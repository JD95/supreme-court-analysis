vi JUSTICE BRENNAN

RESOLUTION
William Joseph Brennan, Jr., graced the Supreme Courtof the United States for thirty-four extraordinary years.

Appointed to the Court on October 15, 1956, by PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower, Justice Brennan's years of Supreme
Court service spanned eight Presidencies, seventeen Con-gresses, and one hundred forty-six volumes of the United
States Reports. Ill-health forced Justice Brennan to retirefrom the Court on July 20, 1990, but not before his unique
qualities of mind and heart had touched the lives of twenty-two Supreme Court colleagues--one-fifth of the Justices to
have served on the Supreme Court; one hundred-twelve lawclerks, each of whom became part of Justice Brennan's extended family; the full complement of the Supreme Court'ssupport personnel--from guards to gardeners--all of whom
Justice Brennan regarded, and treated, as valued friends;and countless members of the Supreme Court bar who recall
with pride and affection their interaction with Justice Bren-nan in the search for justice.

Although death stilled Justice Brennan's heart on July 24,1997, it did not, and could not, still his magnificent voice.
Justice Brennan continues to speak to us through his life andhis work in the prophetic language of the American dream.
Although unanimous agreement with every aspect of a leg-acy as varied and vast as Justice Brennan's is impossible, as
members of the Supreme Court bar, we salute his monumen-tal contribution to the cause of individual liberty.

viiJUSTICE BRENNAN
The sweep and power of Justice Brennan's contribution to
American law challenges our collective imaginations. As
Justice Souter has noted,2 the sheer mass of the Brennan
legal legacy exerts an intense gravitational pull on our jurisprudence. In the course of a remarkable tenure that fell
short of Chief Justice John Marshall's by a matter of months,
Justice Brennan authored 1,573 opinions: 533 opinions for the
Court, 694 dissents, and 346 concurrences.3 Justice Brennan's opinions shaped our Nation. Our ideal of democracy
flows from Justice Brennan's historic opinion for the Court
in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962). The ability of all
Americans to participate equally in the democratic process
was safeguarded and advanced by Justice Brennan's opinions
in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966), and Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986). Our modern conception
of free speech was articulated and defended by Justice Brennan's opinions in New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254
(1964), and Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989), and by his
draftsmanship of the Court's per curiam opinion in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969).4 Our understanding of

ment Odyssey, 139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 5, 1333 (1991); Peter L. Strauss, In
Memoriam, William J. Brennan, Jr., 97 Colum. L. Rev. 1609 (1997).

2 David H. Souter, In Memoriam: William J. Brennan, Jr., eulogy delivered at the funeral mass for Justice Brennan at St. Matthew's Cathedral,
Washington, D. C., on July 29, 1997, reprinted at 111 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1997).

3 Characteristically, Justice Brennan appears to have underestimated

the volume of his judicial output. Justice Brennan's estimate of 1,360
opinions appears to be 213 short when measured against a search conducted by the marvels of modern technology.

4 Justice Brennan's role in drafting the Brandenburg opinion is recounted in Morton J. Horwitz, In Memoriam: William J. Brennan, Jr.,
111 Harv. L. Rev. 23 (1997). The Brandenburg opinion had initially been
assigned to Justice Fortas. Justice Brennan accepted responsibility for
drafting it when Justice Fortas left the bench. See Bernard Schwartz,
Justice Brennan and the Brandenburg Decision--A Lawgiver in Action,
79 Judicature 24, 27-28 (1995).

Throughout his career, Justice Brennan's intense devotion to the Court
as an institution was manifested by his willingness to take on the task of
drafting per curiam opinions in appropriate cases. He drafted well over
sixty per curiam opinions, including the Court's per curiam opinion in

viii JUSTICE BRENNAN
freedom of association was shaped by Justice Brennan's opinions in NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415 (1963); Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976); and Roberts v. United States
Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609 (1984). Our commitment to academic
freedom was defined by Justice Brennan in Keyishian v.
Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967). Our understanding
of the limits placed on government's power to condition benefits on a waiver of First Amendment rights flows from Justice Brennan's opinions in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513
(1958), and FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U. S. 364
(1984). Contemporary protection of the free exercise of religion begins with Justice Brennan's opinion in Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963). Our modern understanding of
the Establishment Clause, initially propounded in his separate opinion in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374

U. S. 203, 230 (1963), was classically restated in Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court in Edwards v. Aguillard, 482
U. S. 578 (1987). Our commitment to equality before the law
was deepened and advanced by Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1
(1958) (opinion signed by all the Justices),5 Green v. County

School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968); Keyes v. School Dist.
No. 1, 413 U. S. 189 (1973); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S.
677 (1973); and Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976). Our
contemporary understanding of procedural fairness was
shaped by Justice Brennan's opinions in Jencks v. United
States, 353 U. S. 657 (1957); Bruton v. United States, 391
U. S. 123 (1968); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970); and

Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254 (1970). Our approach to collective bargaining, and the rights of the individual employee

in that process, was influenced by Justice Brennan's opinions
in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U. S.
735 (1988), and Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union,
398 U. S. 235 (1970). The architecture of our contemporary
federal court structure was shaped by Justice Brennan's
opinions for the Court in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric
Coop, 356 U. S. 525 (1958), and United Mine Workers v.
Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715 (1966), and our modern understanding of
the preeminent role of federal courts as guarantors of individual liberty is based on Justice Brennan's opinions for the
Court in Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Monell v. New
York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658 (1978);
Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), and
Cooper v. Aaron, supra.

When he wrote in dissent, Justice Brennan spoke to the
future. His sustained and passionate efforts to persuade the
Court that capital punishment cannot survive contemporary
moral scrutiny; 6 his concern that non-textual fundamental

personal rights inherent in human dignity be respected; 7 his
defense of the writ of habeas corpus; 8 his efforts to preserve

6 E. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 227 (1976); McCleskey v. Kemp,
481 U. S. 279, 320 (1987). Justice Brennan's belief that the death penalty
violated the Constitution was so intense that, during the last fifteen years
of his tenure, Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, expressed personal opposition to the death penalty in every death case, including denials
of certiorari. Justice Brennan's last public statement, made to his colleagues, friends, family, and admirers at the celebration of his 90th birthday in the Supreme Court chamber, was a plea to continue fighting against
the death penalty.

7 E. g., Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 136 (1989); Cruzan v. Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 301 (1990). Justice Brennan was
more successful in using the Equal Protection Clause to protect "fundamental" non-textual rights. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972)
(invalidating ban on distribution of contraceptives to unmarried couples as
violation of equal protection of the laws); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S.
618 (1969) (invalidating durational residence requirement for welfare eligibility as a discriminatory interference with the right to travel).

8 E. g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 502 (1976); Teague v. Lane, 489

U. S. 288, 326 (1989).

to persuade a majority of the Court to embrace his vision ofthe First Amendment;

10 his endorsement of carefully targeted affirmative action; 11 his scholarly effort to reinterpretthe Eleventh Amendment

12--all stand as reminders of what

seemed unfinished business to Justice Brennan.But it would be shortsighted to purport to measure what

Justice Brennan has meant, and will mean, to American lawmerely by cataloguing his immense substantive contribution.
A fuller assessment of the Brennan legacy calls for a celebra-tion of the happy confluence of intelligence, legal acumen,
political sophistication, and empathy that combined in JusticeBrennan to forge the archetype of a Supreme Court Justice
intensely committed to the protection of constitutionalrights. Justice Brennan's life was the embodiment of the
American dream. His judicial career was a sustained effortto allow others to share in that dream.

dissent in Marsh is of particular interest as a statement of his belief that
the Bill of Rights must be read in the light of contemporary circumstances); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 694 (1984).

10 E. g., Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U. S. 307, 338 (1967); FCC v.

of eight children. Both his parents, William J. Brennan, Sr.,and Agnes McDermott, emigrated from County Roscommon

to the United States because, as Justice Brennan recalled,they "saw a chance for a better life in America."

14 They

met in Newark, New Jersey, at a time when the Irish werenot a welcome presence. Job postings often warned, "No

Irish Need Apply," and some shop doors bore signs reading,"No Dogs or Irish Allowed." The senior Brennan found
work as a coal stoker in the Ballantine Brewery, and quicklybecame active in the nascent labor union movement. The
Justice came of age as his father was organizing workersto fight for better wages and conditions, and rising to local
prominence as a powerful and extraordinarily popular re-form politician, becoming Newark's Director of Public Safety.

"What got me interested in people's rights and liber-ties," Brennan would later recall, "was the kind of neighborhood I was brought up in. I saw all kinds of suffer-ing--people had to struggle. I saw the suffering of my
mother, even though we were never without. We al-ways had something to eat, we always had something
to wear. But others in the neighborhood had a hardertime."

15 Reflecting on his legacy in his last public

statement, Justice Brennan summarized his career bypointing out that "these rulings emerged out of everyday human dramas. . . . At the heart of each drama wasa person who cried out for nothing more than common
human dignity." 16
"Everything I am," Justice Brennan once said, "I am be-cause of my father."

had to be doing something all the time, working at some-thing."

18 It was the elder Brennan's idea that Bill Jr. go

into law. "He was going to make a lawyer out of me, bygolly," the Justice chuckled many years later.

19 Asked once

whether his father would have been surprised by his ap-pointment to the Supreme Court, Brennan earnestly replied,

"No, he would have expected it." 20The Justice graduated from Barringer High School in 1924.
A high school classmate recalled, "Bill took home so manyacademic prizes from school, none were left for the rest of
us." 21 In 1928, Brennan graduated from the University ofPennsylvania's undergraduate Wharton School of Finance
and Commerce, with honors in economics. Just before hegraduated, he married Marjorie Leonard, whom he had met
during his sophomore year at Wharton at the Cotillion ofthe East Orange Women's Club, and to whom he was deeply
devoted for fifty-four years, until her death in 1982. Fore-shadowing the complex man he was to become, Brennan rebelled against parental authority by secretly eloping withMarjorie, but he made certain that they were very properly
married in Baltimore Cathedral.Brennan went off to the Harvard Law School, while Marjorie stayed in Newark working to help pay his tuition. AtHarvard, Bill Brennan was a workaholic. Quiet, unassuming, unknown to classmates who later rose to great prominence in academe, Brennan's academic performance earnedhim acceptance by Harvard's Legal Aid Society, where he

represented the poor in a variety of civil cases, an experiencethat he recalled fondly over the years. It was at the Legal
Aid Society that he experienced firsthand the power of thelaw to affect the lives of the weak.

During Brennan's second year of law school, in 1930, hisfather died suddenly of pneumonia. Brennan contemplated

leaving law school, but Harvard awarded him a scholarshipto allow him to finish his studies. He waited tables at a

fraternity house and performed odd jobs to make ends meet.It was the height of the Great Depression when Brennan
graduated from law school in 1931. His father's suddendeath had left the family in financial straits. It fell to the
Justice to help support his mother, his wife, and six siblings.Brennan contemplated hanging out a shingle as a union lawyer, but his economic responsibilities made that course impossible. Instead, he accepted an offer from Pitney, Har-din & Skinner, the most prestigious law firm in Newark,

where he had clerked for a summer. Brennan was the firstCatholic lawyer hired by the firm. He was assigned to practice labor law, cast in what must have initially seemed theincongruous role of representing management. As he had
in law school, Brennan worked long hours, often into theearly hours of the morning. He distinguished himself as a
talented labor negotiator, and became the firm's first Catholic
partner in 1937.In July, 1942, at the advanced age of 36, Brennan volunteered for the army. Marjorie and his first two children, BillIII and Hugh, moved to the Washington, D. C., area where
Brennan's expertise as a labor troubleshooter was neededby the Army's Ordnance Division. He was commissioned a
major, but within a year was promoted to lieutenant colonel,
and shortly thereafter was appointed chief of the OrdnanceDepartment's Civilian Personnel Division. During 1943-

1944, Brennan was assigned to Los Angeles, where he over-saw the massive influx of women into civilian defense jobs,
organizing a complex support structure of day care, hous-ing, health, and transportation. Despite significant housing
shortages in the Los Angeles area, Col. Brennan refused totake the easy route of commandeering the homes of interned
Japanese-Americans. In 1945, it was Brennan's responsibility to oversee the furlough of soldiers in Europe after the
defeat of Hitler. Despite pressure from industry and from
Congress, Brennan refused to favor workers in certain occupations over others. In one congressional hearing, Brennan

defended his decision, explaining that "to the extent youmake an exception for a single soldier there is somebody eligible for discharge whose discharge is delayed." 22 Brennanleft the Army in 1945 at the rank of full colonel after being
awarded the Legion of Merit.The Justice returned to his old law firm, continuing to
build his labor law practice at a time when labor strife wasmounting. To capitalize on Brennan's growing reputation as
a consummate labor lawyer, the firm added his name to thefirm's masthead, which became, Pitney, Hardin, Ward &
Brennan. Throughout his rapid rise to prominence as aleader of the private bar, Brennan developed a reputation
as impeccably fair and gracious. He once asked a judge topostpone a hearing upon learning that his opponent's father
had died. "We'll have the hearing another day," Brennantold his flabbergasted opponent.

23 Morton Stavis recalled

litigating one of his first cases against Brennan: "I . . . wasguilty of a number of procedural oversights. Not only did

he not take advantage of them, but he went out of his wayto help me correct the record so that the case would be tried
fairly on the merits." 24Brennan carried this fair-mindedness into the public arena.
Though his livelihood depended upon his management-sidelabor work, he spoke out in support of the right to strike and
in favor of legislation to prohibit employer intimidation ofunion members. But he also urged labor to "accep[t] its responsibilities not to invade or trample upon the rights ofother groups" and vigorously condemned racial discrimination by unions.25With his prestige within the bar growing, in 1946, Brennan
championed the cause of court reform, a charge led by Ar-thur T. Vanderbilt, who was at the time a prominent Newark
lawyer and the Dean of New York University School of Law.

xvJUSTICE BRENNAN
Brennan fought hard to develop, and pass into law, a variety
of reforms, including adaptation of federal procedural rules
to the New Jersey courts, the development of an office to
track court statistics, increased accountability of trial judges,
and mandatory pretrial discovery and settlement conferences. The procedural reforms brought startling results, including a cleanup of the massive backlog of cases, an increase
in settlements, and most importantly to Brennan, a system
"assuring that right and justice shall have the most favorable
opportunity of prevailing in cases that are tried." 26

When Vanderbilt was appointed Chief Justice of the New
Jersey Supreme Court, he set his mind to convincing Brennan to accept an appointment as a trial judge. After a year
of cajoling, Brennan relented. In January 1949, Republican
Governor Alfred E. Driscoll appointed Brennan, then 43, to
the trial court. The appointment slashed Brennan's salary
by two-thirds at a time when he was still helping to support
his mother and numerous siblings, as well as Marjorie, his
two sons, and a new infant, Nancy.

The Justice's rise through the New Jersey courts was
meteoric. Shortly after Brennan took the bench, he was
appointed assignment judge for Hudson County. Within a
year and a half, he was elevated to the Appellate Division of
the Superior Court, the state's intermediate court. Two
years later, in March 1952, Governor Driscoll appointed
Brennan to the New Jersey Supreme Court.

It was there that the Justice began to construct his judicial
legacy. He dissented in one criminal case when a defendant
was denied the right to review his written confession before
trial: "To shackle counsel so that they cannot effectively seek
out the truth and afford the accused the representation
which is not his privilege but his absolute right seriously
imperils our bedrock presumption of innocence." 27 He upheld the privilege against self-incrimination as a right that

applied against the state, describing the privilege as "precious to free men as a restraint against high-handed and
arrogant inquisitorial practices." 28

Brennan's ardor in upholding the self-incrimination privilege was no doubt influenced by the activities of Senator Joseph McCarthy. In a 1954 St. Patrick's Day speech in Boston, Brennan attacked McCarthy, warning that " we cannot
and must not doubt our strength to conserve, without sacrifice of any, all of the guarantees of justice and fair play and
simple human dignity which have made our land what it
is." 29 In a later speech, Brennan struck a theme that he
would repeat many times. He warned that if we violate
individual rights out of fear, we come "perilously close to
destroying liberty in liberty's name." 30 In later years,
Brennan was proud that the only Senate vote against
his confirmation was cast by Senator McCarthy.

In one of the extraordinary strokes of fortune that shape
our lives, Brennan attended a 1955 conference on court reform hosted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell. His
lucid presentation so impressed Brownell that he marked
Brennan for future high office. In 1956, upon the resignation of Justice Sherman Minton, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, influenced by Vanderbilt's strong endorsement, and
Brownell's favorable assessment, appointed William J. Brennan, Jr., to the Supreme Court. Brennan himself often
noted that the fact that his appointment would be extremely
popular with Irish-Catholic voters in a Presidential year did
not hurt. At the press conference announcing his recess appointment, Brennan gave a characteristically modest reply
to a reporter's question about how he would fare as a Supreme Court Justice. Brennan predicted he would be like
"the mule that was entered in the Kentucky Derby. I don't

Marjorie and their daughter, Nancy, once more moved to
Washington and settled into a routine that revolved around
family and work. A devoted family man, the Justice would
come home for dinner every night. But then, as Nancy recalled, he would "set up a green card table in the middle of
the living room and spread all these piles of papers within
arm's reach on the rug. He'd work until he was just too
tired." 31 For the next twenty-five years, Brennan's life revolved around his family and his intense dedication to the
Court.

So devoted was Brennan to his family that his legendary
energy level waned only once in his tenure, when Marjorie
lost a sustained battle with cancer in 1982. Brennan himself
had conquered throat cancer, which almost cost him his
voice, but it was Marjorie's death that sent his morale plummeting. The Justice loved Marjorie so deeply that her death
was a terrible blow. His zest for life began to return in 1983
when, after wryly obtaining his daughter Nancy's consent,
he married Mary Fowler, his secretary of twenty-six years.
He had a new spring in his walk, renewed energy. Brennan
and Mary shared a special love--and a lot of history.

Justice Brennan's years of retirement were enriched by
the kindnesses of his colleagues. While his health permitted it, Justice Brennan visited the Court every day. Many
of his colleagues, especially his successor, Justice Souter,
provided continuing personal warmth and friendship. Justice Souter found time to visit with Brennan almost every
day, an event that the retired-Justice often described as the
high-point of his day. Justice Brennan particularly savored
his 90th birthday celebration in the Supreme Court chamber,
the first such celebration since Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,
held a similar birthday celebration in 1931. In his parting
conversations with friends and admirers that day Justice

xviii JUSTICE BRENNAN
Brennan recalled his love for the Court, and his gratitude
for a life well lived. Justice Brennan died peacefully in his
92d year.

The Brennan personal traits that will be most remembered
were the Justice's love of people and his ability to put himself
into their shoes. Virtually everyone who encountered Justice Brennan has a story of his kindness. The bus driver
who rear-ended Brennan's car in Georgetown on a drizzly
day and did not realize that the gentle victim--who assured
him that this kind of thing "happens every time there's a
rain, and it's nobody's fault at all" 32--was a Supreme Court
Justice. The police officer who took Brennan and his son,
Bill III, into custody when he found them in the pre-dawn
hours, hopelessly lost, wandering on the streets, and was
treated to a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs when they
finally convinced him they were who they said they were.
Every law clerk, each of whom can tell countless stories of
how Brennan could reassure with the characteristic grip on
the arm, twinkling eyes, and the word, "Okay, pal"; and how
Brennan always asked about the clerk's spouse or latest romance. Every colleague and friend who, in Justice Souter's words, cherished "the man who made us out to be better than we were, and threw his arms around us in Brennan
bear hugs, and who simply gave his love to us as the friends
he'd chosen us to be." 33 Every Supreme Court employee
who was amazed that Brennan would retain the details of
their last conversation and stop in the halls to ask about this
problem or that joyous event. As author David Halberstam
has put it, "He has been in our lifetime, perhaps more than
anyone else . . . , the common man as uncommon man. . . . He
is a man defined by his own innate decency and kindness. . . .

Justice Brennan's Work: Preserving the American

Dream for Others

Justice Brennan loved this nation. His request that
"America the Beautiful" be played at the ceremony of hisinterment at Arlington National Cemetery reflected the intensity of that love. The Justice understood the wonder of
a democratic society that could lift the son of a penniless
immigrant to the highest Court in the land, and not seem to
notice that anything extraordinary had occurred. Because
he believed that the essence of American democracy is its
commitment to respect the equal, innate dignity of every
human being, Justice Brennan dedicated his judicial career
to building a legal system that reinforces true democracy
by preserving its indispensable building blocks--individuals
living in freedom, mutual toleration and respect.

One key to the power of the Brennan judicial legacy is
the harmony between Justice Brennan's life and his work.
Justice Brennan lived, and judged, as a man who loved
deeply and well. He was blessed with a devoted and closeknit family. He treated every person he met, regardless of
station or class, with heartfelt affection and genuine respect.
Through the years of passionate advocacy, in times of heady
ascendancy and in anguished dissent, there were rarely
harsh words in the Brennan lexicon. He acknowledged his
antagonists as he embraced his adherents, as fellow human
beings worthy of love, toleration and respect.

His capacity for love shaped Justice Brennan's conception
of law, and his vision of judicial role. Drawing upon his religious heritage, Justice Brennan believed that every human
being is endowed with an inalienable dignity that no earthly
power can diminish. He fervently believed in democracy,
but distinguished between a true democracy that respects

xx JUSTICE BRENNAN
the dignity of the individual, and mere majoritarianism thatsubordinates individual dignity to group will. He believed

that the United States Constitution, especially the Bill ofRights and the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, was designed to assure that the American experiment in democracydoes not erode into majoritarian tyranny by ignoring the
kernel of individual dignity at the core of every human being.He believed that judges, especially federal judges, and
above-all Supreme Court Justices, had, and have, a solemn
and unavoidable duty to interpret the majestic generalitiesof the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the light of contemporary circumstances. Finally, he believed that no realconflict exists between vigorous judicial protection of individual rights, and the American conception of democracy en-visioned by the Founders, a democracy premised on individual dignity and mutual toleration. Indeed, in the absence ofvigorous judicial protection of human rights, Justice Brennan
feared that the true democracy envisioned by the Founders
could not flourish.A second key to the power of Justice Brennan's legal heritage was his mastery of the lawyer's art. He was a brilliantlegal craftsman. The classic Brennan opinion speaks to us,
not in the abstract language of moral philosophy or with thearrogance of government command, but in the logical and
institutional cadences of a master lawyer seeking to find the
angle of repose between two seemingly irreconcilable posi-tions. Justice Brennan's great individual rights opinions are

not assertions of absolute truth; rather, they are institutionalblueprints for assuring that only the weightiest assertions of
group need can ever restrict the enjoyment of fundamentalindividual rights. A mark of Justice Brennan's legal genius,
and a source of his enduring influence, was his repeated abil-ity to enunciate complex doctrinal formulations designed to
establish an institutional balance weighted heavily in favor
of individual freedom; a balance that preserves fundamental
individual rights in most settings, without making it impossible for the majority to impose narrow restraints when absolutely necessary. The "thickness" of Justice Brennan's char523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xxiJUSTICE BRENNAN
acteristic constitutional analysis was designed to reflect thecomplexity of the tension between individual right and group

need; to erect a sophisticated legal matrix for resolving thattension; and to explain why, in doubtful cases, the resolution
should favor the right of the individual over the wishes ofthe group.

Yet another mark of Justice Brennan's mastery of the law-yer's craft was his ability to grasp the interrelationships
within an entire body of law. There was no such thing as
an ad hoc Brennan decision. He was able to conceive eachopinion as part of an institutional whole. Justice Brennan's

intense effort to understand the purpose of the statute orconstitutional provision before him allowed him to view each
case as an opportunity to advance the organic enterprise ofwhich it was a part. The resulting jurisprudence is a work
of remarkable coherence.A third key to the power of Justice Brennan's voice was
its candid acceptance of responsibility. He embraced the
obligation of reading the Constitution in the context of ourtimes. Justice Brennan acknowledged that hard choices existed in deciding the difficult cases before him, but he refusedto obfuscate those choices by resort to legal fictions, or to
deflect personal criticism by ascribing his decisions to others.He rejected what, to him, was the false comfort of delegating
the Constitution's meaning to persons living in other times.
He accepted responsibility for interpreting the Constitutionin the context of the world in which he lived, and of giving

the document's ambiguous words a meaning consistent withevolving notions of human dignity. But his great individual
rights opinions were not exercises in subjectivism. Theywere disciplined efforts to read the Constitution purposively
in an effort to advance the document's underlying values ina way that Justice Brennan believed was most faithful to
the covenant between the Justices of today and the founding
generation. Time and again, Justice Brennan plumbed the
manifest purpose underlying a provision of the Bill of Rights,
considered how best to advance that purpose in the context
of the modern world, and forged brilliant constitutional doc523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

Justice Brennan and the First Amendment
When Justice Brennan joined the Court in 1956, the excesses of the McCarthy era were threatening to overwhelm
the parchment barriers of the First and Fifth Amendments.
Over the next thirty-four years, the Court, led by Justice
Brennan, presided over a revolution in First Amendment
doctrine, providing effective constitutional protection for the
freest market in ideas the world has ever seen.

Justice Brennan's characteristic approach to First Amendment issues was to ask why the Founders wanted a Free
Speech Clause in the Constitution in the first place. His answer was twofold. First, Justice Brennan believed that free
speech was indispensable to democratic governance. He understood that democratic self-government is imperilled in
the absence of robust and uninhibited discussion of issues

35 Justice Brennan left a rich non-judicial record of his judicial philosophy. A representative sampling includes William J. Brennan, Jr., The Bill

xxiiiJUSTICE BRENNAN
of public concern. Second, Justice Brennan recognized that
self-expression is an integral element of human dignity. Respect for the equal dignity of each human being, Justice
Brennan believed requires toleration of individual selfexpression, even when the expression is deeply unpopular.

Armed with a purposive account of the Free Speech
Clause, Justice Brennan proceeded to construct a sophisticated institutional structure dedicated to the preservation
and advancement of its underlying values. He began haltingly in Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476 (1957). Rejecting arguments claiming either that sexually explicit speech
had virtually no protection, or that it was absolutely protected, Justice Brennan attempted to broker an institutional
compromise in Roth by positing a small category of unprotected speech--obscenity--that fails to advance any of the
underlying purposes of the First Amendment, while providing full First Amendment protection to sexually explicit material like Ulysses and Fanny Hill. Justice Brennan, the
great lawyer, ultimately rejected the attempt of Justice
Brennan, the great statesman, to forge an institutional compromise because it proved impossible to define unprotected
obscenity with sufficient precision.36 But the analytic approach pioneered in Roth, an approach that rejects absolutes,
that seeks to accommodate seemingly irreconcilable positions
by building complex institutional structures designed to protect speech that advances underlying First Amendment values, while permitting narrow regulation when absolutely
necessary, became the signature Brennan approach to the
First Amendment.

The Brennan approach bore more enduring fruit in New
York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), which tailored
libel law to the underlying values of the First Amendment.
Faced with an effort to use state libel laws to muzzle robust

36 Justice Brennan signaled the abandonment of his effort to define unprotected obscenity in his dissent in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slayton, 413
U. S. 49, 73 (1973). He never was able to persuade a majority of his colleagues to join him in declaring an end to the experiment.

xxiv JUSTICE BRENNAN
press coverage of the civil rights movement, Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, once again rejected arguments at
the extremes claiming either that all libel laws violated the
First Amendment, or that libel was a categorical exception
to the First Amendment. Instead, the Justice elaborated a
complex doctrinal model designed to insulate speech about
public figures (and, he believed, public issues) 37 from liability
in the absence of "actual malice," while permitting traditional libel law to govern private speech that did not implicate democratic governance. The power of the New York
Times opinion is twofold. First, Justice Brennan's rejection
of absolutist approaches led to the elaboration of a complex
institutional structure that seeks to accommodate the competing positions, while providing effective First Amendment
protection to speech relevant to democratic governance.
Second, and more generally, Justice Brennan's lucid explanation of the deep purpose of the free speech guaranty persuaded a generation, providing the intellectual underpinnings for First Amendment analysis in the years to come.
No opinion has been more influential in shaping the reality
of our contemporary free speech world, nor more sophisticated in bringing the lawyer's art to bear on a First Amendment problem.

Justice Brennan's mastery of the interplay between First
Amendment values and the institutional structures needed
to protect them is at the core of Brandenburg v. Ohio,
395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). Brandenburg reflects a
classic Brennan effort to develop legal doctrine strongly
weighted in favor of individual freedom, but sufficiently flexible to permit regulation when absolutely necessary. Government restriction of speech is possible, wrote Justice Brennan for the Court in Brandenburg, but only if the censor
meets an extremely stringent burden of justification. Bran37 See Curtis Publishing Company v. Butts, 388 U. S. 130, 172 (1967);
Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U. S. 29 (1971); and Time, Inc. v.
Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967), for Justice Brennan's views on speech about
"public" or "newsworthy" issues.

xxvJUSTICE BRENNAN
denburg made clear that casual justifications for censorshiprooted in the old "bad tendency" test cannot survive First

Amendment scrutiny. While Roth and New York Timesprovide institutional solutions for specific areas of speech,
Brandenburg offers a general theory applicable across thespectrum of free speech analysis that protects speech unless
the government can prove an overwhelming need for regula-tion. When in doubt,

Brandenburg directs that we err on
the side of free speech.

Justice Brennan's approach to free speech culminated inhis historic opinions for the Court in

Texas v. Johnson, 491
U. S. 397 (1989), and United States v. Eichman, 496 U. S. 310(1990), upholding the right to burn the American flag as an

act of protest. Expressive flag burning must be presump-tively protected, reasoned Justice Brennan, both because it
communicates ideas relevant to democratic self-governance,and because it is an act of individual self-expression. If, Justice Brennan continued, the majority wishes to suppress such
communicative activity, it must demonstrate an overwhelm-ing social need. Mere disagreement with the message, or

anger at the boorishness or offensiveness of the messenger,can never suffice.

Justice Brennan's flag burning opinions do more than closea doctrinal cycle that began a half-century earlier in

Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931). The identities of
the five Justices who formed the majority in the Johnsonand

Eichman cases--Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Scalia, and Kennedy--demonstrate that expansivefree speech protection is neither a "liberal" idea, nor "conservative" idea. It is an American idea that is Justice Bren-nan's most enduring gift to the Nation.

Justice Brennan was not content with re-defining the sub-stantive elements of free speech protection. As a superb
lawyer, he understood that the real world value of free
speech protection, however defined, largely depends on the
procedural matrix within which the substantive norms are
embedded. Like a general deploying troops for battle, Justice Brennan's opinions defend the core of free speech by

xxvi JUSTICE BRENNAN
building a series of procedural ramparts designed to protectthe citadel. He eliminated the threat of criminal libel in

Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64 (1964). He pioneeredthe First Amendment overbreadth doctrine in

Dombrowski
v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965), and Gooding v. Wilson, 405U. S. 518 (1972). He explained the special First Amendment

dangers of standardless discretion in City of Houston v. Hill,482 U. S. 451 (1987), and

City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer
Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750 (1988). He warned about the
real world consequences of "chilling effect" in Bantam Booksv.

Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58 (1963). He insisted on speedy judicial review procedures in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S.51 (1965). He required First Amendment due process in

Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U. S. 717 (1961), and A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, 378 U. S. 205 (1964). And, he inveighed against the danger of prior restraints in his separateopinion in

New York Times v. United States, 403 U. S. 713,
724 (1971) (the Pentagon Papers case).

Nor was Justice Brennan content to protect speech with-out providing judicial support for the relationships and institutions central to a vibrant First Amendment community.As with his opinions protecting speech itself, Justice Brennan resisted the lure of absolutist positions, leaving open thepossibility of regulating First Amendment institutions under
a rigorous showing of extremely serious social need. Building on Justice Harlan's path-breaking decision in NAACP v.
Alabama, 357 U. S. 449 (1958), Justice Brennan charted the
modern contours of freedom of association. In NAACP v.
Button, 371 U. S. 415 (1963), writing for the Court, he held
that lawyers and clients have a First Amendment right toassociate freely in order to pursue litigation to advance a

client's interests. In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976),and

Rutan v. Republican Party, 497 U. S. 62 (1990), Justice
Brennan wrote for the Court holding that government may
not penalize employees for associating with the wrong political party by allocating non-policymaking jobs on the basis of
political affiliation. But, in Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609 (1984), he wrote a classic Brennan individ523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xxviiJUSTICE BRENNAN
ual rights opinion that asked why we care about freedom toassociate in the first place. In

Roberts, Justice Brennan held
that, properly understood, freedom of association was de-signed to protect close-knit individual or political relationships, and did not shield impersonal economic organizationslike the Jaycees from laws banning gender discrimination.

Justice Brennan viewed the press as critical participantsin a system of free expression, but he was reluctant to accord
the press preferred legal status. For example, in his dissent
in Dun & Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U. S. 749,774 (1985), Justice Brennan rejected the notion that media

defendants are entitled to more favorable treatment thannon-media defendants in libel cases. Rather than accord the
press a preferred legal status, Justice Brennan argued thatboth the press and the public enjoy a broad First Amendment right of access to important public institutions in orderto assure an informed public. In his concurrences in

Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U. S. 555, 584 (1980),
and Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 572 (1976),Justice Brennan argued that the "structural" role of the

First Amendment justified a broad right of access to criminaltrials for both the press and public. Similarly, in

Globe
Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U. S. 596 (1982), Jus-tice Brennan wrote for the Court in invalidating a law mandating the closure of criminal trials involving sex offenses
against minors. Characteristically, however Justice Bren-nan declined to endorse an absolute right of access, holding

open the possibility that, in an appropriate case, "counter-vailing" interests might be sufficiently compelling to reverse
the presumption of openness created by the First Amend-ment. In the Justice's final opinion for the Court,

Metro
Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), he recog-nized the importance to a vibrant First Amendment of enhancing diversity in ownership and control of the electronic
press.

Justice Brennan understood that freedom of academic inquiry is central to the underlying values of the First Amendment. In Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589

523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT
xxviii JUSTICE BRENNAN
(1967), his opinion for the Court provided the modern ration-ale for intense First Amendment protection of academic freedom, establishing the constitutional precedent that shieldshigher education from undue government interference.

Justice Brennan recognized that government interferencewith free speech could take the form of the carrot as well as
the stick. Writing for the Court in Speiser v. Randall, 357U. S. 513 (1958), he pioneered the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine, holding that California could not condition the
grant of a property tax exemption on the execution of a loy-alty oath. In

FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U. S. 364
(1984), he applied the unconstitutional conditions doctrine toinvalidate efforts to condition government aid to public television stations on a waiver of the stations' First Amendmentrights to produce privately financed editorials.

Justice Brennan also recognized that a vibrant system offree speech must protect listeners as well as speakers. In
his path-breaking concurrence in Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301, 307 (1965), the first case to declare an actof Congress unconstitutional under the First Amendment,

Justice Brennan explicitly recognized that listeners have aseparately cognizable First Amendment right to receive information, even from foreign speakers who enjoy no FirstAmendment rights of their own. Similarly, in

Blount v.
Rizzi, 400 U. S. 410 (1971), Justice Brennan, relying on the
hearer's independent First Amendment rights, invalidated
an excessively broad restriction on receiving information
through the mails.

Finally, Justice Brennan understood that a robust system
of free expression depends on the ability to assemble funds
needed for effective speech. In Riley v. National Federation for the Blind, 487 U. S. 781 (1988), Justice Brennan
wrote for the Court invalidating an excessively broad regulation of charitable solicitation of funds. In a portion of the
Court's per curiam in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976),
authored by Justice Brennan, he insisted that restrictions on
campaign financing be analyzed as if they were restrictions

xxixJUSTICE BRENNAN
on speech itself. In FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for
Life, 479 U. S. 238 (1986), Justice Brennan wrote for the
Court in striking down an effort to limit the campaign spending of a small, antiabortion advocacy group. But, in his concurring opinion in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 669 (1990), the Justice supported the
constitutionality of a state ban on election spending by
profit-making corporations, arguing that a ban on election
spending from the corporate treasury was justified to prevent organizations amassing great wealth in the economic
marketplace from gaining an unfair advantage in the political marketplace.

Justice Brennan treated religious freedom as an integral
aspect of his First Amendment vision. In Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), he laid the foundation for modern protection of the free exercise of religion by requiring government to establish a compelling interest before
interfering with religious conscience. Justice Brennan also
sought to maintain the "wall" between church and state. In
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 (1987), Justice Brennan
wrote for the Court in holding that efforts to mandate the
teaching of "Creation Science" in the Louisiana public
schools violate the Establishment Clause. His concurring
opinion in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U. S.
203, 230 (1963), and his dissents in Marsh v. Chambers, 463
U. S. 783, 795 (1983), and Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668,
694 (1984), argue for strict separation of church and state in
order to preserve a vibrant private religious life free from
state interference.

Justice Brennan's contribution to contemporary First
Amendment law is unparalleled.38 He re-defined its substantive contours, built its procedural ramparts, preserved

argued, brilliantly crafted doctrinal formulations linked directly to the underlying values of the First Amendment.
When one compares the anemic First Amendment law that
Justice Brennan faced in 1956, with the fully-developed system of free expression that Justice Brennan's opinions bequeath to the nation, it becomes clear how lucky James Madison was to have had William Brennan as his lawyer.

Justice Brennan and Equality
At the heart of Justice Brennan's jurisprudence is a profound commitment to the law's obligation to treat each person equally. Although that commitment to equality suffuses
Justice Brennan's entire judicial career, it finds particular
voice in four sets of Brennan opinions: opinions that seek
to achieve and defend equal participation in democracy;
opinions seeking to enforce racial equality before the law,
especially in an educational context; opinions defining and
implementing gender equality; and opinions defending affirmative action.

Justice Brennan believed that democracy requires that
each citizen be accorded equal political status. He understood that rational variants of majority rule exist that treat
citizens unequally, but he rejected the notion that the American experiment in democracy would adopt such an unequal
structure. Accordingly, after years of malapportionment
had resulted in a political system where the votes of some
counted far more than the votes of others, Justice Brennan
viewed the resulting unequal distribution of political status
as an affront to democracy. His intense belief in political
equality as the organizing principle for a true democracy is
the heart of his historic opinion in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S.
186 (1962), paving the way to the "one-person one-vote" doctrine. Chief Justice Earl Warren believed that Baker v.
Carr was the most influential decision handed down during

his tenure because it re-shaped the contours of Americandemocracy.

Justice Brennan was not content merely to define an ab-stract norm of political equality. He understood the need

for institutional reinforcements that would make the equalparticipation principle a reality for millions of Americans
who had been excluded by generations of discrimination fromfull participation in the democratic process. Unlike the
First Amendment area, where Justice Brennan helped forgethe supporting institutional structures from the provisions
of the Constitution itself, Congress provided crucial institu-tional mechanisms for assuring equal participation in the
democratic process by enacting the Voting Rights Acts of
1965 and 1982. In Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641(1966), Justice Brennan's opinion upheld the constitutionality

of portions of the 1965 Act that prohibited literacy tests as
a bar to voting, recognizing the imperative of overcomingyears of sophisticated resistance to the enfranchisement of

racial minorities. The voting rights partnership betweenCongress and the Court was a brilliant success, leading, for
the first time since Reconstruction, to the widespread po-litical participation of African-Americans in the states of

the old Confederacy, and to a resurgence of political partici-pation by minority groups throughout the United States. In
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), Justice Brennan's
opinion for the Court established the ground rules for judi-cial consideration of a claim for vote dilution added in the

1982 Act, beginning the difficult process, still unfinished, ofassuring that minority groups enjoy an equal opportunity to
elect candidates of their choice.Justice Brennan believed deeply in racial equality. He
fought vigorously to defend the majestic principle of equal39 Earl Warren, Mr. Justice Brennan, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 2 (1966). The

ity before the law underlying Brown v. Board of Education,347 U. S. 483 (1954). Justice Brennan viewed

Brown, not
merely as a narrow case involving school segregation, but asthe enunciation of a broad principle assuring judicial protection to members of minority groups that had been the targetof sustained prejudice. Although he joined the Court two
years after Brown, he (along with Justices Harlan and Whit-taker, who also joined the Court after the

Brown decision)
embraced the Brown opinion explicitly in Cooper v. Aaron,
358 U. S. 1 (1958) (signed by all of the Justices). In Green v.
County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), Justice Brennan,
writing for the Court, finally provided the institutional
mechanism for enforcing Brown, directing the immediate
cessation of legally-imposed public school segregation "root
and branch." The firmness of Justice Brennan's opinion in
Green is widely credited with the widespread elimination of
de jure school segregation in the ensuing year. In Keyes v.
School District No. 1, 413 U. S. 189 (1973), Justice Brennan
demonstrated that the principle of Brown was applicable
to Northern schools, as well, if patterns of government decisionmaking had abetted racial segregation. While Justice
Brennan was unable to persuade a majority of his colleagues
that systematic inequality in financing public education violated the Federal Constitution,40 his talent as a lawyer enabled him to assemble a majority opinion in Plyler v. Doe,
457 U. S. 202 (1982), assuring the children of undocumented
aliens the right to attend public school.

During his wartime service, then-Col. Brennan had organized and observed the extraordinary contribution of women
to the nation's civilian defense production effort. Forty
years later, he helped chart the Constitutional guaranty of
gender equality. Building on Chief Justice Burger's decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), Justice Brennan,
aided in no small part, as he often observed, by the thenDirector of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, provided a coherent theoretical basis for the

40 San Antonio v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 62 (1973).

Court's ban on laws discriminating on the basis of gender.41
In his plurality opinion in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S.
677 (1973), Justice Brennan argued that laws discriminating
on the basis of gender should be subjected to the same strict
scrutiny standard governing challenges to racial discrimination. In Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976), and Califano v.
Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199 (1977), Justice Brennan persuasively
demonstrated why laws based on gender stereotyping were
unconstitutional, and enunciated an intermediate standard of
scrutiny to assist the lower courts in rooting out unfair gender discrimination. Although he did not assemble a majority for his "strict scrutiny" position in Frontiero, Justice
Brennan's powerful defense of women's rights provided the
intellectual blueprint for the systematic eradication of laws
discriminating on the basis of gender, a process that culminated, fittingly, in Justice Ginsburg's repeated citation of
Justice Brennan in her opinion for the Court in United States
v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996), invalidating the male-only
admissions policy at Virginia Military Institute. Justice
Brennan extended the battle against gender stereotyping to
the private sphere in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S.
228 (1989), which held that gender stereotyping also violated
Title VII. In School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480
U. S. 273 (1987), Justice Brennan's majority opinion extended
his efforts to combat stereotyping to persons with contagious diseases, holding that a person with a history of infection with a contagious disease was entitled to protection
against irrational discrimination under the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973.

Justice Brennan's equality jurisprudence was rooted in the
real world. He knew that despite heroic efforts by the
Court to eradicate hundreds of years of racial and gender
discrimination, the effects of generations of widespread discrimination could not be wiped out overnight. Accordingly,
Justice Brennan supported narrowly tailored efforts at af41 Justice Ginsburg's affectionate appreciation of Justice Brennan's

firmative action designed either to redress past wrongs, orto assure the proper functioning of important contemporary

institutions. In Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424U. S. 747 (1976), his opinion for the Court upheld the use of
broad equitable remedies to undo the consequences of pastdiscrimination. In his partial dissent and partial concurrence in California Board of Regents v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265,324 (1978), Justice Brennan noted that educational quality is
enhanced by diversity. Accordingly, he argued that voluntary affirmative action plans by public universities designedto achieve educational diversity are constitutional. In his

opinion for the Court in United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443U. S. 193 (1978), Justice Brennan argued that Title VII's ban
on racial discrimination in employment did not preclude nar-rowly tailored voluntary affirmative action programs by private employers designed to redress the effects of identifiablepast discrimination. In

Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers International Assoc. v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421 (1986), and Local
93, International Association of Firefighters v. Cleveland,478 U. S. 501 (1986), Justice Brennan, who had inveighed

against racial discrimination by labor unions in the 1940's,authored opinions upholding rigorous affirmative action remedies designed to redress the effects of past racial discrimi-nation. In

United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149 (1987),
Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court upheld rigid hiring
quotas designed to redress years of blatant racial discrimina-tion in hiring and promotion. In

Johnson v. Transportation
Agency, 480 U. S. 616 (1987), Justice Brennan's opinion forthe Court upheld the use of voluntary affirmative action

techniques by a government agency to redress the effects ofclearly established past discrimination against women. In
his last opinion for the Court, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC,497 U. S. 547 (1990), Justice Brennan defended the constitutionality of FCC regulations designed to favor women and
minority entrepreneurs seeking broadcast licenses.

Justice Brennan understood the complex moral and legal
calculus that makes affirmative action such a difficult issue.
Not surprisingly, Justice Brennan's affirmative action juris523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xxxvJUSTICE BRENNAN
prudence remains controversial. But, whatever the short-term fate of Justice Brennan's efforts to defend affirmative

action, his affirmative action opinions reflect his consistentconcern that abstract constitutional principles like equality
and free speech must be translated into the real world ifour Constitution is to play its proper role in the American
legal system.

Justice Brennan and Procedural Fairness
Justice Brennan's twin concerns with individual dignityand institutional structure led him to pay extremely close

attention to procedural matters, especially in settings wherethe individual is ranged against the power of the state. He
believed that strict adherence to procedural fairness is aprecondition to the effective protection of individual rights.
One of his early opinions for the Court, Jencks v. United
States, 353 U. S. 657 (1957), made the criminal process fairerby requiring prosecutors to provide an accused with prior

statements by witnesses. In Bruton v. United States, 391U. S. 123 (1968), he authored an opinion ruling that the Confrontation Clause precludes the use of the confession of aco-defendant in settings where cross-examination is unavailable, and, in his dissents in California v. Green, 399 U. S.149, 189 (1970), and

Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 77 (1980),
the Justice argued that the Confrontation Clause broadly
precludes the use in a criminal proceeding of testimony notsubject to cross examination. In

In re Winship, 397 U. S.
358 (1970), Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court held thatproof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case is

a fundamental tenet of due process of law. Justice Brennanunderstood that the reasonable doubt standard is needed to
prevent individual defendants from being overwhelmed bythe power of the state.

Justice Brennan believed that the guaranty of procedural
due process of law advances two basic values: accuracy andindividual dignity. Providing a hearing to an individual before significant adverse government action, believed JusticeBrennan, not only minimizes the chance of error, it recog523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT
xxxvi JUSTICE BRENNAN
nizes the innate dignity of the individual by requiring thestate to humanize the bureaucratic process. Justice Brennan's respect for individual dignity underlies his most impor-tant procedural decision, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254
(1970), finding significant due process requirements applica-ble prior to the suspension of statutory welfare benefits.
Goldberg v. Kelly is a classic example of Justice Brennan'sability to knit understanding of statutory purpose, respect
for constitutional principle, and empathy for the individualinto a compelling opinion. He recognized, as did the parties,
that a statutorily enacted welfare benefit constitutes consti-tutional property in some sense. The Justice's real concern
was over the timing and nature of the hearing required inconnection with its suspension. Evoking the program's purpose, and the shattering consequences for individuals on wel-fare of even a temporary suspension, Justice Brennan's opinion in Goldberg v. Kelly, requiring an extended due processinquiry before suspension of benefits, expanded the due process revolution into the civil arena, permitting millions of indi-viduals, ranging from welfare recipients to applicants for a
driver's license, to confront the bureaucratic state on moreequal terms.

Justice Brennan and the Federal Courts
Justice Brennan's opinions helped shape the modern federal court system. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383U. S. 715 (1966), his opinion for the Court developed the modern view of pendent jurisdiction, enabling federal courts toact as efficient fora for the resolution of actions involving
state and federal claims. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric
Coop., 356 U. S. 525 (1958), ruled that trial by jury must be
available in virtually all damage actions in the federal courts.In

Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462 (1985), and
in his dissent in World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation v.
Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 299 (1980), and his concurrence in
Burnham v. Superior Court of California, 495 U. S. 604, 628
(1990), Justice Brennan championed a broad, functional vi-sion of federal

in personam jurisdiction. And, in Colorado

523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xxxviiJUSTICE BRENNAN
River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424U. S. 800 (1976), Justice Brennan's majority opinion clarified

the duty of a federal court to resolve controversies withinits subject matter jurisdiction. But it was in establishing
federal courts as an instrument to enforce individual rightsthat Justice Brennan left his most enduring mark on the Article III courts. Justice Brennan believed that the institu-tional attributes of the federal courts--especially lifetime
tenure--rendered federal judges the natural defenders of
constitutional rights against majoritarian overreaching. Ina series of opinions, Justice Brennan honed the federal courts

as effective fora for the enforcement of federal rights. In
Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S.
658 (1978), the Court, extending Justice Douglas' opinion in
Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), construed the Civil
Rights Act of 1871 to permit damage actions in federal courtto redress the deprivation of federal constitutional rights by

both local officials and government entities. In Fay v. Noia,
372 U. S. 391 (1963), Justice Brennan established a similarfederal court enforcement presence in the context of writs

of habeas corpus. Justice Brennan's expansive conceptionof the Great Writ permitted the district courts to function
effectively for three decades as decentralized arms of theSupreme Court, enforcing the Court's criminal procedure
precedents against occasionally recalcitrant state courts.

It was in the Court's historic opinion in Cooper v. Aaron,358 U. S. 1 (1958), that Justice Brennan's vision of the federal

courts emerges most clearly. In the years immediately fol-lowing

Brown v. Board of Education, state and local officials
swore "massive resistance" to public school integration.When mobs threatened to prevent the integration of Little

Rock High School, the Supreme Court responded with a un-precedented opinion, largely drafted by Justice Brennan, and
signed individually by each of the nine Justices, re-affirming
the Court's adherence to Brown, and reasserting the primacy of the Supreme Court in interpreting the Constitution.

Constitution and protector of the rights of the weak remainsamong the most eloquent and expansive defenses of the judicial function in our legal heritage.In recalling Justice Brennan's view of the role of federal
courts, we should not overlook the heritage of his years onthe New Jersey courts, and his strong belief in the importance of state courts as protectors of individual liberties.Justice Brennan believed that every American judge has a
duty to protect human rights. Just as in Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), where his opinion forthe Court held that federal officials could be held liable, on

common law principles, for damages resulting from viola-tions of the Bill of Rights, so he strongly urged state judges
to develop independent mechanisms for protecting rightsguaranteed under state constitutions. His two forceful addresses on the subject 42 were among his best-known and in-fluential extra-judicial statements. As the only Justice with

state court experience for many of his years on the Court,Justice Brennan never forgot the crucial role of state courts
in the federal system.

Justice Brennan and Labor Law
Justice Brennan, the consummate labor lawyer, played a
significant role in the evolution of American labor law. His
numerous opinions construing the National Labor RelationsAct and related statutes reflect both Justice Brennan's intense commitment to the individual, and his sophisticated un-derstanding of the collective-bargaining process.

43 As with

his constitutional opinions, Justice Brennan sought to cap-ture the "spirit" of the National Labor Relations Act, and to

develop a coherent body of case law reinforcing its underly42 See William J. Brennan, Jr., State Constitutions and the Protection of

ing goals. In his opinions for the Court in InternationalAssociation of Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740 (1961), and

Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735(1988), Justice Brennan reinforced the individual by holding
that objecting employees were entitled to pro-rata refundsof portions of their agency shop fees used for political causes
they opposed, or for other purposes unconnected with collec-tive bargaining. In

NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S.251 (1975), Justice Brennan's opinion reinforced the individual by holding that an employee is entitled to the presenceof a union representative at a disciplinary investigation conducted by the employer. And, in NLRB v. City DisposalSystems, Inc., 465 U. S. 822 (1984), the Court reinforced the
individual by holding that the activities of a single employeein asserting a right rooted in a collective-bargaining agreement were protected as a form of "concerted activity".Justice Brennan believed that lasting labor peace could not
be obtained by government-imposed solutions. Whetherthe issue was the right of members of a multi-employer bargaining unit to respond to a selective strike with a lock-out,44the right of union members to engage in slow-downs,

45 or the

right of an employer to hire replacement workers,46 JusticeBrennan sought to allow the parties to reach a freely bargained economic solution that reflects their relative economic
power by assuring that each is free to use its economic weap-ons without government interference. Where, however, an

employer sought to by-pass the bargaining process by impos-ing unilateral conditions,

47 or a union sought to ignore nostrike obligations accepted as part of the bargaining proc-ess,

the bargaining process. Justice Brennan believed that thecollective-bargaining process would work best if it were

championed broad preemption of state efforts to regulate

economic forces,49 and sought to minimize federal judicial intervention which would delay the commencement of the bargaining process.50

Justice Brennan: Archetype
Justice Brennan's contribution to American legal thought
transcends even his monumental substantive achievements.
It is true that he shaped the First Amendment; sketched
the contours of the "one-person one-vote" rule; deepened and
defended our commitment to equality; enriched our ideas of
procedural fairness; taught us about the special role of the
federal courts; and profoundly influenced labor law. It is
equally true that his mastery of the lawyers' craft repeatedly
enabled him to place his substantive insights in complex
doctrinal settings designed to persuade and to deflect error

in favor of freedom. But Justice Brennan's contribution is
deeper than substantive outcomes or doctrinal innovations.
He joins Chief Justice John Marshall and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as archetypes of a conception of judging in
a constitutional democracy.

Chief Justice Marshall pioneered the use of judicial review.
His insight that judges, interpreting the text of a written
Constitution, could effectively defend against unconstitutional action by the majority establishes Chief Justice Marshall as the founding archetype of the modern constitutional
judge. Long after his substantive rulings have succumbed
to the inevitable erosion of time and change, we will continue
to draw inspiration from Chief Justice Marshall's grasp of
institutional possibility.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., helped to chart the
complex relationship between judicial review and respect for

the will of the majority. His lifetime of effort to develop a
line between deference to the majority and respect for fundamental individual rights clarified the modern role of judicial
review in a vibrant democracy. Long after Justice Holmes'
substantive rulings have been amended by time, we will look
to him as the archetype of an even-handed constitutional
judge in a functioning democracy.

Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., adds a third judicial archetype to our constitutional heritage. Justice Brennan's lifetime of passionate effort to deploy a modern, purposive reading of the Bill of Rights in defense of the innate dignity of
the individual, not as an alienated island, but as a participant
in a democracy of equals, has immensely enriched our conception of judging. If Justice Holmes reminds us of our duty
to democracy, Justice Brennan reminds us that true democracy requires us to fulfil our duty to the individual. Healthy
debate will continue over the precise role of a constitutional
judge in a vibrant democracy. But time and healthy debate
can only enhance Justice Brennan's status as the archetype
of a Justice passionately devoted to the enforcement of individual constitutional rights. He taught us that constitutional law, brilliantly conceived and courageously enforced,
can lift the human spirit.

Wherefore, it is accordingly
RESOLVED, that we, as representative members of the
Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, express our
deep sadness at the death of Justice Brennan, our condolences to the Brennan family, and our profound admiration
for Justice Brennan's matchless contributions to the cause of
human dignity; and it is further

xlii JUSTICE BRENNAN

The Chief Justice said:
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. I recognize the Attor-ney General of the United States.

Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory ofWilliam J. Brennan, Jr., Associate Justice of the Supreme

Court from 1956 to 1990. While recognizing Justice Bren-nan's extraordinary contributions to this Court and impact
on the legal world in a wide variety of areas, I will limitthese remarks to just a few examples of Justice Brennan's
contributions to constitutional jurisprudence.Justice Brennan served on this Court for 34 years. His
role was central in the Court's expansion during that era ofthe substance of the Constitution's protection of individual
rights, as well as in the Court's strengthening of the reme-dies available for the enforcement of those rights.

Justice Brennan's contributions to the development of thelaw are perhaps most striking in the Court's free speech
cases. In his opinion for the Court in Speiser v. Randall,for example, Justice Brennan introduced the concept of the
chilling effect. Explaining that the man who knows that hemust bring forth proof and persuade another of the lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must steer far wider of theunlawful zone than if the State must bear these burdens.

Six years later came New York Times v. Sullivan, one ofthe leading free speech cases of this century. Justice Brennan articulated the fundamental principle of the opinion, andone of the foundations of this Court's First Amendment
jurisprudence.In oft-quoted language, he stated that the Court considers
this case against the background of a profound national com-mitment to the principle that debate on public issues should

523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xliiiJUSTICE BRENNAN
be uninhibited, robust, and wide open, and that it may well
include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp
attacks on Government and public officials.

New York Times v. Sullivan is a characteristic example of
Justice Brennan's recognition that the provisions of the Bill
of Rights and the Civil War amendments embody core values
and principles that remain valid even where their vindication
requires significant alteration in hitherto accepted principles
of State law.

In NAACP v. Button, the Court held that the State of
Virginia could not prohibit NAACP lawyers from giving
legal advice to citizens of Virginia. Modern conceptions of
vagueness and over-breadth trace their roots to Justice
Brennan's opinion for the Court in this case, which once
again relied on the chilling effect rationale he had first elaborated in Speiser.

In the two flag-burning cases that came before the Court
in Justice Brennan's last two Terms, Texas v. Johnson, and
United States v. Eichman, Justice Brennan spoke for the
Court in holding the statutes unconstitutional. As Justice
Brennan explained in Johnson: Our decision is a reaffirmation
of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness that the flag
best reflects, and of the conviction that our toleration of criticisms such as Johnson's is a sign and a source of our strength.

Justice Brennan was a leading exponent of the need to
maintain separation of church and State under the Establishment Clause, as articulated in his influential concurring
opinion in Abington School District v. Schempp.

As he explained in that opinion, it is not only the nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it is the
devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed which
becomes too deeply involved with, and dependent upon, the
Government.

Justice Brennan also spoke for the Court in a major Free
Exercise Clause case, Sherbert v. Verner, which eloquently
set forth one side of the debate regarding whether strict gov523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT
xliv JUSTICE BRENNAN
ernmental neutrality is sufficient to satisfy the constitutionalcommand of the Clause.

The same underlying philosophy provided the founda-tion for Justice Brennan's notable contribution to the jurisprudence of the Equal Protection Clause. As is by nowwell-known, he wrote most of the opinion, signed by all nine
Members of the Court, in Cooper v. Aaron.Justice Brennan's seminal opinion upholding the constitutionality of substantive provisions of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 in Katzenbach v. Morgan marked a crucial milestonein the struggle for equal voting rights, and in

Thornburg
v. Gingles, Justice Brennan again wrote for the Court in set-ting forth the basic analytical structure that would govern

the interpretation of the amended $ 2 of the Voting RightsAct.

Perhaps even more than in the area of race discrimination,Justice Brennan's application of the Equal Protection Clause
in gender discrimination cases has had a lasting impact on
the law. In Frontiero v. Richardson, Justice Brennan's plu-rality opinion recognized that statutory distinctions between

the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating theentire class of females to inferior legal status without regard
to the actual capabilities of its individual members.Although he was writing only for a plurality in

Frontiero,
the Court adopted Justice Brennan's views in Craig v. Boren,

as well as his further articulation of the standard governinggender discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.

Classifications by gender must serve important govern-mental objectives, and must be substantially related to the
achievement of those objectives.In his ground-breaking opinion for the Court in

Goldberg
v. Kelly, Justice Brennan first applied due process standardsto a State's decision to terminate welfare payments.

In Shapiro v. Thompson, Justice Brennan spoke for the
Court in striking down longstanding State residency requirements for welfare as a burden on the right to travel.

In Eisenstadt v. Baird, Justice Brennan wrote an important opinion that was a crucial stepping stone in the develop523BV$ Unit: $$UV [05-01-00 19:42:35] PGT: FRT

xlvJUSTICE BRENNAN
ment of the right to privacy, and in Penn Central Transportation Company v. New York City, Justice Brennan set forth
for the Court the fundamental analysis that continues to gov-ern the adjudication of claims that Government regulation of

private property constitutes a taking.Justice Brennan's contributions were not limited to civil
cases. He wrote for the Court in Malloy v. Hogan, holdingthat the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled
self-incrimination applied to the States.

In In re Winship, Justice Brennan, again writing for theCourt, articulated the central due process principle of proof

beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.In

Bruton v. United States, the Court applied the Confrontation Clause to defendants who were tried jointly.An important element in Justice Brennan's jurisprudence

was his belief that remedial avenues must be available toensure that constitutional protections can be enforced. For
example, in Baker v. Carr, Justice Brennan wrote for the
Court, holding that claims of malapportionment in State leg-islatures were justiciable.

In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Justice Brennan set forth for the Court
the principles permitting implication of a cause of actiondirectly under the Constitution.

In Monell v. Department of Social Services, Justice Brennan wrote an opinion for the Court opening the door to dam-age actions under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against municipal bodies

for constitutional violations.Of course, the Court has not always accepted Justice Brennan's views and, especially in his later years on the Court,he found himself frequently in dissent. In light of the numerous areas of which Justice Brennan's work proved semi-nal in the development of the law in the 20th Century, the
fact that the Court has not always agreed with his views
should come as no surprise, but it can be safely said that, as
the Court continues to address new problems in these areas,
it will continue to confront the challenges presented by Justice Brennan.

xlvi JUSTICE BRENNAN

Justice Brennan's judicial philosophy was based on the
need for constant vigilance to apply the principles of human
liberty embodied in the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth
Amendment to ever new arrangements and new institutions.
His vision of the Constitution as embodying a fundamental
charter of human liberty will endure and will continue to be
reflected in this Court's jurisprudence.

Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the Resolutions presented to you in honor and
celebration of the memory of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.,
be accepted by the Court, and that they, together with the
chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time
in the records of this Court.

The Chief Justice said:
Thank you, Attorney General Reno, thank you, General
Waxman, for your presentations today in memory of our late
colleague and friend, William J. Brennan.

We also extend to Chairman Burt Neuborne and the members of the Committee on Resolutions, Chairman Daniel Rezneck and members of the Arrangements Committee, Judge
Abner Mikva, chairman of today's meeting of the Bar, our
appreciation for the Resolutions you have read today.

Your motion that they be made part of the permanent
record of the Court is hereby granted.

Bill Brennan's service on this Court and his contributions
to American law are an imposing achievement. He took the
oath of office as a Justice of this Court on October 16, 1956,
at the age of 50. After fulfilling his responsibilities under
three Chief Justices and alongside 19 Associate Justices, he
retired on July 20, 1990, at the age of 84.

His period of service, just a couple of months short of 34
years, is one that has been exceeded by only five other Justices in the 208-year history of this Court's existence, but
Justice Brennan's profound influence on American law can't

be measured simply by counting the number of years he satin one of the chairs behind this bench.

An accurate assessment can only be made after one hasstudied many of the 1,000-plus opinions he authored during
his long career, many of them landmark decisions by thisCourt. His majority opinions alone number well over 400.
These opinions, filling thousands of pages of this Court'sofficial reports, demonstrate Justice Brennan's scholarly
expertise, as well as his keen reasoning abilities.

In Baker v. Carr, for example, which the Resolutions com-ment on, he wrote the opinion that for the first time subjected the apportionment of State legislatures to the require-ments of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause.Before this decision, controversies regarding the radically
unequal voting districts that existed at the time came to theSupreme Court under what is called the Republican Guarantee Clause. The Supreme Court had declined to decide such
cases because the Guarantee Clause lacked judicially man-ageable standards which courts could utilize in cases brought

before them.Malapportionment of State legislatures therefore had been
considered political questions outside the Federal judiciary'sjurisdiction and, while the Federal courts thus declined to
address the problem, State legislatures were also unwilling
to act, because those who benefited from the existing elec-toral system were the ones who were making the law.

Justice Brennan cut this Gordian knot by shifting the issueof the constitutionality of malapportionment from the Guarantee Clause to the Equal Protection Clause. His opinionin

Baker v. Carr took the first step in the direction of the
now well-accepted practice and principle of one person, onevote, and in so doing changed the nature of American politics forever.

Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court in New York Times
v. Sullivan, also commented on in the Resolutions, has a
stature in our constitutional history equal to that of Baker
v. Carr, and as the Resolutions indicate, prior to the Sullivan

xlviii JUSTICE BRENNAN
decision, slander and libel law were left to the States, withfew constitutional restrictions. These rules stifled criticism

of public officials, and the result was a less-informed public.The Court in

Sullivan, relying on freedom of speech and
on what Justice Brennan called our profound national com-mitment to the principle that debate on public issues should

be uninhibited, robust, and wide open, sharply changed thesetraditional rules of libel law. The Court's opinion held that
any public official who was a plaintiff in a libel case had to
prove that the statements in question were defamatory,false, and made with actual malice.

These developments in libel law altered the rules of thegame of American politics, and speech, as a matter of fact,
making American public officials more accountable, theAmerican media more watchful, and the American people
better informed.I've mentioned just two opinions that Justice Brennan
authored that have a special place in our Nation's history.
There are others that have been mentioned in the Resolu-tion, and I'm sure still others that have not been mentioned

by anyone today, because there were so many of his opinionsthat played an important role in the development of our law.

There are dozens of other significant opinions he wrote forthe Court, and yet the great body of law for which he was
responsible may be only but half of the contribution he made
to this Court.Those of us who had the pleasure of serving with Bill

Brennan know what a wonderful human being he was,combining a friendly spirit with a highly analytical mind
dedicated to justice. Blessed with such attributes, JusticeBrennan was a force for civility and good relationship among
his colleagues.During some periods in the Court's history, differences on
constitutional questions have affected personal relationships
among the Justices and complicated the work of the Court.
In contrast, Justice Brennan was a unifying influence on the
bench, often guiding the Court to a majority or unanimous
opinion.

xlixJUSTICE BRENNAN
And when the divisions on the Court on constitutionalissues were too deep and broad to be bridged, Justice Brennan never allowed such disagreements to affect the wayhe treated his colleagues. Warm-hearted, polite, courteous,
Bill Brennan inspired these same qualities in his colleagues,even those who disagreed with him.

His career exemplifies the happy truth that a judge neednot be a prima donna to have a lasting influence on our country's laws. He will have a high place in the annals of thisCourt and in its jurisprudence.

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1997

SPENCER v. KEMNA, SUPERINTENDENT, WESTERN

MISSOURI CORRECTIONAL CENTER, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-7171. Argued November 12, 1997--Decided March 3, 1998
On October 17, 1990, petitioner began serving concurrent 3-year sentences

for convictions of felony stealing and burglary, due to expire on October
16, 1993. On April 16, 1992, he was released on parole, but on September 24, 1992, that parole was revoked and he was returned to prison.
Thereafter, he sought to invalidate the parole revocation, first filing habeas petitions in state court, and then the present federal habeas petition. Before the District Court addressed the merits of the habeas petition, petitioner's sentence expired, and so the District Court dismissed
the petition as moot. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The expiration of petitioner's sentence has caused his petition to be

moot because it no longer presents an Article III case or controversy.
Pp. 7-18.

(a) An incarcerated convict's (or a parolee's) challenge to his conviction always satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement because the
incarceration (or the restriction imposed by the terms of parole) constitutes a concrete injury caused by the conviction and redressable by the
conviction's invalidation. Once the sentence has expired, however, the
petitioner must show some concrete and continuing injury other than
the now-ended incarceration (or parole)--some "collateral consequence"
of the conviction--if the suit is to be maintained. In recent decades,
this Court has presumed that a wrongful conviction has continuing col1

Syllabus
lateral consequences (or, what is effectively the same, has counted collateral consequences that are remote and unlikely to occur). Sibron v.
New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55-56. However, in Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S.
624, the Court refused to extend this presumption of collateral consequences to the revocation of parole. The Court adheres to that refusal,
which leaves only the question whether petitioner has demonstrated
collateral consequences. Pp. 7-14.

(b) Petitioner's asserted injuries-in-fact do not establish collateral
consequences sufficient to state an Article III case or controversy.
That his parole revocation could be used to his detriment in a future
parole proceeding is merely a possibility rather than a certainty or a
probability. That the revocation could be used to increase his sentence
in a future sentencing proceeding is, like a similar claim rejected in
Lane, contingent on petitioner's violating the law, being caught and convicted. Likewise speculative are petitioner's other allegations of collateral consequence--that the parole revocation could be used to impeach
him should he appear as a witness in future proceedings, and that it
could be used directly against him should he appear as a defendant in a
criminal proceeding. Pp. 14-16.

(c) The Court finds no merit in petitioner's remaining arguments--
that since he is foreclosed from pursuing a damages action under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 unless he can establish his parole revocation's invalidity,
see Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, his action to establish that invalidity cannot be moot; that this case falls within the exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are "capable of repetition, yet evading review"; and that the mootness of his case should be ignored because it
was caused by the dilatory tactics of the state attorney general's office
and by District Court delays. Pp. 17-18.

91 F. 3d 1114, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,
C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and
Breyer, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which
O'Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined, post, p. 18. Ginsburg,

John William Simon, by appointment of the Court, 520U. S. 1227, argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.

Opinion of the Court
se, and Stephen D. Hawke, Stacy L. Anderson, and Michael
J. Spillane, Assistant Attorneys General.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Randy G. Spencer seeks to invalidate a September 24, 1992, order revoking
his parole. Because Spencer has completed the entire term
of imprisonment underlying the parole revocation, we must
decide whether his petition is moot.

I
On October 17, 1990, petitioner began serving concurrent
3-year sentences in Missouri on convictions of felony stealing
and burglary. On April 16, 1992, he was released on parole,
but on September 24, 1992, the Missouri Board of Probation
and Parole, after hearing, issued an Order of Revocation revoking the parole. The order concluded that petitioner had
violated three of the conditions, set forth in Missouri's Code
of Regulations, Title 14, $ 80-3.010 (1992), that a Missouri
inmate must comply with in order to remain on parole:

"NOW, THEREFORE, after careful consideration of evidence presented, said charges which warrant revocation
are sustained, to wit:

4 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Opinion of the Court
"#1-LAWS: I will obey all federal and state laws, munic-ipal and county ordinances. I will report all arrests to

my Probation and Parole Officer within 48 hours.
"#6-DRUGS: I will not have in my possession or use any
controlled substance except as prescribed for me by alicensed medical practitioner.

"#7-WEAPONS: I will, if my probation or parole is
based on a misdemeanor involving firearms or explo-sives, or any felony charge, not own, possess, purchase,

receive, sell or transport any firearms, ammunition orexplosive device or any dangerous weapon as defined by
federal, state or municipal laws or ordinances." App.55-56.

The specific conduct that violated these conditions was de-scribed only by citation of the parole violation report that
the board used in making its determination: "Evidence reliedupon for violation is from the Initial Violation Report dated
7-27-92." Id., at 56.That report, prepared by State Probation and Parole Officer Jonathan Tintinger, summarized a June 3, 1992, policereport prepared by the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, according to which a woman had alleged that petitioner, after smoking crack cocaine with her at a local crack
house and later at his own home, pressed a screwdriver
against her side and raped her. According to the Kansas
City report, petitioner had admitted smoking crack cocaine
with the woman, but claimed that the sexual intercourse between them had been consensual. Officer Tintinger's report
then described his own interview with petitioner, at which
petitioner again admitted smoking crack cocaine with the
woman, denied that he had pressed a screwdriver to her side,
and did not respond to the allegation of rape. Finally, after
noting that "Spencer [was] a registered sex offender, having
been given a five-year prison sentence for Sodomy in 1983,"
id., at 75, Officer Tintinger's report tentatively recommended that petitioner's parole be continued, but that he be

placed in a drug treatment center. The report withheldmaking "an ultimate recommendation based on the alleged

[rape and dangerous weapon] violations" until the prosecut-ing attorney's office had a chance to dispose of those charges.
Id., at 76. "In the event formal charges are ultimately
filed," it said, "a separate recommendation will be forthcom-ing."

Ibid. Petitioner was never charged, but a September
14, 1992, followup report prepared by Institutional ParoleOfficer Peggy McClure concluded that "there [did] appear to

be significant evidence that Spencer ha[d] violated the condi-tions of his parole as stated," and recommended that petitioner's parole be revoked. Id., at 64. Officer McClure'sreport is not mentioned in the Order of Revocation.

On being returned to prison, petitioner began his efforts
to invalidate the Order of Revocation. He first sought relief
in the Missouri courts, but was rejected by the Circuit Court
of De Kalb County, the Missouri Court of Appeals, and, finally, the Missouri Supreme Court. Then, on April 1, 1993,
just over six months before the expiration of his 3-year sentence, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Missouri, alleging that he had not
received due process in the parole revocation proceedings.1

1 Specifically, according to petitioner's brief, he contended:
"1. The Board denied him his right to a preliminary revocation hearing
on the armed criminal action accusation. . . .

"2. The Board denied him a hearing on the cancellation of his conditional
release date.

"3. The Board . . . :
"a. . . . denied him the right to confront and cross-examine any of the
witnesses against him. . . .

"b. . . . gave him no notice that the entire case for revoking his parole
would be the out-of-court statements in the violation report.

"c. . . . denied him the right to representation by a person of his choice.
"4. The Board failed to apprise him of the fact of its decision to revoke
his parole, and of the evidence it relied on in doing so, for four months,
when its regulations required that . . . the parolee be provided [such a]

6 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Opinion of the Court
Over petitioner's objections, the District Court granted theState two requested extensions of time to respond to the

petition, deferring the deadline from June 2, 1993, until July7, 1993. On July 14, 1993, after receiving the State's response, petitioner filed a lengthy "Motion and Request for
Final Disposition of this Matter," in which he requested that
the District Court expedite decision on his case in order to
prevent his claim from becoming moot. Before the District
Court responded to this motion, however, on August 7, 1993,
petitioner was re-released on parole, and, two months after
that, on October 16, 1993, the term of his imprisonment expired. On February 3, 1994, the District Court "noted" petitioner's July motion, stating that "[t]he resolution of this case
will not be delayed beyond the requirements of this Court's
docket." App. 127. Then, on August 23, 1995, the District
Court dismissed petitioner's habeas petition. "Because," it
said, "the sentences at issue here have expired, petitioner is
no longer `in custody' within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(a), and his claim for habeas corpus relief is moot."
Id., at 130.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
affirmed the District Court's judgment,2 concluding that,
under our decision in Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624, 632
(1982), petitioner's claim had become moot because he suffered no "collateral consequences" of the revocation order.
91 F. 3d 1114 (1996). (It acknowledged that this interpretation of Lane did not accord with that of the Second and Ninth
Circuits in United States v. Parker, 952 F. 2d 31 (CA2 1991),

statement within ten working days from the date of the decision." See
Brief for Petitioner 5-6.

2 By the time the case reached the Eighth Circuit, petitioner was once

again in prison, this time serving a 7-year sentence for attempted felony
stealing. He is still there, and the State informs us that he is scheduled
to be released on parole on January 24, 1999. See Brief for Respondents
8, n. 4.

and Robbins v. Christianson, 904 F. 2d 492 (CA9 1990).) Wegranted certiorari. 520 U. S. 1165 (1997).

II
The District Court's conclusion that Spencer's release fromprison caused his petition to be moot because it no longer

satisfied the "in custody" requirement of the habeas statutewas in error. Spencer was incarcerated by reason of the
parole revocation at the time the petition was filed, which isall the "in custody" provision of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 requires.
See Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 238 (1968); Maleng v.
Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 490-491 (1989) (per curiam). The moresubstantial question, however, is whether petitioner's subsequent release caused the petition to be moot because it nolonger presented a case or controversy under Article III, $ 2,
of the Constitution. "This case-or-controversy requirementsubsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings,
trial and appellate. . . . The parties must continue to have a`personal stake in the outcome' of the lawsuit."

Lewis v.Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477-478 (1990). See

also Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975). Thismeans that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff "must
have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury trace-able to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Lewis, supra, at 477.An incarcerated convict's (or a parolee's) challenge to the
validity of his conviction always satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement, because the incarceration (or the
restriction imposed by the terms of the parole) constitutes aconcrete injury, caused by the conviction and redressable by
invalidation of the conviction. Once the convict's sentencehas expired, however, some concrete and continuing injury
other than the now-ended incarceration or parole--some"collateral consequence" of the conviction--must exist if the
suit is to be maintained. See, e. g., Carafas, supra, at 237-

8 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Opinion of the Court
238. In recent decades, we have been willing to presumethat a wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateral

consequences (or, what is effectively the same, to count col-lateral consequences that are remote and unlikely to occur).
See Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55-56 (1968).

The present petitioner, however, does not attack his con-victions for felony stealing and burglary, which he concedes

were lawful; he asserts only the wrongful termination ofhis parole status. The reincarceration that he incurred as
a result of that action is now over, and cannot be undone.Subsistence of the suit requires, therefore, that continuing
"collateral consequences" of the parole revocation be either
proved or presumed. And the first question we confront is
whether the presumption of collateral consequences which is
applied to criminal convictions will be extended as well to
revocations of parole. To answer that question, it is helpful
to review the origins of and basis for the presumption.

Originally, we required collateral consequences of conviction to be specifically identified, and we accepted as sufficient
to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement only concrete
disadvantages or disabilities that had in fact occurred, that
were imminently threatened, or that were imposed as a matter of law (such as deprivation of the right to vote, to hold
office, to serve on a jury, or to engage in certain businesses).
Thus, in St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (per
curiam), one of the first cases to recognize collateral consequences of conviction as a basis for avoiding mootness, we
refused to allow St. Pierre's challenge to a contempt citation
after he had completed his 5-month sentence, because "petitioner [has not] shown that under either state or federal law
further penalties or disabilities can be imposed on him as a
result of the judgment which has now been satisfied," id., at
43. We rejected St. Pierre's argument that the possibility
that "the judgment [could] impair his credibility as [a] witness in any future legal proceeding" was such a penalty or
disability, because "the moral stigma of a judgment which no

9Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
longer affects legal rights does not present a case or contro-versy for appellate review."

Ibid. Similarly, in Carafas v.
LaVallee, we permitted an individual to continue his chal-lenge to a criminal conviction only after identifying specific,

concrete collateral consequences that attached to the conviction as a matter of law:

"It is clear that petitioner's cause is not moot. In conse-quence of his conviction, he cannot engage in certain

businesses; he cannot serve as an official of a labor unionfor a specified period of time; he cannot vote in any election held in New York State; he cannot serve as a juror."
391 U. S., at 237 (footnotes and citation omitted).

See also Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211, 221-223(1946) (conviction rendered petitioner liable to deportation

and denial of naturalization, and ineligible to serve on a jury,
vote, or hold office); United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502(1954) (conviction had been used to increase petitioner's current sentence under state recidivist law); Parker v. Ellis, 362U. S. 574, 576 (1960) (Harlan, J., concurring) (since petitioner's other, unchallenged convictions took away the same civilrights as the conviction under challenge, the challenge was
moot); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633, n. 2 (1968)(conviction rendered petitioner liable to revocation of his license to operate luncheonette business). Cf. Tannenbaum
v. New York, 388 U. S. 439 (1967) (per curiam); Jacobs v. New
York, 388 U. S. 431 (1967) (per curiam).

The gateway to abandonment of this fastidious approachto collateral consequences was

Pollard v. United States, 352
U. S. 354 (1957). There, in allowing a convict who had already served his time to challenge the length of his sentence,
we said, almost offhandedly, that "[t]he possibility of consequences collateral to the imposition of sentence [was] sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing with the merits,"
id., at 358--citing for that possibility an earlier case involving consequences for an alien (which there is no reason to

523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
10 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Opinion of the Court
believe Pollard was), see Pino v. Landon, 349 U. S. 901(1955). In Sibron v. New York, we relied upon this opinion

to support the conclusion that our jurisprudence had "aban-doned all inquiry into the actual existence of collateral consequences and in effect presumed that they existed." 392U. S., at 55 (citing

Pollard, supra).3 Thereafter, and in sum-mary fashion, we proceeded to accept the most generalized

and hypothetical of consequences as sufficient to avoid moot-ness in challenges to conviction. For example, in Evitts v.
Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985), we held that respondent's habeaschallenge had not become moot despite the expiration of his
sentence and despite the fact that "his civil rights, includingsuffrage and the right to hold public office, [had been] restored," id., at 391, n. 4. Since he had not been pardoned,we said, "some collateral consequences of his conviction remain, including the possibility that the conviction would beused to impeach testimony he might give in a future proceeding and the possibility that it would be used to subject himto persistent felony offender prosecution if he should go to
trial on any other felony charges in the future." Ibid. See
also Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791 (1969);
Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108, n. 3 (1977) (per
curiam); Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U. S. 366 (1993).

There are several relevant observations to be made re-garding these developments: First, it must be acknowledged

that the practice of presuming collateral consequences (or ofaccepting the remote possibility of collateral consequences as
adequate to satisfy Article III) sits uncomfortably beside the"long-settled principle that standing cannot be `inferred argumentatively from averments in the pleadings,' but rather

3 Sibron also purported to rely on United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S.
502 (1954), and Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211 (1946), as establishing that a "mere possibility" of collateral consequences suffices, see 392
U. S., at 54-55, but as we have described, those cases involved much more
than that.

`must affirmatively appear in the record,' " and that "it is theburden of the `party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor,' `clearly to allege facts demonstrating thathe is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.' " FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990)
(citations omitted). The practice of presuming collateral con-sequences developed during an era in which it was thought

that the only function of the constitutional requirement ofstanding was "to assure that concrete adverseness which
sharpens the presentation of issues," Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S.186, 204 (1962).

Sibron appears in the same volume of the
United States Reports as Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968),which said:

"The question whether a particular person is a properparty to maintain the action does not, by its own force,
raise separation of powers problems related to improperjudicial interference in areas committed to other
branches of the Federal Government. Such problems
arise, if at all, only from the substantive issues the individual seeks to have adjudicated. Thus, in terms of
Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction,
the question of standing is related only to whether the
dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in
an adversary context and in a form historically viewed
as capable of judicial resolution." Id., at 100-101.

See Benton v. Maryland, supra, at 790-791 ("Although this
possibility [of collateral consequences] may well be a remote
one, it is enough to give this case an adversary cast and make
it justiciable"). That parsimonious view of the function of
Article III standing has since yielded to the acknowledgment that the constitutional requirement is a "means of

`defin[ing] the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite
allocation of power,' " Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,

454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982),4 and "a part of the basic charter . . .provid[ing] for the interaction between [the federal] government and the governments of the several States," id., at 476.See also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,
559-560 (1992). And finally, of particular relevance to thequestion whether the practice of presuming collateral
consequences should be extended to challenges of paroletermination: In the context of criminal conviction, the presumption of significant collateral consequences is likely tocomport with reality. As we said in

Sibron, it is an "obviousfact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail

adverse collateral legal consequences." 392 U. S., at 55.The same cannot be said of parole revocation.

For these reasons, perhaps, we have hitherto refused toextend our presumption of collateral consequences (or our
willingness to accept hypothetical consequences) to the areaof parole revocation. In

Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624(1982), we rejected the contention of convicted felons who

had completed their sentences that their challenges to theirsentences of three years' mandatory parole at the conclusion
of their fixed terms of incarceration (which parole they hadviolated) were not moot because the revocations of parole
could be used to their detriment in future parole proceedingsshould they ever be convicted of other crimes. We said:

"The doctrine of Carafas and Sibron is not applicable inthis case. No civil disabilities such as those present in
Carafas result from a finding that an individual has vio-lated his parole."

Id., at 632.

"[Carafas] concerned existing civil disabilities; as aresult of the petitioner's conviction, he was presently

alone. Id., at 100-101, quoted in text.

barred from holding certain offices, voting in state elec-tions, and serving as a juror. This case involves no such

disability." Id., at 632-633, n. 13.
It was not enough that the parole violations found by therevocation decision would enable the parole board to deny

respondents parole in the future, see id., at 639-640 (Mar-shall, J., dissenting) (quoting Illinois rules governing denial
of parole). For such violations "[did] not render an individ-ual ineligible for parole under Illinois law[,] [but were] simply one factor, among many, that may be considered by theparole authority . . . ." Id., at 633, n. 13. And, in any event,
"[t]he parole violations that remain a part of respondents'records cannot affect a subsequent parole determination unless respondents again violate state law, are returned toprison, and become eligible for parole. Respondents themselves are able--and indeed required by law--to preventsuch a possibility from occurring."

Ibid. In addition, werejected as collateral consequences sufficient to keep the controversy alive the possibility that the parole revocationswould affect the individuals' "employment prospects, or

the sentence imposed [upon them] in a future criminal pro-ceeding." Id., at 632. These "nonstatutory consequences"
were dependent upon "[t]he discretionary decisions . . . madeby an employer or a sentencing judge," which are "not governed by the mere presence or absence of a recorded viola-tion of parole," but can "take into consideration, and are
more directly influenced by, the underlying conduct thatformed the basis for the parole violation."

Id., at 632-633.5

5 The Court pointed out in Lane that respondents were attacking only
their parole sentences, and not their convictions, see 455 U. S., at 631.
That was evidently for the purpose of excluding direct application of Sibron. The Court also pointed out, near the conclusion of its opinion, that
respondents were not attacking "the finding that they violated the terms
of their parole." 455 U. S., at 633. This is not framed as an independent
ground for the decision, and if it were such most of the opinion would have

14 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Opinion of the Court
We adhere to the principles announced in Lane, and de-cline to presume that collateral consequences adequate to

meet Article III's injury-in-fact requirement resulted frompetitioner's parole revocation. The question remains, then,
whether petitioner demonstrated such consequences.

III
Petitioner asserts four concrete injuries-in-fact attribut-able to his parole revocation. First, he claims that the

revocation could be used to his detriment in a future paroleproceeding. This possibility is no longer contingent on
petitioner's again violating the law; he has already done so,and is currently serving a 7-year term of imprisonment.
But it is, nonetheless, still a possibility rather than a cer-tainty or even a probability. Under Missouri law, as under
the Illinois law addressed in Lane, a prior parole revocation"[does] not render an individual ineligible for parole[,] [but
is] simply one factor, among many, that may be consideredby the parole authority in determining whether there is a
substantial risk that the parole candidate will not conformto reasonable conditions of parole." 455 U. S., at 633, n. 13.
Under Missouri law, "[w]hen in its opinion there is reasonableprobability that an offender . . . can be released without detriment to the community or himself, the board may in itsdiscretion release or parole such person." Mo. Rev. Stat.

$ 217.690 (1996). The Missouri Supreme Court has said thatthis statute "giv[es] the Board `almost unlimited discretion'
in whether to grant parole release." Shaw v. MissouriBoard of Probation and Parole, 937 S. W. 2d 771, 772 (1997).

been unnecessary. The Court did not contest the dissenters' contention
that "respondents . . . seek to have the parole term declared void, or expunged," id., at 635 (Marshall, J., dissenting), which "would have the effect
of removing respondents' parole-violation status and would relieve respondents of the collateral consequences flowing from this status," id., at
636, n. 1.

15Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Petitioner's second contention is that the Order of Revoca-tion could be used to increase his sentence in a future sentencing proceeding. A similar claim was likewise consid-ered and rejected in Lane, because it was contingent upon
respondents' violating the law, getting caught, and being con-victed. "Respondents themselves are able--and indeed required by law--to prevent such a possibility from occurring."
Lane, supra, at 633, n. 13. We of course have rejected anal-ogous claims to Article III standing in other contexts.

"[W]e are . . . unable to conclude that the case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied by general assertions or inferences that in the course of their activitiesrespondents will be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws. We assume that respondents will conducttheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecution
and conviction." O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488,497 (1974).

See also Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102-103 (1983).For similar reasons, we reject petitioner's third and fourth
contentions, that the parole revocation (and, specifically, the"finding of a parole violation for forcible rape and armed
criminal action," see Brief for Petitioner 34) could be usedto impeach him should he appear as a witness or litigant in
a future criminal or civil proceeding; or could be used againsthim directly, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 405

6 (or

Missouri's state-law equivalent, see Durbin v. Cassalo, 321S. W. 2d 23, 26 (Mo. App. 1959)) or Federal Rule of Evidence

413,7 should he appear as a defendant in a criminal proceed6 Federal Rule of Evidence 405 provides, in relevant part, that "[i]n cases
in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may . . . be made of specific
instances of that person's conduct."

criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual
assault, evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or of523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing. It is purely a matter of speculation whether such anappearance will ever occur. See O'Shea, supra, at 496-497.

Moreover, as to the possibility that petitioner (or a witnessappearing on his behalf) would be impeached with the parole
revocation, it is far from certain that a prosecutor or examin-ing counsel would decide to use the parole revocation (a "discretionary decision" similar to those of the sentencing judgeand employer discussed in

Lane, supra, at 632-633); and, ifso, whether the presiding judge would admit it, particularly

in light of the far more reliable evidence of two past criminalconvictions that would achieve the same purpose of impeachment, see State v. Comstock, 647 S. W. 2d 163, 165 (Mo. App.1983). Indeed, it is not even clear that a Missouri court
could legally admit the parole revocation to impeach peti-tioner. See

State v. Newman, 568 S. W. 2d 276, 278-282 (Mo.App. 1978). And as to the possibility that the parole revocation could be used directly against petitioner should he bethe object of a criminal prosecution, it is at least as likely
that the conduct underlying the revocation, rather than therevocation itself (which does not recite the specific conduct
constituting the parole violation) would be used.8
fenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant."

8 The dissent asserts that "a finding that an individual has committed a

serious felony" renders the "interest in vindicating . . . reputation . . .
constitutionally [s]ufficient" to avoid mootness. Post, at 23, 24. We have
obviously not regarded it as sufficient in the past--even when the finding
was not that of a parole board, but the much more solemn condemnation
of a full-dress criminal conviction. For that would have rendered entirely
unnecessary the inquiry into concrete collateral consequences of conviction
in many of our cases, see, e. g., Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791
(1969); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 237-238 (1968); Fiswick, 329
U. S., at 220-222, and unnecessary as well (at least as to felony convictions)
Sibron's presumption of collateral consequences, see supra, at 8-10. Of
course there is no reason in principle for limiting the dissent's novel theory
to felonies: If constitutionally adequate damage to reputation is produced
by a parole board's finding of one more felony by a current inmate who

Opinion of the Court

IV
Petitioner raises three more arguments, none of whichseems to us well taken. First, he contends that since our

decision in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), wouldforeclose him from pursuing a damages action under Rev.
Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, unless he can establish theinvalidity of his parole revocation, his action to establish that
invalidity cannot be moot. This is a great non sequitur, un-less one believes (as we do not) that a $ 1983 action for damages must always and everywhere be available. It is notcertain, in any event, that a $ 1983 damages claim would be
foreclosed. If, for example, petitioner were to seek damages"for using the wrong procedures, not for reaching the wrong
result," see Heck, 512 U. S., at 482-483, and if that proce-dural defect did not "necessarily imply the invalidity of " the
revocation, see id., at 487, then Heck would have no applica-tion all. See also

Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, 645-649(1997); id., at 649-650 (

Ginsburg, J., concurring).Secondly, petitioner argues in his reply brief that this case

falls within the exception to the mootness doctrine for casesthat are "capable of repetition, yet evading review." Reply
Brief for Petitioner 5. "[T]he capable-of-repetition doctrineapplies only in exceptional situations," Lyons, supra, at 109,
"where the following two circumstances [are] simultaneouslypresent: ` "(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too
short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again," ' "
Lewis, 494 U. S., at 481 (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U. S.478, 482 (1982) (per curiam), in turn quoting Weinstein v.

has spent six of the last seven years in custody on three separate felony
convictions, surely it is also produced by the criminal misdemeanor conviction of a model citizen. Perhaps for obvious reasons, the damage to reputation upon which the dissent would rest its judgment has not been asserted before us by petitioner himself.

18 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Souter, J., concurring
Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam)); see alsoNorman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288 (1992). Petitioner's case

satisfies neither of these conditions. He has not shown (andwe doubt that he could) that the time between parole revocation and expiration of sentence is always so short as to evadereview. Nor has he demonstrated a reasonable likelihood
that he will once again be paroled and have that parolerevoked.

Finally, petitioner argues that, even if his case is moot,that fact should be ignored because it was caused by the
dilatory tactics of the state attorney general's office and thedelay of the District Court. But mootness, however it may
have come about, simply deprives us of our power to act;there is nothing for us to remedy, even if we were disposed
to do so. We are not in the business of pronouncing thatpast actions which have no demonstrable continuing effect
were right or wrong. As for petitioner's concern that lawenforcement officials and district judges will repeat with impunity the mootness-producing abuse that he alleges oc-curred here: We are confident that, as a general matter, district courts will prevent dilatory tactics by the litigants andwill not unduly delay their own rulings; and that, where appropriate, corrective mandamus will issue from the courtsof appeals.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion as well as the judgment, thoughI do so for an added reason that the Court does not reach,

but which I spoke to while concurring in a prior case. Oneof Spencer's arguments for finding his present interest ade523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

19Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)
Souter, J., concurring
quate to support continuing standing despite his release
from custody is, as he says, that he may not now press his
claims of constitutional injury by action against state officers
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. He assumes that Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), held or entails that conclusion,
with the result that holding his habeas claim moot would
leave him without any present access to a federal forum to
show the unconstitutionality of his parole revocation. If
Spencer were right on this point, his argument would provide a reason, whether or not dispositive, to recognize continuing standing to litigate his habeas claim. But he is wrong;
Heck did not hold that a released prisoner in Spencer's circumstances is out of court on a $ 1983 claim, and for reasons
explained in my Heck concurrence, it would be unsound to
read either Heck or the habeas statute as requiring any such
result. For all that appears here, then, Spencer is free to
bring a $ 1983 action, and his corresponding argument for
continuing habeas standing falls accordingly.

The petitioner in Heck was an inmate with a direct appeal
from his conviction pending, who brought a $ 1983 action for
damages against state officials who were said to have acted
unconstitutionally in arresting and prosecuting him. Drawing an analogy to the tort of malicious prosecution, we ruled
that an inmate's $ 1983 claim for damages was unavailable
because he could not demonstrate that the underlying criminal proceedings had terminated in his favor.

To be sure, the majority opinion in Heck can be read to
suggest that this favorable-termination requirement is an
element of any $ 1983 action alleging unconstitutional conviction, whether or not leading to confinement and whether
or not any confinement continued when the $ 1983 action was
filed. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S., at 483-484, 486-487.
Indeed, although Heck did not present such facts, the majority acknowledged the possibility that even a released prisoner might not be permitted to bring a $ 1983 action implying

Souter, J., concurring
the invalidity of a conviction or confinement without first
satisfying the favorable-termination requirement. Id., at
490, n. 10.

Concurring in the judgment in Heck, I suggested a different rationale for blocking an inmate's suit with a requirement to show the favorable termination of the underlying
proceedings. In the manner of Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411
U. S. 475 (1973), I read the "general" $ 1983 statute in light
of the "specific" federal habeas statute, which applies only to
persons "in custody," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), and requires them
to exhaust state remedies, $ 2254(b). Heck v. Humphrey,
512 U. S., at 497. I agreed that "the statutory scheme must
be read as precluding such attacks," id., at 498, not because
the favorable-termination requirement was necessarily an element of the $ 1983 cause of action for unconstitutional conviction or custody, but because it was a "simple way to avoid
collisions at the intersection of habeas and $ 1983." Ibid.

I also thought we were bound to recognize the apparent
scope of $ 1983 when no limitation was required for the sake
of honoring some other statute or weighty policy, as in the
instance of habeas. Accordingly, I thought it important to
read the Court's Heck opinion as subjecting only inmates
seeking $ 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or
confinement to "a requirement analogous to the maliciousprosecution tort's favorable-termination requirement," id., at
500, lest the plain breadth of $ 1983 be unjustifiably limited
at the expense of persons not "in custody" within the meaning of the habeas statute. The subsequent case of Edwards
v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997), was, like Heck itself, a suit
by a prisoner and so for present purposes left the law where
it was after Heck. Now, as then, we are forced to recognize
that any application of the favorable-termination requirement to $ 1983 suits brought by plaintiffs not in custody
would produce a patent anomaly: a given claim for relief from
unconstitutional injury would be placed beyond the scope of

$ 1983 if brought by a convict free of custody (as, in this case,following service of a full term of imprisonment), when exactly the same claim could be redressed if brought by a for-mer prisoner who had succeeded in cutting his custody short
through habeas.*The better view, then, is that a former prisoner, no longer
"in custody," may bring a $ 1983 action establishing the un-constitutionality of a conviction or confinement without
being bound to satisfy a favorable-termination requirementthat it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to
satisfy. Thus, the answer to Spencer's argument that hishabeas claim cannot be moot because

Heck bars him fromrelief under $ 1983 is that
Heck has no such effect. After aprisoner's release from custody, the habeas statute and its

exhaustion requirement have nothing to do with his right toany relief.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
The Court held in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994),that a state prisoner may not maintain an action under 42

U. S. C. $ 1983 if the direct or indirect effect of granting reliefwould be to invalidate the state sentence he is serving. I
joined the Court's opinion in Heck. Mindful of "real-life ex-ample[s]," among them this case, cf. 512 U. S., at 490, n. 10, I
have come to agree with Justice Souter's reasoning: Individuals without recourse to the habeas statute because theyare not "in custody" (people merely fined or whose sentences

have been fully served, for example) fit within $ 1983's
"broad reach." See id., at 503 (Souter, J., concurring injudgment); cf.

Henslee v. Union Planters Nat. Bank & Trust

*The convict given a fine alone, however onerous, or sentenced to a term
too short to permit even expeditious litigation without continuances before
expiration of the sentence, would always be ineligible for $ 1983 relief.

in judgment).

22 SPENCER v. KEMNA

Stevens, J., dissenting
Co., 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)("Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to

reject it merely because it comes late."). On that under-standing of the state of the law, I join both the Court's opinion and Justice Souter's concurring opinion in this case.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
An official determination that a person has committed acrime may cause two different kinds of injury. It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the rightto vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment
if another crime is committed. It may also severely injurethe person's reputation and good name.

In holding that petitioner's case is moot, the Court reliesheavily on our opinion in

Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624(1982) (opinion of
Stevens, J.). See ante, at 12-16. Lane,however, is inapposite. In

Lane, the respondents did notseek to challenge the factual findings underlying their parole

revocations. 455 U. S., at 633. Instead, they simply soughtto challenge their sentences; yet because they had been released by the time the case reached us, the case was moot.
Id., at 631. "Through the mere passage of time, respondentsha[d] obtained all the relief that they sought." Id., at 633.

In this case, petitioner challenges the factual findings onwhich his parole revocation was based. His parole was revoked based on an official determination that he committedthe crime of forcible rape.

1 Assuming, as the Court does,

1 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions: Parole Condition #1, because he
allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly
used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i. e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape). App. 60-64 (alleging violations of Conditions
#1, #6, and #7); id., at 72-76 (same); id., at 112-114 (alleging violations of
Conditions #1 and #6). Thus, when the parole revocation board declared,
"after careful consideration of evidence presented," that petitioner vio523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

23Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)
Stevens, J., dissenting
that he had standing to bring that challenge while he remained in prison, the mootness question, as framed by the
Court, is whether he continues to have " `a "personal stake
in the outcome" of the lawsuit' " that is likely to be redressed
by a favorable decision. Ante, at 7.2

Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is
guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively. It may well be true that many prisoners have
already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good
names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a
de minimis impact on their reputations. I do not believe,
however, that one can say that about a finding that an individual has committed a serious felony.3 Moreover, even if
one may question the wisdom of providing a statutory remedy to redress such an injury, I surely cannot accept the view

lated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 55-56, it found that petitioner
was guilty of forcible rape. See also Brief for Respondents 1 ("Spencer
violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape"). In addition, even
apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that
petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the
rape). App. 55-56.

2 The "personal stake in the outcome" formulation of the test, which has

been repeatedly quoted in our cases, was first articulated in this excerpt
from the Court opinion in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962): "Have
the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination
of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of
standing."

3 See, e. g., Liberty Lobby, Inc. v. Anderson, 746 F. 2d 1563, 1568 (CADC

1984) (opinion of Scalia, J.) ("It is shameful that Benedict Arnold was a
traitor; but he was not a shoplifter to boot, and one should not have been
able to make that charge while knowing its falsity with impunity. . . . Even
the public outcast's remaining good reputation, limited in scope though it
may be, is not inconsequential"), vacated and remanded, on other grounds,

Stevens, J., dissenting
that an interest in vindicating one's reputation is constitutionally insufficient 4 to qualify as a "personal stake in the
outcome." 5 Indeed, in light of the fact that we have held

4 While an individual may not have a "property" or "liberty" interest in
his or her reputation so as to trigger due process protections, Paul v.
Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 712 (1976), that question is obviously distinct from
whether an interest in one's reputation is sufficient to defeat a claim of
mootness.

5 As we have stated: "[T]he individual's right to the protection of his

own good name `reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential
dignity and worth of every human being--a concept at the root of any
decent system of ordered liberty.' " Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.
323, 341 (1974) (quoting Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U. S. 75, 92 (1966) (Stewart, J., concurring)); see also Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S. 1,
12 (1990) (" `[H]e that filches from me my good name/Robs me of that
which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed' " (quoting W. Shakespeare, Othello, act III, sc. 3)); Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S., at 706 ("The Court
has recognized the serious damage that could be inflicted by branding a
government employee as `disloyal,' and thereby stigmatizing his good
name"); Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433, 437 (1971) (emphasizing the importance of "a person's good name, reputation, honor, [and] integrity"; holding that respondent was entitled to due process before notices were posted stating that he was prohibited from buying or receiving
alcohol); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 363-364 (1970) ("[B]ecause of the
certainty that [one found guilty of criminal behavior] would be stigmatized
by the conviction . . . , a society that values the good name and freedom
of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime
when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt"); Wieman v. Updegraff,
344 U. S. 183, 190-191 (1952) ("There can be no dispute about the consequences visited upon a person excluded from public employment on disloyalty grounds. In the view of the community, the stain is a deep one;
indeed, it has become a badge of infamy").

Indeed, vindicating one's reputation is the main interest at stake in a
defamation case, and that interest has always been held to constitute a
sufficient "personal stake." See, e. g., Paul, 424 U. S., at 697 ("[R]espondent's complaint would appear to state a classical claim for defamation
actionable in the courts of virtually every State. Imputing criminal behavior to an individual is generally considered defamatory per se, and
actionable without proof of special damages"); Gertz, 418 U. S., at 349-350
("We need not define `actual injury' . . . . Suffice it to say that actual
injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss. Indeed, the more customary

that an interest in one's reputation is sufficient to conferstanding,

types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment
of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and
mental anguish and suffering"); L. Eldredge, Law of Defamation $ 53,
pp. 293-294 (1978) ("There is no doubt about the historical fact that the
interest in one's good name was considered an important interest requiring legal protection more than a thousand years ago; and that so far as
Anglo-Saxon history is concerned this interest became a legally protected
interest comparatively soon after the interest in bodily integrity was
given legal protection").

6 Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 472-477 (1987).

7 There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioner's challenge to the parole board's findings sooner rather than later. As we
stated in a related context:

"The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many
contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned. It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly
and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral
to the central controversy. Moreover, litigation is better conducted when
the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without
a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade. And it is far
better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require
the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability
itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of
the State's right to impose it on the basis of some past action." Sibron v.
New York, 392 U. S. 40, 56-57 (1968) (citation omitted).

I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible
consequences to the parole board's findings so as to defeat a claim of
mootness.

8 Given the Court's holding that petitioner does not have a remedy under

the habeas statute, it is perfectly clear, as Justice Souter explains, that
he may bring an action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

LEXECON INC. et al. v. MILBERG WEISS BERSHAD

HYNES & LERACH et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1482. Argued November 10, 1997--Decided March 3, 1998
Petitioners, a law and economics consulting firm and one of its principals

(collectively, Lexecon), were defendants in a class action brought against
Charles Keating and the American Continental Corporation in connection with the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan. It and other actions
arising out of that failure were transferred for pretrial proceedings to
the District of Arizona under 28 U. S. C. $ 1407(a), which authorizes the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer civil actions with
common issues of fact "to any district for coordinated or consolidated
pretrial proceedings," but provides that the Panel "shall" remand any
such action to the original district "at or before the conclusion of such
pretrial proceedings." Before the pretrial proceedings ended, the
plaintiffs and Lexecon reached a "resolution," and the claims against
Lexecon were dismissed. Subsequently, Lexecon brought this diversity action in the Northern District of Illinois against respondent law
firms (hereinafter Milberg and Cotchett), claiming several torts, including defamation, arising from the firms' conduct as counsel for the
class-action plaintiffs. Milberg and Cotchett moved for, and the Panel
ordered, a $ 1407(a) transfer to the District of Arizona. After the
remaining parties to the Lincoln Savings litigation reached a final settlement, Lexecon moved the Arizona District Court to refer the case back
to the Panel for remand to the Northern District of Illinois. The law
firms filed a countermotion requesting the Arizona District Court to
invoke $ 1404(a) to "transfer" the case to itself for trial. With only the
defamation claim against Milberg remaining after a summary judgment
ruling, the court assigned the case to itself for trial and denied Lexecon's
motion to request the Panel to remand. The Ninth Circuit then denied
Lexecon's petition for mandamus, refusing to vacate the self-assignment
order and require remand because Lexecon would have the opportunity
to obtain relief from the transfer order on direct appeal. After Milberg
won a judgment on the defamation claim, Lexecon again appealed the
transfer order. The Ninth Circuit affirmed on the ground that permitting the transferee court to assign a case to itself upon completion of its
pretrial work was not only consistent with the statutory language but
conducive to efficiency.

Syllabus
Held: A district court conducting pretrial proceedings pursuant to

$ 1407(a) has no authority to invoke $ 1404(a) to assign a transferred case
to itself for trial. Pp. 32-43.

(a) Two sources of ostensible authority for Milberg's espousal of selfassignment authority are that the Panel has explicitly authorized such
assignments in Panel Rule 14(b), which it issued in reliance on its rulemaking authority; and that $ 1407(a)'s limitations on a transferee court's
authority to the conduct of "coordinated or consolidated" proceedings
and to "pretrial proceedings" raise no obvious bar to a transferee's retention of a case under $ 1404. Beyond this point, however, the textual
pointers reverse direction, for $ 1407 not only authorizes the Panel to
transfer for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings, but obligates the Panel to remand any pending case to its originating court
when, at the latest, those pretrial proceedings end. The Panel's remand
instruction comes in terms of the mandatory "shall," which normally
creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion. Anderson v.
Yungkau, 329 U. S. 482, 485. Reading the statute whole, this Court has
to give effect to this plain command, see Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos
Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 476, even if that will reverse the longstanding practice under the statute and the rule, see Metropolitan Stevedore
Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S. 291, 300. Pp. 32-37.

(b) None of Milberg's additional arguments based on the statute's language and legislative history can unsettle $ 1407's straightforward language imposing the Panel's responsibility to remand, which bars recognizing any self-assignment power in a transferee court and consequently
entails the invalidity of the Panel's Rule 14(b). Pp. 37-41.

(c) Milberg errs in arguing that a remedy for Lexecon can be omitted
under the harmless-error doctrine. That $ 1407's strict remand requirement creates an interest too substantial to be left without a remedy is
attested by a congressional judgment that no discretion is to be left to
a court faced with an objection to a statutory violation. The $ 1407
mandate would lose all meaning if a party who continuously objected to
an uncorrected categorical violation of the mandate could obtain no relief at the end of the day. Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, distinguished. Pp. 41-43.

Opinion of the Court
Illinois against respondents, the law firms of Milberg WeissBershad Hynes & Lerach (Milberg) and Cotchett, Illston &

Pitre (Cotchett), claiming malicious prosecution, abuse ofprocess, tortious interference, commercial disparagement,
and defamation. The suit arose out of the firms' conduct as
counsel in a prior class action brought against Charles Keat-ing and the American Continental Corporation for violations

of the securities and racketeering laws. Lexecon also wasa defendant, charged with giving federal and state banking
regulators inaccurate and misleading reports about the fi-nancial condition of the American Continental Corporation
and its subsidiary Lincoln Savings and Loan. Along with
other actions arising out of the failure of Lincoln Savings,
the case against Lexecon was transferred under $ 1407(a) for
pretrial proceedings before Judge Bilby in the District of
Arizona, where the matters so consolidated were known as
the Lincoln Savings litigation. Before those proceedings
were over, the class-action plaintiffs and Lexecon reached
what they termed a "resolution," under which the claims
against Lexecon were dismissed in August 1992.

Lexecon then filed this case in the Northern District of
Illinois charging that the prior class action terminated in
its favor when the respondent law firms' clients voluntarily
dismissed their claims against Lexecon as meritless, amounting to nothing more, according to Lexecon, than a vendetta.
When these allegations came to the attention of Judge Bilby,
he issued an order stating his understanding of the terms of
the resolution agreement between Lexecon and the classaction plaintiffs. 102 F. 3d 1524, 1529, and n. 2 (CA9 1996).
Judge Bilby's characterization of the agreement being markedly at odds with the allegations in the instant action, Lexecon appealed his order to the Ninth Circuit.

Milberg, joined by Cotchett, then filed a motion under

$ 1407(a) with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
seeking transfer of this case to Judge Bilby for consolidation
with the Lincoln Savings litigation. Although the judge en523US1 Unit: $U31 [04-29-00 19:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

tered a recusal because of the order he had taken it uponhimself to issue, the law firms nonetheless renewed their

motion for a $ 1407(a) transfer.The Panel ordered a transfer in early June 1993 and assigned the case to Judge Roll, noting that Lexecon's claims
"share questions of fact with an as yet unapproved settle-ment involving Touche Ross, Lexecon, Inc. and the investor

plaintiffs in the Lincoln Savings investor class actions inMDL-834." App. 18. The Panel observed that "i) a massive document depository is located in the District of Arizonaand ii) the Ninth Circuit has before it an appeal of an order
[describing the terms of Lexecon's dismissal from the Lincoln Savings litigation] in MDL-834 which may be relevant
to the Lexecon claims." Ibid. Prior to any dispositive action on Lexecon's instant claims in the District of Arizona,
the Ninth Circuit appeal mentioned by the Panel was dismissed, and the document depository was closed down.

In November 1993, Judge Roll dismissed Lexecon's statelaw malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims, applying a "heightened pleading standard," 845 F. Supp. 1377, 1383
(Ariz. 1993). Although the law firms then moved for summary judgment on the claims remaining, the judge deferred
action pending completion of discovery, during which time
the remaining parties to the Lincoln Savings litigation
reached a final settlement, on which judgment was entered
in March 1994.

In August 1994, Lexecon moved that the District Court
refer the case back to the Panel for remand to the Northern
District of Illinois, thus heeding the point of Multidistrict
Litigation Rule 14(d), which provides that "[t]he Panel is reluctant to order remand absent a suggestion of remand from
the transferee district court." The law firms opposed a remand because discovery was still incomplete and filed a countermotion under $ 1404(a) requesting the District of Arizona
to "transfer" the case to itself for trial. Judge Roll deferred
decision on these motions as well.

Opinion of the Court
In November 1994, Lexecon again asked the District
Court to request the Panel to remand the case to the Northern District of Illinois. Again the law firms objected and
requested a $ 1404 transfer, and Judge Roll deferred ruling
once more. On April 24, 1995, however, he granted summary judgment in favor of the law firms on all remaining
claims except one in defamation brought against Milberg,
and at the same time he dismissed Milberg's counterclaims.
884 F. Supp. 1388, 1397 (Ariz. 1995). Cotchett then made a
request for judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
54(b). Lexecon objected to the exercise of Rule 54(b) discretion, but did not contest the authority of the District Court
in Arizona to enter a final judgment in Cotchett's favor. On
June 7, 1995, the court granted respondent Cotchett's Rule
54(b) request.

In the meantime, the Arizona court had granted the law
firms' $ 1404(a) motions to assign the case to itself for trial,
and simultaneously had denied Lexecon's motions to request
the Panel to remand under $ 1407(a). Lexecon sought immediate review of these last two rulings by filing a petition for
mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. After argument, a majority of the Circuit panel, over the dissent of Judge Kozinski,
denied Lexecon's requests to vacate the self-assignment
order and require remand to the Northern District of Illinois. The Circuit so ruled even though the majority was
"not prepared to say that [Lexecon's] contentions lack merit"
and went so far as to note the conflict between "what appears
to be a clear statutory mandate [of $ 1407 and $ 1404]" and
Multidistrict Litigation Rule 14(b), which explicitly authorizes a transferee court to assign an action to itself for trial.
Lexecon v. Milberg Weiss, No. 95-70380 (CA9, July 21, 1995),

relying on its assumption that Lexecon would have an opportunity to obtain relief from the transfer order on direct appeal: "[t]he transfer order can be appealed immediately along

with other issues in the event the petitioners lose on the
merits [at trial]." Id., at p. 3.

Trial on the surviving defamation claim then went forward
in the District of Arizona, ending in judgment for Milberg,
from which Lexecon appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It again
appealed the denial of its motion for a suggestion that the
Panel remand the matter to the Northern District of Illinois,
and it challenged the dismissal of its claims for malicious
prosecution and abuse of process, and the entry of final judgment in favor of Cotchett. Lexecon took no exception to
the Arizona court's jurisdiction (as distinct from venue) and
pursued no claim of error in the conduct of the trial.

A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed, relying on
the Panel's Rule 14 and appellate and District Court decisions in support of the District Court's refusal to support
remand under $ 1407(a) and its decision to assign the case to
itself under $ 1404(a). 102 F. 3d, at 1532-1535. While the
majority indicated that permitting the transferee court to
assign a case to itself upon completion of its pretrial work
was not only consistent with the statutory language but conducive to efficiency, Judge Kozinski again dissented, relying
on the texts of $$ 1407(a) and 1404(a) and a presumption in
favor of a plaintiff 's choice of forum. We granted certiorari,
520 U. S. 1227 (1997), to decide whether $ 1407(a) does permit
a transferee court to entertain a $ 1404(a) transfer motion to
keep the case for trial.

A

In defending the Ninth Circuit majority, Milberg may
claim ostensible support from two quarters. First, the
Panel has itself sanctioned such assignments in a rule issued
in reliance on its rulemaking authority under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1407(f). The Panel's Rule 14(b) provides that "[e]ach
transferred action that has not been terminated in the transferee district court shall be remanded by the Panel to the

Opinion of the Court
transferor district for trial, unless ordered transferred bythe transferee judge to the transferee or other district under

28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a) or 28 U. S. C. $ 1406." Thus, out ofthe 39,228 cases transferred under $ 1407 and terminated as
of September 30, 1995, 279 of the 3,787 ultimately requiring trial were retained by the courts to which the Panelhad transferred them. Administrative Office of the United

States, L. Mecham, Judicial Business of the United StatesCourts: 1995 Report of the Director 32. Although the Panel's rule and the practice of self-assignment have not gonewithout challenge, see,

e. g., 15 C. Wright, A. Miller, &
E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3866, p. 619 (2ded. 1986) (hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Cooper); Trangsrud,

Rev. 779, 809 (1985); Levy, Complex Multidistrict Litigationand the Federal Courts, 40 Ford. L. Rev

. 41, 64-65 (1972),
federal courts have treated such transfers with approval, be-ginning with the Second Circuit's decision in

Pfizer, Inc. v.
Lord, 447 F. 2d 122, 124-125 (1971) (per curiam) (upholdingMDL Rule 15(d), the precursor to Rule 14(b)). See,

e. g., In
re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, 685 F. 2d 810, 820, andn. 7 (CA3 1982);

In re Air Crash Disaster at Detroit Metro.
Airport, 737 F. Supp. 391, 393-394 (ED Mich. 1989); In re
Viatron Computer Sys. Corp., 86 F. R. D. 431, 432 (Mass.1980).

The second source of ostensible authority for Milberg'sespousal of the self-assignment power here is a portion of
text of the multidistrict litigation statute itself:

"When civil actions involving one or more common
questions of fact are pending in different districts,
such actions may be transferred to any district for
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings." 28
U. S. C. $ 1407(a).

Although the statute limits a transferee court's authority to
the conduct of "coordinated or consolidated" proceedings and

34 LEXECON INC. v. MILBERG WEISS BERSHAD

HYNES & LERACH

Opinion of the Court

to those that are "pretrial," these limitations alone raise noobvious bar to a transferee's retention of a case under $ 1404.

If "consolidated" proceedings alone were authorized, therewould be an argument that self-assignment of one or some
cases out of many was not contemplated, but because the
proceedings need only be "coordinated," no such narrow limi-tation is apparent. While it is certainly true that the instant case was not "consolidated" with any other for thepurpose literally of litigating identical issues on common
evidence, it is fair to say that proceedings to resolve pretrialmatters were "coordinated" with the conduct of earlier cases
sharing the common core of the Lincoln Savings debacle, if
only by being brought before judges in a district where much
of the evidence was to be found and overlapping issues had
been considered. Judge Bilby's recusal following his decision to respond to Lexecon's Illinois pleadings may have limited the prospects for coordination, but it surely did not eliminate them. Hence, the requirement that a transferee court
conduct "coordinated or consolidated" proceedings did not
preclude the transferee Arizona court from ruling on a motion (like the $ 1404 request) that affects only one of the cases
before it.

Likewise, at first blush, the statutory limitation to "pretrial" proceedings suggests no reason that a $ 1407 transferor
court could not entertain a $ 1404(a) motion. Section 1404(a)
authorizes a district court to transfer a case in the interest
of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. See $ 1404(a). Such transfer requests are typically
resolved prior to discovery, see Wright, Miller, & Cooper

$ 3866, at 620, and thus are classic "pretrial" motions.

Beyond this point, however, the textual pointers reverse
direction, for $ 1407 not only authorizes the Panel to transfer
for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings, but obligates the Panel to remand any pending case to its originating court when, at the latest, those pretrial proceedings have
run their course.

"Each action so transferred shall be remanded by thepanel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferredunless it shall have been previously terminated."

$ 1407(a) (proviso without application here omitted).
The Panel's instruction comes in terms of the mandatory"shall," which normally creates an obligation impervious to

judicial discretion. Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U. S. 482, 485(1947). In the absence of any indication that there might be
circumstances in which a transferred case would be neither"terminated" nor subject to the remand obligation, then, the
statutory instruction stands flatly at odds with reading thephrase "coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings" so
broadly as to reach its literal limits, allowing a transfereecourt's self-assignment to trump the provision imposing the
Panel's remand duty. If we do our job of reading the statutewhole, we have to give effect to this plain command, see

Es-tate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 476

(1992), even if doing that will reverse the longstanding prac-tice under the statute and the rule, see Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S. 291, 300 (1995) (" `Age is noantidote to clear inconsistency with a statute' " (quoting
Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 122 (1994))).As the Ninth Circuit panel majority saw it, however, the
inconsistency between an expansive view of "coordinated orconsolidated pretrial" proceedings and the uncompromising
terms of the Panel's remand obligation disappeared asmerely an apparent conflict, not a real one. The "focus" of

$ 1407 was said to be constituting the Panel and defining itsauthority, not circumscribing the powers of district courts
under $ 1404(a). 102 F. 3d, at 1533. Milberg presses thispoint in observing that $ 1407(a) does not, indeed, even apply
to transferee courts, being concerned solely with the Panel'sduties, whereas $ 1407(b), addressed to the transferee courts,
says nothing about the Panel's obligation to remand. Butthis analysis fails to persuade, for the very reason that it

Opinion of the Court

rejects that central tenet of interpretation, that a statute isto be considered in all its parts when construing any one of

them. To emphasize that $ 1407(b) says nothing about thePanel's obligation when addressing a transferee court's powers is simply to ignore the necessary consequence of self-assignment by a transferee court: it conclusively thwarts
the Panel's capacity to obey the unconditional command of$ 1407(a).

A like use of blinders underlies the Circuit majority's conclusion that the Panel was not even authorized to remandthe case under its Rule 14(c), the terms of which condition

the remand responsibility on a suggestion of the transferee
court, a motion filed directly with the Panel, or the Panel's
sua sponte decision to remand. None of these conditions
was fulfilled, according to the Court of Appeals, which partic-ularly faulted Lexecon for failing to file a remand motion

directly with the Panel, as distinct from the transfereecourt.

1 This analysis, too, is unpersuasive; it just ignores

the fact that the statute places an obligation on the Panel to

1 The Ninth Circuit stopped short of expressly inferring a waiver from
Lexecon's failure to file a motion for remand directly with the Panel, and
any inference of waiver would surely have been unsound. Although the
Panel's Rule 14(c)(i) does authorize a party to file such a motion, Rule 14(d)
comes close to saying that only under extraordinary circumstances will
such a motion be granted without a suggestion of remand by the transferee court. (The Rule reads: "The Panel is reluctant to order remand
absent a suggestion of remand from the transferee district court.")
Therefore, even if a party may waive the $ 1407 remand requirement by
failing to request remand from the transferor court, see 28 U. S. C.

$ 1406(b), Rule 14(d) precludes an inference of waiver from mere failure to
request remand from the Panel.

In this case, moreover, one can say categorically that a motion before
the Panel would have failed; the transferee court denied Lexecon's motion
for a remand suggestion simultaneously with an order assigning the case
to itself for trial, thus exercising the authority that the Panel's Rule 14(b)
expressly purported to recognize. Under the Panel's own rules, in sum,
Lexecon never had a chance to waive a thing.

Opinion of the Court
remand no later than the conclusion of pretrial proceedingsin the transferee court, and no exercise in rulemaking can

read that obligation out of the statute. See 28 U. S. C.$ 1407(f) (express requirement that rules be consistent with
statute). B

Milberg proffers two further arguments for overlookingthe tension between a broad reading of a court's pretrial authority and the Panel's remand obligation. First, it relieson a subtle reading of the provision of $ 1407(a) limiting the
Panel's remand obligation to cases not "previously termi-nated" during the pretrial period. To be sure, this exception to the Panel's remand obligation indicates that the Panelis not meant to issue ceremonial remand orders in cases already concluded by summary judgment, say, or dismissal.But according to Milberg, the imperative to remand is also
inapplicable to cases self-assigned under $ 1404, because theself-assignment "terminates" the case insofar as its venue
depends on $ 1407. When the $ 1407 character of the actiondisappears, Milberg argues, the strictures of $ 1407 fall away
as well, relieving the Panel of any further duty in the case.The trouble with this creative argument, though, is that the
statute manifests no such subtlety. Section 1407(a) speaksnot in terms of imbuing transferred actions with some new
and distinctive venue character, but simply in terms of "civilactions" or "actions." It says that such an action, not its
acquired personality, must be terminated before the Panel
is excused from ordering remand. The language is straight-forward, and with a straightforward application ready to

hand, statutory interpretation has no business getting
metaphysical.Second, Milberg tries to draw an inference in its favor

from the one subsection of $ 1407 that does authorize thePanel to transfer a case for trial as well as pretrial proceedings. Subsection (h) provides that,

38 LEXECON INC. v. MILBERG WEISS BERSHAD

HYNES & LERACH

Opinion of the Court

"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of section 1404 or sub-section (f) of this section, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation may consolidate and transfer with orwithout the consent of the parties, for both pretrial purposes and for trial, any action brought under section 4Cof the Clayton Act."

Milberg fastens on the introductory language explicitly over-riding the "provisions of section 1404 or subsection (f),"
which would otherwise, respectively, limit a district court totransferring a case "to any other district or division where
it might have been brought," $ 1404(a), and limit the Panel toprescribing rules "not inconsistent with Acts of Congress,"

$ 1407(f). On Milberg 's reasoning, these overrides are re-quired because the cited provisions would otherwise conflict
with the remainder of subsection (h) authorizing the Panelto order trial of certain Clayton Act cases in the transferee
court. The argument then runs that since there is no over-ride of subsection (a) of $ 1407, subsection (a) must be consistent with a transfer for trial as well as pretrial matters.This reasoning is fallacious, however. Subsections (a) and
(h) are independent sources of transfer authority in thePanel; each is apparently written to stand on its own feet.
Subsection (h) need not exclude the application of subsection(a), because nothing in (a) would by its terms limit any provision of (h).Subsection (h) is not merely valueless to Milberg, however;
it is ammunition for Lexecon. For the one point that sub-section (h) does demonstrate is that Congress knew how to
distinguish between trial assignments and pretrial proceed-ings in cases subject to $ 1407. Although the enactment of
subsection (a), Act of Apr. 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 109, precededthe enactment of subsection (h), Act of Sept. 30, 1976, $ 303,
90 Stat. 1394, 1396, the fact that the later section dis-tinguishes trial assignments from pretrial proceedings
generally is certainly some confirmation for our conclu-sion, on independent grounds, that the subjects of pretrial

Opinion of the Court
proceedings in subsections (a) and (b) do not include selfassignment orders.2

C

There is, finally, nothing left of Milberg's position beyond
an appeal to legislative history, some of which turns out to
ignore the question before us, and some of which may support Lexecon. Milberg cites a House Report on the bill that
became $ 1407, which addresses the question of trial transfer
in multidistrict litigation cases by saying that, "[o]f course,
28 U. S. C. 1404, providing for changes of venue generally, is
available in those instances where transfer of a case for all
purposes is desirable." H. R. Rep. No. 1130, 90th Cong., 2d
Sess., p. 4 (1968) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), cited in Brief for
Respondents Milberg et al. 25. But the question is not
whether a change of venue may be ordered in a case consolidated under $ 1407(a); on any view of $ 1407(a), if an order
may be made under $ 1404(a),3 it may be made after remand
of the case to the originating district court. The relevant
question for our purposes is whether a transferee court, and
not a transferor court, may grant such a motion, and on this
point, the language cited by Milberg provides no guidance.

If it has anything to say to us here, the legislative history
tends to confirm that self-assignment is beyond the scope of
the transferee court's authority. The same House Report
that spoke of the continued vitality of $ 1404 in $ 1407 cases
also said this:

2 It is well to note the limitations of a related argument. It may be
tempting to say that the incompatibility of a self-assignment under

$ 1404(a) with the Panel's mandate is confirmed by the authority of a transferor court to assign a case to a $ 1407(a) transferee district for trial if that
would be appropriate following pretrial proceedings under $ 1407(a). But
there is one circumstance in which a transferor court would be unable to
do that. As noted, transfers under $ 1407 are not limited by general
venue statutes; those under $ 1404 are.

HYNES & LERACH

Opinion of the Court

"The proposed statute affects only the pretrial stages inmultidistrict litigation. It would not affect the place of

trial in any case or exclude the possibility of transferunder other Federal statutes.

. . . . .
"The subsection requires that transferred cases be re-manded to the originating district at the close of coordinated pretrial proceedings. The bill does not, there-fore, include the trial of cases in the consolidated
proceedings." H. R. Rep., at 3-4.
The comments of the bill's sponsors further suggest that

application of $ 1407 (before the addition of subsection (h))would not affect the place of trial. See,

e. g., Multidistrict
Litigation: Hearings on S. 3815 and S. 159 before the Sub-committee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the

Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2,p. 110 (1967) (Sen. Tydings) ("[W]hen the deposition and discovery is completed, then the original litigation is remandedto the transferor district for the trial"). Both the House and
the Senate Reports stated that Congress would have to
amend the statute if it determined that multidistrict litiga-tion cases should be consolidated for trial. S. Rep. No. 454,

90th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5 (1967).

D
In sum, none of the arguments raised can unsettle the
straightforward language imposing the Panel's responsibil-ity to remand, which bars recognizing any self-assignment

power in a transferee court and consequently entails the in-validity of the Panel's Rule 14(b). See 28 U. S. C. $ 1407(f).
Milberg may or may not be correct that permitting trans-feree courts to make self-assignments would be more desirable than preserving a plaintiff 's choice of venue (to the
degree that $ 1407(a) does so), but the proper venue for resolving that issue remains the floor of Congress. See Am523US1 Unit: $U31 [04-29-00 19:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

III
The remaining question goes to the remedy, which Milbergargues may be omitted under the harmless-error doctrine.

Milberg posits a distinction between a first category of caseserroneously litigated in a district in which (absent waiver)
venue may never be laid under the governing statute, see
Olberding v. Illinois Central R. Co., 346 U. S. 338, 340 (1953),and a second category, in which the plaintiff might originally

have chosen to litigate in the trial forum to which it wasunwillingly and erroneously carried, as by a transfer under

$ 1404. In the first, reversal is necessary; in the second, af-firmance is possible if no independent and substantial right
was violated in a trial whose venue was determined by adiscretionary decision. Since Lexecon could have brought
suit in the Arizona district consistently with the generalvenue requirements of 28 U. S. C. $ 1391, and since the transfer for trial was made on the authority of $ 1404(a), Milbergargues, this case falls within the second category and should
escape reversal because none of Lexecon's substantial rightswas prejudicially affected, see $ 2111. Assuming the distinction may be drawn, however, we think this case bearscloser analogy to those in the first category, in which reversal
with new trial is required because venue is precluded by thegoverning statute.

Milberg's argument assumes the only kind of statute enti-tled to respect in accordance with its uncompromising terms
is a statute that categorically limits a plaintiff 's initial choiceof forum. But there is no apparent reason why courts

4 Because we find that the statutory language of $ 1407 precludes a
transferee court from granting any $ 1404(a) motion, we have no need to
address the question whether $ 1404(a) permits self-transfer given that the
statute explicitly provides for transfer only "to any other district." 28
U. S. C. $ 1404(a).

Opinion of the Court

should not be equally bound by a venue statute that just ascategorically limits the authority of courts (and special panels) to override a plaintiff 's choice. If the former statutecreates interests too substantial to be denied without a remedy, the latter statute ought to be recognized as creatinginterests equally substantial. In each instance the substantiality of the protected interest is attested by a congressionaljudgment that in the circumstances described in the statute
no discretion is to be left to a court faced with an objectionto a statutory violation. To render relief discretionary in
either instance would be to allow uncorrected defiance of acategorical congressional judgment to become its own justification. Accordingly, just as we agree with Milberg thatthe strict limitation on venue under, say, $ 1391(a) (diversity
action "may . . . be brought only . . .") is sufficient to establishthe substantial character of any violation, Brief for Respondents Milberg et al. 43 (citing Olberding, supra), the equallystrict remand requirement contained in $ 1407 should suffice
to establish the substantial significance of any denial of aplaintiff 's right to a remand once the pretrial stage has
been completed.Nor is Milberg correct that our recent decision in

Caterpil-lar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 (1996), is to the contrary.

5 In its brief to this Court, Milberg suggests that any decision rejecting
multidistrict litigation courts' practice of ruling on $ 1404 transfer motions
should be applied only prospectively under Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404
U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971). Because this argument was not presented below,
see Brief for Milberg Defendants in No. 95-16403 et al. (CA9), or to this
Court when Milberg opposed petitioners' petition for certiorari, see Brief
in Opposition for Respondents Milberg et al., it is unnecessary for us to
consider it here.

Milberg's brief also argues that petitioners are not entitled to relief
because the only claim that survived for trial should have been dismissed
during pretrial proceedings. We do not address the propriety of the District Court's decision to allow this claim to go forward; the issue falls
outside the question on which we granted certiorari. See this Court's
Rule 14.1(a) ("Only the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court").

Opinion of the Court
that case, which got no new trial, the jurisdictional defect (alack of complete diversity) had been cured by subsequent

events. While the statutory error (failure to comply withthe $ 1441(a) requirement that the case be fit for federal adjudication when the removal petition is filed) "remained in theunerasable history of the case,"

id., at 73, in the sense thatit had not been cured within the statutory period, it had

otherwise been cured by the time judgment was entered.The instant case is different from that one, inasmuch as there
was no continuing defiance of the congressional condition inCaterpillar, but merely an untimely compliance. It was on
this understanding that we held that considerations of "fi-nality, efficiency, and economy" trumped the error,

id., at 75.After Caterpillar, therefore, since removal is permissible

only where original jurisdiction exists at the time of removalor at the time of the entry of final judgment, the condition
contained in the removal statute retains significance. Butthe $ 1407(a) mandate would lose all meaning if a party who
continuously objected to an uncorrected categorical violationof the mandate could obtain no relief at the end of the day.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion. So ordered.

6 Although Cotchett's request for an order of dismissal under Rule 54(b)
was not granted until after the Arizona court had assigned the case to
itself for trial, there is no reason to reconsider that dismissal order. It
was perfectly proper as a pretrial order and, for that matter, was merely
the formal reflection of the Arizona court's decision on the merits of the
claims that had been resolved prior to that court's decision on the $ 1404
transfer.

BOGAN et al. v. SCOTT-HARRIS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 96-1569. Argued December 3, 1997--Decided March 3, 1998
Respondent Scott-Harris filed suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against the city

of Fall River, Massachusetts, petitioners Bogan (the city's mayor) and
Roderick (the vice president of the city council), and other officials, alleging that the elimination of the city department in which Scott-Harris
was the sole employee was motivated by racial animus and a desire to
retaliate against her for exercising her First Amendment rights in filing
a complaint against another city employee. The District Court twice
denied petitioners' motions to dismiss on the ground of absolute immunity from suit. The jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants
on the racial discrimination charge, but found the city and petitioners
liable on respondent's First Amendment claim. The First Circuit set
aside the verdict against the city but affirmed the judgments against
Roderick and Bogan. Although concluding that petitioners have absolute immunity from civil liability for damages arising out of their performance of legitimate legislative activities, that court held that their
conduct in introducing, voting for, and signing the ordinance that eliminated respondent's office was not "legislative." Relying on the jury's
finding that respondent's constitutionally sheltered speech was a substantial or motivating factor underlying petitioners' conduct, the court
reasoned that the conduct was administrative, rather than legislative,
because Roderick and Bogan relied on facts relating to a particular individual, respondent, in the decisionmaking calculus.

Held:

1. Local legislators are entitled to the same absolute immunity from
civil liability under $ 1983 for their legislative activities as has long been
accorded to federal, state, and regional legislators. See, e. g., Tenney v.
Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 372, 372-376; Amy v. Supervisors, 11 Wall.
136, 138, distinguished. Such immunity finds pervasive support not
only in common-law cases and older treatises, but also in reason. See
Tenney, 341 U. S., at 376. The rationales for according absolute immunity to federal, state, and regional legislators apply with equal force to
local legislators. Regardless of the level of government, the exercise of
legislative discretion should not be inhibited by judicial interference or
distorted by the fear of personal liability. See, e. g., id., at 377. Furthermore, the time and energy required to defend against a lawsuit are

45Cite as: 523 U. S. 44 (1998)
Syllabus
of particular concern at the local level, where the part-time citizenlegislator remains commonplace. See ibid. And the threat of liability
may significantly deter service in local government, where prestige and
pecuniary rewards may pale in comparison to the threat of civil liability. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 827 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). Moreover, certain deterrents to legislative abuse may be greater
at the local level than at other levels of government, including the availability of municipal liability for constitutional violations, e. g., Lake
Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S.
391, 405, n. 29, and the ultimate check on legislative abuse, the electoral process, cf. Tenney, supra, at 378. Indeed, any argument that
the rationale for absolute immunity does not extend to local legislators
is implicitly foreclosed by Lake Country Estates, supra, at 401-402.
Pp. 48-54.

2. Petitioners' actions in this case were protected by absolute immunity, which attaches to all acts taken "in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity." Tenney, 341 U. S., at 376. The First Circuit erroneously
relied on petitioners' subjective intent in resolving whether their acts
so qualified. Whether an act is legislative turns on the nature of the
act itself, rather than on the motive or intent of the official performing
it. Id., at 370, 377. This Court has little trouble concluding that,
stripped of all considerations of intent and motive, petitioners' actions
were legislative. Most evidently, petitioner Roderick's acts of voting
for the ordinance eliminating respondent's office were, in form, quintessentially legislative. Petitioner Bogan's introduction of a budget that
proposed the elimination of city jobs and his signing the ordinance into
law also were formally legislative, even though he was an executive
official. Officials outside the legislative branch are entitled to legislative immunity when they perform legislative functions, see Supreme
Court of Va. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 446 U. S. 719,
731-334; Bogan's actions were legislative because they were integral
steps in the legislative process. Cf., e. g., Edwards v. United States, 286
U. S. 482, 490. Furthermore, this particular ordinance, in substance,
bore all the hallmarks of traditional legislation: It reflected a discretionary, policymaking decision implicating the city's budgetary priorities
and its services to constituents; it involved the termination of a position,
which, unlike the hiring or firing of a particular employee, may have
prospective implications that reach well beyond the particular occupant
of the office; and, in eliminating respondent's office, it governed in a field
where legislators traditionally have power to act, Tenney, supra, at 379.

Harvey A. Schwartz argued the cause for respondent.With him on the brief were Siobhan M. Sweeney and Eric
Schnapper.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
It is well established that federal, state, and regional legis-lators are entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability

for their legislative activities. In this case, petitionersargue that they, as local officials performing legislative functions, are entitled to the same protection. They furtherargue that their acts of introducing, voting for, and signing
an ordinance eliminating the government office held by re-spondent constituted legislative activities. We agree on
both counts and therefore reverse the judgment below.

I
Respondent Janet Scott-Harris was administrator of theDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for the

city of Fall River, Massachusetts, from 1987 to 1991. In1990, respondent received a complaint that Dorothy Biltcliffe, an employee serving temporarily under her supervi-sion, had made repeated racial and ethnic slurs about her
colleagues. After respondent prepared termination chargesagainst Biltcliffe, Biltcliffe used her political connections to
press her case with several state and local officials, including

Opinion of the Court
petitioner Marilyn Roderick, the vice president of the Fall
River City Council. The city council held a hearing on the
charges against Biltcliffe and ultimately accepted a settlement proposal under which Biltcliffe would be suspended
without pay for 60 days. Petitioner Daniel Bogan, the
mayor of Fall River, thereafter substantially reduced the
punishment.

While the charges against Biltcliffe were pending, Mayor
Bogan prepared his budget proposal for the 1992 fiscal year.
Anticipating a 5 to 10 percent reduction in state aid, Bogan
proposed freezing the salaries of all municipal employees and
eliminating 135 city positions. As part of this package,
Bogan called for the elimination of DHHS, of which respondent was the sole employee. The city council ordinance
committee, which was chaired by Roderick, approved an
ordinance eliminating DHHS. The city council thereafter
adopted the ordinance by a vote of 6 to 2, with petitioner
Roderick among those voting in favor. Bogan signed the
ordinance into law.

Respondent then filed suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, against the city, Bogan, Roderick, and several
other city officials. She alleged that the elimination of her
position was motivated by racial animus and a desire to retaliate against her for exercising her First Amendment
rights in filing the complaint against Biltcliffe. The District
Court denied Bogan's and Roderick's motions to dismiss
on the ground of legislative immunity, and the case proceeded to trial. Scott-Harris v. City of Fall River, et al.,

The jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants on
the racial discrimination charge, but found the city, Bogan,
and Roderick liable on respondent's First Amendment claim,
concluding that respondent's constitutionally protected
speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the elimina523us1$32N 12-18-98 18:44:13 PAGES OPINPGT

tion of her position.1 On a motion for judgment notwith-standing the verdict, the District Court again denied Bogan's

and Roderick's claims of absolute legislative immunity, rea-soning that "the ordinance amendment passed by the city
council was an individually-targeted administrative act,rather than a neutral, legislative elimination of a position
which incidentally resulted in the termination of plaintiff."
Id., at 20.The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

set aside the verdict against the city but affirmed the judg-ments against Roderick and Bogan. Scott-Harris v. Fall
River, 134 F. 3d 427 (1997).2 Although the court concludedthat petitioners have "absolute immunity from civil liability
for damages arising out of their performance of legitimatelegislative activities," id., at 440, it held that their challenged
conduct was not "legislative," id., at 441. Relying on thejury's finding that "constitutionally sheltered speech was a
substantial or motivating factor" underlying petitioners' con-duct, the court reasoned that the conduct was administrative, rather than legislative, because Roderick and Bogan"relied on facts relating to a particular individual [respondent] in the decisionmaking calculus."

District Court directed a verdict in favor of defendant Robert Connors,
the Fall River City Administrator. Only the city, Bogan, and Roderick
were appellants in the Court of Appeals, and only the latter two are petitioners in this Court.

2 The court held that the city was not liable because the jury could reasonably infer unlawful intent only as to two of the city council members,
and municipal liability could not rest "on so frail a foundation." 134 F. 3d,
at 440.

in the Parliamentary struggles of the Sixteenth and Seven-teenth Centuries" and was "taken as a matter of course by

those who severed the Colonies from the Crown and foundedour Nation." Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 372
(1951). The Federal Constitution, the Constitutions of manyof the newly independent States, and the common law thus
protected legislators from liability for their legislative activi-ties. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 6;

Tenney, supra, at 372-375.Recognizing this venerable tradition, we have held that

state and regional legislators are entitled to absolute immu-nity from liability under $ 1983 for their legislative activities.
See Tenney, supra (state legislators); Lake Country Estates,
Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391 (1979)(regional legislators);

3 see also Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103

U. S. 168, 202-204 (1881) (interpreting the federal Speechand Debate Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 6, to provide similar

immunity to Members of Congress). We explained that leg-islators were entitled to absolute immunity from suit at common law and that Congress did not intend the general lan-guage of $ 1983 to "impinge on a tradition so well grounded
in history and reason." Tenney, supra, at 376. Because thecommon law accorded local legislators the same absolute immunity it accorded legislators at other levels of government,and because the rationales for such immunity are fully applicable to local legislators, we now hold that local legislatorsare likewise absolutely immune from suit under $ 1983 for
their legislative activities.The common law at the time $ 1983 was enacted deemed
local legislators to be absolutely immune from suit for theirlegislative activities. New York's highest court, for example, held that municipal aldermen were immune from suit for

their discretionary decisions. Wilson v. New York, 1 Denio595 (1845). The court explained that when a local legislator

exercises discretionary powers, he "is exempt from all re-sponsibility by action for the motives which influence him,
and the manner in which such duties are performed. If corrupt, he may be impeached or indicted, but the law will nottolerate an action to redress the individual wrong which may

have been done." Id., at 599.4 These principles, accordingto the court, were "too familiar and well settled to require
illustration or authority." Id., at 599-600.Shortly after $ 1983 was enacted, the Mississippi Supreme
Court reached a similar conclusion, holding that town alder-men could not be held liable under state law for their role in
the adoption of an allegedly unlawful ordinance. Jones v.
Loving, 55 Miss. 109, 30 Am. Rep. 508 (1877). The court
explained that "[i]t certainly cannot be argued that the motives of the individual members of a legislative assembly, in
voting for a particular law, can be inquired into, and its supporters be made personally liable, upon an allegation that
they acted maliciously towards the person aggrieved by the
passage of the law." Id., at 111, 30 Am. Rep., at 509. The
court thus concluded that "[w]henever the officers of a municipal corporation are vested with legislative powers, they hold
and exercise them for the public good, and are clothed with

4 The court distinguished "discretionary" duties, which were protected
absolutely, and "ministerial" duties, which were not. Although the court
described the former as "judicial" in nature, it was merely using the term
broadly to encompass the "discretionary" acts of officials. See 1 Denio, at
599 ("[I]f his powers are discretionary, to be exerted or withheld, according to his own view of what is necessary and proper, they are in their
nature judicial"). The legislators' actions in Wilson were unquestionably
legislative in both form and substance. Thus, Wilson was widely, and
correctly, cited as a leading case regarding legislative immunity. See,
e. g., T. Cooley, Law of Torts 377, n. 1 (1880) (hereinafter Cooley); F.
Mechem, Law of Public Offices and Officers $ 644, p. 431, n. 1 (1890) (hereinafter Mechem); M. Throop, Law Relating to Public Officers $ 709, p. 671,
n. 1 (1892).

Opinion of the Court
all the immunities of government, and are exempt from allliability for their mistaken use."

Ibid.
Treatises of that era confirm that this was the pervasiveview. A leading treatise on municipal corporations explained that "[w]here the officers of a municipal corporation
are invested with legislative powers, they are exempt from
individual liability for the passage of any ordinance within
their authority, and their motives in reference thereto willnot be inquired into." 1 J. Dillon, Law of Municipal Corporations $ 313, pp. 326-327 (3d ed. 1881) (emphasis in original).Thomas Cooley likewise noted in his influential treatise on
the law of torts that the "rightful exemption" of legislators
from liability was "very plain" and applied to members of
"inferior legislative bodies, such as boards of supervisors,
county commissioners, city councils, and the like." Cooley
376; see also J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Non-Contract
Law $ 744 (1889) (noting that municipal legislators were immune for their legislative functions); Mechem $$ 644-646
(same); Throop, supra n. 4, $ 709, at 671 (same).

Even the authorities cited by respondent are consistent
with the view that local legislators were absolutely immune
for their legislative, as distinct from ministerial, duties. In
the few cases in which liability did attach, the courts emphasized that the defendant officials lacked discretion, and the
duties were thus ministerial. See, e. g., Morris v. The People, 3 Denio 381, 395 (N. Y. 1846) (noting that the duty was
"of a ministerial character only"); Caswell v. Allen, 7 Johns.
63, 68 (N. Y. 1810) (holding supervisors liable because the
act was "mandatory" and "[n]o discretion appear[ed] to [have
been] given to the supervisors"). Respondent's heavy reliance on our decision in Amy v. Supervisors, 11 Wall. 136
(1871), is misguided for this very reason. In that case, we
held that local legislators could be held liable for violating a
court order to levy a tax sufficient to pay a judgment, but
only because the court order had created a ministerial duty.
Id., at 138 ("The rule is well settled, that where the law re523us1$32N 12-18-98 18:44:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quires absolutely a ministerial act to be done by a public
officer, and he neglects or refuses to do such act, he may be
compelled to respond in damages to the extent of the injury
arising from his conduct"). The treatises cited by respondent confirm that this distinction between legislative and ministerial duties was dispositive of the right to absolute immunity. See, e. g., Cooley 377 (stating that local legislators may
be held liable only for their "ministerial" duties); Mechem

$ 647 (same).

Absolute immunity for local legislators under $ 1983 finds
support not only in history, but also in reason. See Tenney
v. Brandhove, 341 U. S., at 376 (stating that Congress did not
intend for $ 1983 to "impinge on a tradition so well grounded
in history and reason"). The rationales for according absolute immunity to federal, state, and regional legislators apply
with equal force to local legislators. Regardless of the level
of government, the exercise of legislative discretion should
not be inhibited by judicial interference or distorted by the
fear of personal liability. See Spallone v. United States, 493
U. S. 265, 279 (1990) (noting, in the context of addressing
local legislative action, that "any restriction on a legislator's
freedom undermines the `public good' by interfering with the
rights of the people to representation in the democratic process"); see also Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S., at 201-204
(federal legislators); Tenney, supra, at 377 (state legislators);
Lake Country Estates, 440 U. S., at 405 (regional legislators).
Furthermore, the time and energy required to defend
against a lawsuit are of particular concern at the local level,
where the part-time citizen-legislator remains commonplace.
See Tenney, supra, at 377 (citing "the cost and inconvenience
and distractions of a trial"). And the threat of liability may
significantly deter service in local government, where prestige and pecuniary rewards may pale in comparison to the
threat of civil liability. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.
800, 816 (1982).

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, certain deterrents to legislative abuse may begreater at the local level than at other levels of government.

Municipalities themselves can be held liable for constitu-tional violations, whereas States and the Federal Government are often protected by sovereign immunity. Lake
Country Estates, supra, at 405, n. 29 (citing Monell v. NewYork City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978)). And,

of course, the ultimate check on legislative abuse--the elec-toral process--applies with equal force at the local level,
where legislators are often more closely responsible to theelectorate. Cf.

Tenney, supra, at 378 (stating that "[s]elfdiscipline and the voters must be the ultimate reliance for
discouraging or correcting such abuses").Any argument that the rationale for absolute immunity

does not extend to local legislators is implicitly foreclosed byour opinion in

Lake Country Estates. There, we held that
members of an interstate regional planning agency wereentitled to absolute legislative immunity. Bereft of any historical antecedent to the regional agency, we relied almostexclusively on

Tenney's description of the purposes of legislative immunity and the importance of such immunity in advancing the "public good." Although we expressly notedthat local legislators were not at issue in that case, see

Lake
Country Estates, 440 U. S., at 404, n. 26, we considered theregional legislators at issue to be the functional equivalents

of local legislators, noting that the regional agency was"comparable to a county or municipality" and that the function of the regional agency, regulation of land use, was "tra-ditionally a function performed by local governments."

Id.,
at 401-402.5 Thus, we now make explicit what was implicit

5 It is thus not surprising that several Members of this Court have recognized that the rationale of Lake Country Estates essentially settled the
question of immunity for local legislators. See Owen v. Independence, 445
U. S. 622, 664, n. 6 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting); Lake Country Estates,
Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 407-408 (1979)

54 BOGAN v. SCOTT-HARRIS

Opinion of the Court
in our precedents: Local legislators are entitled to absoluteimmunity from $ 1983 liability for their legislative activities.

III
Absolute legislative immunity attaches to all actions taken"in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity." Tenney,

supra, at 376. The Court of Appeals held that petitioners'conduct in this case was not legislative because their actions
were specifically targeted at respondent. Relying on thejury's finding that respondent's constitutionally protected
speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind peti-tioners' conduct, the court concluded that petitioners necessarily "relied on facts relating to a particular individual" and"devised an ordinance that targeted [respondent] and treated
her differently from other managers employed by the City."134 F. 3d, at 441. Although the Court of Appeals did not
suggest that intent or motive can overcome an immunity de-fense for activities that are, in fact, legislative, the court
erroneously relied on petitioners' subjective intent in resolv-ing the logically prior question of whether their acts were
legislative.Whether an act is legislative turns on the nature of the
act, rather than on the motive or intent of the official per-forming it. The privilege of absolute immunity "would be
of little value if [legislators] could be subjected to the costand inconvenience and distractions of a trial upon a conclusion of the pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment againstthem based upon a jury's speculation as to motives."

TenU. S. 265, 278 (1990) (explaining that the same considerations underlying
Tenney and Lake Country Estates applied to contempt sanctions against
local legislators). In fact, the argument for absolute immunity for local
legislators may be stronger than for the regional legislators in Lake Country Estates, because immunity was historically granted to local legislators
and because the legislators in Lake Country Estates were unelected and
thus less directly accountable to the public. See Lake Country Estates,
supra, at 407 (Marshall, J., dissenting in part).

Opinion of the Court
ney, 341 U. S., at 377 (internal quotation marks omitted).Furthermore, it simply is "not consonant with our scheme of

government for a court to inquire into the motives of legisla-tors."

Ibid. We therefore held that the defendant in Tenney had acted in a legislative capacity even though he allegedly singled out the plaintiff for investigation in order "tointimidate and silence plaintiff and deter and prevent him

from effectively exercising his constitutional rights." Id., at371 (internal quotation marks omitted).

This leaves us with the question whether, stripped of allconsiderations of intent and motive, petitioners' actions were
legislative. We have little trouble concluding that they
were. Most evidently, petitioner Roderick's acts of voting
for an ordinance were, in form, quintessentially legislative.
Petitioner Bogan's introduction of a budget and signing into
law an ordinance also were formally legislative, even though
he was an executive official. We have recognized that officials outside the legislative branch are entitled to legislative
immunity when they perform legislative functions, see Supreme Court of Va. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 446 U. S. 719, 731-734 (1980); Bogan's actions were legislative because they were integral steps in the legislative
process. Cf. Edwards v. United States, 286 U. S. 482, 490
(1932) (noting "the legislative character of the President's
function in approving or disapproving bills"); Smiley v.
Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 372-373 (1932) (recognizing that a Governor's signing or vetoing of a bill constitutes part of the
legislative process).

Respondent, however, asks us to look beyond petitioners'
formal actions to consider whether the ordinance was legislative in substance. We need not determine whether the formally legislative character of petitioners' actions is alone sufficient to entitle petitioners to legislative immunity, because
here the ordinance, in substance, bore all the hallmarks of
traditional legislation. The ordinance reflected a discretionary, policymaking decision implicating the budgetary pri523us1$32N 12-18-98 18:44:13 PAGES OPINPGT

orities of the city and the services the city provides to itsconstituents. Moreover, it involved the termination of a

position, which, unlike the hiring or firing of a particular em-ployee, may have prospective implications that reach well
beyond the particular occupant of the office. And the citycouncil, in eliminating DHHS, certainly governed "in a field
where legislators traditionally have power to act." Tenney,
supra, at 379. Thus, petitioners' activities were undoubt-edly legislative.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

6 Because of our conclusion that petitioners are entitled to absolute legislative immunity, we need not address the third question on which we
granted certiorari: whether petitioners proximately caused an injury cognizable under $ 1983.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 97-115. Argued January 21, 1998--Decided March 3, 1998
When petitioner Kawaauhau sought treatment for her injured foot, respondent Dr. Geiger examined and hospitalized her to attend to the risk
of infection. Although Geiger knew that intravenous penicillin would
have been more effective, he prescribed oral penicillin, explaining in his
testimony that he understood his patient wished to minimize treatment
costs. Geiger then departed on a business trip, leaving Kawaauhau in
the care of other physicians, who decided she should be transferred to
an infectious disease specialist. When Geiger returned, he canceled the
transfer and discontinued all antibiotics because he believed the infection had subsided. Kawaauhau's condition deteriorated, requiring amputation of her leg below the knee. After trial in the malpractice suit
brought by Kawaauhau and her husband, the jury found Geiger liable
and awarded the Kawaauhaus approximately $355,000 in damages.
Geiger, who carried no malpractice insurance, moved to Missouri, where
his wages were garnished by the Kawaauhaus. Geiger then petitioned
for bankruptcy. The Kawaauhaus requested the Bankruptcy Court to
hold the malpractice judgment nondischargeable under 11 U. S. C.

$ 523(a)(6), which provides that a "discharge [in bankruptcy] . . . does
not discharge an individual debtor from any debt . . . for willful and
malicious injury . . . to another." Concluding that Geiger's treatment
fell far below the appropriate standard of care and therefore ranked as
"willful and malicious," that court held the debt nondischargeable. The
District Court affirmed, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that

$ 523(a)(6)'s exemption from discharge is confined to debts for an intentional tort, so that a debt for malpractice remains dischargeable because
it is based on negligent or reckless conduct.

Held: Because a debt arising from a medical malpractice judgment attributable to negligent or reckless conduct does not fall within the

$ 523(a)(6) exception, the debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy. Section 523(a)(6)'s words strongly support the Eighth Circuit's reading that
only acts done with the actual intent to cause injury fall within the
exception's scope. The section's word "willful" modifies the word "injury," indicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury, not merely, as the Kawaauhaus urge, a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury. Had Congress meant to exempt debts

Syllabus
resulting from unintentionally inflicted injuries, it might have described
instead "willful acts that cause injury" or selected an additional word
or words, i. e., "reckless" or "negligent," to modify "injury." Moreover,

$ 523(a)(6)'s formulation triggers in the lawyer's mind the category "intentional torts," which generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act, not simply the act itself. The Kawaauhaus' more
encompassing interpretation could place within the excepted category a
wide range of situations in which an act is intentional, but injury is
unintended, i. e., neither desired nor in fact anticipated by the debtor.
A construction so broad would be incompatible with the well-known
guide that exceptions to discharge should be confined to those plainly
expressed, and would render superfluous the exemptions from discharge
set forth in $$ 523(a)(9) and 523(a)(12). The Kawaauhaus rely on Tinker
v. Colwell, 193 U. S. 473, which held that a damages award for the tort
of "criminal conversation" survived bankruptcy under the 1898 Bankruptcy Act's exception from discharge for judgments in civil actions for
" `willful and malicious injuries.' " The Tinker opinion repeatedly recognized that at common law the tort in question ranked as trespass vi
et armis, akin to a master's " `action of trespass and assault . . . for the
battery of his servant.' " Tinker placed criminal conversation solidly
within the traditional intentional tort category, and this Court so confines its holding; that decision provides no warrant for departure from
the current statutory instruction that, to be nondischargeable, the judgment debt must be "for willful and malicious injury." See, e. g., Davis
v. Aetna Acceptance Co., 293 U. S. 328, 332. The Kawaauhaus' argument that, as a policy matter, malpractice judgments should be excepted
from discharge, at least when the debtor acted recklessly or carried
no malpractice insurance, should be addressed to Congress. Debts arising from reckless or negligently inflicted injuries do not fall within

$ 523(a)(6)'s compass. Pp. 60-64.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code provides thata debt "for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to

another" is not dischargeable. 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(6). Thequestion before us is whether a debt arising from a medical
malpractice judgment, attributable to negligent or recklessconduct, falls within this statutory exception. We hold that
it does not and that the debt is dischargeable.

I
In January 1983, petitioner Margaret Kawaauhau soughttreatment from respondent Dr. Paul Geiger for a foot injury.

Geiger examined Kawaauhau and admitted her to the hospi-tal to attend to the risk of infection resulting from the injury.
Although Geiger knew that intravenous penicillin wouldhave been more effective, he prescribed oral penicillin, explaining in his testimony that he understood his patientwished to minimize the cost of her treatment.

Geiger then departed on a business trip, leaving Kawaau-hau in the care of other physicians, who decided she should
be transferred to an infectious disease specialist. WhenGeiger returned, he canceled the transfer and discontinued
all antibiotics because he believed the infection had subsided.Kawaauhau's condition deteriorated over the next few days,
requiring the amputation of her right leg below the knee.Kawaauhau, joined by her husband Solomon, sued Geiger
for malpractice. After a trial, the jury found Geiger liableand awarded the Kawaauhaus approximately $355,000 in
damages.1 Geiger, who carried no malpractice insurance,2

and $99,000 in general damages. In re Geiger, 172 B. R. 916, 919 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. ED Mo. 1994). In addition, the jury awarded Solomon Kawaauhau
$18,000 in general damages for loss of consortium and $35,000 for emotional distress. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
moved to Missouri, where his wages were garnished by theKawaauhaus. Geiger then petitioned for bankruptcy. The

Kawaauhaus requested the Bankruptcy Court to hold the
malpractice judgment nondischargeable on the ground that
it was a debt "for willful and malicious injury" excepted from
discharge by 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(6). The Bankruptcy Court
concluded that Geiger's treatment fell far below the appropriate standard of care and therefore ranked as "willful and
malicious." Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court held the
debt nondischargeable. In re Geiger, 172 B. R. 916, 922-923
(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Mo. 1994). In an unpublished order, the
District Court affirmed. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-18 to
A-22.

A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit reversed, 93 F. 3d 443 (1996), and a divided en banc
court adhered to the panel's position, 113 F. 3d 848 (1997) (en
banc). Section 523(a)(6)'s exemption from discharge, the en
banc court held, is confined to debts "based on what the law
has for generations called an intentional tort." Id., at 852.
On this view, a debt for malpractice, because it is based on
conduct that is negligent or reckless, rather than intentional,
remains dischargeable.

The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that its interpretation
of $ 523(a)(6) diverged from previous holdings of the Sixth
and Tenth Circuits. See id., at 853 (citing Perkins v.
Scharffe, 817 F. 2d 392, 394 (CA6), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 853
(1987), and In re Franklin, 726 F. 2d 606, 610 (CA10 1984)).
We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 521 U. S. 1153
(1997), and now affirm the Eighth Circuit's judgment.

II
Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:

"(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a),
1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an
individual debtor from any debt--

Opinion of the Court
. . . . .
"(6) for willful and malicious injury by the debtor toanother entity or to the property of another entity."

The Kawaauhaus urge that the malpractice award fits withinthis exception because Dr. Geiger intentionally rendered inadequate medical care to Margaret Kawaauhau that neces-sarily led to her injury. According to the Kawaauhaus, Geiger deliberately chose less effective treatment because hewanted to cut costs, all the while knowing that he was providing substandard care. Such conduct, the Kawaauhausassert, meets the "willful and malicious" specification of

$ 523(a)(6).We confront this pivotal question concerning the scope
of the "willful and malicious injury" exception: Does$ 523(a)(6)'s compass cover acts, done intentionally,

3 that

cause injury (as the Kawaauhaus urge), or only acts donewith the actual intent to cause injury (as the Eighth Circuit

ruled)? The words of the statute strongly support theEighth Circuit's reading.

The word "willful" in (a)(6) modifies the word "injury," in-dicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury, not merely a deliberate or intentional act thatleads to injury. Had Congress meant to exempt debts resulting from unintentionally inflicted injuries, it might havedescribed instead "willful acts that cause injury." Or, Congress might have selected an additional word or words, i. e.,"reckless" or "negligent," to modify "injury." Moreover, as
the Eighth Circuit observed, the (a)(6) formulation triggersin the lawyer's mind the category "intentional torts," as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts. Intentionaltorts generally require that the actor intend "the conse3 The word "willful" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as "voluntary" or "intentional." Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979). Consistently, legislative reports note that the word "willful" in $ 523(a)(6)
means "deliberate or intentional." See S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 79 (1978);
H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 365 (1977).

quences of an act," not simply "the act itself." Restatement(Second) of Torts $ 8A, Comment a, p. 15 (1964) (emphasis

added).The Kawaauhaus' more encompassing interpretation could
place within the excepted category a wide range of situationsin which an act is intentional, but injury is unintended,

i. e.,neither desired nor in fact anticipated by the debtor. Every

traffic accident stemming from an initial intentional act--forexample, intentionally rotating the wheel of an automobile
to make a left-hand turn without first checking oncomingtraffic--could fit the description. See 113 F. 3d, at 852. A
"knowing breach of contract" could also qualify. See ibid.A construction so broad would be incompatible with the
"well-known" guide that exceptions to discharge "should beconfined to those plainly expressed."

Gleason v. Thaw, 236U. S. 558, 562 (1915).

Furthermore, "we are hesitant to adopt an interpretationof a congressional enactment which renders superfluous
another portion of that same law." Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988).Reading $ 523(a)(6) as the Kawaauhaus urge would obviate

the need for $ 523(a)(9), which specifically exempts debts "fordeath or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of
a motor vehicle if such operation was unlawful because thedebtor was intoxicated from using alcohol, a drug, or another
substance." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(9); see also $ 523(a)(12) (ex-empting debts for "malicious or reckless failure" to fulfill certain commitments owed to a federal depository institutionsregulatory agency).

The Kawaauhaus heavily rely on Tinker v. Colwell, 193U. S. 473 (1904), which presented this question: Does an

award of damages for "criminal conversation" survive bank-ruptcy under the 1898 Bankruptcy Act's exception from

4 Sections 523(a)(9) and (12) were added to the Bankruptcy Code in 1984
and 1990 respectively. See Pub. L. 98-353, 98 Stat. 364 (1984), and Pub.
L. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4865 (1990).

Opinion of the Court
discharge for judgments in civil actions for " `willful and ma-licious injuries to the person or property of another' "?

Id.,
at 480. The Tinker Court held such an award a nondis-chargeable debt. The Kawaauhaus feature certain statements in the Tinker opinion, in particular: "[An] act is willful
. . . in the sense that it is intentional and voluntary" even ifperformed "without any particular malice,"

id., at 485; an act
that "necessarily causes injury and is done intentionally, maybe said to be done willfully and maliciously, so as to come

within the [bankruptcy discharge] exception," id., at 487.See also

id., at 486 (the statute exempts from discharge liability for " `a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just
cause or excuse' ") (quoting from definition of malice in Bromage v. Prosser, 4 Barn. & Cress. 247, 107 Eng. Rep. 1051
(K. B. 1825)).

The exposition in the Tinker opinion is less than crystalline. Counterbalancing the portions the Kawaauhaus emphasize, the Tinker Court repeatedly observed that the tort

in question qualified in the common law as trespassory. Indeed, it ranked as "trespass vi et armis." 193 U. S., at 482,
483. Criminal conversation, the Court noted, was an action
akin to a master's "action of trespass and assault . . . for
the battery of his servant," id., at 482. Tinker thus placed
criminal conversation solidly within the traditional intentional tort category, and we so confine its holding. That decision, we clarify, provides no warrant for departure from
the current statutory instruction that, to be nondischargeable, the judgment debt must be "for willful and malicious
injury."

Subsequent decisions of this Court are in accord with our
construction. In McIntyre v. Kavanaugh, 242 U. S. 138
(1916), a broker "deprive[d] another of his property forever
by deliberately disposing of it without semblance of authority." Id., at 141. The Court held that this act constituted
an intentional injury to property of another, bringing it
within the discharge exception. But in Davis v. Aetna Ac523US1 Unit: $U33 [04-29-00 19:53:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
64 KAWAAUHAU v. GEIGER

Opinion of the Court
ceptance Co., 293 U. S. 328 (1934), the Court explained thatnot every tort judgment for conversion is exempt from discharge. Negligent or reckless acts, the Court held, do notsuffice to establish that a resulting injury is "wilful and malicious." See id., at 332.Finally, the Kawaauhaus maintain that, as a policy matter,
malpractice judgments should be excepted from discharge,at least when the debtor acted recklessly or carried no malpractice insurance. Congress, of course, may so decide.But unless and until Congress makes such a decision, we
must follow the current direction $ 523(a)(6) provides.

* * *
We hold that debts arising from recklessly or negligentlyinflicted injuries do not fall within the compass of $ 523(a)(6).

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appealsfor the Eighth Circuit is

Affirmed.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. RAMIREZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1469. Argued January 13, 1998--Decided March 4, 1998
Based on a reliable confidential informant's statement that he had seen a

person he believed to be Alan Shelby, a dangerous escaped prisoner, at
respondent's home, and on a federal agent's subsequent observation of
a man resembling Shelby outside that home, the Government obtained
a "no-knock" warrant to enter and search the home. Having gathered
in the early morning hours to execute the warrant, officers announced
over a loud speaker system that they had a search warrant. Simultaneously, they broke a single window in respondent's garage and pointed a
gun through the opening, hoping thereby to dissuade occupants from
rushing to the weapons stash the informant had told them was in the
garage. Awakened by the noise and fearful that his house was being
burglarized, respondent grabbed a pistol and fired it into the garage
ceiling. When the officers shouted "police," respondent surrendered
and was taken into custody. After he admitted that he had fired the
weapon, that he owned both that gun and another in the house, and that
he was a convicted felon, respondent was indicted on federal charges
of being a felon in possession of firearms. The District Court granted
his motion to suppress evidence regarding weapons possession, ruling
that the officers had violated both the Fourth Amendment and 18
U. S. C. $ 3109 because there were "insufficient exigent circumstances"
to justify their destruction of property in executing the warrant. The
Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. The Fourth Amendment does not hold officers to a higher standard
when a "no-knock" entry results in the destruction of property. It is
obvious from the holdings in Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 934,
936, and Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, that such an entry's lawfulness does not depend on whether property is damaged in the course
of the entry. Under Richards, a no-knock entry is justified if police
have a "reasonable suspicion" that knocking and announcing their presence before entering would "be dangerous or futile, or . . . inhibit the
effective investigation of the crime." Id., at 394. Whether such a
reasonable suspicion exists does not depend on whether police must destroy property in order to enter. This is not to say that the Fourth
Amendment does not speak to the manner of executing a warrant.

523US1 Unit: $U34 [04-29-00 19:54:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
66 UNITED STATES v. RAMIREZ

Syllabus
Such execution is governed by the general touchstone of reasonableness
that applies to all Fourth Amendment analysis. See Pennsylvania v.
Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108-109. Excessive or unnecessary property
destruction during a search may violate the Amendment, even though
the entry itself is lawful and the fruits of the search not subject to
suppression. Applying these principles to the facts at hand demonstrates that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred. The police certainly had a "reasonable suspicion" that knocking and announcing their
presence might be dangerous to themselves or others, in that a reliable
informant had told them that Alan Shelby might be in respondent's
home, an officer had confirmed this possibility, and Shelby had a violent
past and possible access to a large supply of weapons and had vowed
that he "would not do federal time." Moreover, the manner in which
the entry was accomplished was clearly reasonable, in that the police
broke but a single window in the garage to discourage Shelby, or anyone
else, from rushing to the weapons that the informant had told them
were there. Pp. 70-72.

2. The officers executing the warrant did not violate $ 3109, which
provides: "The officer may break open any . . . window . . . to execute
a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is
refused admittance . . . ." Contrary to respondent's contention, that
statute does not specify the only circumstances under which an officer
executing a warrant may damage property. By its terms $ 3109 prohibits nothing, but merely authorizes officers to damage property in
certain instances. Even accepting, arguendo, that it implicitly forbids
some of what it does not expressly permit, it is of no help to respondent.
In both Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313, and Sabbath v. United
States, 391 U. S. 585, 591, n. 8, this Court noted that $ 3109's prior notice
requirement codified a common-law tradition. The Court now makes
clear that $ 3109 also codified the exceptions to the common-law requirement of notice before entry. Because that is the case, and because
the common law informs the Fourth Amendment, Wilson and Richards
serve as guideposts in construing the statute. In Wilson, the Court
concluded that the common-law announcement principle is an element
of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry, but noted that the
principle was never stated as an inflexible rule requiring announcement
under all circumstances. 514 U. S., at 934. In Richards, the Court
articulated the test used to determine whether exigent circumstances
justify a particular no-knock entry. 520 U. S., at 394. Thus, $ 3109 includes an exigent circumstances exception and that exception's applicability in a given instance is measured by the same standard articulated
in Richards. The police met that standard here. Pp. 72-74.

Opinion of the Court
the crime." In this case, we must decide whether theFourth Amendment holds officers to a higher standard than

this when a "no-knock" entry results in the destruction ofproperty. We hold that it does not.

Alan Shelby was a prisoner serving concurrent state and
federal sentences in the Oregon state prison system. OnNovember 1, 1994, the Tillamook County Sheriff 's Office took

temporary custody of Shelby, expecting to transport him tothe Tillamook County Courthouse, where he was scheduled
to testify. On the way to the courthouse, Shelby slipped hishandcuffs, knocked over a deputy sheriff, and escaped from
custody.

It was not the first time Shelby had attempted escape. In
1991 he struck an officer, kicked out a jail door, assaulted a
woman, stole her vehicle, and used it to ram a police vehicle.
Another time he attempted escape by using a rope made
from torn bedsheets. He was reported to have made
threats to kill witnesses and police officers, to have tortured
people with a hammer, and to have said that he would " `not
do federal time.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. It was also
thought that Shelby had had access to large supplies of
weapons.

Shortly after learning of Shelby's escape, the authorities
sent out a press release, seeking information that would lead
to his recapture. On November 3, a reliable confidential

informant told Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
Agent George Kim that on the previous day he had seen a
person he believed to be Shelby at respondent Hernan Ramirez's home in Boring, Oregon. Kim and the informant then
drove to an area near respondent's home, from where Kim
observed a man working outside who resembled Shelby.

Based on this information, a Deputy United States Marshal sought and received a "no-knock" warrant granting permission to enter and search Ramirez's home. Around this
time, the confidential informant also told authorities that
respondent might have a stash of guns and drugs hidden in

Opinion of the Court
his garage. In the early morning of November 5, approxi-mately 45 officers gathered to execute the warrant. The officers set up a portable loudspeaker system and began an-nouncing that they had a search warrant. Simultaneously,
they broke a single window in the garage and pointed a gun
through the opening, hoping thereby to dissuade any of theoccupants from rushing to the weapons the officers believed

might be in the garage.Respondent and his family were asleep inside the house at
the time this activity began. Awakened by the noise, re-spondent believed that they were being burglarized. He
ran to his utility closet, grabbed a pistol, and fired it into the
ceiling of his garage. The officers fired back and shouted
"police." At that point respondent realized that it was law
enforcement officers who were trying to enter his home. He
ran to the living room, threw his pistol away, and threw himself onto the floor. Shortly thereafter, he, his wife, and their
child left the house and were taken into police custody. Respondent waived his Miranda rights, and then admitted that
he had fired the weapon, that he owned both that gun and
another gun that was inside the house, and that he was a
convicted felon. Officers soon obtained another search warrant, which they used to return to the house and retrieve the
two guns. Shelby was not found.

Respondent was subsequently indicted for being a felon in
possession of firearms. 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). The District
Court granted his motion to suppress evidence regarding his
possession of the weapons, ruling that the police officers had
violated both the Fourth Amendment and 18 U. S. C. $ 3109
because there were "insufficient exigent circumstances" to
justify the police officers' destruction of property in their
execution of the warrant. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 91
F. 3d 1297 (1996). Applying Circuit precedent, that court
concluded that while a "mild exigency" is sufficient to justify
a no-knock entry that can be accomplished without the de523US1 Unit: $U34 [04-29-00 19:54:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

It held that this heightened standard had not been met onthe facts of this case. We granted certiorari and now reverse. 521 U. S. 1103 (1997).In two recent cases we have considered whether and to
what extent "no-knock" entries implicate the protections ofthe Fourth Amendment. In

no role in Fourth Amendment analysis. We rejected thatconclusion, and held instead that "in some circumstances an
officer's unannounced entry into a home might be unreason-able under the Fourth Amendment."

Id., at 934. We werecareful to note, however, that there was no rigid rule requiring announcement in all instances, and left "to the lowercourts the task of determining the circumstances under
which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the FourthAmendment."

Id., at 934, 936.In Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385 (1997),

1 the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that police officers executingsearch warrants in felony drug investigations were never required to knock and announce their presence. We concludedthat this blanket rule was overly broad and held instead that
"[i]n order to justify a `no-knock' entry, the police must havea reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their
presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dan-gerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destructionof evidence." Id., at 394.

Neither of these cases explicitly addressed the questionwhether the lawfulness of a no-knock entry depends on
whether property is damaged in the course of the entry. It

Court of Appeals issued its opinion in this case.

Opinion of the Court
is obvious from their holdings, however, that it does not.Under Richards, a no-knock entry is justified if police have

a "reasonable suspicion" that knocking and announcingwould be dangerous, futile, or destructive to the purposes
of the investigation. Whether such a "reasonable suspicion"exists depends in no way on whether police must destroy
property in order to enter.This is not to say that the Fourth Amendment speaks not
at all to the manner of executing a search warrant. Thegeneral touchstone of reasonableness which governs Fourth
Amendment analysis, see Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S.106, 108-109 (1977)

(per curiam), governs the method of exe-cution of the warrant. Excessive or unnecessary destruction of property in the course of a search may violate theFourth Amendment, even though the entry itself is lawful
and the fruits of the search are not subject to suppression.Applying these principles to the facts at hand, we conclude
that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred. A reliableconfidential informant had notified the police that Alan
Shelby might be inside respondent's home, and an officer hadconfirmed this possibility. Shelby was a prison escapee with
a violent past who reportedly had access to a large supply ofweapons. He had vowed that he would " `not do federal
time.' " The police certainly had a "reasonable suspicion"that knocking and announcing their presence might be dangerous to themselves or to others.2As for the manner in which the entry was accomplished,
the police here broke a single window in respondent's garage.They did so because they wished to discourage Shelby, or
any other occupant of the house, from rushing to the weap-ons that the informant had told them respondent might have

2 It is of no consequence that Shelby was not found. "[I]n determining
the lawfulness of entry and the existence of probable cause we may concern ourselves only with what the officers had reason to believe at the
time of their entry." Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40-41, n. 12 (1963)

Opinion of the Court
kept there. Their conduct was clearly reasonable and we
conclude that there was no Fourth Amendment violation.3

Respondent also argues, however, that suppression is appropriate because the officers executing the warrant violated
18 U. S. C. $ 3109. This statutory argument fares no better.
Section 3109 provides:

"The officer may break open any outer or inner door or
window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything
therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of
his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or
when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding
him in the execution of the warrant."

Respondent contends that the statute specifies the only circumstances under which an officer may damage property in
executing a search warrant, and that it therefore forbids all
other property-damaging entries.

But by its terms $ 3109 prohibits nothing. It merely authorizes officers to damage property in certain instances.
Even accepting, arguendo, that the statute implicitly forbids
some of what it does not expressly permit, it is of no help to
respondent. In Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313
(1958), we noted that $ 3109's "requirement of prior notice
. . . before forcing entry . . . codif[ied] a tradition embedded
in Anglo-American law." We repeated this point in Sabbath
v. United States, 391 U. S. 585, 591, n. 8 (1968) (referring to

$ 3109 as "codification" of the common law). In neither of

3 After concluding that the Fourth Amendment had been violated in this
case, the Ninth Circuit further concluded that the guns should be excluded
from evidence. Because we conclude that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, we need not decide whether, for example, there was sufficient causal relationship between the breaking of the window and the discovery of the guns to warrant suppression of the evidence. Cf. Nix v.
Williams, 467 U. S. 431 (1984); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471
(1963).

73Cite as: 523 U. S. 65 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
these cases, however, did we expressly hold that $ 3109 also
codified the exceptions to the common-law requirement of
notice before entry. In Miller the Government made "no
claim . . . of the existence of circumstances excusing compliance" and the question was accordingly not before us. 357
U. S., at 309. In Sabbath the Government did make such a
claim, but because the record did "not reveal any substantial
basis for the failure of the agents . . . to announce their authority" we did not decide the question. We did note, however, that "[e]xceptions to any possible constitutional rule
relating to announcement and entry have been recognized
. . . and there is little reason why those limited exceptions
might not also apply to $ 3109, since they existed at common
law, of which the statute is a codification." 391 U. S., at
591, n. 8.

In this case the question is squarely presented. We remove whatever doubt may remain on the subject and hold
that $ 3109 codifies the exceptions to the common-law announcement requirement. If $ 3109 codifies the common law
in this area, and the common law in turn informs the Fourth
Amendment, our decisions in Wilson and Richards serve as
guideposts in construing the statute. In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), we concluded that the common-law
principle of announcement is "an element of the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment," but noted that
the principle "was never stated as an inflexible rule requiring announcement under all circumstances." Id., at 934. In
Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385 (1997), we articulated
the test used to determine whether exigent circumstances
justify a particular no-knock entry. Id., at 394. We therefore hold that $ 3109 includes an exigent circumstances exception and that the exception's applicability in a given instance is measured by the same standard we articulated in
Richards. The police met that standard here and $ 3109 was
therefore not violated.

ONCALE v. SUNDOWNER OFFSHORE

SERVICES, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-568. Argued December 3, 1997--Decided March 4, 1998
Petitioner Oncale filed a complaint against his employer, respondent Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., claiming that sexual harassment directed against him by respondent co-workers in their workplace constituted "discriminat[ion] . . . because of . . . sex" prohibited by Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). Relying on
Fifth Circuit precedent, the District Court held that Oncale, a male, had
no Title VII cause of action for harassment by male co-workers. The
Fifth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII. Title VII's prohibition of discrimination "because of . . . sex" protects men as well as women, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 682, and in the related
context of racial discrimination in the workplace this Court has rejected
any conclusive presumption that an employer will not discriminate
against members of his own race, Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U. S. 482,
499. There is no justification in Title VII's language or the Court's
precedents for a categorical rule barring a claim of discrimination "because of . . . sex" merely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the
person charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are of the same
sex. Recognizing liability for same-sex harassment will not transform
Title VII into a general civility code for the American workplace, since
Title VII is directed at discrimination because of sex, not merely conduct tinged with offensive sexual connotations; since the statute does
not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women
routinely interact with members of the same, and the opposite, sex; and
since the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the
perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering
all the circumstances. Pp. 78-82.

Opinion of the Court
to the legal point we must decide, and in the interest of both
brevity and dignity we shall describe them only generally.
In late October 1991, Oncale was working for respondent
Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., on a Chevron U. S. A.,
Inc., oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. He was employed
as a roustabout on an eight-man crew which included respondents John Lyons, Danny Pippen, and Brandon Johnson.
Lyons, the crane operator, and Pippen, the driller, had supervisory authority, App. 41, 77, 43. On several occasions,
Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating
actions against him by Lyons, Pippen, and Johnson in the
presence of the rest of the crew. Pippen and Lyons also
physically assaulted Oncale in a sexual manner, and Lyons
threatened him with rape.

Oncale's complaints to supervisory personnel produced no
remedial action; in fact, the company's Safety Compliance
Clerk, Valent Hohen, told Oncale that Lyons and Pippen
"picked [on] him all the time too," and called him a name
suggesting homosexuality. Id., at 77. Oncale eventually
quit--asking that his pink slip reflect that he "voluntarily
left due to sexual harassment and verbal abuse." Id., at 79.
When asked at his deposition why he left Sundowner, Oncale
stated: "I felt that if I didn't leave my job, that I would be
raped or forced to have sex." Id., at 71.

Oncale filed a complaint against Sundowner in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,
alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment
because of his sex. Relying on the Fifth Circuit's decision in
Garcia v. Elf Atochem North America, 28 F. 3d 446, 451-452
(1994), the District Court held that "Mr. Oncale, a male, has
no cause of action under Title VII for harassment by male
co-workers." App. 106. On appeal, a panel of the Fifth
Circuit concluded that Garcia was binding Circuit precedent,
and affirmed. 83 F. 3d 118 (1996). We granted certiorari.

78 ONCALE v. SUNDOWNER OFFSHORE SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

II
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, in rele-vant part, that "[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice

for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individualwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color,religion, sex, or national origin." 78 Stat. 255, as amended,
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). We have held that this not onlycovers "terms" and "conditions" in the narrow contractual
sense, but "evinces a congressional intent to strike at theentire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women
in employment." Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,477 U. S. 57, 64 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted). "When the workplace is permeated with discrimi-natory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently
severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim'semployment and create an abusive working environment,
Title VII is violated." Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted).Title VII's prohibition of discrimination "because of . . .
sex" protects men as well as women, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 682 (1983),and in the related context of racial discrimination in the

workplace we have rejected any conclusive presumption thatan employer will not discriminate against members of his
own race. "Because of the many facets of human motiva-tion, it would be unwise to presume as a matter of law that
human beings of one definable group will not discriminateagainst other members of their group."

Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U. S. 482, 499 (1977). See also id., at 515-516,n. 6 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and

Rehnquist, J.,dissenting). In
Johnson v. Transportation Agency, SantaClara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987), a male employee claimed

that his employer discriminated against him because of hissex when it preferred a female employee for promotion. Al523US1 Unit: $U35 [04-29-00 19:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

79Cite as: 523 U. S. 75 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
though we ultimately rejected the claim on other grounds,we did not consider it significant that the supervisor who

made that decision was also a man. See id., at 624-625. Ifour precedents leave any doubt on the question, we hold
today that nothing in Title VII necessarily bars a claim of
discrimination "because of . . . sex" merely because the plain-tiff and the defendant (or the person charged with acting on

behalf of the defendant) are of the same sex.Courts have had little trouble with that principle in cases
like Johnson, where an employee claims to have been passedover for a job or promotion. But when the issue arises in
the context of a "hostile environment" sexual harassment
claim, the state and federal courts have taken a bewildering
variety of stances. Some, like the Fifth Circuit in this case,
have held that same-sex sexual harassment claims are never
cognizable under Title VII. See also, e. g., Goluszek v. H. P.
Smith, 697 F. Supp. 1452 (ND Ill. 1988). Other decisions say
that such claims are actionable only if the plaintiff can prove
that the harasser is homosexual (and thus presumably motivated by sexual desire). Compare McWilliams v. Fairfax
County Board of Supervisors, 72 F. 3d 1191 (CA4 1996), with
Wrightson v. Pizza Hut of America, 99 F. 3d 138 (CA4 1996).
Still others suggest that workplace harassment that is sexual
in content is always actionable, regardless of the harasser's
sex, sexual orientation, or motivations. See Doe v. Belleville, 119 F. 3d 563 (CA7 1997).

We see no justification in the statutory language or our
precedents for a categorical rule excluding same-sex harassment claims from the coverage of Title VII. As some courts
have observed, male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably
comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our
laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by
which we are governed. Title VII prohibits "discrimina523US1 Unit: $U35 [04-29-00 19:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
80 ONCALE v. SUNDOWNER OFFSHORE SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
t[ion] . . . because of . . . sex" in the "terms" or "conditions"of employment. Our holding that this includes sexual harassment must extend to sexual harassment of any kind thatmeets the statutory requirements.

Respondents and their amici contend that recognizing liability for same-sex harassment will transform Title VII intoa general civility code for the American workplace. But

that risk is no greater for same-sex than for opposite-sexharassment, and is adequately met by careful attention to
the requirements of the statute. Title VII does not prohibitall verbal or physical harassment in the workplace; it is directed only at "discriminat[ion] . . . because of . . . sex."
We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. "The critical issue, Title VII's
text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to
disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which
members of the other sex are not exposed." Harris, supra,
at 25 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).

Courts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most male-female sexual harassment
situations, because the challenged conduct typically involves
explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity; it is reasonable to assume those proposals would not have been made to
someone of the same sex. The same chain of inference
would be available to a plaintiff alleging same-sex harassment, if there were credible evidence that the harasser was
homosexual. But harassing conduct need not be motivated
by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on
the basis of sex. A trier of fact might reasonably find such
discrimination, for example, if a female victim is harassed in
such sex-specific and derogatory terms by another woman as
to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general
hostility to the presence of women in the workplace. A
same-sex harassment plaintiff may also, of course, offer di523US1 Unit: $U35 [04-29-00 19:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

81Cite as: 523 U. S. 75 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
rect comparative evidence about how the alleged harassertreated members of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace.

Whatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow,he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was
not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted "discrimina[tion] . . . because of . . . sex."And there is another requirement that prevents Title VII

from expanding into a general civility code: As we empha-sized in

Meritor and Harris, the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and womenroutinely interact with members of the same sex and of the

opposite sex. The prohibition of harassment on the basis of
sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace; it forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to
alter the "conditions" of the victim's employment. "Conduct
that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment
that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is
beyond Title VII's purview." Harris, 510 U. S., at 21, citing
Meritor, 477 U. S., at 67. We have always regarded that
requirement as crucial, and as sufficient to ensure that courts
and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace--such as male-on-male horseplay or intersexual flirtation--for discriminatory "conditions of employment."

We have emphasized, moreover, that the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of
a reasonable person in the plaintiff 's position, considering
"all the circumstances." Harris, supra, at 23. In same-sex
(as in all) harassment cases, that inquiry requires careful
consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target. A professional
football player's working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, if the coach smacks him on the
buttocks as he heads onto the field--even if the same behavior would reasonably be experienced as abusive by the
coach's secretary (male or female) back at the office. The

Thomas, J., concurring
real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on aconstellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations,

and relationships which are not fully captured by a simplerecitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.
Common sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social con-text, will enable courts and juries to distinguish between
simple teasing or roughhousing among members of the samesex, and conduct which a reasonable person in the plaintiff 's
position would find severely hostile or abusive.

III
Because we conclude that sex discrimination consisting ofsame-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII,

the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I concur because the Court stresses that in every sexualharassment case, the plaintiff must plead and ultimately

prove Title VII's statutory requirement that there be dis-crimination "because of . . . sex."

v. CITIZENS FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 96-643. Argued October 6, 1997--Decided March 4, 1998
Alleging that petitioner manufacturer had violated the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) by failing to
file timely toxic- and hazardous-chemical storage and emission reports
for past years, respondent environmental protection organization filed
this private enforcement action for declaratory and injunctive relief
under EPCRA's citizen-suit provision, 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(a)(1). The
District Court held that, because petitioner had brought its filings up to
date by the time the complaint was filed, the court lacked jurisdiction
to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA
does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondent's allegation of untimely filing was not a claim upon which relief could be
granted. The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that EPCRA authorizes citizen suits for purely past violations.

Held: Because none of the relief sought would likely remedy respondent's

alleged injury in fact, respondent lacks standing to maintain this suit,
and this Court and the lower courts lack jurisdiction to entertain it.
Pp. 88-110.

(a) The merits issue in this case--whether $ 11046(a) permits citizen
suits for purely past violations--is not also "jurisdictional," and so does
not occupy the same status as standing to sue as a question that must
be resolved first. It is firmly established that a district court's subjectmatter jurisdiction is not defeated by the absence of a valid (as opposed
to arguable) cause of action, see, e. g., Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682.
Subject-matter jurisdiction exists if the right to recover will be sustained under one reading of the Constitution and laws and defeated
under another, id., at 685, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial, wholly insubstantial and frivolous, or otherwise so devoid of merit
as not to involve a federal controversy, see, e. g., Oneida Indian Nation
of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 666. Here, respondent wins
under one construction of EPCRA and loses under another, and its claim
is not frivolous or immaterial. It is unreasonable to read $ 11046(c)--
which provides that "[t]he district court shall have jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection (a) . . . to enforce [an EPCRA] requirement . . . and to impose any civil penalty provided for violation of that
requirement"--as making all the elements of the $ 11046(a) cause of ac523US1 Unit: $U36 [05-01-00 12:16:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion jurisdictional, rather than as merely specifying the remedial powers
of the court. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, as well as cases deciding a statutory standing
question before a constitutional standing question, distinguished. In no
case has this Court called the existence of a cause of action "jurisdictional," and decided that question before resolving a dispute concerning
the existence of an Article III case or controversy. Such a principle
would turn every statutory question in an EPCRA citizen suit into a
question of jurisdiction that this Court would have to consider--indeed,
raise sua sponte--even if not raised below. Pp. 88-93.

(b) This Court declines to endorse the "doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction," under which several Courts of Appeals have found it proper
to proceed immediately to the merits question, despite jurisdictional
objections, at least where (1) the merits question is more readily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the merits would be the same as
the prevailing party were jurisdiction denied. That doctrine carries
the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus
offends fundamental separation-of-powers principles. In a long and
venerable line of cases, this Court has held that, without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only note the jurisdictional
defect and dismiss the suit. See, e. g., Capron v. Van Noorden, 2
Cranch 126; Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 73.
Bell v. Hood, supra; National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National
Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U. S. 453, 465, n. 13; Norton v. Mathews, 427 U. S. 524, 531; Secretary of Navy v. Avrech, 418 U. S. 676, 678
(per curiam); United States v. Augenblick, 393 U. S. 348; Philbrook v.
Glodgett, 421 U. S. 707, 721; and Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth
Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 86-88, distinguished. For a court to pronounce
upon a law's meaning or constitutionality when it has no jurisdiction to
do so is, by very definition, an ultra vires act. Pp. 93-102.

(c) Respondent lacks standing to sue. Standing is the "irreducible
constitutional minimum" necessary to make a justiciable "case" or "controversy" under Article III, $ 2. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504
U. S. 555, 560. It contains three requirements: injury in fact to the
plaintiff, causation of that injury by the defendant's complained-of conduct, and a likelihood that the requested relief will redress that injury.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a private enforcement action under the citizen-suitprovisi on of the Emergency Planning and Community

Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 100 Stat. 1755, 42U. S. C. $ 11046(a)(1). The case presents the merits question, answered in the affirmative by the United States Courtof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, whether EPCRA authorizes suits for purely past violations. It also presents thejurisdictional question whether respondent, plaintiff below,
has standing to bring this action.

I
Respondent, an association of individuals interested in en-vironmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional, and local
agencies designed to inform the public about the presence ofhazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency
response in the event of health-threatening release. Centralto its operation are reporting requirements compelling users
of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual

Opinion of the Court
"emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms" and"toxic chemical release forms," which contain,

inter alia, the
name and location of the facility, the name and quantity ofthe chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals,

the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium. 42 U. S. C.$$ 11022 and 11023. The hazardous-chemical inventory

forms for any given calendar year are due the followingMarch 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following
July 1st. $$ 11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most
powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or
administrative penalties. $ 11045. State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. $$ 11046(a)(2) and (c). For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit
provision, $ 11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see $ 11046(c). This provides that
"any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf
against . . . [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure,"
among other things, to "[c]omplete and submit an inventory
form under section 11022(a) of this title . . . [and] section
11023(a) of this title." $ 11046(a)(1). As a prerequisite to
bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing
his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA,
the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the
alleged violator. $ 11046(d). The citizen suit may not go
forward if the Administrator "has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to
enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty." $ 11046(e).

In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, alleging--accurately, as it turns out--that petitioner had failed since 1988,
the first year of EPCRA's filing deadlines, to complete and

Opinion of the Court
to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory andtoxic-chemical release forms under $$ 11022 and 11023.

Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdueforms with the relevant agencies. The EPA chose not to
bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day wait-ing period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District
Court. Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss underFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending
that, because its filings were up to date when the complaintwas filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for
a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allowsuit for a purely historical violation, respondent's allegation
of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which reliefcould be granted.

The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points.App. to Pet. for Cert. A24-A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties againstEPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline
and after receiving notice. 90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996). Wegranted certiorari, 519 U. S. 1147 (1997).

II
We granted certiorari in this case to resolve a conflict be-tween the interpretation of EPCRA adopted by the Seventh

Circuit and the interpretation previously adopted by theSixth Circuit in

Atlantic States Legal Foundation, Inc. v.United Musical Instruments, U. S. A., Inc., 61 F. 3d 473

(1995)--a case relied on by the District Court, and acknowl-edged by the Seventh Circuit to be "factually indistinguishable," 90 F. 3d, at 1241-1242. Petitioner, however, both inits petition for certiorari and in its briefs on the merits, has
raised the issue of respondent's standing to maintain the suit,and hence this Court's jurisdiction to entertain it. Though
there is some dispute on this point, see Part III, infra, thiswould normally be considered a threshold question that must
be resolved in respondent's favor before proceeding to the

Opinion of the Court
merits. Justice Stevens' opinion concurring in the judg-ment, however, claims that the question whether $ 11046(a)

permits this cause of action is also "jurisdictional," and sohas equivalent claim to being resolved first. Whether that
is so has significant implications for this case and for many
others, and so the point warrants extended discussion.It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a

valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not impli-cate subject-matter jurisdiction,

i. e., the courts' statutory or
constitutional power to adjudicate the case. See generally5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure

$ 1350, p. 196, n. 8 and cases cited (2d ed. 1990). As we
stated in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682 (1946), "[ j]urisdiction . . . is not defeated . . . by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover." Rather, the district court has
jurisdiction if "the right of the petitioners to recover under
their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws
of the United States are given one construction and will be
defeated if they are given another," id., at 685, unless the
claim "clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for
the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim
is wholly insubstantial and frivolous." Id., at 682-683; see
also Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U. S.
263, 285 (1993); The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228
U. S. 22, 25 (1913). Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is
proper only when the claim is "so insubstantial, implausible,
foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise
completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy." Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of
Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 666 (1974); see also Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359 (1959).
Here, respondent wins under one construction of EPCRA
and loses under another, and Justice Stevens does not
argue that respondent's claim is frivolous or immaterial--

Opinion of the Court
in fact, acknowledges that the language of the citizen-suitprovision is ambiguous.

Post, at 131.
Justice Stevens relies on our treatment of a similarissue as jurisdictional in

Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49 (1987). Post,
at 114. The statute at issue in that case, however, after cre-ating the cause of action, went on to say that "[t]he district

courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount
in controversy or the citizenship of the parties," to provide various forms of relief. 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a) (emphasisadded). The italicized phrase strongly suggested (perhaps

misleadingly) that the provision was addressing genuinesubject-matter jurisdiction. The corresponding provision in
the present case, however, reads as follows:

"The district court shall have jurisdiction in actions
brought under subsection (a) of this section against anowner or operator of a facility to enforce the requirement concerned and to impose any civil penalty provided for violation of that requirement." 42 U. S. C.$ 11046(c).

It is unreasonable to read this as making all the elements
of the cause of action under subsection (a) jurisdictional,rather than as merely specifying the remedial

powers of the
court, viz., to enforce the violated requirement and to impose
civil penalties. "Jurisdiction," it has been observed, "is aword of many, too many, meanings,"

United States v. Vanness, 85 F. 3d 661, 663, n. 2 (CADC 1996), and it is common-place for the term to be used as it evidently was here. See,

e. g., 7 U. S. C. $ 13a-1(d) ("In any action brought under this
section, the Commission may seek and the court shall have
jurisdiction to impose . . . a civil penalty in the amount of
not more than the higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary
gain to the person for each violation"); 15 U. S. C. $ 2622(d)
("In actions brought under this subsection, the district
courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief,

Opinion of the Court
including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary
damages"); 42 U. S. C. $ 7622(d) ("In actions brought under
this subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to
grant all appropriate relief including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, compensatory, and exemplary damages").

It is also the case that the Gwaltney opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything turned upon
whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations
was technically jurisdictional--as indeed nothing of substance did. The District Court had statutory jurisdiction
over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were
also alleged. See 484 U. S., at 64. It is true, as Justice
Stevens points out, that the issue of Article III standing
which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional. But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found. The
short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the
elements of the cause of action in Gwaltney made no substantive difference (nor even any procedural difference that
the Court seemed aware of), had been assumed by the parties, and was assumed without discussion by the Court. We
have often said that drive-by jurisdictional rulings of this
sort (if Gwaltney can even be called a ruling on the point
rather than a dictum) have no precedential effect. See
Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996); Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88,
97 (1994); United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,
344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952). But even if it is authoritative on the
point as to the distinctive statute there at issue, it is fanciful
to think that Gwaltney revised our established jurisprudence that the failure of a cause of action does not automatically produce a failure of jurisdiction, or adopted the expansive principle that a statute saying "the district court shall
have jurisdiction to remedy violations [in specified ways]"

Opinion of the Court
renders the existence of a violation necessary for subject-matter jurisdiction.

Justice Stevens' concurrence devotes a large portionof its discussion to cases in which a statutory standing question was decided before a question of constitutional standing. See post, at 115-117. They also are irrelevant here,because it is not a statutory

standing question that Justice
Stevens would have us decide first. He wishes to resolve,not whether EPCRA authorizes this plaintiff to sue (it

assuredly does), but whether the scope of the EPCRAright of action includes past violations. Such a question, we
have held, goes to the merits and not to statutory standing.
See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S.
355, 365 (1994) ("The question whether a federal statute
creates a claim for relief is not jurisdictional"); Romero
v. International Terminal Operating Co., supra, at 359;
Montana-Dakota Util. Co. v. Northwestern Public Service
Co., 341 U. S. 246, 249 (1951).

Though it is replete with extensive case discussions, case
citations, rationalizations, and syllogoids, see post, at 120,
n. 12, and n. 2, infra, Justice Stevens' opinion conspicuously lacks one central feature: a single case in which this
Court has done what he proposes, to wit, call the existence
of a cause of action "jurisdictional," and decide that question
before resolving a dispute concerning the existence of an Article III case or controversy. Of course, even if there were
not solid precedent contradicting Justice Stevens' position, the consequences are alone enough to condemn it. It
would turn every statutory question in an EPCRA citizen
suit into a question of jurisdiction. Under Justice Stevens' analysis, $ 11046(c)'s grant of "jurisdiction in actions
brought under [$ 11046(a)]" withholds jurisdiction over
claims involving purely past violations if past violations are
not in fact covered by $ 11046(a). By parity of reasoning, if
there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular
item constituted a failure to "complete" the form; or as to

93Cite as: 523 U. S. 83 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
whether a particular manner of delivery complied in timewith the requirement to "submit" the form; and if the court

agreed with the defendant on the point; the action wouldnot be "brought under [$ 11046(a)]," and would be dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are "jurisdictional," would have to be considered by this Court eventhough not raised earlier in the litigation--indeed, this Court
would have to raise them sua sponte. See Mt. Healthy City
Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977); GreatSouthern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 449, 453

(1900). Congress of course did not create such a strangescheme. In referring to actions "brought under" $ 11046(a),

$ 11046(c) means suits contending that $ 11046(a) contains acertain requirement. If

Justice Stevens is correct thatall cause-of-action questions may be regarded as jurisdictional questions, and thus capable of being decided wherethere is no genuine case or controversy, it is hard to see what
is left of that limitation in Article III.

III
In addition to its attempt to convert the merits issue inthis case into a jurisdictional one,

Justice Stevens' con-currence proceeds,
post, at 117-124, to argue the bolder pointthat jurisdiction need not be addressed first anyway. Even

if the statutory question is not "fram[ed] . . . in terms of`jurisdiction,' " but is simply "characterize[d] . . . as whether
respondent's complaint states a `cause of action,' " "it is alsoclear that we have the power to decide the statutory question first." Post, at 117-118. This is essentially the posi-tion embraced by several Courts of Appeals, which find it
proper to proceed immediately to the merits question, de-spite jurisdictional objections, at least where (1) the merits
question is more readily resolved, and (2) the prevailingparty on the merits would be the same as the prevailing
party were jurisdiction denied. See, e. g., SEC v. American

characterizes as "assuming" jurisdiction for the purpose ofdeciding the merits--the "doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction." See, e. g., United States v. Troescher, 99 F. 3d 933,934, n. 1 (1996).

1

We decline to endorse such an approach because it carriesthe courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action

and thus offends fundamental principles of separation ofpowers. This conclusion should come as no surprise, since
it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases."Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any
cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and whenit ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court
is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause."
Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869). "On every writof error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that

of jurisdiction, first, of this court, and then of the court fromwhich the record comes. This question the court is bound
to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise sug-gested, and without respect to the relation of the parties
to it." Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, supra,at 453. The requirement that jurisdiction be established as
a threshold matter "spring[s] from the nature and limits of

1 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by
this substantial body of Court of Appeals precedent. The fact that Justice Stevens' concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes
his contention that this discussion is an "excursion," and "unnecessary to
an explanation" of our decision, post, at 121, particularly puzzling.

the judicial power of the United States" and is "inflexibleand without exception."

Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v.
Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884).This Court's insistence that proper jurisdiction appear

begins at least as early as 1804, when we set aside a judgment for the defendant at the instance of the losing plaintiff
who had himself failed to allege the basis for federal jurisdiction. Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126 (1804). Justlast Term, we restated this principle in the clearest fashion,

unanimously setting aside the Ninth Circuit's merits deci-sion in a case that had lost the elements of a justiciable
controversy:

" `[E]very federal appellate court has a special obligation
to `satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but alsothat of the lower courts in a cause under review,' even

though the parties are prepared to concede it. Mitchellv.

Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934). See Juidice v.
Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 331-332 (1977) (standing). `And if
the record discloses that the lower court was withoutjurisdiction this court will notice the defect, although

the parties make no contention concerning it. [Whenthe lower federal court] lack[s] jurisdiction, we have
jurisdiction on appeal, not of the merits but merely forthe purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in
entertaining the suit.' United States v. Corrick, 298U. S. 435, 440 (1936) (footnotes omitted).' "

Justice Stevens' arguments contradicting all this jurisprudence--and asserting that a court may decide the
cause of action before resolving Article III jurisdiction--are
readily refuted. First, his concurrence seeks to convert Bell
v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678 (1946), into a case in which the causeof-action question was decided before an Article III stand523US1 Unit: $U36 [05-01-00 12:16:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
96 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Opinion of the Court
ing question. Post, at 118-119, n. 8. "Bell," Justice Stevens asserts, "held that we have jurisdiction to decide
[whether the plaintiff has stated a cause of action] even
when it is unclear whether the plaintiff 's injuries can be
redressed." Post, at 118. The italicized phrase (the italics
are his own) invites the reader to believe that Article IIIredressability was at issue. Not only is this not true, but

the whole point of Bell was that it is not true. In Bell,which was decided before

Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), the District Court haddismissed the case on

jurisdictional grounds because it believed that (what we would now call) a Bivens action would
not lie. This Court held that the nonexistence of a cause of
action was no proper basis for a jurisdictional dismissal.
Thus, the uncertainty about "whether the plaintiff 's injuries
can be redressed" to which Justice Stevens refers is simply the uncertainty about whether a cause of action existed--which is precisely what Bell holds not to be an Article
III "redressability" question. It would have been a different matter if the relief requested by the plaintiffs in Bell
(money damages) would not have remedied their injury in
fact; but it of course would. Justice Stevens used to understand the fundamental distinction between arguing no
cause of action and arguing no Article III redressability, having written for the Court that the former argument is "not
squarely directed at jurisdiction itself, but rather at the existence of a remedy for the alleged violation of . . . federal
rights," which issue is " `not of the jurisdictional sort which
the Court raises on its own motion.' " Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391,
398 (1979) (Stevens, J.), (quoting Mt. Healthy Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S., at 279).

Justice Stevens also relies on National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414
U. S. 453 (1974). Post, at 119-120. But in that case, we did
not determine whether a cause of action existed before de523US1 Unit: $U36 [05-01-00 12:16:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

97Cite as: 523 U. S. 83 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
termining that the plaintiff had Article III standing; therewas no question of injury in fact or effectiveness of the

requested remedy. Rather, National Railroad PassengerCorp. determined whether a statutory cause of action existed
before determining whether (if so) the plaintiff came withinthe "zone of interests" for which the cause of action was
available. 414 U. S., at 465, n. 13. The latter question is anissue of

statutory standing. It has nothing to do withwhether there is case or controversy under Article III.

2

2 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given
priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger
Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an
Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 115-117), but a merits
question cannot be given priority over an Article III question. See post,
at 120, n. 12. It seems to us no more illogical than many other "broken
circles" that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may
displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 301 U. S.
324, 330-331 (1937), and that unilateral Presidential action (renunciation)
may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the "logical" conclusion that unilateral Presidential action may displace state law. The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing
questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before
Article III questions. As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out,
the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often "overlap," 414
U. S., at 456. The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action
under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of
action under the statute are closely connected--indeed, depending upon
the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two. The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement
of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous
claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon. Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the
court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion giving; whereas the
proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no
Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of "generalized grievances," Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208,
217 (1974), that the Constitution leaves for resolution through the political process.

98 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Opinion of the Court
Much more extensive defenses of the practice of decidingthe cause of action before resolving Article III jurisdiction

have been offered by the Courts of Appeals. They relyprincipally upon two cases of ours,

Norton v. Mathews, 427
U. S. 524 (1976), and Secretary of Navy v. Avrech, 418 U. S.
676 (1974) (per curiam). Both are readily explained, wethink, by their extraordinary procedural postures. In

Norton, the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judgeDistrict Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether

the action was properly brought in that forum rather thanin an ordinary district court. We declined to decide that
jurisdictional question, because the merits question was de-cided

in a companion case, Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495
(1976), with the consequence that the jurisdictional question
could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge courthad been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if

not, we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decreefrom which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals,
the outcome of which was foreordained by Lucas. Nortonv.

Mathews, supra, at 531. Thus, Norton did not use the
pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device forreaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone

unaddressed. Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded
the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of Lucas as
equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present
a substantial federal question. The Court said: "This disposition [Lucas] renders the merits in the present case a

decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense." 427 U. S., at 530-531. We think it clear
that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively
resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,
sub silentio, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the
necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to
the merits. See Clow, 948 F. 2d, at 627 (O'Scannlain, J.,
dissenting).

Avrech also involved an instance in which an intervening
Supreme Court decision definitively answered the merits

Opinion of the Court
question. The jurisdictional question in the case had beenraised by the Court

sua sponte after oral argument, and supplemental briefing had been ordered. Secretary of Navy v.
Avrech, supra, at 677. Before the Court came to a decision,
however, the merits issue in the case had been conclusively
resolved in Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733 (1974), a case ar-gued the same day as

Avrech. The Court was unwilling to
decide the jurisdictional question without oral argument, 418U. S., at 677, but acknowledged (with some understatement)

that "even the most diligent and zealous advocate could findhis ardor somewhat dampened in arguing a jurisdictional
issue where the decision on the merits is . . . foreordained,"
id., at 678. Accordingly, the Court disposed of the case on
the basis of the intervening decision in Parker, in a minimalist two-page per curiam opinion. The first thing to be ob-served about

Avrech is that the supposed jurisdictional issue
was technically not that. The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for

backpay. Although Avrech, like the earlier case of United
States v. Augenblick, 393 U. S. 348 (1969), characterized this
question as jurisdictional, we later held squarely that it wasnot. See

Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 753
(1975). In any event, the peculiar circumstances of Avrech
hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering
general proposition that an "easy" merits question may
be decided on the assumption of jurisdiction. To the
contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question sua sponte demonstrates its adherence to
traditional and constitutionally dictated requirements. See
Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. v. ICC, 934 F. 2d, at 344-
345, and n. 10 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring
in denial of petition for review).

Other cases sometimes cited by the lower courts to support "hypothetical jurisdiction" are similarly distinguishable.
United States v. Augenblick, as we have discussed, did not
involve a jurisdictional issue. In Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421
U. S. 707, 721 (1975), the jurisdictional question was whether,

100 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Opinion of the Court
in a suit under 28 U. S. C. $ 1343(3) against the Commissionerof the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation

of federal rights under color of state law by denying pay-ments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare. The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary wasprecisely the same as that involved in the claim against the
Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdic-tion) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner. The Court's dispo-sition of the case was to dismiss the Secretary's appeal under
what was then this Court's Rule 40(g), for failure to briefthe jurisdictional question adequately. Normally, the Court
acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdictionof the District Court might prevent this disposition. But
here, the Court concluded, "the substantive issue decided bythe District Court would have been decided by that court
even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properlya party," and "the only practical difference that resulted . . .
was that its injunction was directed against him as well asagainst [the Commissioner]," which the Secretary "has [not]
properly contended to be wrongful before this Court." 421U. S., at 721-722. And finally, in

Chandler v. Judicial Coun-cil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74 (1970), we reserved the

question whether we had jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohi-bition or mandamus because the petitioner had not exhausted all available avenues before seeking relief under theAll Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, and because there was no
record to review. 398 U. S., at 86-88. The exhaustionquestion

itself was at least arguably jurisdictional, and wasclearly treated as such. Id., at 86.

3 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support "hypothetical jurisdiction." Post, at 121-122, and n. 15. They are
all inapposite. In Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973), we
declined to decide whether a federal court's pendent jurisdiction extended

101Cite as: 523 U. S. 83 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
While some of the above cases must be acknowledged tohave diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III

jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of themeven approaches approval of a doctrine of "hypothetical jurisdiction" that enables a court to resolve contested ques-tions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt. Hypothetical
jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judg-ment--which comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning. Muskrat v. United States, 219 U. S. 346, 362 (1911); Hayburn'sCase, 2 Dall. 409 (1792). Much more than legal niceties are

at stake here. The statutory and (especially) constitutionalelements of jurisdiction are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration of powers, restraining the courts fromacting at certain times, and even restraining them from acting permanently regarding certain subjects. See United
States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179 (1974); Schlesingerv. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227

(1974). For a court to pronounce upon the meaning or theconstitutionality of a state or federal law when it has no juto state-law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the District Court's discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction. Id., at 715-
716. Thus, the case decided not a merits question before a jurisdictional
question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question. Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 421 U. S. 426,
436 (1975), the "authoritative ground of decision" upon which the District
Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.
And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S.
77 (1955) (per curiam), was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the
substantive question whether the Seventh Amendment permits an appellate court to review the district court's denial of a motion for new trial on
the ground that the verdict was excessive. We declined to consider that
question because we agreed with the District Court's decision to deny the
motion on the facts in the record. The more numerous the look-alikebut-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it
becomes: His concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding
the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

risdiction to do so is, by very definition, for a court to actultra vires.

IV
Having reached the end of what seems like a long frontwalk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standingto sue. Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution extends the "judicial Power" of the United States only to "Cases" and "Controversies." We have always taken this to mean cases and
controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and re-solved by, the judicial process.

Muskrat v. United States,
supra, at 356-357. Such a meaning is fairly implied by thetext, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all. Everycriminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a
"case," and every policy issue resolved by congressional leg-islation involves a "controversy." These are not, however,
the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, $ 2, refers
to, since "the Constitution's central mechanism of separationof powers depends largely upon common understanding of

what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives,and to courts."

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.
555, 559-560 (1992). Standing to sue is part of the commonunderstanding of what it takes to make a justiciable case.

Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990).4The "irreducible constitutional minimum of standing" contains three requirements. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,

4 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the
more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizen's suit "somehow interferes with the Executive's power to `take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed,' Art. II, $ 3," post, at 129. The courts must stay
within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not
exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches. This case
calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing
jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on Presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 560. First and foremost, there must be alleged(and ultimately proved) an "injury in fact"--a harm suffered

by the plaintiff that is "concrete" and "actual or imminent,not `conjectural' or `hypothetical.' " Whitmore v. Arkansas,
supra, at 149, 155 (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S.
95, 101-102 (1983)). Second, there must be causation--afairly traceable connection between the plaintiff 's injury

and the complained-of conduct of the defendant. Simon v.
Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26,
41-42 (1976). And third, there must be redressability--alikelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged

injury. Id., at 45-46; see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,505 (1975). This triad of injury in fact, causation, and redressability 5 constitutes the core of Article III's case-or5 Contrary to Justice Stevens' belief that redressability "is a judicial
creation of the past 25 years," post, at 124, the concept has been ingrained
in our jurisprudence from the beginning. Although we have packaged
the requirements of constitutional "case" or "controversy" somewhat differently in the past 25 years--an era rich in three-part tests--the point
has always been the same: whether a plaintiff "personally would benefit
in a tangible way from the court's intervention." Warth, 422 U. S., at 508.
For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 114 U. S. 325, 328-329 (1885), we held
that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case
of "damnum absque injuria^." Although the complainant alleged a breach
of contract by the State, the complainant "asks no relief as to that, for
there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts. . . . The
bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character."
Because courts do not "si[t] to determine questions of law in thesi," we
remanded with directions to dismiss the bill. Id., at 328-330.

Also contrary to Justice Stevens' unprecedented suggestion, post, at
125, redressability--like the other prongs of the standing inquiry--does
not depend on the defendant's status as a governmental entity. There is
no conceivable reason why it should. If it is true, as Justice Stevens
claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because
of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising. Suits that promise no concrete benefit
to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us "determine questions of
law in thesi," Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy

controversy requirement, and the party invoking federal ju-risdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.

See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990).We turn now to the particulars of respondent's complaint
to see how it measures up to Article III's requirements.This case is on appeal from a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss
on the pleadings, so we must presume that the general alle-gations in the complaint encompass the specific facts necessary to support those allegations. Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 889 (1990). The complaintcontains claims "on behalf of both [respondent] itself and its

members." 6 App. 4. It describes respondent as an organi-zation that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under

EPCRA. It says that respondent "reports to its membersand the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals
into the environment, advocates changes in environmentalregulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members
and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals andfurther seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws." Id., at 5. The complaint asserts that re-spondent's "right to know about [toxic-chemical] releases and
its interests in protecting and improving the environmentand the health of its members have been, are being, and will
be adversely affected by [petitioner's] actions in failing toprovide timely and required information under EPCRA."
Ibid. The complaint also alleges that respondent's mem-bers, who live in or frequent the area near petitioner's facility, use the EPCRA-reported information "to learn about
preferences of political activists. But the principle of redressability has
broader application than that.

6 EPCRA states that "any person may commence a civil action on his

own behalf . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(a)(1) (emphasis added). "[P]erson"
includes an association, see $ 11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute
permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization,
and not the interests of its individual members. Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the
interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances intheir communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the

event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemi-cals in areas in which they live, work and visit."

Ibid. The
members' "safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic
and environmental interests" in the information, it isclaimed, "have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioner's] actions in failing to file timely andrequired reports under EPCRA."

Ibid.
As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioner'sfailure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion,

and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact
to itself and its members. We have not had occasion to
decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRA--or at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its use--is a
concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III. Cf. Lujan
v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 578. And we need not
reach that question in the present case because, assuming
injury in fact, the complaint fails the third test of standing,
redressability.

The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that
petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioner's facility and records (with costs borne by
petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the
EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties
of $25,000 per day for each violation of $$ 11022 and 11023;
(5) an award of all respondent's "costs, in connection with
the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including
reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized
by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]"; and (6) any such further
relief as the court deems appropriate. App. 11. None of

the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as "appropriate" under the general request, would serve
to reimburse respondent for losses caused by the late re523US1 Unit: $U36 [05-01-00 12:16:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
106 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Opinion of the Court
porting, or to eliminate any effects of that late reporting
upon respondent.7

The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that
petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.
There being no controversy over whether petitioner failed
to file reports, or over whether such a failure constitutes a
violation, the declaratory judgment is not only worthless to
respondent, it is seemingly worthless to all the world. See
Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 479 (1990).

Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see

$ 11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.
But they are not. These penalties--the only damages authorized by EPCRA--are payable to the United States
Treasury. In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks
not remediation of its own injury--reimbursement for the
costs it incurred as a result of the late filing--but vindication of the rule of law--the "undifferentiated public interest"
in faithful execution of EPCRA. Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, supra, at 577; see also Fairchild v. Hughes, 258
U. S. 126, 129-130 (1922). This does not suffice. Justice
Stevens thinks it is enough that respondent will be gratified
by seeing petitioner punished for its infractions and that the

7 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our
prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the
Court. Post, at 125-126. Even if that were so, it would not prove that
redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a
third party. But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise. See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95,
105 (1983); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 495-496 (1974). He also
seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has
directly injured the plaintiff. If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks
whether the injury is "fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the
defendant, and not . . . th[e] resul[t] [of] the independent action of some
third party not before the court." Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights
Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976).

punishment will deter the risk of future harm. Post, at127-128. If that were so, our holdings in

Linda R. S. v.
Richard D., 410 U. S. 614 (1973), and Simon v. Eastern Ky.
Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26 (1976), are inexplicable. Obviously, such a principle would make the redressability requirement vanish. By the mere bringing ofhis suit,

every plaintiff demonstrates his belief that a favorable judgment will make him happier. But although a suitormay derive great comfort and joy from the fact that the

United States Treasury is not cheated, that a wrongdoer getshis just deserts, or that the Nation's laws are faithfully enforced, that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable Article
III remedy because it does not redress a cognizable Article
III injury. See, e. g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 754-755
(1984); Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 482-
483 (1982). Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered
cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the
very essence of the redressability requirement.

Item (5), the "investigation and prosecution" costs "as
authorized by Section 326(f )," would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large. Obviously,
however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a
substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing
suit. The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of
the litigation itself. An "interest in attorney's fees is . . .
insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy
where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim."
Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., supra, at 480 (citing Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 70-71 (1986)). Respondent
asserts that the "investigation costs" it seeks were incurred
prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that
respondent needed for its own purposes. See Brief for Respondent 37-38. The recovery of such expenses unrelated

108 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Opinion of the Court
to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing,
but the problem is that $ 326(f ), which is the entitlement to
monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the
"costs of litigation." 8 $ 11046(f ). Respondent finds itself, in
other words, impaled upon the horns of a dilemma: For the
expenses to be reimbursable under the statute, they must be
costs of litigation; but reimbursement of the costs of litigation cannot alone support standing.9

The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving
respondent authority to inspect petitioner's facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.
It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed
at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.
See Brief for Respondent 36. The latter objective can of
course be "remedial" for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint. If
respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested
would remedy that alleged harm. But there is no such allegation here--and on the facts of the case, there seems no
basis for it. Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondent's generalized interest in deterrence,

8 Section 326(f) reads: "The court, in issuing any final order in any action
brought pursuant to this section, may award costs of litigation (including
reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to the prevailing or the substantially prevailing party whenever the court determines such an award
is appropriate." 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(f).

9 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 123-124, n. 16, that this argument

involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence
that jurisdictional issues be resolved first. It involves us in a construction
of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention
that costs incurred for respondent's own purposes, not in preparation for
litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing), are nonetheless "costs of litigation" under the statute. As we have described
earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect. See supra, at 89.

Opinion of the Court
which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See LosAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S., at 111.

The United States, as amicus curiae, argues that the in-junctive relief does constitute remediation because "there
is a presumption of [future] injury when the defendant hasvoluntarily ceased its illegal activity in response to litigation," even if that occurs before a complaint is filed. Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 27-28, and n. 11. Thismakes a sword out of a shield. The "presumption" the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertionof mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint
that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases thecomplained-of activity. See,

e. g., United States v. W. T.Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632 (1953). It is an immense and

unacceptable stretch to call the presumption into service asa substitute for the allegation of present or threatened injury
upon which initial standing must be based. See Los Angelesv. Lyons, supra, at 109. To accept the Government's view
would be to overrule our clear precedent requiring that theallegations of future injury be particular and concrete.
O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 496-497 (1974). "Past ex-posure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present
case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unac-companied by any continuing, present adverse effects."

Id.,at 495-496; see also Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 320 (1991)

("[T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetitionyet evading review . . . will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced"). Because re-spondent alleges only past infractions of EPCRA, and not a
continuing violation or the likelihood of a future violation,injunctive relief will not redress its injury.

Having found that none of the relief sought by respondentwould likely remedy its alleged injury in fact, we must conclude that respondent lacks standing to maintain this suit,

I join the Court's opinion. I agree that our precedent sup-ports the Court's holding that respondent lacks Article III
standing because its injuries cannot be redressed by a judg-ment that would, in effect, require only the payment of penalties to the United States Treasury. As the Court notes,
ante, at 108, had respondent alleged a continuing or imminent violation of the Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U. S. C. $ 11046, the

requested injunctive relief may well have redressed theasserted injury.

I also agree with the Court's statement that federal courts
should be certain of their jurisdiction before reaching themerits of a case. As the Court acknowledges, however, several of our decisions "have diluted the absolute purity of therule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent
question." Ante, at 101. The opinion of the Court ade-quately describes why the assumption of jurisdiction was defensible in those cases, see ante, at 98-100, and why it is notin this case, see

ante, at 92-93. I write separately to note
that, in my view, the Court's opinion should not be read as
cataloging an exhaustive list of circumstances under whichfederal courts may exercise judgment in "reserv[ing] difficult

questions of . . . jurisdiction when the case alternatively

could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same party,"
Norton v. Mathews, 427 U. S. 524, 532 (1976).

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I agree with the Court that the respondent in this case
lacks Article III standing. I further agree that federal
courts often, and typically should, decide standing questions
at the outset of a case. That order of decision (first jurisdiction then the merits) helps better to restrict the use of the
federal courts to those adversarial disputes that Article III
defines as the federal judiciary's business. But my qualifying words "often" and "typically" are important. The Constitution, in my view, does not require us to replace those
words with the word "always." The Constitution does not
impose a rigid judicial "order of operations," when doing so
would cause serious practical problems.

This Court has previously made clear that courts may "reserv[e] difficult questions of . . . jurisdiction when the case
alternatively could be resolved on the merits in favor of the
same party." Norton v. Mathews, 427 U. S. 524, 532 (1976).
That rule makes theoretical sense, for the difficulty of the
jurisdictional question makes reasonable the court's jurisdictional assumption. And that rule makes enormous practical sense. Whom does it help to have appellate judges
spend their time and energy puzzling over the correct answer to an intractable jurisdictional matter, when (assuming an easy answer on the substantive merits) the same
party would win or lose regardless? More importantly, to
insist upon a rigid "order of operations" in today's world of
federal-court caseloads that have grown enormously over a
generation means unnecessary delay and consequent added
cost. See L. Mecham, Judicial Business of the United States

cases filed per judgeship, and district court caseloads in-creased from 341 to 490 cases filed per judgeship). It means
a more cumbersome system. It thereby increases, to atleast a small degree, the risk of the "justice delayed" that
means "justice denied."For this reason, I would not make the ordinary sequence
an absolute requirement. Nor, even though the case beforeus is ordinary, not exceptional, would I simply reserve judgment about the matter. Ante, at 110-111 (O'Connor, J.,concurring). I therefore join only Parts I and IV of the
Court's opinion.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins asto Parts I, III, and IV, and with whom

Justice Ginsburgjoins as to Part III, concurring in the judgment.

This case presents two questions: (1) whether the Emer-gency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986
(EPCRA), 42 U. S. C. $ 11001 et seq., confers federal jurisdic-tion over citizen suits for wholly past violations; and (2) if so,
whether respondent has standing under Article III of theConstitution. The Court has elected to decide the constitutional question first and, in doing so, has created new consti-tutional law. Because it is always prudent to avoid passing
unnecessarily on an undecided constitutional question, see
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis,J., concurring), the Court should answer the statutory question first. Moreover, because EPCRA, properly construed,does not confer jurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly past
violations, the Court should leave the constitutional questionfor another day.

I
The statutory issue in this case can be viewed in one oftwo ways: whether EPCRA confers "jurisdiction" over citizen suits for wholly past violations, or whether the statute

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
creates such a "cause of action." Under either analysis, theCourt has the power to answer the statutory question first.

EPCRA frames the question in terms of "jurisdiction."Section 326(c) states:

"The district court shall have jurisdiction in actionsbrought under [$ 326(a)] against an owner or operator of
a facility to enforce the requirement concerned and toimpose any civil penalty provided for violation of that
requirement." 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(c).
Thus, if $ 326(a) authorizes citizen suits for wholly past viola-tions, the district court has jurisdiction over these actions; if

it does not, the court lacks jurisdiction.Given the text of the statute, it is not surprising that the
parties and the District Court framed the question in juris-dictional terms. Respondent's complaint alleged that the
District Court had "subject matter jurisdiction under Sec-tion 326(a) of EPCRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(a)." App. 3. The
merits questions that were raised by respondent's complaintwere whether Steel Company violated EPCRA and, if so,
what relief should be granted. The District Court, however,made no ruling on the merits when it granted Steel Company's motion to dismiss. It held that dismissal was re-quired because respondent had merely alleged "a failure to
timely file the required reports, a violation of the Act forwhich there is no jurisdiction for a citizen suit." App. to

question as a jurisdictional one in its briefs before thisCourt.

The threshold issue concerning the meaning of $ 326 is vir-tually identical to the question that we decided in Gwaltney

of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484U. S. 49 (1987). In that case, we considered whether $ 505(a)
of the Clean Water Act allows suits for wholly past viola-tions.

3 We unanimously characterized that question as a

matter of "jurisdiction":

"In this case, we must decide whether $ 505(a) of theClean Water Act, also known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a), confers federaljurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly past violations."

National Railroad PassengerCorp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U. S.

453, 456, 465, n. 13 (1974)). If we resolve the comparablestatutory issue in the same way in this case, federal courts
will have no jurisdiction to address the merits in future simi-lar cases. Thus, this is not a case in which the choice between resolving the statutory question or the standingquestion first is a choice between a merits issue and a jurisclusion that EPCRA confers federal jurisdiction over citizen lawsuits for
past violations").

2 Brief for Petitioner 12 ("A statute conferring jurisdiction on the federal

courts should . . . be strictly construed, and any doubts resolved against
jurisdiction. Here there are serious doubts that Congress intended citizens to sue for past EPCRA violations, and all citizen plaintiffs can highlight is a slight difference in language and attempt to stretch that difference into federal jurisdiction"); see also id., at 26, 30.

several weeks before respondents filed their complaint, the District Court
lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over respondents' action." Gwaltney,

dictional issue; rather, it is a choice between two jurisdic-tional issues.

We have routinely held that when presented with two ju-risdictional questions, the Court may choose which one to
answer first. In Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 (1972),for example, we were presented with a choice between a
statutory jurisdictional question and a question of Article IIIstanding. In that case, the United States, as respondent,
argued that petitioner lacked standing under the Adminis-trative Procedure Act and under the Constitution.

4 Rather

than taking up the constitutional issue, the Court stated:

"Where . . . Congress has authorized public officials toperform certain functions according to law, and has provided by statute for judicial review of those actionsunder certain circumstances, the inquiry as to standing
must begin with a determination of whether the statutein question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff." Id., at 732 (emphasis added).

decide whether petitioner had suffered a sufficient injuryunder Article III.

Similarly, in Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467U. S. 340 (1984), the Court was faced with a choice between
a statutory jurisdictional issue and a question of Article III
standing. The Court of Appeals had held that the respond-ents had standing under both the statute and the Constitution. 698 F. 2d 1239, 1244-1252 (CADC 1983). On writ ofcertiorari to this Court, the United States, as petitioner, argued both issues: that the respondents did not come withinthe "zone of interests" of the statute, and that they did not
have standing under Article III of the Constitution.5 Aunanimous Court bypassed the constitutional standing question in order to decide the statutory question. It thereforeconstrued the statute, and concluded that respondents could
not bring suit under the statute. The only mention of theconstitutional question came in a footnote at the end of the
opinion: "Since congressional preclusion of judicial review is
in effect jurisdictional, we need not address the standingissue decided by the Court of Appeals in this case."

Corp., 414 U. S., at 456, 465, and n. 13).

Finally, in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441U. S. 91 (1979), we were also faced with a choice between a

statutory and constitutional jurisdictional question. Id., at93 ("This case presents both statutory and constitutional
questions concerning standing to sue under Title VIII").
The statutory question was whether respondents had standing to sue under $ 812 of the Fair Housing Act. The Court,

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
reluctant to address the constitutional question, opted to decide the statutory question first so as to avoid the constitutional question if possible:

"The issue [of the meaning of $ 812] is a critical one, for
if the District Court correctly understood and applied

$ 812 [in denying respondents standing under the statute], we do not reach the question whether the minimum
requirements of Art. III have been satisfied. If the
Court of Appeals is correct [in holding that respondents
have statutory standing], however, then the constitutional question is squarely presented." Id., at 101.

See also Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 164 (1997) (footnote
omitted) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (stating that "[t]he first question in the present case is whether the [Endangered Species
Act's] citizen-suit provision . . . negates the zone-of-interests
test," and turning to the constitutional standing question
only after determining that standing existed under the statute); Food and Commercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc.,
517 U. S. 544, 548-550 (1996) (analyzing the statutory question before turning to the constitutional standing question);

(CADC 1991) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring
in denial of petition for review) (courts exceed the scope of
their power "only if the ground passed over is jurisdictional
and the ground rested upon is non-jurisdictional, for courts
properly rest on one jurisdictional ground instead of another"). Thus, our precedents clearly support the proposition that, given a choice between two jurisdictional questions--one statutory and the other constitutional--the Court
has the power to answer the statutory question first.

Rather than framing the question in terms of "jurisdiction," it is also possible to characterize the statutory issue in
this case as whether respondent's complaint states a "cause

of action." 6 Framed this way, it is also clear that we have
the power to decide the statutory question first. As our
holding in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 681-685 (1946), demonstrates, just as a court always has jurisdiction to determine
its own jurisdiction, United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S.
258, 290 (1947), a federal court also has jurisdiction to decide
whether a plaintiff who alleges that she has been injured by
a violation of federal law has stated a cause of action.7 Indeed, Bell held that we have jurisdiction to decide this question even when it is unclear whether the plaintiff 's injuries
can be redressed.8 Thus, Bell demonstrates that the Court

6 As Justice Cardozo stated, " ` "cause of action" may mean one thing for
one purpose and something different for another.' " Davis v. Passman,
442 U. S. 228, 237 (1979) (quoting United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil
Co., 288 U. S. 62, 67-68 (1933)). Under one meaning of the term, it is clear
that citizens have a "cause of action" to sue under the statute. Under that
meaning, "cause of action is a question of whether a particular plaintiff is
a member of the class of litigants that may, as a matter of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court." Davis, 442 U. S., at 240, and n. 18
(emphasis deleted); see also id., at 239 ("The concept of a `cause of action'
is employed specifically to determine who may judicially enforce the statutory rights or obligations" (emphasis added)). Since EPCRA expressly
gives citizens the right to sue, 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(a)(1), there is no question
that citizens are "member[s] of the class of litigants that may, as a matter
of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court," Davis, 442 U. S., at
240, and n. 18.

7 "Jurisdiction . . . is not defeated . . . by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover." Bell, 327 U. S., at 682.

8 In Bell, a precursor to Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,

403 U. S. 388 (1971), petitioners brought suit in federal court "to recover
damages in excess of $3,000 from . . . agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation" for allegedly violating their Fourth and Fifth Amendment
rights. 327 U. S., at 679. The question whether petitioners' injuries
were redressable--"whether federal courts can grant money recovery for
damages said to have been suffered as a result of federal officers violating
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments"--was an open one, id., at 684 (which
the Court did not decide until Bivens, 403 U. S., at 389). Nonetheless,

has the power to decide whether a cause of action exists evenwhen it is unclear whether the plaintiff has standing.

National Railroad Passenger Corp. also makes it clearthat we have the power to decide this question before addressing other threshold issues. In that case, we were faced
with the interrelated questions of "whether the Amtrak Act
can be read to create a private right of action to enforce
compliance with its provisions; whether a federal district
court has jurisdiction under the terms of the Act to entertain
such a suit [under 28 U. S. C. $ 1337 10]; and whether respondent has [statutory] standing to bring such a suit." 414 U. S.,
at 455-456. In choosing its method of analysis, the Court
stated:

even though it was unclear whether there was a remedy, the Court held
that federal courts have jurisdiction to determine whether a cause of
action exists. 327 U. S., at 685.

9 The Court incorrectly states that I "used to understand the fundamental distinction between arguing no cause of action and arguing no Article
III redressability," ante, at 96. The Court gives me too much credit. I
have never understood any fundamental difference between arguing: (1)
plaintiff's complaint does not allege a cause of action because the law does
"not provide a remedy" for the plaintiff's injury; and (2) plaintiff's injury
is "not redressable." In Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 398 (1979), we stated that the absence of
a remedy, i. e., the lack of redressability, was not the sort of jurisdictional
issue that the Court raises on its own motion. That was the law when
that case was decided, and it would still be the law today if the Court had
not supplemented the standing analysis set forth in Baker v. Carr, 369
U. S. 186, 204 (1962), with its current fascination with "redressability."
What has changed is not the admittedly imperfect state of my understanding, but rather the state of the Court's standing doctrine.

10 Section 1337 states, in relevant part: "[D]istrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of
Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against
restraints and monopolies." 28 U. S. C. $ 1337(a); see also Potomac Passengers Assn. v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 475 F. 2d 325, 339 (CADC

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
"[H]owever phrased, the threshold question clearly iswhether the Amtrak Act or any other provision of law

creates a cause of action whereby a private party suchas the respondent can enforce duties and obligations imposed by the Act; for it is only if such a right of action
exists that we need consider whether the respondenthad standing to bring the action and whether the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain it." Id., at 456(emphasis added).

11

After determining that there was no cause of action under
the statute, the Court concluded: "Since we hold that noright of action exists, questions of standing and jurisdiction

become immaterial." Id., at 465, n. 13.12Thus, regardless of whether we characterize this issue
in terms of "jurisdiction" or "causes of action," the Court
clearly has the power to address the statutory question first.
Gwaltney itself powerfully demonstrates this point. As
noted, that case involved a statutory question virtually iden-tical to the one presented here--whether the statute permitted citizens to sue for wholly past violations. While the
Court framed the question as one of "jurisdiction," supra, at
114, it could also be said that the case presented the question
whether the plaintiffs had a "cause of action." Regardless
of the label, the Court resolved the statutory question without pausing to consider whether the plaintiffs had standing

11 The Court distinguished this "threshold question" from respondent's
claim "on the merits," id., at 455, n. 3.

12 In insisting that the Article III standing question must be answered

first, the Court finds itself in a logical dilemma. For if "A" (whether a
cause of action exists) can be decided before "B" (whether there is statutory standing), id., at 456, 465, n. 13; and if "B" (whether there is statutory
standing) can be decided before "C" (whether there is Article III standing), e. g., Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 353, n. 4
(1984); then logic dictates that "A" (whether a cause of action exists) can
be decided before "C" (whether there is Article III standing)--precisely
the issue of this case.

to sue for wholly past violations.13 Of course, the fact that
we did not discuss standing in Gwaltney does not establish
that the plaintiffs had standing there. Nonetheless, it supports the proposition that--regardless of how the issue is
characterized--the Court has the power to address the virtually identical statutory question in this case as well.

The Court disagrees, arguing that the standing question
must be addressed first. Ironically, however, before "first"
addressing standing, the Court takes a long excursion that
entirely loses sight of the basic reason why standing is a
matter of such importance to the proper functioning of the
judicial process. The "gist of the question of standing" is
whether plaintiffs have "alleged such a personal stake in the
outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon
which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions." 14 The Court completely disregards this core purpose of standing in its discussion of
"hypothetical jurisdiction." Not only is that portion of the
Court's opinion pure dictum because it is entirely unnecessary to an explanation of the Court's decision; it is also not
informed by any adversary submission by either party.
Neither the topic of "hypothetical jurisdiction," nor any of
the cases analyzed, distinguished, and criticized in Part III,
was the subject of any comment in any of the briefs submitted by the parties or their amici. It therefore did not benefit from the "concrete adverseness" that the standing doctrine is meant to ensure. The discussion, in short, "comes

13 In Gwaltney, in addition to answering the question whether the statute confers jurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly past violations, we
considered whether the allegation of ongoing injury sufficed to support
jurisdiction. The fact that we discussed "standing" in connection with
that secondary issue, 484 U. S., at 65-66, adds significance to the omission
of even a passing reference to any standing issue in connection with the
principal holding.

to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by thisCourt from the beginning." Ante, at 101; see also Muskrat

v. United States, 219 U. S. 346, 362 (1911) (stressing that Ar-ticle III limits federal courts to "deciding cases or controversies arising between opposing parties").15

15 The Court boldly distinguishes away no fewer than five of our precedents. In each of these five cases, the Court avoided deciding a jurisdictional issue by assuming that jurisdiction existed for the purpose of that
case. In Norton v. Mathews, 427 U. S. 524, 532 (1976), for example, we
stated:

"It . . . is evident that, whichever disposition we undertake, the effect
is the same. It follows that there is no need to decide the theoretical
question of jurisdiction in this case. In the past, we similarly have reserved difficult questions of our jurisdiction when the case alternatively
could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same party. See Secretary
of the Navy v. Avrech, 418 U. S. 676 (1974). The Court has done this
even when the original reason for granting certiorari was to resolve the
jurisdictional issue. See United States v. Augenblick, 393 U. S. 348, 349-
352 (1969). . . . Making the assumption, then, without deciding, that our
jurisdiction in this cause is established, we affirm the judgment in favor
of the Secretary . . . ."

See also Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U. S. 707, 720-722 (1975) (opinion of
Rehnquist, J.) (declining to reach "subtle and complex" jurisdictional
issue and assuming that jurisdiction existed); Secretary of Navy v. Avrech,
418 U. S. 676, 677-678 (1974) (per curiam) ("[a]ssuming, arguendo, that the
District Court had jurisdiction"; leaving "to a future case the resolution of
the jurisdictional issue"); Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit,
398 U. S. 74, 89 (1970) ("Whether the Council's action was administrative
action not reviewable in this Court, or whether it is reviewable here,
plainly petitioner has not made a case for the extraordinary relief of mandamus or prohibition"); United States v. Augenblick, 393 U. S. 348, 351-352
(1969) (assuming, arguendo, that jurisdiction existed).

Moreover, in addition to the five cases that the Court distinguishes,
there are other cases that support the notion that a court can assume

(1973) ("Whether there exists judicial power to hear the state law claims
against the County is, in short, a subtle and complex question with farreaching implications. But we do not consider it appropriate to resolve
this difficult issue in the present case, for we have concluded that even

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The doctrine of "hypothetical jurisdiction" is irrelevantbecause this case presents us with a choice between two

threshold questions that are intricately interrelated--asthere is only a standing problem if the statute confers jurisdiction over suits for wholly past violations. The Court'sopinion reflects this fact, as its analysis of the standing issue
is predicated on the hypothesis that $ 326 may be read toconfer jurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly past violations. If, as I think it should, the Court were to reject thathypothesis and construe $ 326,

reaching the constitutional challenge to that court's jurisdiction . . . .
Even assuming such appellate power to exist . . . , [the Court of Appeals
erred]"); see also Ellis v. Dyson, 421 U. S. 426, 436 (1975) (Rehnquist, J.,
concurring) ("While it would have been more in keeping with conventional
adjudication had [the District Court] first inquired as to the existence of
a case or controversy, . . . I cannot fault the District Court for disposing
of the case on what it quite properly regarded at that time as an authoritative ground of decision. Indeed, this Court has on occasion followed
essentially the same practice").

Because this case involves a choice between two threshold questions
that are intricately interrelated, I do not take a position on the propriety
of courts assuming jurisdiction. Nonetheless, I strongly disagree with
the Court's decision to reach out and decide this question, especially in
light of the fact that we have not had the benefit of briefing and argument.
See Philbrook, 421 U. S., at 721 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.) (declining to
answer a "complex question of federal jurisdiction" because of "the absence of substantial aid from the briefs of either of the parties"); Avrech,
418 U. S., at 677 ("Without the benefit of further oral argument, we are
unwilling to decide the difficult jurisdictional issue which the parties have
briefed"); ante, at 99 (noting that the Avrech Court "was unwilling to decide the jurisdictional question without oral argument" and emphasizing
the importance of zealous advocacy to sharpen issues).

16 Indeed, the Court acknowledges--as it must--that the Court has the

power to construe the statute, as it is impossible to resolve the standing
issue without construing some provisions of EPCRA. Thus, in order to
determine whether respondent's investigation and prosecution costs are
sufficient to confer standing, the Court construes $ 326(f) of EPCRA,
which authorizes the district court to "award costs of litigation" to the
prevailing party. Ante, at 107-108. Yet if $ 326(f) were construed to

would be entirely unnecessary. Thus, ironically, the Courtis engaged in a version of the "hypothetical jurisdiction" that

it has taken pains to condemn at some length.

II
There is an important reason for addressing the statutoryquestion first: to avoid unnecessarily passing on an undecided

constitutional question. New York Transit Authority v.Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 582-583 (1979); Ashwander v. TVA,
297 U. S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).17Whether correct or incorrect, the Court's constitutional holding represents a significant extension of prior case law.The Court's conclusion that respondent does not have
standing comes from a mechanistic application of the "re-dressability" aspect of our standing doctrine. "Redressability," of course, does not appear anywhere in the text of theConstitution. Instead, it is a judicial creation of the past 25
years, see Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 38, 41-46 (1976); Linda R. S. v. Richard D.,410 U. S. 614, 617-618 (1973)--a judicial interpretation of the

"Case" requirement of Article III, Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559-561 (1992).18

cover the cost of the investigation that preceded the filing of respondent's
complaint, even under the Court's reasoning respondent would have alleged a "redressable" injury and would have standing. See ibid.

17 There are two other reasons that counsel in favor of answering the

statutory question first. First, it is the statutory question that has divided the courts of appeals and that we granted certiorari to resolve. See
Pet. for Cert. i. Second, the meaning of the statute is a matter of general
and national importance, whereas the Court's answer to the constitutional
question depends largely on a construction of the allegations of this particular complaint, ante, at 104 ("We turn now to the particulars of respondent's complaint to see how it measures up to Article III's requirements").

18 In an attempt to demonstrate that redressability has always been a

component of the standing doctrine, the Court cites our decision in Marye
v. Parsons, 114 U. S. 325 (1885), a case in which neither the word "standing" nor the word "redressability" appears.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
In every previous case in which the Court has denied
standing because of a lack of redressability, the plaintiff was
challenging some governmental action or inaction. Leeke v.
Timmerman, 454 U. S. 83, 85-87 (1981) (per curiam) (suit
against Director of the Department of Corrections and another prison official); Simon, 426 U. S., at 28 (suit against the
Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 493 (1975) (suit
against the town of Penfield and members of Penfield's Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards); Linda R. S., 410 U. S., at
615-616, 619 (suit against prosecutor); see also Renne v.
Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 314 (1991) (suit against the city and
County of San Francisco, its board of supervisors, and other
local officials).19 None of these cases involved an attempt by
one private party to impose a statutory sanction on another
private party.20

In addition, in every other case in which this Court has
held that there is no standing because of a lack of redressability, the injury to the plaintiff by the defendant was indirect (e. g., dependent on the action of a third party). This is
true in the two cases that the Court cites for the "redressability" prong, ante, at 103; see also Simon, 426 U. S., at
40-46 ("[T]he `case or controversy' limitation of Art. III . . .
requires that a federal court act only to redress injury that
fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,

19 Although the Court discussed redressability, Renne did not in fact
turn on that issue. While the Court stated that "[t]here is reason to
doubt . . . that the injury alleged . . . can be redressed" by the relief
sought, 501 U. S., at 319, it then went on to hold that the claims were
nonjusticiable because "respondents have not demonstrated a live controversy ripe for resolution by the federal courts," id., at 315, 320-324.

20 This distinction is significant, as our standing doctrine is rooted in

separation-of-powers concerns. E. g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504
U. S. 555, 573-578 (1992); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984); see
also infra, at 129-130.

and not injury that results from the independent action ofsome third party not before the court" (emphasis added));

Warth, 422 U. S., at 504-508 (stating that "the indirectnessof the injury . . . may make it substantially more difficult to
meet the minimum requirement of Art. III," and holding thatthe injury at issue was too indirect to be redressable), as
well as in every other case in which the Court denied stand-ing because of a lack of redressability,

Leeke, 454 U. S., at86-87 (injury indirect because it turned on the action of a

prosecutor, a party not before the Court); Linda R. S., 410U. S., at 617-618 (stating that "[t]he party who invokes [ judicial] power must be able to show . . . that he has sustainedor is immediately in danger of sustaining some

direct injury"(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); injury indirect because it turned on the action of the father, aparty not before the Court); see also 3 K. Davis & R. Pierce,
Administrative Law Treatise 30 (3d ed. 1994).21 Thus, as faras I am aware, the Court has never held--until today--that
a plaintiff who is directly injured 22 by a defendant lacksstanding to sue because of a lack of redressability.

23

21 "It is an established principle that to entitle a private individual to
invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger
of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that action . . . ." Ex parte
Le'vitt, 302 U. S. 633, 634 (1937).

22 Assuming that EPCRA authorizes suits for wholly past violations,

then Congress has created a legal right in having EPCRA reports filed on
time. Although this is not a traditional injury:

"[W]e must be sensitive to the articulation of new rights of action that do
not have clear analogs in our common-law tradition. . . . Congress has the
power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give
rise to a case or controversy where none existed before . . . ." Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,
455 U. S. 363, 373-374 (1982); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500 (1975).

23 In another context, the Court has specified that there is a critical distinction between whether a defendant is directly or indirectly harmed.
In Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, a case involving a challenge to Executive action, the Court stated:

127Cite as: 523 U. S. 83 (1998)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The Court acknowledges that respondent would have hadstanding if Congress had authorized some payment to respondent. Ante, at 106 ("[T]he civil penalties authorized bythe statute . . . might be viewed as a sort of compensation or
redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent").Yet the Court fails to specify why payment to respondent--
even if only a peppercorn--would redress respondent's inju-ries, while payment to the Treasury does not. Respondent
clearly believes that the punishment of Steel Company, alongwith future deterrence of Steel Company and others, redresses its injury, and there is no basis in our previous stand-ing holdings to suggest otherwise.

When one private party is injured by another, the injurycan be redressed in at least two ways: by awarding compensatory damages or by imposing a sanction on the wrongdoerthat will minimize the risk that the harm-causing conduct
will be repeated. Thus, in some cases a tort is redressed byan award of punitive damages; even when such damages are
payable to the sovereign, they provide a form of redress forthe individual as well.

History supports the proposition that punishment ordeterrence can redress an injury. In past centuries in
England,24 in the American Colonies, and in the United

"When the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or
inaction, the nature and extent of facts that must be averred (at the summary judgment stage) or proved (at the trial stage) in order to establish
standing depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an
object of the action (or forgone action) at issue. If he is, there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and
that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it. When,
however, as in this case, a plaintiff's asserted injury arises from the government's allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone
else, much more is needed. In that circumstance, causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable)
third party to the government action or inaction--and perhaps on the
response of others as well." 504 U. S., at 561-562 (emphasis in original).

24 "Several scholars have attempted to trace the historical origins of private prosecution in the United States. Without exception, these scholars
have determined that the notion of private prosecutions originated in

128 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
States,25 private persons regularly prosecuted criminal
cases. The interest in punishing the defendant and deterring violations of law by the defendant and others was sufficient to support the "standing" of the private prosecutor
even if the only remedy was the sentencing of the defendant
to jail or to the gallows. Given this history, the Framers of
Article III surely would have considered such proceedings
to be "Cases" that would "redress" an injury even though
the party bringing suit did not receive any monetary
compensation.26

The Court's expanded interpretation of the redressability requirement has another consequence. Under EPCRA,

early common law England, where the legal system primarily relied upon
the victim or the victim's relatives or friends to bring a criminal to justice.
According to these historians, private prosecutions developed in England
as a means of facilitating private vengeance." Bessler, The Public Interest and the Unconstitutionality of Private Prosecutors, 47 Ark. L. Rev.
511, 515 (1994) (footnotes omitted).

25 "American citizens continued to privately prosecute criminal cases in

many locales during the nineteenth century. In Philadelphia, for example,
all types of cases were privately prosecuted, with assault and battery
prosecutions being the most common. However, domestic disputes short
of assault also came before the court. Thus, `parents of young women
prosecuted men for seduction; husbands prosecuted their wives' paramours for adultery; wives prosecuted their husbands for desertion.' Although many state courts continued to sanction the practice of private
prosecutions without significant scrutiny during the nineteenth century, a
few state courts outlawed the practice." Id., at 518-519 (footnotes omitted); A. Steinberg, The Transformation of Criminal Justice: Philadelphia,
1800-1880, p. 5 (1989) ("Private prosecution and the minor judiciary were
firmly rooted in Philadelphia's colonial past. Both were examples of the
creative American adaptation of the English common law. By the 17th
century, private prosecution was a fundamental part of English common
law"); see also F. Goodnow, Principles of the Administrative Law of the
United States 412-413 (1905).

26 When such a party obtains a judgment that imposes sanctions on the

wrongdoer, it is proper to presume that the wrongdoer will be less likely
to repeat the injurious conduct that prompted the litigation. The lessening of the risk of future harm is a concrete benefit.

Congress gave enforcement power to state and local gov-ernments. 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(a)(2). Under the Court's reasoning, however, state and local governments would nothave standing to sue for past violations, as a payment to
the Treasury would no more "redress" the injury of these
governments than it would redress respondent's injury.This would be true

even if Congress explicitly granted state
and local governments this power. Such a conclusion isunprecedented.

It could be argued that the Court's decision is rooted inanother separation-of-powers concern: that this citizen suit
somehow interferes with the Executive's power to "take
Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II, $ 3. It
is hard to see, however, how EPCRA's citizen-suit provision
impinges on the power of the Executive. As an initial matter, this is not a case in which respondent merely possesses
the " `undifferentiated public interest' " in seeing EPCRA enforced. Ante, at 106; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 577. Here, respondent--whose members
live near Steel Company--has alleged a sufficiently particularized injury under our precedents. App. 5 (complaint alleges that respondent's members "reside, own property, engage in recreational activities, breathe the air, and/or use
areas near [Steel Company's] facility").

Moreover, under the Court's own reasoning, respondent
would have had standing if Congress had authorized some
payment to respondent. Ante, at 106 ("[T]he civil penalties
authorized by the statute . . . might be viewed as a sort of
compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable
to respondent"). This conclusion is unexceptional given that
respondent has a more particularized interest than a plaintiff
in a qui tam suit, an action that is deeply rooted in our history. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537,
541, n. 4 (1943) (" `Statutes providing for actions by a common informer, who himself has no interest whatever in the

tam actions authorized by First Congress); see also Lujan v.Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 572-573.

Yet it is unclear why the separation-of-powers questionshould turn on whether the plaintiff receives monetary compensation. In either instance, a private citizen is enforcingthe law. If separation of powers does not preclude standing
when Congress creates a legal right that authorizes compen-sation to the plaintiff, it is unclear why separation of powers
should dictate a contrary result when Congress has createda legal right but has directed that payment be made to the
Federal Treasury.Indeed, in this case (assuming for present purposes that
respondent correctly reads the statute) not only has Con-gress authorized standing, but the Executive Branch has
also endorsed its interpretation of Article III. Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 7-30. It is this Court's
decision, not anything that Congress or the Executive hasdone, that encroaches on the domain of other branches of the
Federal Government.27

27 Ironically, although the Court insists that the standing question must
be answered first, it relies on the merits when it answers the standing
question. Proof that Steel Company repeatedly violated the law by failing to file EPCRA reports for eight years should suffice to establish the
District Court's power to impose sanctions, or at least to decide what
sanction, if any, is appropriate. Evidence that Steel Company was ignorant of the law and has taken steps to avoid future violations is highly
relevant to the merits of the question whether any remedy is necessary,
but surely does not deprive the District Court of the power to decide the

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
It is thus quite clear that the Court's holding today rep-resents a significant new development in our constitutional

jurisprudence. Moreover, it is equally clear that the Courthas the power to answer the statutory question first. It is,
therefore, not necessary to reject the Court's resolution ofthe standing issue in order to conclude that it would be prudent to answer the question of statutory construction beforeannouncing new constitutional doctrine.

III
EPCRA's citizen-suit provision states, in relevant part:

"[A]ny person may commence a civil action on his ownbehalf against . . . [a]n owner or operator of a facility for

failure to do any of the following: . . . Complete andsubmit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this
title . . . [or] [c]omplete and submit a toxic chemical re-lease form under section 11023(a) of this title." 42
U. S. C. $$ 11046(a)(1)(A)(iii)-(iv).
Unfortunately, this language is ambiguous. It couldmean, as the Sixth Circuit has held, that a citizen only has

the right to sue for a "failure . . . to complete and submit"the required forms. Under this reading, once the owner or
operator has filed the forms, the district court no longer hasjurisdiction. Atlantic States Legal Foundation v. United
Musical, 61 F. 3d 473, 475 (1995). Alternatively, it could be,as the Seventh Circuit held, that the phrases "under section
11022(a)" and "under section 11023(a)" incorporate the re-quirements of those sections, including the requirement that
the reports be filed by particular dates. 90 F. 3d 1237,1243 (1996).

does not suffice to make a case moot although it is one of the factors to be
considered in determining the appropriateness of granting an injunction

132 STEEL CO. v. CITIZENS FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Although the language of the citizen-suit provision is ambiguous, other sections of EPCRA indicate that Congress did
not intend to confer jurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly
past violations. First, EPCRA requires the private litigant
to give the alleged violator notice at least 60 days before
bringing suit. 42 U. S. C. $ 11046(d)(1).28 In Gwaltney, we
considered the import of a substantially identical notice requirement, and concluded that it indicated a congressional
intent to allow suit only for ongoing and future violations:

"[T]he purpose of notice to the alleged violator is to give
it an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance
with the Act and thus likewise render unnecessary a
citizen suit. If we assume, as respondents urge, that
citizen suits may target wholly past violations, the requirement of notice to the alleged violator becomes
gratuitous. Indeed, respondents, in propounding their
interpretation of the Act, can think of no reason for Congress to require such notice other than that `it seemed
right' to inform an alleged violator that it was about to
be sued. Brief for Respondents 14." 484 U. S., at 60.

Second, EPCRA places a ban on citizen suits once EPA has
commenced an enforcement action. 42 U. S C. $ 11046(e).29
In Gwaltney, we considered a similar provision and concluded that it indicated a congressional intent to prohibit citizen suits for wholly past violations:

28 "No action may be commenced under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section prior to 60 days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged
violation to the Administrator, the State in which the alleged violation
occurs, and the alleged violator. Notice under this paragraph shall be
given in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe by regulation."

29 "No action may be commenced under subsection (a) of this section

against an owner or operator of a facility if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action
to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty under
this Act with respect to the violation of the requirement."

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
"The bar on citizen suits when governmental enforce-ment action is under way suggests that the citizen suit

is meant to supplement rather than supplant govern-mental action. . . . Permitting citizen suits for wholly
past violations of the Act could undermine the supple-mentary role envisioned for the citizen suit. This danger is best illustrated by an example. Suppose that theAdministrator identified a violator of the Act and issued
a compliance order . . . . Suppose further that the Ad-ministrator agreed not to assess or otherwise seek civil
penalties on the condition that the violator take someextreme corrective action, such as to install particularly
effective but expensive machinery, that it otherwisewould not be obliged to take. If citizens could file suit,
months or years later, in order to seek the civil penaltiesthat the Administrator chose to forgo, then the Administrator's discretion to enforce the Act in the public inter-est would be curtailed considerably. The same might
be said of the discretion of state enforcement authori-ties. Respondents' interpretation of the scope of the
citizen suit would change the nature of the citizens' rolefrom interstitial to potentially intrusive." 484 U. S., at
60-61.
Finally, even if these two provisions did not resolve theissue, our settled policy of adopting acceptable constructions

of statutory provisions in order to avoid the unnecessary ad-judication of constitutional questions--here, the unresolved
standing question--strongly supports a construction of thestatute that does not authorize suits for wholly past violations. As we stated in Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.568, 575 (1988): "This cardinal principle has its roots in Chief

Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court in Murray v. Schoo-ner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804), and has for so
long been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate."See also NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490,

QUALITY KING DISTRIBUTORS, INC. v. L'ANZARESEARCH INTERNATIONAL, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1470. Argued December 8, 1997--Decided March 9, 1998
Respondent L'anza, a California manufacturer, sells its hair care products

in this country exclusively to distributors who have agreed to resell
within limited geographic areas and only to authorized retailers.
L'anza promotes its domestic sales with extensive advertising and special retailer training. In foreign markets, however, it does not engage
in comparable advertising or promotion; its foreign prices are substantially lower than its domestic prices. It appears that after L'anza's
United Kingdom distributor arranged for the sale of several tons of
L'anza products, affixed with copyrighted labels, to a distributor in
Malta, that distributor sold the goods to petitioner, which imported
them back into this country without L'anza's permission and then resold
them at discounted prices to unauthorized retailers. L'anza filed suit,
alleging that petitioner's actions violated L'anza's exclusive rights under
the Copyright Act of 1976 (Act), 17 U. S. C. $$ 106, 501, and 602, to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted material in the United States. The
District Court rejected petitioner's "first sale" defense under $ 109(a)
and entered summary judgment for L'anza. Concluding that $ 602(a),
which gives copyright owners the right to prohibit the unauthorized
importation of copies, would be "meaningless" if $ 109(a) provided a
defense, the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The first sale doctrine endorsed in $ 109(a) is applicable to imported

copies. Pp. 140-154.

(a) In Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, 349-350, this Court
held that the exclusive right to "vend" under the copyright statute
then in force applied only to the first sale of a copyrighted work. Congress subsequently codified Bobbs-Merrill's first sale doctrine in the
Act. Section 106(3) gives the copyright holder the exclusive right "to
distribute copies . . . by sale or other transfer of ownership," but $ 109(a)
provides: "Notwithstanding . . . [$ ]106(3), the owner of a particular copy
. . . lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without the authority
of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of
that copy . . . ." Although the first sale doctrine prevents L'anza from
treating unauthorized resales by its domestic distributors as an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute, L'anza claims that $ 602(a),
properly construed, prohibits its foreign distributors from reselling

its products to American vendors unable to buy from its domestic distributors. Pp. 140-143.

(b) The statutory language clearly demonstrates that the right
granted by $ 602(a) is subject to $ 109(a). Significantly, $ 602(a) does
not categorically prohibit the unauthorized importation of copyrighted
materials, but provides that, with three exceptions, such "[i]mportation . . . is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute . . . under
[$ ]106 . . . ." Section 106 in turn expressly states that all of the exclusive rights therein granted--including the distribution right granted by
subsection (3)--are limited by $$ 107 through 120. One of those limitations is provided by $ 109(a), which expressly permits the owner of a
lawfully made copy to sell that copy "[n]otwithstanding the provisions
of [$ ]106(3)." After the first sale of a copyrighted item "lawfully made
under this title," any subsequent purchaser, whether from a domestic or
a foreign reseller, is obviously an "owner" of that item. Read literally,

$ 109(a) unambiguously states that such an owner "is entitled, without
the authority of the copyright owner, to sell" that item. Moreover,
since $ 602(a) merely provides that unauthorized importation is an infringement of an exclusive right "under [$ ]106," and since that limited
right does not encompass resales by lawful owners, $ 602(a)'s literal text
is simply inapplicable to both domestic and foreign owners of L'anza's
products who decide to import and resell them here. Pp. 143-145.

(c) The Court rejects L'anza's argument that $ 602(a), and particularly its exceptions, are superfluous if limited by the first sale doctrine. The short answer is that this argument does not adequately
explain why the words "under [$ ]106" appear in $ 602(a). Moreover,
there are several flaws in L'anza's reasoning that, because $ 602(b)
already prohibits the importation of unauthorized or "piratical" copies,

$ 602(a) must cover nonpiratical ("lawfully made") copies sold by the
copyright owner. First, even if $ 602(a) applied only to piratical copies, it at least would provide a private remedy against the importer,
whereas $ 602(b)'s enforcement is vested in the Customs Service. Second, because $ 109(a)'s protection is available only to the "owner" of a
lawfully made copy, the first sale doctrine would not provide a defense
to a $ 602(a) action against a nonowner such as a bailee. Third, $ 602(a)
applies to a category of copies that are neither piratical nor "lawfully
made under this title": those that are "lawfully made" under another
country's law. Pp. 145-149.

(d) Also rejected is L'anza's argument that because $ 501(a) defines
an "infringer" as one "who violates . . . [$ ]106 . . . , or who imports . . .
in violation of [$ ]602," a violation of the latter type is distinct from one
of the former, and thus not subject to $ 109(a). This argument's force
is outweighed by other statutory considerations, including the fact that

Syllabus

$ 602(a) unambiguously states that the prohibited importation is an
infringement "under [$ ]106," thereby identifying $ 602 violations as a
species of $ 106 violations. More important is the fact that the $ 106
rights are subject to all of the provisions of "[$$ ]107 through 120."
If $ 602(a) functioned independently, none of those sections would limit
its coverage. Pp. 149-151.

(e) The Court finds unpersuasive the Solicitor General's argument
that "importation" describes an act that is not protected by $ 109(a)'s
authorization to a subsequent owner "to sell or otherwise dispose of
the possession of" a copy. An ordinary interpretation of that language includes the right to ship the copy to another person in another
country. More important, the Solicitor General's cramped reading is
at odds with $ 109(a)'s necessarily broad reach. The whole point of the
first sale doctrine is that once the copyright owner places a copyrighted
item in the stream of commerce by selling it, he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution. There is no reason
to assume that Congress intended $ 109(a) to limit the doctrine's scope.
Pp. 151-152.

(f) The wisdom of protecting domestic copyright owners from the unauthorized importation of validly copyrighted copies of their works, and
the fact that the Executive Branch has recently entered into at least
five international trade agreements apparently intended to do just that,
are irrelevant to a proper interpretation of the Act. Pp. 153-154.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 106(3) of the Copyright Act of 1976 (Act), 17U. S. C. $ 106(3), gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to distribute copies of a copyrighted work. Thatexclusive right is expressly limited, however, by the provisions of $$ 107 through 120. Section 602(a) gives the copy-right owner the right to prohibit the unauthorized importation of copies. The question presented by this case iswhether the right granted by $ 602(a) is also limited by $$ 107
through 120. More narrowly, the question is whether the"first sale" doctrine endorsed in $ 109(a) is applicable to imported copies. I

drug stores." App. 54 (declaration of Robert Hall). L'anzapromotes the domestic sales of its products with extensive

advertising in various trade magazines and at point of sale,and by providing special training to authorized retailers.

L'anza also sells its products in foreign markets. In thosemarkets, however, it does not engage in comparable advertising or promotion; its prices to foreign distributorsare 35% to 40% lower than the prices charged to domestic
distributors. In 1992 and 1993, L'anza's distributor in theUnited Kingdom arranged the sale of three shipments to a
distributor in Malta; 1 each shipment contained several tonsof L'anza products with copyrighted labels affixed.

2 The

record does not establish whether the initial purchaser wasthe distributor in the United Kingdom or the distributor in

Malta, or whether title passed when the goods were deliv-ered to the carrier or when they arrived at their destination,
but it is undisputed that the goods were manufactured byL'anza and first sold by L'anza to a foreign purchaser.

It is also undisputed that the goods found their way backto the United States without the permission of L'anza and
were sold in California by unauthorized retailers who hadpurchased them at discounted prices from Quality King Distributors, Inc. (petitioner). There is some uncertainty aboutthe identity of the actual importer, but for the purpose of
our decision we assume that petitioner bought all three ship-ments from the Malta distributor, imported them, and then
resold them to retailers who were not in L'anza's authorizedchain of distribution.

After determining the source of the unauthorized sales,L'anza brought suit against petitioner and several other defendants.3 The complaint alleged that the importation and

U. S. C. $$ 106, 501 and 602 to reproduce and distribute thecopyrighted material in the United States." App. 32. The
District Court rejected petitioner's defense based on the"first sale" doctrine recognized by $ 109 and entered summary judgment in favor of L'anza. Based largely on its con-clusion that $ 602 would be "meaningless" if $ 109 provided a
defense in a case of this kind, the Court of Appeals affirmed.98 F. 3d 1109, 1114 (CA9 1996). Because its decision created
a conflict with the Third Circuit, see Sebastian Int'l, Inc. v.

II
This is an unusual copyright case because L'anza does notclaim that anyone has made unauthorized copies of its copyrighted labels. Instead, L'anza is primarily interested inprotecting the integrity of its method of marketing the products to which the labels are affixed. Although the labelsthemselves have only a limited creative component, our interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions would applyequally to a case involving more familiar copyrighted materials such as sound recordings or books. Indeed, we first en-dorsed the first sale doctrine in a case involving a claim by
a publisher that the resale of its books at discounted pricesinfringed its copyright on the books. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.
Straus, 210 U. S. 339 (1908).4In that case, the publisher, Bobbs-Merrill, had inserted
a notice in its books that any retail sale at a price under

earlier cases. See Kipling v. G. P. Putnam's Sons, 120 F. 631, 634 (CA2

$1 would constitute an infringement of its copyright. Thedefendants, who owned Macy's department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price with-out Bobbs-Merrill's consent. We held that the exclusive
statutory right to "vend" 5 applied only to the first sale of thecopyrighted work:

"What does the statute mean in granting `the soleright of vending the same'? Was it intended to create
a right which would permit the holder of the copyrightto fasten, by notice in a book or upon one of the articles
mentioned within the statute, a restriction upon thesubsequent alienation of the subject-matter of copyright
after the owner had parted with the title to one who hadacquired full dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for it? It is not denied that one who has solda copyrighted article, without restriction, has parted
with all right to control the sale of it. The purchaser ofa book, once sold by authority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again, although he could not publish anew edition of it.

"In this case the stipulated facts show that the bookssold by the appellant were sold at wholesale, and purchased by those who made no agreement as to the con-trol of future sales of the book, and took upon themselves no obligation to enforce the notice printed in thebook, undertaking to restrict retail sales to a price of
one dollar per copy." Id., at 349-350.
The statute in force when Bobbs-Merrill was decided pro-vided that the copyright owner had the exclusive right to

"vend" the copyrighted work.6 Congress subsequently cod5 In 1908, when Bobbs-Merrill was decided, the copyright statute provided that copyright owners had "the sole liberty of printing, reprinting,
publishing, completing, copying, executing, finishing, and vending" their
copyrighted works. Copyright Act of 1891, $ 4952, 26 Stat. 1107 (emphasis added).

ified our holding in Bobbs-Merrill that the exclusive rightto "vend" was limited to first sales of the work.

7 Under the

1976 Act, the comparable exclusive right granted in 17U. S. C. $ 106(3) is the right "to distribute copies . . . by sale

or other transfer of ownership." 8 The comparable limita-tion on that right is provided not by judicial interpretation, but by an express statutory provision. Section 109(a)provides:

"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), theowner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made
under this title, or any person authorized by such owner,is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner,
to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of thatcopy or phonorecord. . . ."

7 Congress codified the first sale doctrine in $ 41 of the Copyright Act
of 1909, ch. 320, 35 Stat. 1084, and again in $ 27 of the 1947 Act, ch. 391,
61 Stat. 660.

8 The full text of $ 106 reads as follows:

"$ 106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works

"Subject to sections 107 through 120, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

"(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;
"(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;
"(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to
the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;

"(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,

Opinion of the Court
The Bobbs-Merrill opinion emphasized the critical distinc-tion between statutory rights and contract rights.

10 In this

case, L'anza relies on the terms of its contracts with its do-mestic distributors to limit their sales to authorized retail

outlets. Because the basic holding in Bobbs-Merrill is nowcodified in $ 109(a) of the Act, and because those domestic
distributors are owners of the products that they purchasedfrom L'anza (the labels of which were "lawfully made under
this title"), L'anza does not, and could not, claim that thestatute would enable L'anza to treat unauthorized resales by
its domestic distributors as an infringement of its exclusiveright to distribute copies of its labels. L'anza does claim,
however, that contractual provisions are inadequate to pro-tect it from the actions of foreign distributors who may resell
L'anza's products to American vendors unable to buy fromL'anza's domestic distributors, and that $ 602(a) of the Act,
properly construed, prohibits such unauthorized competition.To evaluate that submission, we must, of course, consider the
text of $ 602(a). III

The most relevant portion of $ 602(a) provides:

"Importation into the United States, without the author-ity of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies

or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired out-side the United States is an infringement of the excluof any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained." Copyright Act of 1909, ch. 320, $ 41, 35 Stat. 1084; see
also Copyright Act of 1947, ch. 391, $ 27, 61 Stat. 660. It is noteworthy
that $ 109(a) of the 1978 Act does not apply to "any copy"; it applies only
to a copy that was "lawfully made under this title."

10 "We do not think the statute can be given such a construction, and it

is to be remembered that this is purely a question of statutory construction. There is no claim in this case of contract limitation, nor license
agreement controlling the subsequent sales of the book." Bobbs-Merrill
Co. v. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, 350 (1908).

sive right to distribute copies or phonorecords undersection 106, actionable under section 501. . . ."

11

It is significant that this provision does not categorically pro-hibit the unauthorized importation of copyrighted materials.
Instead, it provides that such importation is an infringementof the exclusive right to distribute copies "under section
106." Like the exclusive right to "vend" that was construedin Bobbs-Merrill, the exclusive right to distribute is a limited right. The introductory language in $ 106 expresslystates that all of the exclusive rights granted by that section--including, of course, the distribution right granted bysubsection (3)--are limited by the provisions of $$ 107
through 120.12 One of those limitations, as we have noted,is provided by the terms of $ 109(a), which expressly permit
the owner of a lawfully made copy to sell that copy "[n]ot-withstanding the provisions of section 106(3)."

13

11 The remainder of $ 602(a) reads as follows:
"This subsection does not apply to--

"(1) importation of copies or phonorecords under the authority or for
the use of the Government of the United States or of any State or political
subdivision of a State, but not including copies or phonorecords for use in
schools, or copies of any audiovisual work imported for purposes other
than archival use;

"(2) importation, for the private use of the importer and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more than one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by any person arriving from
outside the United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming
part of such person's personal baggage; or

"(3) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect to no
more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival purposes,
and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its
library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation of such copies
or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction
or distribution, engaged in by such organization in violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2)."

Opinion of the Court
After the first sale of a copyrighted item "lawfully madeunder this title," any subsequent purchaser, whether from a

domestic or from a foreign reseller, is obviously an "owner"of that item. Read literally, $ 109(a) unambiguously states
that such an owner "is entitled, without the authority of thecopyright owner, to sell" that item. Moreover, since $ 602(a)
merely provides that unauthorized importation is an in-fringement of an exclusive right "under section 106," and
since that limited right does not encompass resales by lawfulowners, the literal text of $ 602(a) is simply inapplicable to
both domestic and foreign owners of L'anza's products whodecide to import them and resell them in the United States.

14

Notwithstanding the clarity of the text of $$ 106(3), 109(a),and 602(a), L'anza argues that the language of the Act supports a construction of the right granted by $ 602(a) as "dis-tinct from the right under Section 106(3) standing alone,"
and thus not subject to $ 109(a). Brief for Respondent 15.Otherwise, L'anza argues, both the $ 602(a) right itself and
its exceptions 15 would be superfluous. Moreover, supportedby various amici curiae, including the Solicitor General of
the United States, L'anza contends that its construction issupported by important policy considerations. We consider
these arguments separately.

IV
L'anza advances two primary arguments based on the textof the Act: (1) that $ 602(a), and particularly its three exceptions, are superfluous if limited by the first sale doctrine;and (2) that the text of $ 501 defining an "infringer" refers

26-27, the owner of goods lawfully made under the Act is entitled to the
protection of the first sale doctrine in an action in a United States court
even if the first sale occurred abroad. Such protection does not require
the extraterritorial application of the Act any more than $ 602(a)'s "acquired abroad" language does.

Opinion of the Court

separately to violations of $ 106, on the one hand, and to im-ports in violation of $ 602. The short answer to both of

these arguments is that neither adequately explains why thewords "under section 106" appear in $ 602(a). The Solicitor
General makes an additional textual argument: he contendsthat the word "importation" in $ 602(a) describes an act that
is not protected by the language in $ 109(a) authorizing asubsequent owner "to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of " a copy. Each of these arguments merits separatecomment.

The Coverage of $ 602(a)

Prior to the enactment of $ 602(a), the Act already prohib-ited the importation of "piratical," or unauthorized, copies.

16

Moreover, that earlier prohibition is retained in $ 602(b) ofthe present Act.

17 L'anza therefore argues (as do the Solicitor General and other amici curiae) that $ 602(a) is super-fluous unless it covers nonpiratical ("lawfully made") copies

sold by the copyright owner, because importation nearlyalways implies a first sale. There are several flaws in this
argument.First, even if $ 602(a) did apply only to piratical copies, it
at least would provide the copyright holder with a privateremedy against the importer, whereas the enforcement of

$ 602(b) is vested in the Customs Service.18 Second, becausethe protection afforded by $ 109(a) is available only to the

"owner" of a lawfully made copy (or someone authorized bythe owner), the first sale doctrine would not provide a de16 See 17 U. S. C. $$ 106, 107 (1970).
17 Section 602(b) provides in relevant part: "In a case where the making

of the copies or phonorecords would have constituted an infringement
of copyright if this title had been applicable, their importation is
prohibited. . . ." The first sale doctrine of $ 109(a) does not protect owners of piratical copies, of course, because such copies were not "lawfully
made."

Opinion of the Court
fense to a $ 602(a) action against any nonowner such as abailee, a licensee, a consignee, or one whose possession of the

copy was unlawful.19 Third, $ 602(a) applies to a category ofcopies that are neither piratical nor "lawfully made under
this title." That category encompasses copies that were"lawfully made" not under the United States Copyright Act,
but instead, under the law of some other country.The category of copies produced lawfully under a foreign
copyright was expressly identified in the deliberations thatled to the enactment of the 1976 Act. We mention one example of such a comment in 1961 simply to demonstrate thatthe category is not a merely hypothetical one. In a report
to Congress, the Register of Copyrights stated, in part:

"When arrangements are made for both a U. S. editionand a foreign edition of the same work, the publishers

frequently agree to divide the international markets.The foreign publisher agrees not to sell his edition in
the United States, and the U. S. publisher agrees not tosell his edition in certain foreign countries. It has been
suggested that the import ban on piratical copies shouldbe extended to bar the importation of the foreign edition in contravention of such an agreement." Copy-right Law Revision: Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. CopyrightLaw, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 125-126 (H. R. Judiciary
Comm. Print 1961).
19 In its opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals quoted a statement
by a representative of the music industry expressing the need for protection against the importation of stolen motion picture prints: "We've had

RESEARCH INT'L, INC.

Opinion of the Court

Even in the absence of a market allocation agreement be-tween, for example, a publisher of the United States edition

and a publisher of the British edition of the same work, eachsuch publisher could make lawful copies. If the author of
the work gave the exclusive United States distributionrights--enforceable under the Act--to the publisher of the
United States edition and the exclusive British distributionrights to the publisher of the British edition,

20 however, presumably only those made by the publisher of the UnitedStates edition would be "lawfully made under this title"

within the meaning of $ 109(a). The first sale doctrinewould not provide the publisher of the British edition who
decided to sell in the American market with a defense to anaction under $ 602(a) (or, for that matter, to an action under

$ 106(3), if there was a distribution of the copies).The argument that the statutory exceptions to $ 602(a) are
superfluous if the first sale doctrine is applicable rests on theassumption that the coverage of that section is coextensive
with the coverage of $ 109(a). But since it is, in fact, broaderbecause it encompasses copies that are not subject to the
first sale doctrine--e. g., copies that are lawfully made underthe law of another country--the exceptions do protect the
traveler who may have made an isolated purchase of a copyof a work that could not be imported in bulk for purposes of
resale. As we read the Act, although both the first sale doc-trine embodied in $ 109(a) and the exceptions in $ 602(a) may

Opinion of the Court
be applicable in some situations, the former does not sub-sume the latter; those provisions retain significant independent meaning.
Section 501's Separate References to $$ 106 and 602

The text of $ 501 does lend support to L'anza's submission.In relevant part, it provides:

"(a) Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights ofthe copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through
118 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), orwho imports copies or phonorecords into the United
States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of thecopyright or right of the author, as the case may be. . . ."

The use of the words "or who imports," rather than wordssuch as "

including one who imports," is more consistent withan interpretation that a violation of $ 602 is distinct from a

violation of $ 106 (and thus not subject to the first sale doc-trine set out in $ 109(a)) than with the view that it is a species
of such a violation. Nevertheless, the force of that inferenceis outweighed by other provisions in the statutory text.

Most directly relevant is the fact that the text of $ 602(a)itself unambiguously states that the prohibited importation
is an infringement of the exclusive distribution right "undersection 106, actionable under section 501." Unlike that
phrase, which identifies $ 602 violations as a species of $ 106violations, the text of $ 106A, which is also cross-referenced
in $ 501, uses starkly different language. It states that theauthor's right protected by $ 106A is "independent of the
exclusive rights provided in Section 106." The contrastbetween the relevant language in $ 602 and that in $ 106A
strongly implies that only the latter describes an independ-ent right.

21

21 The strength of the implication created by the relevant language in

$ 106A is not diminished by the fact that Congress enacted $ 106A more

Opinion of the Court

Of even greater importance is the fact that the $ 106 rights
are subject not only to the first sale defense in $ 109(a), but
also to all of the other provisions of "sections 107 through
120." If $ 602(a) functioned independently, none of those
sections would limit its coverage. For example, the "fair
use" defense embodied in $ 107 22 would be unavailable to importers if $ 602(a) created a separate right not subject to the
limitations on the $ 106(3) distribution right. Under L'anza's
interpretation of the Act, it presumably would be unlawful
for a distributor to import copies of a British newspaper that
contained a book review quoting excerpts from an American

recently than $ 602(a), which is part of the Copyright Act of 1976. Section 106A was passed as part of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 in
order to protect the moral rights of certain visual artists. Section 106A
is analogous to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works, but its coverage is more limited. See 2
P. Goldstein, Copyright $ 5.12, p. 5:225 (2d ed. 1996) ($ 106A encompasses
aspects of the moral rights guaranteed by Article 6bis of the Berne Convention, "but effectively gives these rights a narrow subject matter and
scope").

22 Title 17 U. S. C. $ 107 provides as follows:

"$ 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

"Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use
of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes
such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement
of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include--

"(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

"(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
"(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and

"(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.

"The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair
use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."

Opinion of the Court
novel protected by a United States copyright.23 Given theimportance of the fair use defense to publishers of scholarly

works, as well as to publishers of periodicals, it is difficult tobelieve that Congress intended to impose an absolute ban
on the importation of all such works containing any copyingof material protected by a United States copyright.

In the context of this case, involving copyrighted labels, itseems unlikely that an importer could defend an infringement as a "fair use" of the label. In construing the statute,however, we must remember that its principal purpose was
to promote the progress of the "useful Arts," U. S. Const.,Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8, by rewarding creativity, and its principal
function is the protection of original works, rather than ordi-nary commercial products that use copyrighted material as
a marketing aid. It is therefore appropriate to take intoaccount the impact of the denial of the fair use defense for
the importer of foreign publications. As applied to suchpublications, L'anza's construction of $ 602 "would merely

inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit."
Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464U. S. 417, 450-451 (1984).

24

Does an importer "sell or otherwise dispose" of copies as

those words are used in $ 109(a)?

Whether viewed from the standpoint of the importer orfrom that of the copyright holder, the textual argument

advanced by the Solicitor General 25--that the act of "im23 The $ 602(a) exceptions, which are substantially narrower than $ 107,
would not permit such importation. See n. 11, supra.

24 L'anza's reliance on $ 602(a)(3)'s reference to $ 108(g)(2), see n. 11,

supra, to demonstrate that all of the other limitations set out in $$ 107
through 120--including the first sale and fair use doctrines--do not apply
to imported copies is unavailing for the same reasons.

Opinion of the Court

portation" is neither a sale nor a disposal of a copy under$ 109(a)--is unpersuasive. Strictly speaking, an importer

could, of course, carry merchandise from one country toanother without surrendering custody of it. In a typical
commercial transaction, however, the shipper transfers "pos-session, custody, control and title to the products"

26 to a different person, and L'anza assumes that petitioner's importa-tion of the L'anza shipments included such a transfer. An

ordinary interpretation of the statement that a person isentitled "to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" of an
item surely includes the right to ship it to another person inanother country.

More important, the Solicitor General's cramped readingof the text of the statutes is at odds not only with $ 602(a)'s
more flexible treatment of unauthorized importation as aninfringement of the distribution right (even when there is no
literal "distribution"), but also with the necessarily broadreach of $ 109(a). The whole point of the first sale doctrine
is that once the copyright owner places a copyrighted itemin the stream of commerce by selling it, he has exhausted his
exclusive statutory right to control its distribution. As wehave recognized, the codification of that doctrine in $ 109(a)
makes it clear that the doctrine applies only to copies thatare "lawfully made under this title," but that was also true
of the copies involved in the Bobbs-Merrill case, as well asthose involved in the earlier cases applying the doctrine.
There is no reason to assume that Congress intended either$ 109(a) or the earlier codifications of the doctrine to limit its
broad scope.27In sum, we are not persuaded by either L'anza's or the
Solicitor General's textual arguments.

Opinion of the Court

V
The parties and their amici have debated at length thewisdom or unwisdom of governmental restraints on what is

sometimes described as either the "gray market" or the prac-tice of "parallel importation."

28 In K mart Corp. v. Cartier,

Inc., 486 U. S. 281 (1988), we used those terms to refer to theimportation of foreign-manufactured goods bearing a valid

United States trademark without the consent of the trade-mark holder.

Id., at 285-286. We are not at all sure thatthose terms appropriately describe the consequences of an

American manufacturer's decision to limit its promotionalefforts to the domestic market and to sell its products abroad
at discounted prices that are so low that its foreign distribu-tors can compete in the domestic market.

29 But even if they

do, whether or not we think it would be wise policy to pro-vide statutory protection for such price discrimination is not

a matter that is relevant to our duty to interpret the text ofthe Copyright Act.

Equally irrelevant is the fact that the Executive Branch ofthe Government has entered into at least five international
trade agreements that are apparently intended to protect do-mestic copyright owners from the unauthorized importation
of copies of their works sold in those five countries.30 Theearliest of those agreements was made in 1991; none has
been ratified by the Senate. Even though they are of course

28 Compare, for example, Gorelick & Little, The Case for Parallel Importation, 11 N. C. J. Int'l L. & Comm. Reg. 205 (1986), with Gordon, Gray
Market Is Giving Hair-Product Makers Gray Hair, N. Y. Times, July 13,
1997, section 1, p. 28, col. 1.

29 Presumably L'anza, for example, could have avoided the consequences

of that competition either (1) by providing advertising support abroad and
charging higher prices, or (2) if it was satisfied to leave the promotion
of the product in foreign markets to its foreign distributors, to sell its
products abroad under a different name.

30 The Solicitor General advises us that such agreements have been made

with Cambodia, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Ecuador, and Sri Lanka.

This case involves a "round trip" journey, travel of thecopies in question from the United States to places abroad,

Patry,Copyright Law and Practice 166-170 (1997 Supp.) (commenting that provisions of Title 17 do not apply extraterritoriallyunless expressly so stated, hence the words "lawfully made

155OCTOBER TERM, 1997
Syllabus

LEWIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-7151. Argued November 12, 1997--Decided March 9, 1998
A federal indictment charged petitioner Lewis and her husband with beating and killing his 4-year-old daughter while they lived at an Army
base in Louisiana. Relying on the federal Assimilative Crimes Act
(ACA), 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a)--which provides that "[w]hoever within . . .
any [federal enclave] is guilty of any act or omission which, although
not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable . . . within the jurisdiction of the State . . . in which such place is
situated, . . . shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to like punishment"--the indictment charged the defendants under a Louisiana
statute defining first-degree murder to include "killing . . . [w]hen the
offender has the specific intent to kill or . . . harm . . . a victim under
the age of twelve . . . ." Upon her conviction of Louisiana first-degree
murder, the District Court sentenced Lewis to life imprisonment without parole. The Fifth Circuit held that the Louisiana statute was not
assimilated into federal law under the ACA because the federal seconddegree murder statute applicable to federal enclaves, 18 U. S. C. $ 1111
(1988 ed.), governed the crime at issue. The court nonetheless affirmed
Lewis' conviction on the ground that, in finding her guilty of the state
charge, the jury had necessarily found all of the requisite elements of
federal second-degree murder. And it affirmed her sentence on the
ground that it was no greater than the maximum sentence (life) permitted by $ 1111.

Held:

1. Because the ACA does not make Louisiana's first-degree murder
statute part of federal law, the federal second-degree murder statute,

$ 1111, governs the crime at issue. Pp. 159-172.

(a) The basic question before this Court is the meaning of the ACA
phrase "not made punishable by any enactment of Congress." (Emphasis added.) The Court rejects an absolutely literal reading of the
italicized words because that would dramatically separate the ACA from
its basic purpose of borrowing state law to fill gaps in the federal criminal law applicable on federal enclaves, and would conflict with the ACA's
history and features. See, e. g., Williams v. United States, 327 U. S.
711, 718-719. On the other hand, the Court cannot find a convincing
justification in language, purpose, or precedent for the Government's

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
156 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
narrow interpretation that "any enactment" refers, with limited exceptions, only to federal enactments that share the same statutory elements
as the relevant state law. Id., at 717, distinguished. Rather, the ACA's
language and its gap-filling purpose taken together indicate that, to
determine whether a particular state statute is assimilated, a court
must first ask the question that the ACA's language requires: Is the
defendant's "act or omission . . . made punishable by any enactment of
Congress." (Emphasis added.) If the answer is "no," that will normally end the matter because the ACA presumably would assimilate
the state statute. If the answer is "yes," however, the court must ask
the further question whether the federal statutes that apply to the "act
or omission" reveal a legislative intent to preclude application of the
state law in question, say, because the federal statutes reveal an intent
to occupy so much of a field as would exclude use of the particular state
statute, see, e. g., id., at 724. Pp. 159-166.

(b) Application of these principles to this case reveals that federal
law does not assimilate the child murder provision of Louisiana's firstdegree murder statute. Among other things, $ 1111 defines first-degree
murder to include "willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing," as well as certain listed felony murders and instances of transferred intent, and says that "murder in the second degree" is "any other
murder" and is punishable by imprisonment for "any term of years or
for life." In contrast, the Louisiana statute defines first-degree murder
as, inter alia, the killing of someone under 12 with a "specific intent to
kill or . . . harm," and makes it punishable by "death or life imprisonment" without parole. Here, the defendant's "act or omission" is "made
punishable by a[n] enactment of Congress" because $ 1111 makes Lewis'
"act . . . punishable" as second-degree murder. Moreover, applicable
federal law indicates an intent to punish conduct such as the defendant's
to the exclusion of the state statute at issue. Even though the two
statutes cover different forms of behavior, other $ 1111 features, taken
together, demonstrate Congress' intent to completely cover all types of
federal enclave murder as an integrated whole. These features include
the fact that $ 1111 is drafted in a detailed manner to cover all variants
of murder; the way in which its "first-degree" and "second-degree" provisions are linguistically interwoven; the fact that its "first-degree" list
is detailed; the fact that that list sets forth several circumstances at
the same level of generality as does the Louisiana law; and the extreme breadth of the possible federal sentences, ranging all the way
from any term of years, to death. Also supporting preclusive intent
are the circumstances that Congress has recently focused directly several times upon the $ 1111 first-degree list's content, subtracting certain
specified felonies or adding others; that, by drawing the line between

Syllabus
first and second degree, Congress has carefully decided just when it
does, and does not, intend for murder to be punishable by death, a major
way in which the Louisiana statute (which provides the death penalty)
differs from the federal second-degree provision (which does not); that,
when writing and amending the ACA, Congress has referred to murder
as an example of a crime covered by, not as an example of a gap in,
federal law; that $ 1111 applies only on federal enclaves, so that assimilation of Louisiana law would treat enclave residents differently from
those living elsewhere in that State, by subjecting them to two sets of
"territorial" criminal laws in addition to the general federal criminal
laws that apply nationwide; and that there apparently is not a single
reported case in which a federal court has used the ACA to assimilate
a state murder law. Given all these considerations, there is no gap for
Louisiana's statute to fill. Pp. 166-172.

2. Lewis is entitled to resentencing. As she argues and the Government concedes, the Fifth Circuit erred in affirming her life sentence
because $ 1111, unlike the Louisiana statute, does not make such a sentence mandatory for second-degree murder, but provides for a sentence
of "any term of years or life." Moreover, the federal Sentencing Guidelines provide for a range of 168 to 210 months' imprisonment for a firsttime offender like her who murders a "vulnerable victim." Although a
judge could impose a higher sentence by departing from the Guidelines
range, it is for the District Court to make such a determination in the
first instance. Pp. 172-173.

158 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA or Act) assimilates into federal law, and thereby makes applicable on fed-eral enclaves such as Army bases, certain criminal laws of

the State in which the enclave is located. It says:

"Whoever within or upon any [federal enclave] is guilty
of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable
if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the
State . . . in which such place is situated, . . . shall be
guilty of a like offense and subject to like punishment."
18 U. S. C. $ 13(a).

The question in this case is whether the ACA makes applicable on a federal Army base located in Louisiana a state
first-degree murder statute that defines first-degree murder
to include the "killing of a human being . . . [w]hen the offender has the specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily
harm upon a victim under the age of twelve . . . ." La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 14:30(A)(5) (West 1986 and Supp. 1997).

We hold that the ACA does not make the state provision
part of federal law. A federal murder statute, 18 U. S. C.

$ 1111, therefore governs the crime at issue--the killing of
a 4-year-old child "with malice aforethought" but without
"premeditation." Under that statute this crime is seconddegree, not first-degree, murder.

I
A federal grand jury indictment charged that petitioner,
Debra Faye Lewis, and her husband James Lewis, beat and
killed James' 4-year-old daughter while all three lived at
Fort Polk, a federal Army base in Louisiana. Relying on
the ACA, the indictment charged a violation of Louisiana's
first-degree murder statute. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30
(West 1986 and Supp. 1993). Upon her conviction, the Dis523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

159Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
trict Court sentenced Debra Lewis to life imprisonmentwithout parole. See $ 14:30(C) (West 1986).

On appeal the Fifth Circuit held that Louisiana's stat-ute did not apply at Fort Polk. 92 F. 3d 1371 (1996). It
noted that the Act made state criminal statutes applicableon federal enclaves only where the wrongful " `act or omission' " was " `not made punishable by any enactment of Con-gress.' "

Id., at 1373-1374 (citing 18 U. S. C. $ 13). BecauseCongress made Lewis' acts "punishable" as federal seconddegree murder, and the federal and state laws were directedat roughly the same sort of conduct, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the ACA did not permit the application of Loui-siana's first-degree murder statute to petitioner's acts. 92
F. 3d, at 1375-1377. The court nonetheless affirmed Lewis'conviction on the ground that in convicting her of the state
charge the jury had necessarily found all of the requisiteelements of federal second-degree murder.

Id., at 1378;cf. Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S. 292, 305-306 (1996).

And it affirmed the sentence on the ground that it was nogreater than the maximum sentence (life) permitted by the
federal second-degree murder statute. 92 F. 3d, at 1379-1380.

We granted certiorari primarily to consider the FifthCircuit's ACA determination. We conclude that the holding was correct, though we also believe that Lewis is enti-tled to resentencing on the federal second-degree murder
conviction. II

The ACA applies state law to a defendant's acts or omis-sions that are "not made punishable by

any enactment ofCongress." 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added). The basic

question before us concerns the meaning of the italicizedphrase. These words say that the ACA does

not assimilatea state statute if the defendant's "act" or "omission" is punished by "any [federal] enactment." If the words are takenliterally, Louisiana's law could not possibly apply to Lewis,

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
160 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
for there are several federal "enactments" that make Lewis'acts punishable, for example, the federal (second-degree)

murder statute, $ 1111, and the federal assault law, $ 113.We agree with the Government, however, that this is not a
sensible interpretation of this language, since a literal reading of the words "any enactment" would dramatically sepa-rate the statute from its intended purpose.

The ACA's basic purpose is one of borrowing state law tofill gaps in the federal criminal law that applies on federal
enclaves. See Williams v. United States, 327 U. S. 711, 718-719 (1946) (ACA exists "to fill in gaps" in federal law where
Congress has not "define[d] the missing offenses"); United
States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 289 (1958) (ACA represents congressional decision of "adopting for otherwise undefined offenses the policy of general conformity to local law");
United States v. Press Publishing Co., 219 U. S. 1, 9-10
(1911) (state laws apply to crimes "which were not previously
provided for by a law of the United States"); Franklin v.
United States, 216 U. S. 559, 568 (1910) (assimilation occurs
where state laws "not displaced by specific laws enacted by
Congress").

In the 1820's, when the ACA began its life, federal statutory law punished only a few crimes committed on federal
enclaves, such as murder and manslaughter. See 1 Stat.
113. The federal courts lacked the power to supplement
these few statutory crimes through the use of the common
law. See United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).
Consequently James Buchanan, then a Congressman, could
point out to his fellow House Members a "palpable defect in
our system," namely, that "a great variety of actions, to
which a high degree of moral guilt is attached, and which
are punished . . . at the common law, and by every State . . .
may be committed with impunity" on federal enclaves. 40
Annals of Cong. 930 (1823). Daniel Webster sought to cure
this palpable defect by introducing a bill that both increased
the number of federal crimes and also made "the residue"

Opinion of the Court
criminal, see 1 Cong. Deb. 338 (1825), by assimilating statelaw where federal statutes did not provide for the "punishment" of an "offence." 4 Stat. 115. This law, with onlya few changes, has become today's ACA. See

Williams,
supra, at 719-723 (describing history of ACA).

Two features of the Act indicate a congressional intent toconfine the scope of the words "any enactment" more narrowly than (and hence extend the Act's reach beyond what)a literal reading might suggest. First, a literal interpretation of the words "any enactment" would leave federal crimi-nal enclave law subject to gaps of the very kind the Act was
designed to fill. The Act would be unable to assimilate even
a highly specific state law aimed directly at a serious, narrowly defined evil, if the language of any federal statute,
however broad and however clearly aimed at a different kind
of harm, were to cover the defendant's act. Were there only
a state, and no federal, law against murder, for example, a
federal prohibition of assault could prevent the state statute
from filling the obvious resulting gap.

At the same time, prior to its modern amendment the
ACA's language more clearly set limits upon the scope of
the word "any." The original version of the ACA said that
assimilation of a relevant state law was proper when "any
offence shall be committed . . . the punishment of which offence is not specially provided for by any law of the United
States." 4 Stat. 115 (emphasis added); see also 30 Stat. 717
(later reenactment also using "offense"). The word "offense" avoided the purpose-thwarting interpretation of the
Act discussed above, for it limited the relevant federal "enactment" to an enactment that punished offenses of the same
kind as those punished by state law. Presumably, a federal
assault statute would not have provided punishment for the
"offense" that state murder law condemned. Congress
changed the Act's language in 1909, removing the word "offense" and inserting the words "act or thing," 35 Stat. 1145,
which later became the current "act or omission." But Con523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gress did so for reasons irrelevant here, see H. R. Rep. No. 2,60th Cong., 1st Sess., 25 (1908) (stating that, technically

speaking, conduct otherwise not forbidden by law was not an"offense"), and did not intend to alter the basic meaning of
the Act. See Williams, supra, at 722-723.

For these or similar reasons, many lower courts haveinterpreted the words "any enactment" more narrowly than

a literal reading might suggest. And they have appliedthe Act to assimilate state statutes in circumstances they
thought roughly similar to those suggested by our assault/murder example above. See,

e. g., United States v. Kaufman, 862 F. 2d 236, 238 (CA9 1988) (existence of federal law
punishing the carrying of a gun does not prevent assimilation
of state law punishing threatening someone with a gun);
Fields v. United States, 438 F. 2d 205, 207-208 (CA2 1971)
(assimilation of state malicious shooting law proper despite
existence of federal assault statute); United States v. Brown,
608 F. 2d 551, 553-554 (CA5 1979) (child abuse different in
kind from generic federal assault, and so state law could be
assimilated). But see United States v. Chaussee, 536 F. 2d
637, 644 (CA7 1976) (stating a more literal test). Like the
Government, we conclude that Congress did not intend the
relevant words--"any enactment"--to carry an absolutely
literal meaning.

On the other hand, we cannot accept the narrow interpretation of the relevant words (and the statute's consequently broader reach) that the Solicitor General seems to
urge. Drawing on our language in Williams, supra, at
717, some lower courts have said that the words "any enactment" refer only to federal enactments that make criminal the same "precise acts" as those made criminal by the
relevant state law. See, e. g., United States v. Johnson, 967
F. 2d 1431, 1436 (CA10 1992). The Government apparently
interprets this test to mean that, with limited exceptions,
the ACA would assimilate a state law so long as that state
law defines a crime in terms of at least one element that does

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

163Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
not appear in the relevant federal enactment. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 27 ("[I]n the great majority of cases the question

of whether the State law offense has been made punishableby an enactment of Congress can be resolved by asking, is
there a Federal statute that contains precisely the same essential elements as the State statute"). But this interpreta-tion of federal "enactments" is too narrow.

The Government's view of the "precise acts" test--whichcomes close to a "precise elements" test--would have the
ACA assimilate state law even where there is no gap to fill.Suppose, for example, that state criminal law (but not federal criminal law) makes possession of a state bank charter
an element of an offense it calls "bank robbery"; or suppose
that state law makes purse snatching criminal under a statute that is indistinguishable from a comparable federal law
but for a somewhat different definition of the word "purse."
Where, one might ask, is the gap? As Congress has enacted
more and more federal statutes, including many that are applicable only to federal enclaves, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 113
(assault); $ 1460 (possession with intent to sell obscene materials), such possibilities become more realistic. And to that
extent the Government's broad view of assimilation threatens not only to fill nonexistent gaps, but also to rewrite each
federal enclave-related criminal law in 50 different ways, depending upon special, perhaps idiosyncratic, drafting circumstances in the different States. See Williams, 327 U. S., at
718 (ACA may not be used to "enlarg[e] . . . modif[y] or repea[l] existing provisions of the Federal Code"). It would
also leave residents of federal enclaves randomly subject to
three sets of criminal laws (special federal territorial criminal law, general federal criminal law, and state criminal law)
where their state counterparts would be subject only to the
latter two types.

Nothing in the Act's language or in its purpose warrants
imposing such narrow limits upon the words "any enactment" and thereby so significantly broadening the statute's

Opinion of the Court
reach. Nor does the use by this Court of the words "preciseacts" in the leading case in which this Court has applied the

Act, Williams, 327 U. S., at 717, help the Government in thisrespect. In

Williams, the Court held that the ACA did not
assimilate a State's "statutory rape" crime (with a cut-off age
of 18) both because federal adultery and fornication statutescovered the defendant's "precise acts," and because the policies underlying a similar federal statute (with a cutoff ageof 16) made clear there was no gap to fill.

Id., at 724-725.
The Court's opinion refers to both of these circumstances anddoes not decide whether the Act would, or would not, have

applied in the absence of only one. We cannot find a convincing justification in language, purpose, or precedent for
the Government's interpretation. Hence, we conclude that,
just as a literal interpretation would produce an ACA that
is too narrow, see supra, at 161-162, so the Government's
interpretation would produce an ACA that is too broad.

In our view, the ACA's language and its gap-filling purpose taken together indicate that a court must first ask the
question that the ACA's language requires: Is the defendant's "act or omission . . . made punishable by any enactment
of Congress." 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added). If the
answer to this question is "no," that will normally end the
matter. The ACA presumably would assimilate the statute.
If the answer to the question is "yes," however, the court
must ask the further question whether the federal statutes
that apply to the "act or omission" preclude application of
the state law in question, say, because its application would
interfere with the achievement of a federal policy, see Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., 321 U. S. 383, 389-390 (1944),
because the state law would effectively rewrite an offense
definition that Congress carefully considered, see Williams,
327 U. S., at 718, or because federal statutes reveal an intent
to occupy so much of a field as would exclude use of the
particular state statute at issue, see id., at 724 (no assimilation where Congress has "covered the field with uniform fed523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
eral legislation"). See also Franklin, 216 U. S., at 568 (as-similation proper only where state laws "not displaced by

specific laws enacted by Congress").There are too many different state and federal criminal
laws, applicable in too many different kinds of circumstances,
bearing too many different relations to other laws, tocommon-law tradition, and to each other, for a touchstone to

provide an automatic general answer to this second question.Still, it seems fairly obvious that the Act will not apply
where both state and federal statutes seek to punish approxi-mately the same wrongful behavior--where, for example,
differences among elements of the crimes reflect jurisdictional, or other technical, considerations, or where differences amount only to those of name, definitional language, or
punishment. See, e. g., United States v. Adams, 502 F. Supp.
21, 25 (SD Fla. 1980) (misdemeanor/felony difference did not
justify assimilation).

The Act's basic purpose makes it similarly clear that assimilation may not rewrite distinctions among the forms of
criminal behavior that Congress intended to create. Williams, supra, at 717-718 (nothing in the history or language of the ACA to indicate that once Congress has "defined a penal offense, it has authorized such definition to
be enlarged" by state law). Hence, ordinarily, there will
be no gap for the Act to fill where a set of federal enactments taken together make criminal a single form of wrongful behavior while distinguishing (say, in terms of seriousness) among what amount to different ways of committing
the same basic crime.

At the same time, a substantial difference in the kind of
wrongful behavior covered (on the one hand by the state
statute, on the other, by federal enactments) will ordinarily
indicate a gap for a state statute to fill--unless Congress,
through the comprehensiveness of its regulation, cf. Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 604-605
(1991), or through language revealing a conflicting policy, see

Opinion of the Court
Williams, supra, at 724-725, indicates to the contrary in aparticular case. See also Johnson v. Yellow Cab, supra, at

389-390; Blackburn v. United States, 100 F. 3d 1426, 1435(CA9 1996). The primary question (we repeat) is one of legislative intent: Does applicable federal law indicate an intentto punish conduct such as the defendant's to the exclusion of
the particular state statute at issue?

III
We must now apply these principles to this case. The rel-evant federal murder statute--applicable only on federal

enclaves--read as follows in 1993, the time of petitioner'scrime:

"$ 1111. Murder
"(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human beingwith malice aforethought. Every murder perpetrated

by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful,deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate,any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexualabuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effectthe death of any human being other than him who is
killed, is murder in the first degree.
"Any other murder is murder in the second degree.
"(b) Within the special maritime and territorial juris-diction of the United States,

"Whoever is guilty of murder in the first degree, shallsuffer death unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto `without capital punishment', in which eventhe shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life;
"Whoever is guilty of murder in the second degree, shallbe imprisoned for any term of years or for life." 18
U. S. C. $ 1111 (1988 ed.).

167Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
This statute says that "murder in the first degree" shallbe punished by death or life imprisonment. It says that

"murder in the second degree" shall be punished by impris-onment for "any term of years or for life." It defines firstdegree murder as a "willful, deliberate, malicious, and pre-meditated killing," and also adds certain kinds of felony
murder (i. e., murder occurring during the commission ofother crimes) and certain instances of transferred intent
(i. e., D's killing of A, while intending to murder B). It de-fines second-degree murder as "[a]ny other murder."

Louisiana's statute says the following:

"A. First degree murder is the killing of a human being:
"(1) When the offender has specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated kid-napping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated escape,
aggravated arson, aggravated rape, forcible rape, aggra-vated burglary, armed robbery, drive-by shooting, first
degree robbery, or simple robbery.
"(2) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm upon a fireman or peace officer

engaged in the performance of his lawful duties;
"(3) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm upon more than one person; or

"(4) When the offender has specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm and has offered, has been of-fered, has given, or has received anything of value for

the killing.
"(5) When the offender has the specific intent to kill or
to inflict great bodily harm upon a victim under the age
of twelve or sixty-five years of age or older.

"(6) When the offender has the specific intent to kill orto inflict great bodily harm while engaged in the distribution, exchange, sale, or purchase, or any attemptthereof, of a controlled dangerous substance listed in

168 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V of the Uniform ControlledDangerous Substances Law.

"(7) When the offender has specific intent to kill andis engaged in the activities prohibited by R. S.
14:107.1(C)(1).. . . . .
"C. Whoever commits the crime of first degree murder
shall be punished by death or life imprisonment at hardlabor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension

of sentence in accordance with the determination of the
jury." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30 (West 1986 and Supp.
1997) (emphasis added).

This statute says that murder in the first degree shall
be punished by "death or life imprisonment" without parole.
It defines first-degree murder as the "killing of a human
being" with a "specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily
harm" where the "offender" is committing certain other felonies or has been paid for the crime or kills more than one
victim, or kills a fireman, a peace officer, someone over the
age of 64, or someone under the age of 12. In this case, the
jury found that the defendant killed a child under the age
of 12 with a "specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily
harm" upon that child.

In deciding whether the ACA assimilates Louisiana's
law, we first ask whether the defendant's "act or omission"
is "made punishable by any enactment of Congress." 18
U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added); see supra, at 164. The answer to this question is "yes." An "enactment of Congress,"
namely, $ 1111, makes the defendant's "act . . . punishable" as
second-degree murder. This answer is not conclusive, however, for reasons we have pointed out. Rather, we must ask
a second question. See supra, at 164-165. Does applicable
federal law indicate an intent to punish conduct such as the
defendant's to the exclusion of the particular state statute
at issue?

Opinion of the Court
We concede at the outset the Government's claim that thetwo statutes cover different forms of behavior. The federal

second-degree murder statute covers a wide range of con-duct; the Louisiana first-degree murder provision focuses
upon a narrower (and different) range of conduct. We also
concede that, other things being equal, this considerationargues in favor of assimilation. Yet other things are not

equal; and other features of the federal statute convince usthat Congress has intended that the federal murder statute
preclude application of a first-degree murder statute such asLouisiana's to a killing on a federal enclave.

The most obvious such feature is the detailed manner in
which the federal murder statute is drafted. It purports
to make criminal a particular form of wrongful behavior,
namely, "murder," which it defines as "the unlawful killing
of a human being with malice aforethought." It covers all
variants of murder. It divides murderous behavior into two
parts: a specifically defined list of "first-degree" murders and
all "other" murders, which it labels "second-degree." This
fact, the way in which "first-degree" and "second-degree"
provisions are linguistically interwoven; the fact that the
"first-degree" list is detailed; and the fact that the list sets
forth several circumstances at the same level of generality
as does Louisiana's statute, taken together, indicate that
Congress intended its statute to cover a particular field--
namely, "unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought"--as an integrated whole. The complete coverage
of the federal statute over all types of federal enclave murder is reinforced by the extreme breadth of the possible sentences, ranging all the way from any term of years, to death.
There is no gap for Louisiana's statute to fill.

Several other circumstances offer support for the conclusion that Congress' omissions from its "first-degree" murder
list reflect a considered legislative judgment. Congress, for
example, has recently focused directly several times upon the
content of the "first-degree" list, subtracting certain speci523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
170 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
fied circumstances or adding others. See Pub. L. 99-646,100 Stat. 3623 (substituting "aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse" for "rape"); Pub. L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2138 (adding"escape, murder, kidnaping, treason, espionage," and "sabotage" to first-degree list). By drawing the line between first

and second degree, Congress also has carefully decided justwhen it does, and when it does not, intend for murder

to be punishable by death--a major way in which the Louisi-ana first-degree murder statute (which provides the death
penalty) differs from the federal second-degree provision(which does not). 18 U. S. C. $ 1111(b); La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 14:30(C) (West Supp. 1997). The death penalty is a matter
that typically draws specific congressional attention. See,
e. g., Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, Pub. L. 103-322, $ 60003, 108 Stat. 1968 (section entitled
"Specific Offenses For Which [the] Death Penalty Is Authorized"). As this Court said in Williams, "[w]here offenses
have been specifically defined by Congress and the public has
been guided by such definitions for many years," it is unusual
for Congress through general legislation like the ACA "to
amend such definitions or the punishments prescribed for
such offenses, without making clear its intent to do so." 327
U. S., at 718 (footnote omitted).

Further, Congress when writing and amending the ACA
has referred to the conduct at issue here--murder--as an
example of a crime covered by, not as an example of a gap
in, federal law. See H. R. Rep. No. 1584, 76th Cong., 3d
Sess., 1 (1940) ("Certain of the major crimes . . . such . . . as
murder" are "expressly defined" by Congress; assimilation
of state law is proper as to "other offenses"); 1 Cong. Deb.
338 (1825) (Daniel Webster explaining original assimilation
provision as a way to cover "the residue" of crimes not "provide[d] for" by Congress; at the time federal law contained
a federal enclave murder provision, see 1 Stat. 113); see
also United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S., at 289, and n. 5
(citing 18 U. S. C. $ 1111 for proposition that Congress has

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
increasingly "enact[ed] for the enclaves specific criminal stat-utes" and "to that extent, [has] excluded the state laws from

that field").Finally, the federal criminal statute before us applies only
on federal enclaves. $ 1111(b). Hence, there is a sense in
which assimilation of Louisiana law would treat those livingon federal enclaves differently from those living elsewhere

in Louisiana, for it would subject them to two sets of "terri-torial" criminal laws in addition to the general federal criminal laws that apply nationwide. See supra, at 163. Givenall these considerations, it is perhaps not surprising that we
have been unable to find a single reported case in which a
federal court has used the ACA to assimilate a state murder
law to fill a supposed "gap" in the federal murder statute.

The Government, arguing to the contrary, says that Louisiana's provision is a type of "child protection" statute, filling a "gap" in federal enclave-related criminal law due to
the fact that Congress left "child abuse," like much other
domestic relations law, to the States. See Brief for United
States 23, 29-30. The fact that Congress, when writing
various criminal statutes, has focused directly upon "child
protection" weakens the force of this argument. See, e. g.,
21 U. S. C. $$ 859(a)-(b) (person selling drugs to minors is
subject to twice the maximum sentence as one who deals to
adults, and repeat offenders who sell to children subject
to three times the normal maximum); 18 U. S. C. $ 1201(g)
("special rule" for kidnaping offenses involving minors, with
enhanced penalties in certain cases); $$ 2241(c) and 2243 (prohibiting sexual abuse of minors); $ 2251 (prohibiting sexual exploitation of children); $ 2251A (selling and buying of
children); $ 2258 (failure to report child abuse). And, without expressing any view on the merits of lower court cases
that have assimilated state child abuse statutes despite the
presence of a federal assault law, $ 113, see, e. g., United
States v. Brown, 608 F. 2d, at 553-554; United States v.
Fesler, 781 F. 2d 384, 390-391 (CA5 1986), we note that the

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
172 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
federal assault prohibition is less comprehensive than thefederal murder statute, and the relevant statutory relationships are less direct than those at issue here. We concludethat the consideration to which the Government points is not
strong enough to open a child-related "gap" in the compre-hensive effort to define murder on federal enclaves.

For these reasons we agree with the Fifth Circuit thatfederal law does not assimilate the child victim provision of
Louisiana's first-degree murder statute.

IV
The Fifth Circuit affirmed petitioner's conviction on theground that the jury, in convicting petitioner under the

Louisiana statute, necessarily found all of the requisite ele-ments of the federal second-degree murder offense. 92 F.
3d, at 1379; cf. Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S., at 305-306. Petitioner does not contest the legal correctness of
this conclusion.Petitioner, however, does argue that the Fifth Circuit
was wrong to affirm her sentence (life imprisonment). Shepoints out that the federal second-degree murder statute, unlike Louisiana's first-degree murder statute, does not makea life sentence mandatory. See 18 U. S. C. $ 1111(b) (sentence of "any term of years or for life"). Moreover, the Sen-tencing Guidelines provide for a range of 168 to 210 months'
imprisonment for a first-time offender who murders a "vul-nerable victim," United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $$ 2A1.2, 3A1.1, and ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.1994), although a judge could impose a higher sentence by
departing from the Guidelines range. See id., ch. 5, pt. K;see also

Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 92-96 (1996)(describing circumstances for departures).

The Government concedes petitioner's point. The Solici-tor General writes:

"If the jury had found petitioner guilty of second degreemurder under federal law, the district court would have

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
been required to utilize the Sentencing Guidelines pro-visions applicable to that offense, and the court might

have imposed a sentence below the statutory maximum.An upward departure from that range, if appropriate,
could reach the statutory maximum of a life sentence,
but it is for the district court in the first instance tomake such a determination. Resentencing under the

Guidelines is therefore appropriate if this Court vacatespetitioner's conviction on the assimilated state offense
and orders entry of a judgment of conviction for fed-eral second degree murder." Brief for United States 38
(footnote and citations omitted).
We consequently vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment in
respect to petitioner's sentence and remand the case for
resentencing.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment.

As the proliferation of opinions indicates, this is a most
difficult case. I agree with the Court's conclusion that the
Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA), 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a), does not
incorporate Louisiana's first-degree murder statute into
the criminal law governing federal enclaves in that State.
I write separately because it seems to me that the Court's
manner of reaching that result turns the language of the
ACA into an empty vessel, and invites the lower courts to
fill it with free-ranging speculation about the result that
Congress would prefer in each case. Although I agree that
the ACA is not a model of legislative draftsmanship, I believe we have an obligation to search harder for its meaning
before abandoning the field to judicial intuition.

The Court quotes the text of the ACA early in its opinion,
but then identifies several policy reasons for leaving it behind. The statutory language is deceptively simple.

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
"Whoever within or upon any [federal enclave] is guiltyof any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punish-able if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of
the State . . . in which such place is situated, . . . shallbe guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment." $ 13(a).
At first glance, this appears to say that state law is not as-similated if the defendant can be prosecuted under any federal statute. The Court acknowledges this, but concludesthat "a literal reading of the words `any enactment' would
dramatically separate the statute from its intended pur-pose," ante, at 160, because, for example, a general federal
assault statute would prevent assimilation of a state pro-hibition against murder.

It seems to me that the term "any enactment" is not thetext that poses the difficulty. Whether a federal assault
statute (which is assuredly an "enactment") prevents assimi-lation of a state murder statute to punish an assault that
results in death depends principally upon whether fatal as-sault constitutes the same "act or omission" that the assault
statute punishes. Many hypotheticals posing the same issuecan readily be conceived of. For example, whether a state
murder statute is barred from assimilation by a federaldouble-parking prohibition, when the behavior in question
consists of the defendant's stopping and jumping out of hiscar in the traffic lane to assault and kill the victim. The
federal parking prohibition is sure enough an "enactment,"but the issue is whether the "act or omission" to which it
applies is a different one. So also with a federal statutepunishing insurance fraud, where the murderer kills in order
to collect a life insurance policy on the victim.Many lower courts have analyzed situations like these
under what they call the "precise acts" test, see, e. g., United
States v. Kaufman, 862 F. 2d 236 (CA9 1988), which in prac-tice is no test at all but an appeal to vague policy intuitions.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
See, e. g., United States v. Brown, 608 F. 2d 551 (CA5 1979)(striking a child is not the same "precise act" for purposes

of a federal assault law and a state law against child abuse).I am skeptical of any interpretation which leaves a statute
doing no real interpretive work in most of the hard cases
which it was drafted to resolve. On that score, however, theCourt's solution is no improvement. After rejecting proposals from the petitioner and from the United States thatwould have given the ACA more definite content (on the policy grounds that they would produce too little, and too much,assimilation, respectively), the Court invites judges to speculate about whether Congress would approve of assimilationin each particular case.

"[T]he court must ask . . . whether the federal statutesthat apply to the `act or omission' preclude application
of the state law in question, say, because its applicationwould interfere with the achievement of a federal policy,
because the state law would effectively rewrite an offense definition that Congress carefully considered, orbecause federal statutes reveal an intent to occupy so

much of a field as would exclude use of the particularstate statute at issue . . . . The primary question (we
repeat) is one of legislative intent: Does applicable fed-eral law indicate an intent to punish conduct such as the
defendant's to the exclusion of the particular state stat-ute at issue?"

Ante, at 164, 166 (citations omitted).

Those questions simply transform the ACA into a mirrorthat reflects the judge's assessment of whether assimilation

of a particular state law would be good federal policy.

I believe that the statutory history of the ACA supports
a more principled and constraining interpretation of the
current language. The original version of the ACA provided for assimilation whenever "any offence shall be committed . . . , the punishment of which offence is not specially
provided for by any law of the United States." 4 Stat. 115.

176 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Subsequent amendments replaced the word "offence" with
"act or thing," 35 Stat. 1145, and eventually the present
formulation, "act or omission." But we held in Williams
v. United States, 327 U. S. 711, 722-723 (1946), that those
amendments were designed to respond to a perceived technical deficiency, and that they did not intend to change the
meaning of the Act.

Williams reached that conclusion by studying the legislative history of the ACA amendments. Although I am not
prepared to endorse that particular methodology, reading
the ACA against the backdrop of its statutory predecessors
does shed some light on its otherwise puzzling language.
An "act or omission . . . made punishable by [law]" is the
very definition of a criminal "offense," and certainly might
have been another way to express that same idea. In addition, the ACA still provides that a defendant charged with
an assimilated state crime "shall be guilty of a like offense
and subject to a like punishment." 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added). Since an interpretation that ascribes greater
substantive significance to the amendments would produce
such a vague and unhelpful statute, I think that Williams's
reading of the ACA was essentially correct. A defendant
may therefore be prosecuted under the ACA for an "offense"
which is "like" the one defined by state law if, and only if,
that same "offense" is not also defined by federal law.

That interpretation would hardly dispel all of the confusion surrounding the ACA, because courts would still have
to decide whether the assimilated state offense is "the same"
as some crime defined by federal law. As Justice Kennedy points out in dissent, "[t]here is a methodology at hand
for this purpose, and it is the Blockburger test we use in
double jeopardy law." Post, at 182. Two offenses are different, for double jeopardy purposes, whenever each contains
an element that the other does not. See, e. g., Blockburger
v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932). That test can be

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
easily and mechanically applied, and has the virtue of pro-ducing consistent and predictable results.

The Blockburger test, however, establishes what consti-tutes the "same offence" for purposes of the traditional practice that underlies the Double Jeopardy Clause, U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 5. That constitutional guarantee not only assumes ascheme of "offences" much more orderly than those referred

to by the ACA (since they are the offenses designed by asingle sovereign), but also pursues policy concerns that are
entirely different. When it is fair to try a defendant a sec-ond time has little to do with when it is desirable to subject
a defendant to two separate criminal prohibitions. Thus, for
example, double jeopardy law treats greater and lesser included offenses as the same, see, e. g., Harris v. Oklahoma,
433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam), so that a person tried for
felony murder cannot subsequently be prosecuted for the
armed robbery that constituted the charged felony. That is
fair enough; but it is assuredly not desirable that a jurisdiction (the federal enclave) which has an armed robbery law
not have a felony-murder law. Contrariwise, as the Court's
opinion points out, ante, at 163, Blockburger's emphasis on
the formal elements of crimes causes it to deny the "sameness" of some quite similar offenses because of trivial differences in the way they are defined. In other words, the
Blockburger test gives the phrase "same offence" a technical
meaning that reflects our double jeopardy traditions, see
Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 528-536 (1990) (Scalia, J.,
dissenting), but that is neither a layman's understanding of
the term nor a meaning that produces sensible results for
purposes of "gap filling." There is no reason to assume, it
seems to me, that Congress had the term of art in the Double
Jeopardy Clause in mind when it enacted the ACA.

Justice Kennedy contends that all of these concerns can
be accommodated through adjustments to the Blockburger
test. In his view, for example, "the existence of a lesser
included federal offense does not prevent the assimilation of

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
178 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
a greater state offense under the ACA, or vice versa." Post,
at 183. He proposes that courts should "look beyond slight
differences in wording and jurisdictional elements to discern
whether, as a practical matter, the elements of the two
crimes are the same." Post, at 182. In order to avoid overruling Williams, he also suggests that assimilation is improper when "Congress . . . adverts to a specific element of
an offense and sets it at a level different from the level set
by state law." Post, at 183. I admire Justice Kennedy's
effort to construct an interpretation of the ACA that yields
more certain and predictable results, but the modifications
he proposes largely dispel the virtues of familiarity, clarity,
and predictability that would make Blockburger the means
to such an end. Ultimately, moreover, those modifications
are driven by a view of the policies underlying the Act which
I do not share. Justice Kennedy contends that the ACA
is primarily about federalism, and that respect for that principle requires a strong presumption in favor of assimilation.
Post, at 181-182. To the extent that we can divine anything
about the ACA's "purpose" from the historical context which
produced it, I agree with the Court that the statute was
apparently designed "to fill gaps in the federal criminal law"
at a time when there was almost no federal criminal law.
Ante, at 160; see also Williams, supra, at 718-719.

Rejecting Blockburger's elements test leaves me without
an easy and mechanical answer to the question of when a
state and federal offense are the "same" under the ACA.
But the language of the original 1825 ACA suggests that the
focus of that inquiry should be on the way that crimes were
traditionally defined and categorized at common law. It
provided that

". . . if any offence shall be committed in [an enclave], the
punishment of which offence is not specially provided for
by any law of the United States, such offence shall . . .
receive the same punishment as the laws of the state . . .

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
provide for the like offence when committed within thebody of any county of such state." 4 Stat. 115.

Congress did not provide any methodology for determiningwhether an "offence" under state law is "provided for by any
law of the United States"; the statute appears, instead, topresume the reader's familiarity with a set of discrete "offence[s]" existing apart from the particular provisions ofeither state or federal statutory law.

In my opinion, the legal community of that day could onlyhave regarded such language as a reference to the traditional vocabulary and categories of the common law. In-deed, the original ACA was at least in part a response to our
decision in United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32 (1812),which held that the federal courts could not recognize and
punish common-law crimes in the absence of a specific federalstatute. The common law's taxonomy of criminal behavior
developed over the centuries through the interplay of stat-utes and judicial decisions, and its basic categories of criminal offenses remain familiar today: murder, rape, assault,burglary, larceny, fraud, forgery, and so on. I believe that a
contemporary reader of the original ACA would have under-stood it to apply if, and only if, the federal criminal statutes
simply failed to cover some significant "offence" categorygenerally understood to be part of the common law.

Since 1825, of course, state and federal legislatures havecreated a tremendous variety of new statutory crimes that
both cut across and expand the old common-law categories.Some of those new "offences" may have become so well established in our common legal culture that their absencefrom the federal criminal law would now represent a significant gap in its coverage--a gap of the sort the ACA wasdesigned to fill. That possibility introduces an unavoidable
element of judgment and discretion into the application ofthe ACA, and to that extent my interpretation is subject to
the same criticisms I have leveled at the approaches takenby the Court and by

Justice Kennedy. But I think that

180 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
danger is more theoretical than practical. The structure ofthe criminal law, like the basic categories of human vice, has

remained quite stable over the centuries. There have beena few genuine innovations recently; I have in mind, for example, antitrust or securities crimes which did not exist in 1825.
But Congress has been the principal innovator in most ofthose areas, and I doubt that courts will confront many new

"offence" candidates that are not already covered by the fed-eral criminal law. Regardless, the approach outlined above
would produce more predictable results than the majority'sbalancing test, and has the additional virtue of being more
firmly grounded in the text and statutory history.It also produces a clear answer in this case. Ms. Lewis's
conduct is not just punishable under some federal criminal
statute; it is punishable as murder under 18 U. S. C. $ 1111.
Louisiana's murder statutes are structured somewhat differently from their federal counterparts, but they are still
unquestionably murder statutes. Because that "offence" is
certainly "made punishable by any enactment of Congress,"
there is no gap for the ACA to fill. That remains true even
if the common-law category at the appropriate level of generality is instead murder in the first degree. That "offence"
is also defined and punished by the federal criminal law,
although the prosecutors in this case apparently did not believe that they could establish its elements. Accordingly,
I concur in the judgment, and in Part IV of the majority's
opinion.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
As the majority recognizes, the touchstone for interpreting the Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA) is the intent of
Congress. Ante, at 166. One of Congress' purposes in
enacting the ACA was to fill gaps in federal criminal law.
Ante, at 160. The majority fails to weigh, however, a second, countervailing policy behind the ACA: the value of federalism. The intent of Congress was to preserve state law

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
except where it is "displaced by specific laws enacted by Con-gress."

Franklin v. United States, 216 U. S. 559, 568 (1910).
In other words, the ACA embodies Congress' "policy of gen-eral conformity to local law."

United States v. Sharpnack,
355 U. S. 286, 289 (1958). The majority quotes these passages with approval, ante, at 160, yet ignores the principlesof federalism upon which they rest.

A central tenet of federalism is concurrent jurisdictionover many subjects. See

McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat.
316, 425, 435 (1819). One result of concurrent jurisdiction isthat, outside federal enclaves, citizens can be subject to the

criminal laws of both state and federal sovereigns for the
same act or course of conduct. See Heath v. Alabama, 474
U. S. 82, 88-89 (1985). The ACA seeks to mirror the results
of concurrent jurisdiction in enclaves where, but for its provisions, state laws would be suspended in their entirety.
Congress chose this means to recognize and respect the
power of both sovereigns. We should implement this principle by assimilating state law except where Congress has
manifested a contrary intention in "specific [federal] laws."
Franklin, supra, at 568. But see ante, at 163 (suggesting
that persons within federal enclaves should not be "randomly
subject" to state as well as federal law, even though both
sovereigns regulate those outside enclaves).

The majority recognizes that assimilation is not barred
simply because the conduct at issue could be punished under a
federal statute. It is correct, then, to assume that assimilation depends on whether Congress has proscribed the same offense. Ante, at 161-162. Yet in trying to define the same
offense, the majority asks whether assimilation would interfere with a federal policy, rewrite a federal offense, or intrude upon a field occupied by the Federal Government.
Ante, at 164-165. The majority's standards are a roundabout way to ask whether specific federal laws conflict with
state laws. The standards take too little note of the value
of federalism and the concomitant presumption in favor of

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
182 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
assimilation. And for many concrete cases, they are toovague to be of help.

A more serious problem with the majority's approach,however, is that it undervalues the best indicia of congressional intent: the words of the criminal statutes in question
and the factual elements they define. There is a methodol-ogy at hand for this purpose, and it is the

Blockburger test
we use in double jeopardy law. See Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932); see also Missouri v. Hunter, 459
U. S. 359, 366-367 (1983) (Blockburger is a rule for diviningcongressional intent). Under

Blockburger, we examine
whether "[e]ach of the offenses created requires proof of a
different element." 284 U. S., at 304. In other words, does
"each provision requir[e] proof of a fact which the other does
not"? Ibid.

The same-elements test turns on the texts of the statutes
in question, the clearest and most certain indicators of the
will of Congress. The test is straightforward, and courts
and Congress are already familiar with its dynamic. Following Blockburger, a same-elements approach under the
ACA would respect federalism by allowing a broad scope
for assimilation of state law. The majority rejects this approach, however, because federal and state statutes may
have trivial differences in wording or may differ in jurisdictional elements. Ante, at 163, 165.

It would be simpler and more faithful to federalism to use
a same-elements inquiry as the starting point for the ACA
analysis. Courts could use this standard and still accommodate the majority's concerns. Under this view, we would
look beyond slight differences in wording and jurisdictional
elements to discern whether, as a practical matter, the elements of the two crimes are the same. The majority frets
that a small difference in the definitions of purses in federal
and state purse-snatching laws would by itself permit assimilation. Ante, at 163. But a slight difference in definition
need not by itself allow assimilation. See Amar & Marcus,

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Double Jeopardy Law After Rodney King, 95 Colum. L. Rev.1, 38-44 (1995) (advocating a similar approach for double

jeopardy claims involving combinations of federal and stateoffenses). The majority also wonders whether one could
assimilate state laws forbidding robbery of state-chartered
banks because a federal bank-robbery law did not requirea state charter.

Ante, at 163. But again, a jurisdictional
element need not by itself allow assimilation, if all substan-tive elements of the offenses are identical.

Because the purposes of the ACA and double jeopardy lawdiffer, some other adjustments to

Blockburger may be necessary. For instance, Blockburger treats greater and lesser
included offenses as the same to protect the finality of a single prosecution, but finality is not the purpose of the ACA.
Congress chooses to allow greater and lesser included offenses to coexist at the federal level, though a particular
offender cannot be convicted of both. So too the existence
of a lesser included federal offense does not prevent the assimilation of a greater state offense under the ACA, or vice
versa. See ante, at 171 (citing cases finding federal assault
statute does not prevent assimilation of state child-abuse
laws).

Another way in which the ACA differs from double jeopardy law is compelled by our own precedent interpreting the
ACA. See Williams v. United States, 327 U. S. 711 (1946).
Congress sometimes adverts to a specific element of an offense and sets it at a level different from the level set by
state law. When the federal and state offenses have otherwise identical elements, assimilation is not proper. In the
Williams case, for example, a state statutory-rape law set
the age of majority at 18. Id., at 716. Congress had
enacted a federal carnal-knowledge statute, setting the age
of majority at 16. Id., at 714, n. 6. Once Congress had adverted to and set the age of majority, state law could not be
used to rewrite and broaden this particular element. See
id., at 717-718, 724-725. Because Congress had manifested

523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
184 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
a clear intent to the contrary, assimilation was improper.The same would be true if a state grand-larceny law required

a theft of at least $200, while a federal grand-larceny lawrequired a theft of $250 or more.

Congress could have defined first-degree murder to includethe killing of children younger than 3, even though state law
set the requisite age at 12. Had Congress done so, Williams would apply and assimilation of state law would beimproper if all other elements were the same. Here, on the

other hand, Congress has not taken a victim's age into ac-count at all in defining first-degree murder. The state offense includes a substantive age element missing from thefederal statute, so the two do not share the same elements
and assimilation is proper. The majority's analysis is moreobscure and leads it to an incorrect conclusion. For these
reasons, and with all respect, I dissent.

Syllabus

GRAY v. MARYLAND
certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland

No. 96-8653. Argued December 8, 1997--Decided March 9, 1998
Anthony Bell confessed to the police that he, petitioner Gray, and another

man participated in the beating that caused Stacey Williams' death.
After the third man died, a Maryland grand jury indicted Bell and Gray
for murder, and the State tried them jointly. When the trial judge
permitted the State to introduce a redacted version of Bell's confession,
the detective who read it to the jury said "deleted" or "deletion" whenever the name of Gray or the third participant appeared. Immediately
after that reading, however, the detective answered affirmatively when
the prosecutor asked, "after [Bell] gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest . . . Gray; is that correct?" The State also
introduced a written copy of the confession with the two names omitted,
leaving in their place blanks separated by commas. The judge instructed the jury that the confession could be used as evidence only
against Bell, not Gray. The jury convicted both defendants. Maryland's intermediate appellate court held that Bruton v. United States,
391 U. S. 123, prohibited use of the confession and set aside Gray's
conviction. Maryland's highest court disagreed and reinstated that
conviction.

Held: The confession here at issue, which substituted blanks and the word

"delete" for Gray's proper name, falls within the class of statements to
which Bruton's protective rule applies. Pp. 189-197.

(a) Bruton also involved two defendants tried jointly for the same
crime, with the confession of one of them incriminating both himself and
the other. This Court held that, despite a limiting instruction that the
jury should consider the confession as evidence only against the confessing codefendant, the introduction of such a confession at a joint trial
violates the nonconfessing defendant's Sixth Amendment right to crossexamine witnesses. The Court explained that this situation, in which
the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant
are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial, is one of the
contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow limiting instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so devastating to the defendant, that the introduction of the evidence cannot be
allowed. See 391 U. S., at 135-136. Bruton's scope was limited by
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 211, in which the Court held that
the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontesti523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
186 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Syllabus
fying codefendant's confession with a proper limiting instruction when
the confession is redacted to eliminate not only that defendant's name,
but any reference to his or her existence. Pp. 189-191.

(b) Unlike Richardson's redacted confession, the confession here refers directly to Gray's "existence." Redactions that simply replace a
name with an obvious blank space or a word such as "deleted" or a
symbol or other similarly obvious indications of alteration leave statements that, considered as a class, so closely resemble Bruton's unredacted statements as to warrant the same legal results. For one thing,
a jury will often react similarly to an unredacted confession and a confession redacted as here, for it will realize that the confession refers
specifically to the defendant, even when the State does not blatantly
link the defendant to the deleted name, as it did below by asking the
detective whether Gray was arrested on the basis of information in
Bell's confession. For another thing, the obvious deletion may well call
the jurors' attention specially to the removed name. By encouraging
the jury to speculate about the reference, the redaction may overemphasize the importance of the confession's accusation--once the jurors work
out the reference. Finally, Bruton's protected statements and statements redacted to leave a blank or some other similarly obvious alteration, function the same way grammatically: They point directly to, and
accuse, the nonconfessing codefendant. Pp. 192-195.

(c) Although Richardson placed outside Bruton's scope statements
that incriminate inferentially, 481 U. S., at 208, and the jury must use
inference to connect Bell's statements with Gray, Richardson does not
control the result here. Inference pure and simple cannot make the
critical difference. If it did, then Richardson would also place outside
Bruton's scope confessions that use, e. g., nicknames and unique descriptions, whereas this Court has assumed that such identifiers fall inside
Bruton's protection, see Harrington v. California, 395 U. S. 250, 253.
Thus, Richardson must depend in significant part upon the kind of, not
the simple fact of, inference. Richardson's inferences involved statements that did not refer directly to the defendant himself, but became
incriminating "only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial."
481 U. S., at 208. In contrast, the inferences here involve statements
that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously to Gray, and involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make
immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at
trial. Richardson's policy reasons for its conclusion--that application
of Bruton's rule would force prosecutors to abandon use either of the
confession or of a joint trial in instances where adequate redaction
would "not [be] possible," 481 U. S., at 209, and would lead to those same

188 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case concerns the application of Brutonv.

United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968). Bruton involved twodefendants accused of participating in the same crime and

tried jointly before the same jury. One of the defendantshad confessed. His confession named and incriminated the
other defendant. The trial judge issued a limiting instruc-tion, telling the jury that it should consider the confession as
evidence only against the codefendant who had confessed andnot against the defendant named in the confession.

Brutonheld that, despite the limiting instruction, the Constitution

forbids the use of such a confession in the joint trial.The case before us differs from Bruton in that the prosecution here redacted the codefendant's confession by substi-tuting for the defendant's name in the confession a blank
space or the word "deleted." We must decide whether thesesubstitutions make a significant legal difference. We hold
that they do not and that Bruton's protective rule applies.

I
In 1993, Stacey Williams died after a severe beating. An-thony Bell gave a confession, to the Baltimore City police, in

which he said that he (Bell), Kevin Gray, and Jacquin "Tank"Vanlandingham had participated in the beating that resulted
in Williams' death. Vanlandingham later died. A Marylandgrand jury indicted Bell and Gray for murder. The State of
Maryland tried them jointly.The trial judge, after denying Gray's motion for a separate
trial, permitted the State to introduce Bell's confession intoevidence at trial. But the judge ordered the confession redacted. Consequently, the police detective who read theconfession into evidence said the word "deleted" or "deletion" whenever Gray's name or Vanlandingham's name ap-peared. Immediately after the police detective read the
redacted confession to the jury, the prosecutor asked, "afterhe gave you that information, you subsequently were able

to arrest Mr. Kevin Gray; is that correct?" The officer responded, "That's correct." App. 12. The State also introduced into evidence a written copy of the confession with
those two names omitted, leaving in their place blank white
spaces separated by commas. See Appendix, infra. The
State produced other witnesses, who said that six persons
(including Bell, Gray, and Vanlandingham) participated in the
beating. Gray testified and denied his participation. Bell
did not testify.

When instructing the jury, the trial judge specified that
the confession was evidence only against Bell; the instructions said that the jury should not use the confession as evidence against Gray. The jury convicted both Bell and Gray.
Gray appealed.

Maryland's intermediate appellate court accepted Gray's
argument that Bruton prohibited use of the confession and
set aside his conviction. 107 Md. App. 311, 667 A. 2d 983
(1995). Maryland's highest court disagreed and reinstated
the conviction. 344 Md. 417, 687 A. 2d 660 (1997). We
granted certiorari in order to consider Bruton's application
to a redaction that replaces a name with an obvious blank
space or symbol or word such as "deleted."

II
In deciding whether Bruton's protective rule applies to
the redacted confession before us, we must consider both
Bruton and a later case, Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200
(1987), which limited Bruton's scope. We shall briefly summarize each of these two cases.

Bruton, as we have said, involved two defendants--Evans
and Bruton--tried jointly for robbery. Evans did not testify, but the Government introduced into evidence Evans'
confession, which stated that both he (Evans) and Bruton
together had committed the robbery. 391 U. S., at 124.
The trial judge told the jury it could consider the confession

190 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Opinion of the Court
as evidence only against Evans, not against Bruton. Id., at125.

This Court held that, despite the limiting instruction, theintroduction of Evans' out-of-court confession at Bruton's
trial had violated Bruton's right, protected by the Sixth
Amendment, to cross-examine witnesses. Id., at 137. TheCourt recognized that in many circumstances a limiting instruction will adequately protect one defendant from theprejudicial effects of the introduction at a joint trial of evidence intended for use only against a different defendant.
Id., at 135. But it said:

"[T]here are some contexts in which the risk that thejury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great,

and the consequences of failure so vital to the defend-ant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury
system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presentedhere, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial
statements of a codefendant, who stands accused sideby-side with the defendant, are deliberately spreadbefore the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but theircredibility is inevitably suspect . . . . The unreliability
of such evidence is intolerably compounded when thealleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot
be tested by cross-examination." Id., at 135-136 (cita-tions omitted).

The Court found that Evans' confession constituted just sucha "powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statemen[t]," and
that its introduction into evidence, insulated from crossexamination, violated Bruton's Sixth Amendment rights.
Id., at 135.

In Richardson v. Marsh, supra, the Court considered a
redacted confession. The case involved a joint murder trial
of Marsh and Williams. The State had redacted the confession of one defendant, Williams, so as to "omit all reference"

523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

191Cite as: 523 U. S. 185 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
to his codefendant, Marsh--"indeed, to omit all indicationthat

anyone other than . . . Williams" and a third person had
"participated in the crime." Id., at 203 (emphasis in origi-nal). The trial court also instructed the jury not to consider

the confession against Marsh. Id., at 205. As redacted, the
confession indicated that Williams and the third person haddiscussed the murder in the front seat of a car while they

traveled to the victim's house. Id., at 203-204, n. 1. Theredacted confession contained no indication that Marsh--or
any other person--was in the car. Ibid. Later in the trial,however, Marsh testified that she was in the back seat of the
car. Id., at 204. For that reason, in context, the confessionstill could have helped convince the jury that Marsh knew
about the murder in advance and therefore had participated
knowingly in the crime.The Court held that this redacted confession fell outside

Bruton's scope and was admissible (with appropriate limitinginstructions) at the joint trial. The Court distinguished
Evans' confession in Bruton as a confession that was "in-criminating on its face," and which had "expressly implicat[ed]" Bruton. 481 U. S., at 208. By contrast, Williams'confession amounted to "evidence requiring linkage" in that
it "became" incriminating in respect to Marsh "only when
linked with evidence introduced later at trial." Ibid. TheCourt held

"that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the
admission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession
with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, theconfession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant's name, but any reference to his or her existence."
Id., at 211.

The Court added: "We express no opinion on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant's name has been
replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun." Id., at 211,
n. 5.

192 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Opinion of the Court

III
Originally, the codefendant's confession in the case beforeus, like that in

Bruton, referred to, and directly implicated,another defendant. The State, however, redacted that confession by removing the nonconfessing defendant's name.Nonetheless, unlike Richardson's redacted confession, this
confession refers directly to the "existence" of the noncon-fessing defendant. The State has simply replaced the nonconfessing defendant's name with a kind of symbol, namely,the word "deleted" or a blank space set off by commas. The
redacted confession, for example, responded to the question"Who was in the group that beat Stacey," with the phrase,
"Me, , and a few other guys." SeeAppendix,

infra, at 199. And when the police witness readthe confession in court, he said the word "deleted" or "deletion" where the blank spaces appear. We therefore mustdecide a question that

Richardson left open, namely,whether redaction that replaces a defendant's name with

an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space,the word "deleted," or a similar symbol, still falls within
Bruton's protective rule. We hold that it does.Bruton, as interpreted by Richardson, holds that certain
"powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a co-defendant"--those naming another defendant--considered as
a class, are so prejudicial that limiting instructions cannotwork.

Richardson, 481 U. S., at 207; Bruton, 391 U. S., at135. Unless the prosecutor wishes to hold separate trials or

to use separate juries or to abandon use of the confession,he must redact the confession to reduce significantly or to
eliminate the special prejudice that the Bruton Court found.Redactions that simply replace a name with an obvious blank
space or a word such as "deleted" or a symbol or other simi-larly obvious indications of alteration, however, leave statements that, considered as a class, so closely resemble Bruton's unredacted statements that, in our view, the law mustrequire the same result.

Opinion of the Court
For one thing, a jury will often react similarly to an unre-dacted confession and a confession redacted in this way, for

the jury will often realize that the confession refers specifi-cally to the defendant. This is true even when the State
does not blatantly link the defendant to the deleted name, as
it did in this case by asking whether Gray was arrested onthe basis of information in Bell's confession as soon as the

officer had finished reading the redacted statement. Con-sider a simplified but typical example, a confession that reads
"I, Bob Smith, along with Sam Jones, robbed the bank." Toreplace the words "Sam Jones" with an obvious blank will
not likely fool anyone. A juror somewhat familiar with
criminal law would know immediately that the blank, in the
phrase "I, Bob Smith, along with , robbed the bank,"
refers to defendant Jones. A juror who does not know the
law and who therefore wonders to whom the blank might
refer need only lift his eyes to Jones, sitting at counsel table,
to find what will seem the obvious answer, at least if the
juror hears the judge's instruction not to consider the confession as evidence against Jones, for that instruction will provide an obvious reason for the blank. A more sophisticated
juror, wondering if the blank refers to someone else, might
also wonder how, if it did, the prosecutor could argue the
confession is reliable, for the prosecutor, after all, has been
arguing that Jones, not someone else, helped Smith commit
the crime.

For another thing, the obvious deletion may well call the
jurors' attention specially to the removed name. By encouraging the jury to speculate about the reference, the redaction
may overemphasize the importance of the confession's accusation--once the jurors work out the reference. That is why
Judge Learned Hand, many years ago, wrote in a similar
instance that blacking out the name of a codefendant not only
"would have been futile. . . . [T]here could not have been the
slightest doubt as to whose names had been blacked out,"
but "even if there had been, that blacking out itself would

Opinion of the Court
have not only laid the doubt, but underscored the answer."
United States v. Delli Paoli, 229 F. 2d 319, 321 (CA2 1956),
aff 'd, 352 U. S. 232 (1957), overruled by Bruton v. United
States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968). See also Malinski v. New York,
324 U. S. 401, 430 (1945) (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (describing
substitution of names in confession with "X" or "Y" andother similar redactions as "devices . . . so obvious as perhaps to emphasize the identity of those they purported toconceal").

Finally, Bruton's protected statements and statementsredacted to leave a blank or some other similarly obvious alteration function the same way grammatically. They are
directly accusatory. Evans' statement in Bruton used a
proper name to point explicitly to an accused defendant.
And Bruton held that the "powerfully incriminating" effect
of what Justice Stewart called "an out-of-court accusation,"
391 U. S., at 138 (concurring opinion), creates a special, and
vital, need for cross-examination--a need that would be immediately obvious had the codefendant pointed directly to
the defendant in the courtroom itself. The blank space in
an obviously redacted confession also points directly to the
defendant, and it accuses the defendant in a manner similar
to Evans' use of Bruton's name or to a testifying codefendant's accusatory finger. By way of contrast, the factual
statement at issue in Richardson--a statement about what
others said in the front seat of a car--differs from directly
accusatory evidence in this respect, for it does not point
directly to a defendant at all.

We concede certain differences between Bruton and this
case. A confession that uses a blank or the word "delete"
(or, for that matter, a first name or a nickname) less obviously refers to the defendant than a confession that uses the
defendant's full and proper name. Moreover, in some instances the person to whom the blank refers may not be
clear: Although the followup question asked by the State in
this case eliminated all doubt, the reference might not be

523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

195Cite as: 523 U. S. 185 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
transparent in other cases in which a confession, like the
present confession, uses two (or more) blanks, even though
only one other defendant appears at trial, and in which the
trial indicates that there are more participants than the confession has named. Nonetheless, as we have said, we believe that, considered as a class, redactions that replace a
proper name with an obvious blank, the word "delete," a
symbol, or similarly notify the jury that a name has been
deleted are similar enough to Bruton's unredacted confessions as to warrant the same legal results.

IV
The State, in arguing for a contrary conclusion, relies
heavily upon Richardson. But we do not believe Richardson controls the result here. We concede that Richardson
placed outside the scope of Bruton's rule those statements
that incriminate inferentially. 481 U. S., at 208. We also
concede that the jury must use inference to connect the
statement in this redacted confession with the defendant.
But inference pure and simple cannot make the critical difference, for if it did, then Richardson would also place outside Bruton's scope confessions that use shortened first
names, nicknames, descriptions as unique as the "red-haired,
bearded, one-eyed man-with-a-limp," United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 591 (1966) (Fortas, J., dissenting),
and perhaps even full names of defendants who are always
known by a nickname. This Court has assumed, however,
that nicknames and specific descriptions fall inside, not outside, Bruton's protection. See Harrington v. California,
395 U. S. 250, 253 (1969) (assuming Bruton violation where
confessions describe codefendant as the "white guy" and
gives a description of his age, height, weight, and hair color).
The Solicitor General, although supporting Maryland in this
case, concedes that this is appropriate. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 18-19, n. 8.

523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
196 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Opinion of the Court
That being so, Richardson must depend in significant partupon the kind of, not the simple fact of, inference. Richardson's inferences involved statements that did not refer di-rectly to the defendant himself and which became incriminating "only when linked with evidence introduced later attrial." 481 U. S., at 208. The inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer di-rectly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which
involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immedi-ately, even were the confession the very first item introduced
at trial. Moreover, the redacted confession with the blankprominent on its face, in

Richardson's words, "facially in-criminat[es]" the codefendant.

Id., at 209 (emphasis added).Like the confession in Bruton itself, the accusation that the

redacted confession makes "is more vivid than inferential in-crimination, and hence more difficult to thrust out of mind."
481 U. S., at 208.Nor are the policy reasons that Richardson provided in
support of its conclusion applicable here. Richardson ex-pressed concern lest application of

Bruton's rule applywhere "redaction" of confessions, particularly "confessions

incriminating by connection," would often "not [be] possi-ble," thereby forcing prosecutors too often to abandon use
either of the confession or of a joint trial. 481 U. S., at 209.Additional redaction of a confession that uses a blank space,
the word "delete," or a symbol, however, normally is possi-ble. Consider as an example a portion of the confession before us: The witness who read the confession told the jurythat the confession (among other things) said,

"Question: Who was in the group that beat Stacey?
"Answer: Me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys."App. 11.

Why could the witness not, instead, have said:

"Question: Who was in the group that beat Stacey?
"Answer: Me and a few other guys."

197Cite as: 523 U. S. 185 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Richardson itself provides a similar example of this kind ofredaction. The confession there at issue had been "redacted

to omit all reference to respondent--indeed, to omit all indi-cation that anyone other than Martin and Williams participated in the crime," 481 U. S., at 203 (emphasis deleted), and
it did not indicate that it had been redacted. But cf. post,at 203 (

Scalia, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the Court has
"never before endorsed . . . the redaction of a statement bysome means other than the deletion of certain words, with

the fact of the deletion shown").The

Richardson Court also feared that the inclusion,
within Bruton's protective rule, of confessions that incriminated "by connection" too often would provoke mistrials, or
would unnecessarily lead prosecutors to abandon the confession or joint trial, because neither the prosecutors nor the
judge could easily predict, until after the introduction of all
the evidence, whether or not Bruton had barred use of the
confession. 481 U. S., at 209. To include the use of blanks,
the word "delete," symbols, or other indications of redaction,
within Bruton's protections, however, runs no such risk.
Their use is easily identified prior to trial and does not depend, in any special way, upon the other evidence introduced
in the case. We also note that several Circuits have interpreted Bruton similarly for many years, see, e. g., United
States v. Garcia, 836 F. 2d 385 (CA8 1987); Clark v. Maggio,
737 F. 2d 471 (CA5 1984), yet no one has told us of any significant practical difficulties arising out of their administration of that rule.

For these reasons, we hold that the confession here at
issue, which substituted blanks and the word "delete" for the
petitioner's proper name, falls within the class of statements
to which Bruton's protections apply.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200 (1987), we declinedto extend the "narrow exception" of

Bruton v. United States,391 U. S. 123 (1968), beyond confessions that facially incriminate a defendant. Today the Court "concede[s] that
Richardson placed outside the scope of Bruton's rule those
statements that incriminate inferentially," ante, at 195, and
"concede[s] that the jury must use inference to connect thestatement in this redacted confession with the defendant,"

ibid., but nonetheless extends Bruton to confessions thathave been redacted to delete the defendant's name. Because I believe the line drawn in Richardson should not bechanged, I respectfully dissent.

The almost invariable assumption of the law is that jurorsfollow their instructions.

Francis v. Franklin, 471 U. S.
307, 324-325, n. 9 (1985). This rule "is a pragmatic one,
rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption istrue than in the belief that it represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the state and thedefendant in the criminal justice process."

Richardson,
supra, at 211. We have held, for example, that the statemay introduce evidence of a defendant's prior convictions for

the purpose of sentencing enhancement, or statements elic-ited from a defendant in violation of

Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966), for the purpose of impeachment, so long
as the jury is instructed that such evidence may not be con-sidered for the purpose of determining guilt.

Spencer v.
Texas, 385 U. S. 554 (1967); Harris v. New York, 401 U. S.222 (1971). The same applies to codefendant confessions:

523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

201Cite as: 523 U. S. 185 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
"[A] witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial isnot considered to be a witness `against' a defendant if the

jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against acodefendant."

Richardson, supra, at 206. In Bruton, we
recognized a "narrow exception" to this rule: "We held that
a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of con-frontation when the facially incriminating confession of a

nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their joint trial,even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only
against the codefendant." 481 U. S., at 207.We declined in

Richardson, however, to extend Bruton
to confessions that incriminate only by inference from other
evidence. When incrimination is inferential, "it is a less
valid generalization that the jury will not likely obey the
instruction to disregard the evidence." 481 U. S., at 208.
Today the Court struggles to decide whether a confession
redacted to omit the defendant's name is incriminating on its
face or by inference. On the one hand, the Court "concede[s]
that the jury must use inference to connect the statement in
this redacted confession with the defendant," ante, at 195,

but later asserts, on the other hand, that "the redacted confession with the blank prominent on its face . . . `facially
incriminat[es]' " him, ante, at 196. The Court should have
stopped with its concession: The statement "Me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys" does not facially incriminate
anyone but the speaker. The Court's analogizing of "deleted" to a physical description that clearly identifies the
defendant (which we have assumed Bruton covers, see
Harrington v. California, 395 U. S. 250, 253 (1969)) does
not survive scrutiny. By "facially incriminating," we have
meant incriminating independent of other evidence introduced at trial. Richardson, supra, at 208-209. Since the
defendant's appearance at counsel table is not evidence, the
description "red-haired, bearded, one-eyed man-with-alimp," ante, at 195, would be facially incriminating--unless,
of course, the defendant had dyed his hair black and shaved

523US1 Unit: $U39 [04-29-00 20:26:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
202 GRAY v. MARYLAND

Scalia, J., dissenting
his beard before trial, and the prosecution introduced evi-dence concerning his former appearance. Similarly, the

statement "Me, Kevin Gray, and a few other guys" would befacially incriminating, unless the defendant's name set forth
in the indictment was not Kevin Gray, and evidence was introduced to the effect that he sometimes used "Kevin Gray"as an alias. By contrast, the person to whom "deleted" refers in "Me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys" is notapparent from anything the jury knows independent of the
evidence at trial. Though the jury may speculate, the state-ment expressly implicates no one but the speaker.

Of course the Court is correct that confessions redacted to
omit the defendant's name are more likely to incriminate
than confessions redacted to omit any reference to his existence. But it is also true--and more relevant here--that confessions redacted to omit the defendant's name are less likely
to incriminate than confessions that expressly state it. The
latter are "powerfully incriminating" as a class, Bruton,
supra, at 124, n. 1, 135; the former are not so. Here, for instance, there were two names deleted, five or more participants in the crime, and only one other defendant on trial. The
jury no doubt may "speculate about the reference," ante, at
193, as it speculates when evidence connects a defendant to a
confession that does not refer to his existence. The issue,
however, is not whether the confession incriminated petitioner, but whether the incrimination is so "powerful" that we
must depart from the normal presumption that the jury follows its instructions. Richardson, supra, at 208, n. 3. I
think it is not--and I am certain that drawing the line for departing from the ordinary rule at the facial identification of
the defendant makes more sense than drawing it anywhere
else.

The Court's extension of Bruton to name-redacted confessions "as a class" will seriously compromise "society's compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those
who violate the law." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426

(1986) (citation omitted). We explained in Richardson thatforgoing use of codefendant confessions or joint trials was

"too high" a price to ensure that juries never disregard theirinstructions. 481 U. S., at 209-210. The Court minimizes
the damage that it does by suggesting that "[a]dditional re-daction of a confession that uses a blank space, the word
`delete,' or a symbol . . . normally is possible." In the pres-ent case, it asks, why could the police officer not have testified that Bell's answer was "Me and a few other guys"?
Ante, at 196. The answer, it seems obvious to me, is be-cause that is not what Bell said. Bell's answer was "Me,

Tank, Kevin and a few other guys." Introducing the statement with full disclosure of deletions is one thing; introduc-ing as the complete statement what was in fact only a part

is something else. And of course even concealed deletionsfrom the text will often not do the job that the Court demands. For inchoate offenses--conspiracy in particular--redaction to delete all reference to a confederate would often
render the confession nonsensical. If the question was"Who agreed to beat Stacey?", and the answer was "Me and
Kevin," we might redact the answer to "Me and [deleted],"
or perhaps to "Me and somebody else," but surely not tojust "Me"--for that would no longer be a confession to the

conspiracy charge, but rather the foundation for an insanitydefense. To my knowledge we have never before endorsed--and to my strong belief we ought not endorse--theredaction of a statement by some means other than the deletion of certain words, with the fact of the deletion shown.1The risk to the integrity of our system (not to mention the
increase in its complexity) posed by the approval of such

1 The Court is mistaken to suggest that in Richardson v. Marsh, 481
U. S. 200 (1987), we endorsed rewriting confessions as a proper method of
redaction. See ante, at 197. There the parties agreed to the method of
redaction, App. in Richardson v. Marsh, O. T. 1986, No. 85-1433, pp. 100,
107-108, and we had no occasion to address the propriety of editing confessions without showing the nature of the editing.

freelance editing seems to me infinitely greater than the risk
posed by the entirely honest reproduction that the Court
disapproves.

The United States Constitution guarantees, not a perfect
system of criminal justice (as to which there can be considerable disagreement), but a minimum standard of fairness.
Lest we lose sight of the forest for the trees, it should be
borne in mind that federal and state rules of criminal procedure--which can afford to seek perfection because they can
be more readily changed--exclude nontestifying-codefendant
confessions even where the Sixth Amendment does not.
Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (and Maryland's), a trial court may order separate trials if joinder will
prejudice a defendant. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 14; Md.
Crim. Rule 4-253(c) (1998). Maryland courts have described
the term "prejudice" as a "term of art," which "refers only
to prejudice resulting to the defendant from the reception
of evidence that would have been inadmissible against that
defendant had there been no joinder." Ogonowski v. State,
589 A. 2d 513, 520, cert. denied, 593 A. 2d 1127 (1991). The
Federal Rule expressly contemplates that in ruling on a severance motion the court will inspect "in camera any statements or confessions made by the defendants which the
government intends to introduce in evidence at the trial."
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 14. Federal and most state trial
courts (including Maryland's) also have the discretion to exclude unfairly prejudicial (albeit probative) evidence. Fed.
Rule Evid. 403; Md. Rule Evid. 5-403 (1998). Here, petitioner moved for a severance on the ground that the admission of Bell's confession would be unfairly prejudicial. The
trial court denied the motion, explaining that where a confession names two others, and the evidence is that five or
six others participated, redaction of petitioner's name would
not leave the jury with the "unavoidable inference" that Bell
implicated Gray. App. 8.

I do not understand the Court to disagree that the redac-tion itself left unclear to whom the blank referred.

ante, at 194-195. That being so, the rule set forth in Rich-ardson applies, and the statement could constitutionally be

admitted with limiting instruction. This remains, insofar asthe Sixth Amendment is concerned, the most "reasonable
practical accommodation of the interests of the state and thedefendant in the criminal justice process."

Richardson, 481U. S., at 211. For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland.

2 The Court does believe, however, that the answer to a "followup question"--"All right, now, officer, after he gave you that information, you
subsequently were able to arrest Mr. Kevin Gray; is that correct?" ("That's
correct")--"eliminated all doubt" as to the subject of the redaction. Ante,
at 189, 194. That is probably not so, and is certainly far from clear. Testimony that preceded the introduction of Bell's confession had already established that Gray had become a suspect in the case, and that a warrant
had been issued for his arrest, before Bell confessed. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 10. Respondent contends that, given this trial background, and
in its context, the prosecutor's question did not imply any connection between Bell's confession and Gray's arrest, and was simply a means of making the transition from Bell's statement to the next piece of evidence,
Gray's statement. Ibid. That is at least arguable, and an appellate court
is in a poor position to resolve such a contextual question de novo. That
is why objections to trial testimony are supposed to be made at the time--
so that trial judges, who hear the testimony in full, live context, can make
such determinations in the first instance. But if the question did bring
the redaction home to the defendant, surely that shows the impropriety
of the question rather than of the redaction--and the question was not
objected to. The failure to object deprives petitioner of the right to complain of some incremental identifiability added to the redacted statement
by the question and answer. Of course the Court's reliance upon this
testimony belies its contention that name-redacted confessions are powerfully incriminating "as a class," ante, at 195.

GLENDORA v. PORZIO et al.
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 97-7300. Decided March 9, 1998
Held: Abusive filer's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied; and

for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, she is barred from filing any further certiorari
petitions in noncriminal matters unless she first pays the required docketing fee and submits her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Glendora seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperis to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the
Second Circuit. The District Court dismissed petitioner's
claims alleging violation of her due process rights and a conspiracy to violate her due process rights under Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and 42 U. S. C. $ 1985, respectively.
The claims, which arose out of a dispute with her landlord,
were based on purported "sewer service" used by her landlord's lawyers and acceptance of the affidavits of service by
the state-court trial judge. The Second Circuit denied petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissed
her appeal as frivolous.

We deny petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
She is allowed until March 30, 1998, to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance
with Rule 33.1. For the reasons discussed below, we also
direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari in noncriminal matters from petitioner
unless she first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38
and submits her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.

Petitioner has filed 14 petitions with this Court since 1994.
All have been denied without recorded dissent. In 1997, we
invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner in forma pauperis sta523US1 Unit: $U40 [04-29-00 20:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tus. Glendora v. DiPaola, 522 U. S. 965. Petitioner never-theless has filed another frivolous petition with this Court.

In her petition, Glendora asserts that the state trial courtjudge who presided over her dispute with her landlord sanctioned "sewer service" by her landlord's lawyers, and thatthe District Court and Court of Appeals sanctioned this conduct. She does not address the District Court's reasons fordismissing her complaint.

Accordingly, we enter this order barring prospective in
forma pauperis filings by petitioner in noncriminal cases forthe reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia

Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam).

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (Stevens,

HETZEL v. PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY,VIRGINIA,

et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the fourth circuit

No. 97-954. Decided March 23, 1998
A jury awarded petitioner $750,000 on her claims against respondent

county under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the District
Court reduced the damages to $500,000. The Fourth Circuit affirmed
the liability finding, but set aside the damages award as grossly excessive and remanded for recalculation. The District Court then awarded
petitioner $50,000. She filed a motion for a new trial in which she declined the award, arguing that, in reducing her damages, the Fourth
Circuit had effectively offered her a remittitur, which entitled her to a
new trial under the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial.
The District Court agreed, concluding that when a court finds a jury's
verdict excessive and reduces it, the plaintiff has a right either to accept
the reduced award or to have a new trial on the damages issue. The
Fourth Circuit then granted respondents' mandamus petition and stayed
the scheduled retrial, noting that its prior decision had ordered the District Court to recalculate the damages "and to enter final judgment
thereon."

Held: The Fourth Circuit violated petitioner's Seventh Amendment right

to a jury trial. Because the Amendment prohibits the reexamination
of facts determined by a jury, a court has no authority, upon a motion
for a new trial, "according to its own estimate of the amount of damages
which the plaintiff ought to have recovered, to enter an absolute judgment for any other sum than that assessed by the jury." Kennon v.
Gilmer, 131 U. S. 22, 29. In determining that the evidence did not support the jury's general damages award and in ordering the District
Court to recalculate the damages, the appeals court imposed a remittitur. The District Court correctly afforded petitioner the option of a
new trial when it entered judgment for the reduced damages.

Certiorari granted; reversed.

of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983. The District Court reduced the damages

from $750,000 to $500,000, on the grounds that one of theclaims supporting the award was legally insufficient. On respondents' appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit, that court affirmed the finding of liability, but heldthat the damages award was grossly excessive because it

was unsupported by the limited evidence of harm presentedat trial.

Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F. 3d 169,
cert. denied, 519 U. S. 1028 (1996). The court "set aside thedamage award and remand[ed] the case to the district court

for the recalculation of the award of damages for emotional
distress." 89 F. 3d, at 173.

On remand, the District Court recalculated the damages
and awarded petitioner $50,000. Petitioner filed a motion
for a new trial in which she declined the award. She argued
that in reducing her damages, the Court of Appeals in effect
had offered her a remittitur, and that she was therefore entitled to a new trial under the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a right to trial by jury. Respondents agreed that the
Court of Appeals' decision functioned as a remittitur, but
contended that the decision did not allow petitioner the option of a new trial. In a memorandum opinion, the District
Court determined that although the Court of Appeals' mandate clearly reversed the judgment and remanded for recalculation of damages, it did not address the Seventh Amendment issue, which had not arisen until petitioner rejected the
recalculated damages award and sought a new trial. Concluding that Circuit precedent was clear that when a court
finds a jury's verdict excessive and reduces it, the plaintiff
has a right either to accept the reduced award or to have a
new trial, the court granted petitioner's motion for a new
trial on the issue of damages.

Respondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of
mandamus, contending that the District Court did not have
authority under its prior decision to order a new trial. In

an unpublished order, the Court of Appeals granted the peti-tion and stayed the scheduled retrial. It stated that its

prior decision had ordered the District Court to recalculatethe damages "and to enter final judgment thereon." It also
reiterated that pursuant to its earlier mandate, the DistrictCourt should closely examine two cases it had previously
noted as comparable to what would be an appropriate awardin petitioner's case.

1

Petitioner contends that this action of the Court of Ap-peals violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

2

We agree. The Seventh Amendment provides that "theright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by

a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of theUnited States, than according to the rules of the common
law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.

1 After the Court of Appeals issued its mandamus order, the District
Court again recalculated the damages and entered judgment for petitioner
in the amount of $15,000, which was the greater of the amounts awarded
in the two cases noted by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner's appeal from
that judgment is pending in the Court of Appeals. We do not think it
appropriate to stay our decision, however, since the Court of Appeals, at
the time it issued its writ of mandamus, was presented with petitioner's
Seventh Amendment claim in the District Court's memorandum opinion
granting a new trial.

2 Respondents argue that we should not consider petitioner's Seventh

Amendment claim because she failed to raise it in her prior petition for
certiorari. Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F. 3d 169 (CA4), cert.
denied, 519 U. S. 1028 (1996). We think it apparent, however, that petitioner did not raise this claim at that time because she reasonably construed the Court of Appeals' decision as not depriving her of the option
of a new trial if she were to reject the remitted damages award. The
Court of Appeals' decision ordered only that the judgment be reversed
and the case remanded to the District Court for recalculation of damages.
83 F. 3d, at 173. To interpret that decision as precluding the option of a
new trial would require petitioner to assume a deviation from normal practice and an action by the Court of Appeals that at minimum implicated
constitutional concerns. We agree with the District Court that the original mandate was not so explicit as to compel that interpretation.

In Kennon v. Gilmer, 131 U. S. 22, 27-28 (1889), the plaintiff won a general damages verdict for $20,000, and the trial
court denied a motion for a new trial. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana reduced the verdict to $10,000 on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to sustain such a high damages award, and affirmed
the judgment for that amount. Ibid. This Court concluded
that the judgment reducing the amount of the verdict "without submitting the case to another jury, or putting the plaintiff to the election of remitting part of the verdict before
rendering judgment for the rest, was irregular, and, so far
as we are informed, unprecedented." Ibid. It noted that
in accord with the Seventh Amendment's prohibition on the
reexamination of facts determined by a jury, a court has no
authority, upon a motion for a new trial, "according to its
own estimate of the amount of damages which the plaintiff
ought to have recovered, to enter an absolute judgment for
any other sum than that assessed by the jury." Id., at 29.

In determining that the evidence did not support the jury's
general damages award and in ordering the District Court
to recalculate the damages, the Court of Appeals in this case
imposed a remittitur. The District Court correctly afforded
petitioner the option of a new trial when it entered judgment
for the reduced damages. The Court of Appeals' writ of
mandamus, requiring the District Court to enter judgment
for a lesser amount than that determined by the jury without
allowing petitioner the option of a new trial, cannot be
squared with the Seventh Amendment. See id., at 29-30;
see also Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486 (1935) (reaffirming the practice of conditionally remitting damages, but
noting that where a verdict is set aside as grossly inadequate
or excessive, both parties remain entitled to have a jury determine the issues of liability and the extent of injury); Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 433

Scalia, J., dissenting).Respondents contend that the action of the Court of Appeals here is supported by Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr.Co., 386 U. S. 317, 329-330 (1967). But that case dealt with
the application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(d) in asituation where the Court of Appeals had held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of liability. Itdid not involve overturning an award of damages where the
evidence was found sufficient to support a finding of liability.We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals issuing a writ of man-damus to the District Court.

COHEN v. de la CRUZ et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 96-1923. Argued January 20, 1998--Decided March 24, 1998
After the local rent control administrator ordered petitioner to refund

$31,382.50 in excessive rents he had charged respondent tenants, he
sought to discharge his debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code
(Code). The tenants filed an adversary proceeding, arguing that the
debt owed to them was nondischargeable under 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A)
of the Code, which excepts from discharge "any debt . . . for money,
property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to
the extent obtained by . . . actual fraud." They also sought treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud
Act. The Bankruptcy Court ruled in their favor, finding that petitioner
had committed "actual fraud" within the meaning of $ 523(a)(2)(A) and
that his conduct violated the New Jersey law. The court therefore
awarded the tenants treble damages totaling $94,147.50, plus attorney's
fees and costs. The District Court affirmed, as did the Third Circuit,
which held that debts resulting from fraud are nondischargeable in their
entirety under $ 523(a)(2)(A), and that the award of treble damages (plus
attorney's fees and costs) in this case was therefore nondischargeable.

Held: Because $ 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge all liability arising

from fraud, treble damages (plus attorney's fees and costs) awarded
on account of the debtor's fraud fall within the scope of the exception.
The most straightforward reading of $ 523(a)(2)(A) is that it prevents
discharge of "any debt" respecting "money, property, services, or . . .
credit" that the debtor has fraudulently obtained. See Field v. Mans,
516 U. S. 59, 61, 64. First, an obligation to pay treble damages satisfies
the threshold condition that it constitute a "debt." That word is defined
as liability on a "claim," $ 101(12), which in turn is defined as a "right to
payment," $ 101(5)(A), which this Court has said means an enforceable
obligation, Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495
U. S. 552, 559. An award of treble damages is an enforceable obligation
of the debtor, and the creditor has a corresponding right to payment.
Moreover, the phrase "to the extent obtained by" in $ 523(a)(2)(A) modifies "money, property, services, or . . . credit"--not "any debt"--so that
the exception encompasses "any debt . . . for money, property, [etc.], to
the extent [that the money, property, etc., is] obtained by" fraud. The
phrase thereby makes clear that the share of money, property, etc., so

214 COHEN v. de la CRUZ

Opinion of the Court
obtained gives rise to a nondischargeable debt. Once it is established
that specific money or property has been obtained by fraud, however,
"any debt" arising therefrom is excepted from discharge.

The Court rejects petitioner's argument that a "debt for" money,
property, etc., is necessarily limited to the value of the "money, property,
services, or . . . credit" the debtor obtained by fraud, such that a restitutionary ceiling would be imposed on the extent to which a debtor's liability for fraud is nondischargeable. That argument is at odds with the
meaning of "debt for" in parallel exceptions to discharge set forth in

$ 523(a), which use "debt for" to mean "debt as a result of," "debt with
respect to," "debt by reason of," and the like. The Court's reading of

$ 523(a)(2)(A) is also reinforced by the fraud exception's history. Moreover, $ 523(a)'s various exceptions from discharge reflect Congress' conclusion that the creditors' interest in recovering full payment of debts
in these categories outweighs the debtors' interest in a complete fresh
start, see Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 287. But petitioner's construction of the fraud exception would leave creditors short of being
made whole whenever the loss to the creditor from the fraud exceeds
the value obtained by the debtor. Because, under New Jersey law, the
debt for fraudulently obtaining $31,382.50 in rent payments includes treble damages and attorney's fees and costs, petitioner's entire debt of
$94,147.50 (plus attorney's fees and costs) is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Pp. 217-223.

property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancingof credit, to the extent obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false

representation, or actual fraud." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A).The issue in this case is whether $ 523(a)(2)(A) bars the discharge of treble damages awarded on account of the debtor'sfraudulent acquisition of "money, property, services, or . . .
credit," or whether the exception only encompasses thevalue of the "money, property, services, or . . . credit" the
debtor obtains through fraud. We hold that $ 523(a)(2)(A)prevents the discharge of all liability arising from fraud, and
that an award of treble damages therefore falls within thescope of the exception.

I
Petitioner owned several residential properties in andaround Hoboken, New Jersey, one of which was subject to

a local rent control ordinance. In 1989, the Hoboken RentControl Administrator determined that petitioner had been
charging rents above the levels permitted by the ordi-nance, and ordered him to refund to the affected tenants,
who are respondents in this Court, $31,382.50 in excess rentscharged. Petitioner did not comply with the order.

Petitioner subsequently filed for relief under Chapter 7of the Bankruptcy Code, seeking to discharge his debts.
The tenants filed an adversary proceeding against petitionerin the Bankruptcy Court, arguing that the debt owed to
them arose from rent payments obtained by "actual fraud"and that the debt was therefore nondischargeable under 11
U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A). They also sought treble damages andattorney's fees and costs pursuant to the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. See N. J. Stat. Ann. $$ 56:8-2, 56:8-19(West 1989).

Following a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court ruled in thetenants' favor.

In re Cohen, 185 B. R. 171 (1994); 185 B. R.180 (1995). The court found that petitioner had committed

"actual fraud" within the meaning of 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A)and that his conduct amounted to an "unconscionable com523US1 Unit: $U42 [04-29-00 20:29:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mercial practice" under the New Jersey Consumer FraudAct. As a result, the court awarded the tenants treble damages totaling $94,147.50, plus reasonable attorney's fees andcosts. Noting that courts had reached conflicting conclusions on whether $ 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge pu-nitive damages (such as the treble damages at issue here),
the Bankruptcy Court sided with those decisions holdingthat $ 523(a)(2)(A) encompasses all obligations arising out of
fraudulent conduct, including both punitive and compensa-tory damages.* 185 B. R., at 188-189. The District Court
affirmed. 191 B. R. 599 (1996).The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in a
divided opinion. In re Cohen, 106 F. 3d 52 (1997). Afteraccepting the finding of the Bankruptcy Court that petitioner had committed fraud under $ 523(a)(2)(A) and the NewJersey Consumer Fraud Act, the Court of Appeals turned
to whether the treble damages portion of petitioner's lia-bility represents a "debt . . . for money, property, services,
or . . . credit, to the extent obtained by . . . actual fraud."$ 523(a)(2)(A). The court observed that the term "debt,"
defined in the Code as a "right to payment," $ 101(5)(A),plainly encompasses all liability for fraud, whether in the
form of punitive or compensatory damages. And the phrase"to the extent obtained by," the court reasoned, modifies
"money, property, services, or . . . credit," and therefore dis-tinguishes not between compensatory and punitive damages
awarded for fraud but instead between money or propertyobtained through fraudulent means and money or property
obtained through nonfraudulent means. Id., at 57. Here,the court concluded, the entire award of $94,147.50 (plus
attorney's fees and costs) resulted from money obtained

*The Bankruptcy Court characterized an award of treble damages
under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act as punitive in nature, see 185
B. R., at 188, and the Court of Appeals assumed as much without deciding
the question, In re Cohen, 106 F. 3d 52, 55, n. 2 (CA3 1997). That issue
does not affect our analysis, and we have no occasion to revisit it here.

through fraud and is therefore nondischargeable. Id., at 59.Judge Greenberg dissented, concluding that treble damages

are not encompassed by $ 523(a)(2)(A) because they "do notreflect money, property, or services the debtor `obtained.' "
Id., at 60.As the Court of Appeals recognized,

id., at 56, its inter-pretation of $ 523(a)(2)(A) is in accord with that of the Eleventh Circuit but in conflict with that of the Ninth Circuit.Compare In re St. Laurent, 991 F. 2d 672, 677-681 (CA11
1993), with In re Levy, 951 F. 2d 196, 198-199 (CA9 1991).Bankruptcy courts have likewise reached differing conclusions on whether $ 523(a)(2)(A) prevents the discharge inbankruptcy of punitive damages awarded on account of
fraud. Compare In re George, 205 B. R. 679, 682 (Bkrtcy.Ct. Conn. 1997) (punitive damages not dischargeable);

The Bankruptcy Code has long prohibited debtors fromdischarging liabilities incurred on account of their fraud,

embodying a basic policy animating the Code of affordingrelief only to an "honest but unfortunate debtor." Grogan
v. Garner, 498 U. S., at 287 (internal quotation marks omit-ted); see id., at 290; Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127, 138
(1979). Section 523(a)(2)(A) continues the tradition, except-ing from discharge "any debt . . . for money, property, serv523US1 Unit: $U42 [04-29-00 20:29:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ices, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to theextent obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation,

or actual fraud."The most straightforward reading of $ 523(a)(2)(A) is that
it prevents discharge of "any debt" respecting "money, property, services, or . . . credit" that the debtor has fraudu-lently obtained, including treble damages assessed on account of the fraud. See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 61, 64(1995) (describing $ 523(a)(2)(A) as barring discharge of debts
"resulting from" or "traceable to" fraud). First, an obli-gation to pay treble damages satisfies the threshold condition that it constitute a "debt." A "debt" is defined in the
Code as "liability on a claim," $ 101(12), a "claim" is defined
in turn as a "right to payment," $ 101(5)(A), and a "right to
payment," we have said, "is nothing more nor less than
an enforceable obligation." Pennsylvania Dept. of Public
Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 559 (1990). Those
definitions "reflec[t] Congress' broad . . . view of the class of
obligations that qualify as a `claim' giving rise to a `debt,' "
id., at 558, and they plainly encompass treble damages: An
award of treble damages is an "enforceable obligation" of
the debtor, and the creditor has a corresponding "right to
payment."

Moreover, the phrase "to the extent obtained by" in

$ 523(a)(2)(A), as the Court of Appeals recognized, does not
impose any limitation on the extent to which "any debt" arising from fraud is excepted from discharge. "[T]o the extent
obtained by" modifies "money, property, services, or . . .
credit"--not "any debt"--so that the exception encompasses
"any debt . . . for money, property, services, or . . . credit, to
the extent [that the money, property, services, or . . . credit
is] obtained by" fraud. The phrase thereby makes clear that
the share of money, property, etc., that is obtained by fraud
gives rise to a nondischargeable debt. Once it is established
that specific money or property has been obtained by fraud,
however, "any debt" arising therefrom is excepted from dis523US1 Unit: $U42 [04-29-00 20:29:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
charge. In this case, petitioner received rent paymentsfrom respondents for a number of years, of which $31,382.50

was obtained by fraud. His full liability traceable to thatsum--$94,147.50 plus attorney's fees and costs--thus falls
within the exception.

Petitioner does not dispute that the term "debt" encom-passes treble damages or that the phrase "to the extent

obtained by" modifies "money, property, services, or . . .credit." He nonetheless contends that "any debt . . . for
money, property, services, or . . . credit, to the extent ob-tained by" fraud does not include treble damages awarded
in a fraud action. Petitioner submits that $ 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge only the portion of the damages award
in a fraud action corresponding to the value of the "money,
property, services, or . . . credit" the debtor obtained by
fraud. The essential premise of petitioner's argument is
that a "debt for" money, property, or services obtained by
fraud is necessarily limited to the value of the money, property, or services received by the debtor. Petitioner, in this
sense, interprets "debt for"--or alternatively, "liability on a
claim for"--in $ 523(a)(2)(A) to mean "liability on a claim to
obtain," i. e., "liability on a claim to obtain the money, property, services, or credit obtained by fraud," thus imposing a
restitutionary ceiling on the extent to which a debtor's liability for fraud is nondischargeable.

Petitioner's reading of "debt for" in $ 523(a)(2)(A), however, is at odds with the meaning of the same phrase in parallel provisions. Section 523(a) defines several categories of
liabilities that are excepted from discharge, and the words
"debt for" introduce many of them, viz., "debt . . . for a tax
or a customs duty . . . with respect to which a return . . . was
not filed," $ 523(a)(1)(B)(i), "debt . . . for fraud or defalcation
while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny," $ 523(a)(4), "debt . . . for willful and malicious injury
by the debtor to another entity," $ 523(a)(6), and "debt . . .
for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's op523US1 Unit: $U42 [04-29-00 20:29:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
220 COHEN v. de la CRUZ

Opinion of the Court
eration of a motor vehicle if such operation was unlawfulbecause the debtor was intoxicated," $ 523(a)(9). None of

these use "debt for" in the restitutionary sense of "liabilityon a claim to obtain"; it makes little sense to speak of "liability on a claim to obtain willful and malicious injury" or
"liability on a claim to obtain fraud or defalcation." Instead,"debt for" is used throughout to mean "debt as a result of,"

"debt with respect to," "debt by reason of," and the like, seeAmerican Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed. 1992); Black's Law
Dictionary 644 (6th ed. 1990), connoting broadly any liabilityarising from the specified object, see

Davenport, supra, at
563 (characterizing $ 523(a)(7), which excepts from discharge
certain debts "for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture" as encompassing "debts arising from a `fine, penalty, or forfeiture' ").

Because each use of "debt for" in $ 523(a) serves the identical function of introducing a category of nondischargeable
debt, the presumption that equivalent words have equivalent
meaning when repeated in the same statute, e. g., Ratzlaf
v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994), has particular
resonance here. And contrary to petitioner's submission,
it is of no moment that "debt for" in $ 523(a)(2)(A) has as its
immediate object a commodity (money, property, etc.), but in
some of the other exceptions has as its immediate object a
description of misconduct, e. g., $ 523(a)(4) ("debt for fraud
or defalcation [by a] fiduciary"). Section 523(a)(2)(A) also
describes misconduct ("false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud"), even if it first specifies the result of
that conduct (money, property, etc., obtained). The exception in $ 523(a)(9) is framed in the same way, initially specifying an outcome as the immediate object of "debt for" ("death
or personal injury"), and subsequently describing the misconduct giving rise to that outcome ("operation of a motor
vehicle [while] intoxicated"). It is clear that "debt for" in
that provision means "debt arising from" or "debt on account
of," and it follows that "debt for" has the same meaning in

$ 523(a)(2)(A). When construed in the context of the statute

221Cite as: 523 U. S. 213 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
as a whole, then, $ 523(a)(2)(A) is best read to prohibit thedischarge of any liability arising from a debtor's fraudulent

acquisition of money, property, etc., including an award oftreble damages for the fraud.

The history of the fraud exception reinforces our reading of $ 523(a)(2)(A). The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 prohib-ited discharge of "judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations,"$ 17, 30 Stat. 550, and an award of punitive damages for fraud
plainly fits in the category of "judgments in actions forfraud." The exception was broadened in 1903 to include
all "liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or
false representations," $ 5, 32 Stat. 798, language that, a
fortiori, encompasses liability for punitive damages. See
Brown, 442 U. S., at 138 (interpreting the provision as prohibiting discharge of "all debts arising out of conduct specified" therein); In re St. Laurent, 991 F. 2d, at 679 (noting
"practice of holding debts for punitive damages nondischargeable" under this exception "if the compensatory damages . . . were themselves nondischargeable"). And the
Bankruptcy Act of 1978 enacted a "substantially similar"
provision, Brown, supra, at 129, n. 1, barring discharge of
"any debt . . . for obtaining money, property, services, or . . .
credit, by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A) (1982 ed.).

As the result of a slight amendment to the language in
1984, referred to in the legislative history only as a "stylistic
change," see S. Rep. No. 98-65, p. 80 (1983), $ 523(a)(2)(A)
now excepts from discharge "any debt . . . for money, property, services, or . . . credit, to the extent obtained by . . .
false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud."
We, however, "will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode
past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure," Davenport, 495 U. S., at
563, and the change to the language of $ 523(a)(2)(A) in 1984
in no way signals an intention to narrow the established

222 COHEN v. de la CRUZ

Opinion of the Court
scope of the fraud exception along the lines suggested bypetitioner. If, as petitioner contends, Congress wished to

limit the exception to that portion of the debtor's liabilityrepresenting a restitutionary--as opposed to a compensatory
or punitive--recovery for fraud, one would expect Congress
to have made unmistakably clear its intent to distinguishamong theories of recovery in this manner. See,

e. g.,

$ 523(a)(7) (barring discharge of debts "for a fine, penalty, orforfeiture payable to . . . a governmental unit," but only if

the debt "is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss").The conclusion that $ 523(a)(2)(A) bars the discharge of all
liability arising from fraud is further borne out by the implications of petitioner's alternative construction. The various
exceptions to discharge in $ 523(a) reflect a conclusion on the
part of Congress "that the creditors' interest in recovering
full payment of debts in these categories outweigh[s] the
debtors' interest in a complete fresh start." Grogan, 498
U. S., at 287. But if, as petitioner would have it, the fraud
exception only barred discharge of the value of any money,
property, etc., fraudulently obtained by the debtor, the objective of ensuring full recovery by the creditor would be ill
served. Limiting the exception to the value of the money
or property fraudulently obtained by the debtor could prevent even a compensatory recovery for losses occasioned by
fraud. For instance, if a debtor fraudulently represents that
he will use a certain grade of shingles to roof a house and is
paid accordingly, the cost of repairing any resulting water
damage to the house could far exceed the payment to the
debtor to install the shingles. See In re Church, 69 B. R.
425, 427 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex. 1987). The United States, as
amicus curiae, posits another example along these lines, involving "a debtor who fraudulently represents to aircraft
manufacturers that his steel bolts are aircraft quality [and]
obtains sales of $5,000" for the bolts, but "the fraud causes a
multi-million dollar airplane to crash." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 21.

223Cite as: 523 U. S. 213 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
As petitioner acknowledges, his gloss on $ 523(a)(2)(A)would allow the debtor in those situations to discharge any

liability for losses caused by his fraud in excess of theamount he initially received, leaving the creditor far short of
being made whole. And the portion of a creditor's recovery
that exceeds the value of the money, property, etc., fraudu-lently obtained by the debtor--and that hence would be dischargeable under petitioner's view--might include compen-sation not only for losses brought about by fraud but also for
attorney's fees and costs of suit associated with establishingfraud. But see $ 523(d) (allowing award of attorney's fees
and costs to the debtor where a creditor requests dischargeability determination under $ 523(a)(2) for a consumer debt
that is ultimately found to be dischargeable). Those sorts
of results would not square with the intent of the fraud exception. As we have observed previously in addressing different issues surrounding the scope of that exception, it is
"unlikely that Congress . . . would have favored the interest
in giving perpetrators of fraud a fresh start over the interest
in protecting victims of fraud." Grogan, supra, at 287.

In short, the text of $ 523(a)(2)(A), the meaning of parallel
provisions in the statute, the historical pedigree of the fraud
exception, and the general policy underlying the exceptions
to discharge all support our conclusion that "any debt . . . for
money, property, services, or . . . credit, to the extent obtained by" fraud encompasses any liability arising from
money, property, etc., that is fraudulently obtained, including
treble damages, attorney's fees, and other relief that may
exceed the value obtained by the debtor. Under New Jersey law, the debt for fraudulently obtaining $31,382.50 in rent
payments includes treble damages and attorney's fees and
costs, and consequently, petitioner's entire debt of $94,147.50
(plus attorney's fees and costs) is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-6839. Argued October 14, 1997--Decided March 24, 1998
Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a) makes it a crime for a deported alien to return to

the United States without special permission and authorizes a maximum
prison term of two years. In 1988, Congress added subsection (b)(2),
which authorizes a maximum prison term of 20 years for "any alien
described" in subsection (a), if the initial "deportation was subsequent
to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony." Petitioner
pleaded guilty to violating $ 1326, admitting that he had been deported,
that he had unlawfully returned, and that the earlier deportation had
taken place pursuant to three convictions for aggravated felonies. The
District Court sentenced him under the applicable Sentencing Guideline
range to 85 months' imprisonment, rejecting his argument that, since
his indictment failed to mention his aggravated felony convictions, the
court could not sentence him to more than the maximum imprisonment
authorized by $ 1326(a). The Fifth Circuit also rejected his argument,
holding that subsection (b)(2) is a penalty provision which simply permits the imposition of a higher sentence when the unlawfully returning
alien also has a record of prior convictions.

Held: Subsection (b)(2) is a penalty provision, which simply authorizes

an enhanced sentence. Since it does not create a separate crime, the
Government is not required to charge the fact of an earlier conviction
in the indictment. Pp. 228-248.

(a) An indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it
charges, Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, but it need not set
forth factors relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty
of the charged crime. Within limits, see McMillan v. Pennsylvania,
477 U. S. 79, 84-91, the question of which factors are which is normally
a matter for Congress. See Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600,
604. Pp. 228-229.

(b) That Congress intended subsection (b)(2) to set forth a sentencing factor is reasonably clear from a number of considerations. Its subject matter is a typical sentencing factor, and the lower courts have
almost uniformly interpreted statutes that authorize higher sentences
for recidivists as setting forth sentencing factors, not as creating separate crimes. In addition, the words "subject to subsection (b)" at the
beginning of subsection (a) and "[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)" at

Syllabus
the beginning of subsection (b) have a meaning that is neither obscure
nor pointless if subsection (b) is interpreted to provide additional penalties, but not if it is intended to set forth substantive crimes. Moreover,
the circumstances of subsection (b)'s adoption support this reading of
the statutory text. The title of the 1988 amendment--"Criminal penalties for reentry of certain deported aliens," 102 Stat. 4471 (emphasis
added)--also signals a provision that deals with penalties for a substantive crime, and it is reinforced by a legislative history that speaks only
about the creation of new penalties. Finally, interpreting the subsection to create a separate offense risks unfairness, for the introduction at
trial of evidence of a defendant's prior crimes risks significant prejudice.
See, e. g., Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560. Pp. 229-235.

(c) Additional arguments supporting a contrary interpretation--that
the magnitude of the increase in the maximum authorized sentence
shows a congressional intent to create a separate crime, that statutory
language added after petitioner's conviction offers courts guidance on
how to interpret subsection (b)(2), and that the doctrine of constitutional
doubt requires this Court to interpret the subsection as setting forth a
separate crime--are rejected. Pp. 235-239.

(d) There is not sufficient support, in this Court's precedents or elsewhere, for petitioner's claim that the Constitution requires Congress to
treat recidivism as an element of the offense irrespective of Congress'
contrary intent. At most, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364; Mullaney
v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 704; Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197;
and Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605, taken together, yield the broad
proposition that sometimes the Constitution does require (though sometimes it does not require) the State to treat a sentencing factor as an
element of the crime, but they offer no more support than that for petitioner's position. And a legislature's decision to treat recidivism, in
particular, as a sentencing factor rather than an element of the crime
does not exceed constitutional limits on the legislature's power to define
the elements of an offense. McMillan v. Pennsylvania, supra, distinguished. Petitioner's additional arguments--that courts have a tradition of treating recidivism as an element of the related crime, and that
this Court should simply adopt a rule that any significant increase in a
statutory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional "elements"
requirement--are rejected. Pp. 239-247.

(e) The Court expresses no view on whether some heightened standard of proof might apply to sentencing determinations bearing significantly on the severity of sentence. Cf. United States v. Watts, 519
U. S. 148, 156, and n. 2 (per curiam). Pp. 247-248.

113 F. 3d 515, affirmed.

C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed
a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ.,

joined, post, p. 248.

Peter Fleury argued the cause for petitioner. With himon the briefs was Timothy Crooks.

Beth S. Brinkmann argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With her on the brief were

Acting Solicitor Gen-eral Dellinger, Acting Assistant Attorney General Keeney,

Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and William C. Brown.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
Subsection (a) of 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 defines a crime. It for-bids an alien who once was deported to return to the United

States without special permission, and it authorizes a prisonterm of up to, but no more than, two years. Subsection
(b)(2) of the same section authorizes a prison term of upto, but no more than, 20 years for "any alien described" in
subsection (a), if the initial "deportation was subsequentto a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony."
The question before us is whether this latter provision de-fines a separate crime or simply authorizes an enhanced penalty. If the former, i. e., if it constitutes a separate crime,then the Government must write an indictment that mentions the additional element, namely, a prior aggravated fel-ony conviction. If the latter,

i. e., if the provision simplyauthorizes an enhanced sentence when an offender also has

an earlier conviction, then the indictment need not mentionthat fact, for the fact of an earlier conviction is not an element of the present crime.We conclude that the subsection is a penalty provision,
which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence fora recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the

Opinion of the Court
Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlierconviction, in the indictment.

I
In September 1995, a federal grand jury returned an in-dictment charging petitioner, Hugo Almendarez-Torres, with

having been "found in the United States . . . after being de-ported" without the "permission and consent of the Attorney
General" in "violation of . . . Section 1326." App. 3. In De-cember 1995, Almendarez-Torres entered a plea of guilty.
At a hearing, before the District Court accepted his plea,Almendarez-Torres admitted that he had been deported, that
he had later unlawfully returned to the United States, andthat the earlier deportation had taken place "pursuant to"
three earlier "convictions" for aggravated felonies. Id., at10-14.

In March 1996, the District Court held a sentencing hear-ing. Almendarez-Torres pointed out that an indictment
must set forth all the elements of a crime. See Hamling v.United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974). He added that his
indictment had not mentioned his earlier aggravated felonyconvictions. And he argued that, consequently, the court
could not sentence him to more than two years imprison-ment, the maximum authorized for an offender without an
earlier conviction. The District Court rejected this argu-ment. It found applicable a Sentencing Guideline range of
77 to 96 months, see United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 2L1.2; ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table)
(Nov. 1995) (USSG), and it imposed a sentence of 85 months'imprisonment. App. 17.

On appeal the Fifth Circuit also rejected petitioner's argu-ment. 113 F. 3d 515 (1996). Like seven other Circuits, it
has held that subsection (b)(2) is a penalty provision thatsimply permits a sentencing judge to impose a higher sentence when the unlawfully returning alien also has a recordof prior convictions. United States v. Vasquez-Olvera, 999

(CA2 1994) (reaching same result with respect to 8 U. S. C.$ 1326(b)(1)). The Ninth Circuit, however, has reached the
opposite conclusion. United States v. Gonzalez-Medina, 976F. 2d 570, 572 (1992) (subsection (b)(2) constitutes separate
crime). We granted certiorari to resolve this differenceamong the Circuits.

II
An indictment must set forth each element of the crimethat it charges. Hamling v. United States, supra, at 117.

But it need not set forth factors relevant only to the sentenc-ing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime. Within
limits, see McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 84-91(1986), the question of which factors are which is normally a
matter for Congress. See Staples v. United States, 511 U. S.600, 604 (1994) (definition of a criminal offense entrusted to
the legislature, " `particularly in the case of federal crimes,which are solely creatures of statute' ") (quoting

Liparota v.United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985)). We therefore look

to the statute before us and ask what Congress intended.Did it intend the factor that the statute mentions, the prior
aggravated felony conviction, to help define a separatecrime? Or did it intend the presence of an earlier conviction
as a sentencing factor, a factor that a sentencing court mightuse to increase punishment? In answering this question, we
look to the statute's language, structure, subject matter, con-text, and history--factors that typically help courts determine a statute's objectives and thereby illuminate its text.

The directly relevant portions of the statute as it existedat the time of petitioner's conviction included subsection (a),

which Congress had enacted in 1952, and subsection (b),
which Congress added in 1988. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 (1952ed.), as enacted June 27, 1952, $ 276, 66 Stat. 229; 8 U. S. C.

to the question presented--whether Congress intended subsection (b)(2) to set forth a sentencing factor or a separate
crime--is reasonably clear.

At the outset, we note that the relevant statutory subject
matter is recidivism. That subject matter--prior commission of a serious crime--is as typical a sentencing factor as
one might imagine. See, e. g., USSG $$ 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov.
1997) (requiring sentencing judge to consider an offender's
prior record in every case); 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h) (instructing
Commission to write Guidelines that increase sentences dramatically for serious recidivists); 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e) (Armed
Career Criminal Act of 1984) (imposing significantly higher
sentence for felon-in-possession violation by serious recidivists); 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A)-(D) (same for drug distribution); United States Sentencing Commission, 1996 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 35, 49 (for year ending
Sept. 30, 1996, 20.3% of all federal cases involved offenders
with substantial criminal records (criminal history categories
IV-VI); 44.2% of drug cases involved offenders with prior
convictions). Perhaps reflecting this fact, the lower courts
have almost uniformly interpreted statutes (that authorize
higher sentences for recidivists) as setting forth sentencing
factors, not as creating new crimes (at least where the conduct, in the absence of the recidivism, is independently unlawful). E. g., United States v. McGatha, 891 F. 2d 1520,
1525 (CA11 1990) (18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)); United States v.
Arango-Montoya, 61 F. 3d 1331, 1339 (CA7 1995) (21 U. S. C.

$ 841(b)); United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d 21, 25, and n. 6
(CADC 1987). And we have found no statute that clearly
makes recidivism an offense element in such circumstances.
But cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1) (prior felony conviction an element but conduct not otherwise unlawful).

With recidivism as the subject matter in mind, we turn to
the statute's language. In essence, subsection (a) says that
"any alien" once "deported," who reappears in the United

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

231Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
States without appropriate permission, shall be fined or "imprisoned not more than 2 years." Subsection (b) says that
"any alien described in" subsection (a), "whose deportation
was subsequent to a conviction" for a minor, or for a major,
crime, may be subject to a much longer prison term.

The statute includes the words "subject to subsection (b)"
at the beginning of subsection (a), and the words "[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)" at the beginning of subsection (b).
If Congress intended subsection (b) to set forth substantive
crimes, in respect to which subsection (a) would define a
lesser included offense, see Blockburger v. United States, 284
U. S. 299, 304 (1932), what are those words doing there?
The dissent believes that the words mean that the substantive crime defined by "subsection (a) is inapplicable to an
alien covered by subsection (b)," post, at 264, hence the
words represent an effort to say that a defendant cannot be
punished for both substantive crimes. But that is not what
the words say. Nor has Congress ever (to our knowledge)
used these or similar words anywhere else in the federal
criminal code for such a purpose. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 113
(aggravated and simple assault); $$ 1111, 1112 (murder and
manslaughter); $ 2113 (bank robbery and incidental crimes);

$$ 2241, 2242 (aggravated and simple sexual abuse). And
this should come as no surprise since, for at least 60 years,
the federal courts have presumed that Congress does not
intend for a defendant to be cumulatively punished for two
crimes where one crime is a lesser included offense of the
other. See Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 691-693
(1980); Blockburger, supra.

If, however, Congress intended subsection (b) to provide
additional penalties, the mystery disappears. The words
"subject to subsection (b)" and "[n]otwithstanding subsection
(a)" then are neither obscure nor pointless. They say, without obscurity, that the crime set forth in subsection (a),
which both defines a crime and sets forth a penalty, is "sub523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
232 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ject to" subsection (b)'s different penalties (where the alien isalso a felon or aggravated felon). And (b)'s higher maximum

penalties may apply to an offender who violates (a) "notwith-standing" the fact that (a) sets forth a lesser penalty for one
who has committed the same substantive crime. Nor is itpointless to specify that (b)'s punishments, not (a)'s punishment, apply whenever an offender commits (a)'s offense in amanner set forth by (b).

Moreover, the circumstances of subsection (b)'s adoptionsupport this reading of the statutory text. We have examined the language of the statute in 1988, when Congressadded the provision here at issue. That original language
does not help petitioner. In 1988, the statute read as follows(with the 1988 amendment underscored):

"$ 1326. Reentry of deported alien; criminal penaltiesfor reentry of certain deported aliens.

"(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, anyalien who--
"(1) has been . . . deported . . . , and thereafter"(2) enters . . . , or is at any time found in, the United
States [without the Attorney General's consent or thelegal equivalent],
"shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof,be punished by imprisonment of not more than two
years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.

"(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section,in the case of any alien described in such subsection--

"(1) whose deportation was subsequent to a convic-tion for commission of a felony (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined under title 18,
imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; or"(2) whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alienshall be fined under such title, imprisoned not more
than 15 years, or both." 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 (1988 ed.) (em-phasis added).

Opinion of the Court
Thus, at the time of the amendment, the operative languageof subsection (a)'s ordinary reentering-alien provision said

that a reentering alien "shall be guilty of a felony, and
upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment of not
more than two years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000."
The 1988 amendment, subsection (b), by way of contrast, re-ferred only to punishment--an increased punishment for the

felon, or the aggravated felon, whom subsection (a) has "de-scribed." Although one could read the language, "any alien
described in [subsection (a)]," standing alone, as importingsubsection (a)'s elements into new offenses defined in subsection (b), that reading seems both unusual and awkward when
taken in context, for the reasons just given. Linguistically
speaking, it seems more likely that Congress simply meant
to "describe" an alien who, in the words of the 1988 statute,
was "guilty of a felony" defined in subsection (a) and "convict[ed] thereof."

As the dissent points out, post, at 265, Congress later
struck from subsection (a) the words just quoted, and added
in their place the words, "shall be fined under title 18, or
imprisoned not more than two years." See Immigration Act
of 1990 (1990 Act), $ 543(b)(3), 104 Stat. 5059. But this
amendment was one of a series in the 1990 Act that uniformly updated and simplified the phrasing of various, disparate civil and criminal penalty provisions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act. See, e. g., 1990 Act, $ 543(b)(1)
(amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1282(c)); $ 543(b)(2)(C) (amending 8
U. S. C. $ 1325); $ 543( b)(4) (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1327);

$ 543(b)(5) (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1328). The section of the
Act that contained the amendment is titled "Increase in Fine
Levels; Authority of the INS to Collect Fines," and the relevant subsection, simply "Criminal Fine Levels." 1990 Act,

$ 543(b), 104 Stat. 5057, 5059. Although the 1990 amendment did have the effect of making the penalty provision in
subsection (a) (which had remained unchanged since 1952)
parallel with its counterparts in later enacted subsection (b),

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
234 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
neither the amendment's language, nor the legislative his-tory of the 1990 Act, suggests that in this housekeeping

measure, Congress intended to change, or to clarify, the fun-damental relationship between the two subsections.

We also note that "the title of a statute and the heading
of a section" are "tools available for the resolution of adoubt" about the meaning of a statute.

Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947); see also
INS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502
U. S. 183, 189 (1991). The title of the 1988 amendment is"Criminal

penalties for reentry of certain deported aliens."

$ 7345, 102 Stat. 4471 (emphasis added). A title that contains the word "penalties" more often, but certainly not

always, see post, at 266-267, signals a provision that deals
with penalties for a substantive crime.

In this instance the amendment's title does not reflect
careless, or mistaken, drafting, for the title is reinforced by
a legislative history that speaks about, and only about, the
creation of new penalties. See S. 973, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.
(1987), 133 Cong. Rec. 8771 (1987) (original bill titled, "A bill
to provide for additional criminal penalties for deported
aliens who reenter the United States, and for other purposes"); 134 Cong. Rec. 27429 (1988) (section-by-section analysis referring to Senate bill as increasing penalties for unlawful reentry); id., at 27445 (remarks of Sen. D'Amato) (law
would "increas[e] current penalties for illegal reentry after
deportation"); id., at 27462 (remarks of Sen. Chiles) (law
would "impose stiff penalties" against deported aliens previously convicted of drug offenses); 133 Cong. Rec. 28840-
28841 (1987) (remarks of Rep. Smith) (corresponding House
bill creates three-tier penalty structure). The history, to
our knowledge, contains no language at all that indicates
Congress intended to create a new substantive crime.

Finally, the contrary interpretation--a substantive criminal offense--risks unfairness. If subsection (b)(2) sets forth
a separate crime, the Government would be required to

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

235Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
prove to the jury that the defendant was previously deported"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated

felony." As this Court has long recognized, the introductionof evidence of a defendant's prior crimes risks significant
prejudice. See, e. g., Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560(1967) (evidence of prior crimes "is generally recognized to
have potentiality for prejudice"). Even if a defendant's stip-ulation were to keep the name and details of the previous
offense from the jury, see Old Chief v. United States, 519U. S. 172, 178-179 (1997), jurors would still learn, from the
indictment, the judge, or the prosecutor, that the defendanthad committed an

aggravated felony. And, as we said lastTerm, "there can be no question that evidence of the . . .

nature of the prior offense," here, that it was "aggravated"or serious, "carries a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant." Id., at 185 (emphasis added). Like several lowercourts, we do not believe, other things being equal, that Congress would have wanted to create this kind of unfairness inrespect to facts that are almost never contested. See,

e. g.,
United States v. Forbes, 16 F. 3d, at 1298-1300; United Statesv. Rumney, 867 F. 2d 714, 718-719 (CA1 1989); United States

v. Brewer, 853 F. 2d 1319, 1324-1325 (CA6 1988) (en banc);United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d, at 25-26; Government
of Virgin Islands v. Castillo, 550 F. 2d 850, 854 (CA3 1977).In sum, we believe that Congress intended to set forth
a sentencing factor in subsection (b)(2) and not a separatecriminal offense.

B
We must also consider several additional arguments thathave been or might be made for a contrary interpretation

of the statute. First, one might try to derive a congres-sional intent to establish a separate crime from the magnitude of the increase in the maximum authorized sentence.The magnitude of the change that Congress made in 1988,
however, proves little. That change--from a 2-year maxi-mum to 5- and 15-year maximums--is well within the range

236 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
set forth in other statutes that the lower courts have gen-erally interpreted as providing for sentencing enhancements. Compare 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 (1988 ed.) with 21 U. S. C.$$ 841(b)(1)(B) and (D) (distributing less than 50 kilograms of
marijuana, maximum 5 years; distributing 100 or more kilograms of marijuana, 5 to 40 years), $$ 841(b)(1)(A) and (C)(distributing less than 100 grams of heroin, maximum 20

years; distributing 1 kilogram or more of heroin, maximumof life imprisonment), $ 841(b)(1)(B) (distributing 500 grams
or more of cocaine, 5 to 40 years; same, with prior drug fel-ony conviction, 10 years to life); $ 962 (doubling maximum
term for second and subsequent violations of drug importation laws); 18 U. S. C. $ 844 (using or carrying explosive device during commission of felony, maximum 10 years; subsequent offense, maximum 20 years); $ 2241(c) (sexual abuse
of children, maximum life; second offense, mandatory life);

$ 2320(a) (trafficking in counterfeit goods, maximum 10 years;
subsequent offense, maximum 20 years). Congress later
amended the statute, increasing the maximums to 10 and to
20 years, respectively. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, $$ 130001(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2), 108 Stat.
2023. But nothing suggests that, in doing so, Congress intended to transform that statute's basic nature. And the
later limits are close to the range suggested by other statutes regardless.

Second, petitioner and the dissent point, in part, to statutory language that did not exist when petitioner was convicted in 1995. Petitioner, for example, points out that in
1996, Congress added two new subsections, (b)(3) and (b)(4),
which, petitioner says, created new substantive crimes. See
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,

$ 401(c), 110 Stat. 1267 (adding subsection (b)(3)); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(IIRIRA), $ 305(b), 110 Stat. 3009-606 to 3009-607 (adding
subsection (b)(4)). Both petitioner and the dissent also refer
to another 1996 statutory provision in which Congress used

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

237Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
the word "offense" to refer to the subsection now before us.See IIRIRA, $ 334, 110 Stat. 3009-635.

These later enacted laws, however, are beside the point.They do not declare the meaning of earlier law. Cf.

Federal
Housing Administration v. Darlington, Inc., 358 U. S. 84,
90 (1958). They do not seek to clarify an earlier enactedgeneral term. Cf.

Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395
U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969). They do not depend for their ef-fectiveness upon clarification, or a change in the meaning of

an earlier statute. Cf. Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell
Oil Co., 444 U. S. 572, 595-596 (1980). They do not reflect
any direct focus by Congress upon the meaning of the earlier
enacted provisions. Cf. ibid.; Darlington, supra, at 86.
Consequently, we do not find in them any forward looking
legislative mandate, guidance, or direct suggestion about
how courts should interpret the earlier provisions.

Regardless, it is not obvious that the two new subsections
to which petitioner points create new crimes (a matter on
which we express no view) nor, in adding them, did Congress
do more than leave the legal question here at issue where it
found it. The fact that Congress used a technical, crimesuggesting word--"offense"--eight years later in a different,
and minor, statutory provision proves nothing--not least because it is more than offset by different words in the same
later statute that suggest with greater force the exact opposite, namely, the precise interpretation of the relation of subsection (b) to subsection (a) that we adopt. See IIRIRA,

$ 321(c), 110 Stat. 3009-628 (stating that a new definition of
"aggravated felony" applies "under" subsection (b) "only to

violations" of subsection (a)).

Finally, petitioner and the dissent argue that the doctrine
of "constitutional doubt" requires us to interpret subsection
(b)(2) as setting forth a separate crime. As Justice Holmes
said long ago: "A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score." United

States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916) (citing
United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909)); see also Ashwander v.
TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
"This canon is followed out of respect for Congress, which we
assume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations."

American Tobacco Co., 264 U. S. 298, 305-307 (1924). The
doctrine seeks in part to minimize disagreement between
the branches by preserving congressional enactments that
might otherwise founder on constitutional objections. It is
not designed to aggravate that friction by creating (through
the power of precedent) statutes foreign to those Congress
intended, simply through fear of a constitutional difficulty
that, upon analysis, will evaporate. Thus, those who invoke
the doctrine must believe that the alternative is a serious
likelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional.
Only then will the doctrine serve its basic democratic function of maintaining a set of statutes that reflect, rather than
distort, the policy choices that elected representatives have
made. For similar reasons, the statute must be genuinely
susceptible to two constructions after, and not before, its
complexities are unraveled. Only then is the statutory construction that avoids the constitutional question a "fair" one.

Unlike the dissent, we do not believe these conditions are
met in the present case. The statutory language is somewhat complex. But after considering the matter in context,
we believe the interpretative circumstances point significantly in one direction. More important, even if we were to
assume that petitioner's construction of the statute is "fairly
possible," Jin Fuey Moy, supra, at 401, the constitutional
questions he raises, while requiring discussion, simply do not
lead us to doubt gravely that Congress may authorize courts
to impose longer sentences upon recidivists who commit a
particular crime. The fact that we, unlike the dissent, do

239Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
not gravely doubt the statute's constitutionality in this re-spect is a crucial point. That is because the "constitutional

doubt" doctrine does not apply mechanically whenever therearises a significant constitutional question the answer to
which is not obvious. And precedent makes clear that theCourt need not apply (for it has not always applied) the doctrine in circumstances similar to those here--where a consti-tutional question, while lacking an obvious answer, does not
lead a majority gravely to doubt that the statute is constitu-tional. See,

e. g., Rust, 500 U. S., at 190-191 (declining toapply doctrine although petitioner's constitutional claims not

"without some force"); id., at 204-207 (Blackmun, J., dissent-ing);

United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 611 (1989);id., at 636 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); United States v. Locke,

471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985); id., at 120 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

III
Invoking several of the Court's precedents, petitionerclaims that the Constitution requires Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the offense--irrespective of Congress'contrary intent. Moreover, petitioner says, that requirement carries with it three subsidiary requirements that theConstitution mandates in respect to ordinary, legislatively
intended, elements of crimes. The indictment must statethe "element." See, e. g., Hamling v. United States, 418
U. S., at 117. The Government must prove that "element"to a jury. See, e. g., Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145,
149 (1968). And the Government must prove the "element"beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). We cannot find sufficientsupport, however, in our precedents or elsewhere, for petitioner's claim.This Court has explicitly held that the Constitution's Due
Process Clause "protects the accused against conviction ex-cept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."

240 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). But Winship, thecase in which the Court set forth this proposition of constitutional law, does not decide this case. It said that the Consti-tution entitles juveniles, like adults, to the benefit of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt in respect to the elements of the
crime. It did not consider whether, or when, the Constitu-tion requires the Government to treat a particular fact as an

element, i. e., as a "fact necessary to constitute the crime,"even where the crime-defining statute does not do so.

Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), provides peti-tioner with stronger support. The Court there struck down
a state homicide statute under which the State presumed
that all homicides were committed with "malice," punishable
by life imprisonment, unless the defendant proved that he
had acted in the heat of passion. Id., at 688. The Court
wrote that "if Winship were limited to those facts that constitute a crime as defined by state law, a State could undermine many of the interests that decision sought to protect"
just by redefining "the elements that constitut[ed] different
crimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solely on the
extent of punishment." Id., at 698. It simultaneously held
that the prosecution must establish "beyond a reasonable
doubt" the nonexistence of "heat of passion"--the fact that,
under the State's statutory scheme, distinguished a homicide
punishable by a life sentence from a homicide punishable by
a maximum of 20 years. Id., at 704. Read literally, this
language, we concede, suggests that Congress cannot permit
judges to increase a sentence in light of recidivism, or any
other factor, not set forth in an indictment and proved to a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

This Court's later case, Patterson v. New York, supra,
however, makes absolutely clear that such a reading of Mullaney is wrong. The Court, in Patterson, pointed out that
the State in Mullaney made the critical fact--the absence of
"heat of passion"--not simply a potential sentencing factor,
but also a critical part of the definition of "malice afore523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

241Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
thought," which was itself in turn "part of " the statute'sdefinition of "homicide," the crime in question.

Patterson,
432 U. S., at 215-216. (The Maine Supreme Court, in defin-ing the crime, had said that "malice" was "presumed" unless

"rebutted" by the defendant's showing of "heat of passion."
Id., at 216.) The Court found this circumstance extremelyimportant. It said that

Mullaney had considered (and held
"impermissible") the shifting of a burden of proof "with
respect to a fact which the State deems so important that
it must be either proved or presumed." 432 U. S., at 215(emphasis added). And the Court then held that similar

burden shifting was permissible with respect to New York's
homicide-related sentencing factor "extreme emotional disturbance." Id., at 205-206. That factor was not a factor
that the state statute had deemed "so important" in relation
to the crime that it must be either "proved or presumed."
Id., at 205-206, 215.

The upshot is that Mullaney's language, if read literally,
suggests that the Constitution requires that most, if not all,
sentencing factors be treated as elements. But Patterson
suggests the exact opposite, namely, that the Constitution
requires scarcely any sentencing factors to be treated in that
way. The cases, taken together, cannot significantly help
petitioner, for the statute here involves a sentencing factor--
the prior commission of an aggravated felony--that is neither "presumed" to be present, nor need be "proved" to be
present, in order to prove the commission of the relevant
crime. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a) (defining offense elements).
Indeed, as we have said, it involves one of the most frequently found factors that affects sentencing--recidivism.

Nor does Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605 (1967), which
petitioner cites, provide significant additional help, for
Specht was decided before Patterson (indeed before Winship); it did not consider the kind of matter here at issue;
and, as this Court later noted, the Colorado defendant in
Specht was "confronted with `a radically different situation'

Opinion of the Court
from the usual sentencing proceeding." McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S., at 89. At most, petitioner might read
all these cases, taken together, for the broad proposition that
sometimes the Constitution does require (though sometimes
it does not require) the State to treat a sentencing factor as
an element. But we do not see how they can help petitionermore than that.

We turn then to the case upon which petitioner must pri-marily rely,

McMillan v. Pennsylvania. The Court there
considered a Pennsylvania statute that set forth a sentenc-ing factor--"visibly possessing a firearm"--the presence of

which required the judge to impose a minimum prison term
of five years. The Court held that the Constitution did not
require the State to treat the factor as an element of the
crime. In so holding, the Court said that the State's "link[ing] the `severity of punishment' to `the presence or absence
of an identified fact' " did not automatically make of that fact
an "element." Id., at 84 (quoting Patterson v. New York,
supra, at 214). It said, citing Patterson, that "the state legislature's definition of the elements of the offense is usually
dispositive." 477 U. S., at 85. It said that it would not "define precisely the constitutional limits" of a legislature's
power to define the elements of an offense. Id., at 86. And
it held that, whatever those limits might be, the State had
not exceeded them. Ibid. Petitioner must therefore concede that "firearm possession" (in respect to a mandatory
minimum sentence) does not violate those limits. And he
must argue that, nonetheless, "recidivism" (in respect to an
authorized maximum) does violate those limits.

In assessing petitioner's claim, we have examined McMillan to determine the various features of the case upon which
the Court's conclusion arguably turned. The McMillan
Court pointed out: (1) that the statute plainly "does not
transgress the limits expressly set out in Patterson," ibid.;
(2) that the defendant (unlike Mullaney's defendant) did not
face " `a differential in sentencing ranging from a nominal

Opinion of the Court
fine to a mandatory life sentence,' " 477 U. S., at 87 (quoting
Mullaney, 421 U. S., at 700); (3) that the statute did not
"alte[r] the maximum penalty for the crime" but "operatessolely to limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a

penalty within the range already available to it," 477 U. S., at
87-88; (4) that the statute did not "creat[e] a separate offensecalling for a separate penalty,"

id., at 88; and (5) that the
statute gave "no impression of having been tailored to per-mit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags the

dog of the substantive offense," but, to the contrary, "simplytook one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment . . . and dictated the precise
weight to be given that factor," id., at 88, 89-90.

This case resembles McMillan in respect to most of these
factors. But it is different in respect to the third factor, for
it does "alte[r] the maximum penalty for the crime," id., at
87; and it also creates a wider range of appropriate punishments than did the statute in McMillan. We nonetheless
conclude that these differences do not change the constitutional outcome for several basic reasons.

First, the sentencing factor at issue here--recidivism--is a
traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing
court's increasing an offender's sentence. See, e. g., Parke v.
Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 26 (1992) (Recidivism laws "have a long
tradition in this country that dates back to colonial times"
and currently are in effect in all 50 States); U. S. Dept. of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Statutes Requiring the
Use of Criminal History Record Information 17-41 (June
1991) (50-state survey); USSG $$ 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov. 1997)
(requiring sentencing court to consider defendant's prior record in every case). Consistent with this tradition, the Court
said long ago that a State need not allege a defendant's prior
conviction in the indictment or information that alleges the
elements of an underlying crime, even though the conviction
was "necessary to bring the case within the statute." Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S. 616, 624 (1912). That con523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
244 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
clusion followed, the Court said, from "the distinct nature
of the issue," and the fact that recidivism "does not relate
to the commission of the offense, but goes to the punishment
only, and therefore . . . may be subsequently decided."
Id., at 629 (emphasis added). The Court has not deviated
from this view. See Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 452 (1962)(due process does not require advance notice that trial for

substantive offense will be followed by accusation that thedefendant is a habitual offender);

Parke, supra, at 27 ("[A]
charge under a recidivism statute does not state a separateoffense, but goes to punishment only"). And, as we said

before, supra, at 230, Congress, reflecting this tradition, has
never, to our knowledge, made a defendant's recidivism an
element of an offense where the conduct proscribed is otherwise unlawful. See United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d
21, 25, and n. 6 (CADC 1987) (opinion of R. Ginsburg, J.) (referring to fact that few, if any, federal statutes make "prior
criminal convictions . . . elements of another criminal offense
to be proved before the jury"). Although these precedents
do not foreclose petitioner's claim (because, for example, the
state statute at issue in Graham and Oyler provided for a
jury determination of disputed prior convictions), to hold
that the Constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an
"element" of petitioner's offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition of treating recidivism
as "go[ing] to the punishment only." Graham, supra, at 629.

Second, the major difference between this case and McMillan consists of the circumstance that the sentencing factor at issue here (the prior conviction) triggers an increase
in the maximum permissive sentence, while the sentencing
factor at issue in McMillan triggered a mandatory minimum
sentence. Yet that difference--between a permissive maximum and a mandatory minimum--does not systematically, or
normally, work to the disadvantage of a criminal defendant.
To the contrary, a statutory minimum binds a sentencing
judge; a statutory maximum does not. A mandatory mini523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

245Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
mum can, as Justice Stevens dissenting in McMillanpointed out, "mandate a

minimum sentence of imprisonment
more than twice as severe as the maximum the trial judgewould otherwise have imposed." 477 U. S., at 95. It can

eliminate a sentencing judge's discretion in its entirety.
See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2241(c) (authorizing maximum term oflife imprisonment for sexual abuse of children; mandating

life imprisonment for second offense). And it can produceunfairly disproportionate impacts on certain kinds of offenders. See United States Sentencing Commission, MandatoryMinimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System
26-34 (Aug. 1991) (discussing "tariff " and "cliff " effects of
mandatory minimums). In sum, the risk of unfairness to a
particular defendant is no less, and may well be greater,
when a mandatory minimum sentence, rather than a permissive maximum sentence, is at issue.

Although McMillan pointed to a difference between
mandatory minimums and higher authorized maximums, it
neither "rested its judgment" on that difference, nor "rejected" the above analysis, as the dissent contends, post,
at 254. Rather, McMillan said that the petitioners' argument in that case would have had "more superficial appeal"
if the sentencing fact "exposed them to greater or additional
punishment." 477 U. S., at 88 (emphasis added). For the
reasons just given, and in light of the particular sentencing
factor at issue in this case--recidivism--we should take McMillan's statement to mean no more than it said, and therefore not to make a determinative difference here.

Third, the statute's broad permissive sentencing range
does not itself create significantly greater unfairness.
Judges (and parole boards) have typically exercised their
discretion within broad statutory ranges. See, e. g., supra,
at 232, 236 (statutory examples); National Institute of Justice, Sentencing Reform in the United States (Aug. 1985)
(survey of sentencing laws in the 50 States); L. Friedman,
Crime and Punishment in American History 159-163 (1993)

246 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(history of indeterminate sentencing). And the SentencingGuidelines have recently sought to channel that discretion

using "sentencing factors" which no one here claims that theConstitution thereby makes "elements" of a crime.

Finally, the remaining McMillan factors support the conclusion that Congress has the constitutional power to treatthe feature before us--prior conviction of an aggravated

felony--as a sentencing factor for this particular offense(illegal entry after deportation). The relevant statutory
provisions do not change a pre-existing definition of a well-established crime, nor is there any more reason here, than
in McMillan, to think Congress intended to "evade" the
Constitution, either by "presuming" guilt or "restructuring"
the elements of an offense. Cf. McMillan, supra, at 86-87,
89-90.

For these reasons, we cannot find in McMillan (a case
holding that the Constitution permits a legislature to require
a longer sentence for gun possession) significant support for
the proposition that the Constitution forbids a legislature to
authorize a longer sentence for recidivism.

Petitioner makes two basic additional arguments in response. He points to what he calls a different "tradition"--
that of courts having treated recidivism as an element of
the related crime. See, e. g., Massey v. United States, 281
F. 293, 297-298 (CA8 1922); Singer v. United States, 278
F. 415, 420 (CA3 1922); People v. Sickles, 51 N. E. 288, 289
(N. Y. 1898); see also post, at 256-257 (citing authority). We
do not find this claim convincing, however, for any such tradition is not uniform. See Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S., at 566
("The method for determining prior convictions varies . . .
between jurisdictions affording a jury trial on this issue . . .
and those leaving that question to the court"); Note, Recidivist Procedures, 40 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 332, 347 (1965) (as of
1965, eight States' recidivism statutes provide for determination of prior convictions by judge, not jury). Nor does it
appear modern. Compare State v. Thorne, 129 Wash. 2d

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
736, 776-784, 921 P. 2d 514, 533-538 (1996) (upholding staterecidivism law against federal constitutional challenge), with

State v. Furth, 5 Wash. 2d 1, 11-19, 104 P. 2d 925, 930-933(1940). And it nowhere (to our knowledge) rested upon
a federal constitutional guarantee. See, e. g., Massey v.
United States, supra, at 297 (applying federal law, notingjury determination of prior offense applied "unless the statute designates a different mode of procedure").Petitioner also argues, in essence, that this Court should
simply adopt a rule that any significant increase in a statu-tory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional "elements" requirement. We have explained why we believethe Constitution, as interpreted in

McMillan and earliercases, does not impose that requirement. We add that such

a rule would seem anomalous in light of existing case lawthat permits a judge, rather than a jury, to determine the
existence of factors that can make a defendant eligible forthe death penalty, a punishment far more severe than that
faced by petitioner here. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639, 647 (1990) (rejecting capital defendant's argument that
every finding of fact underlying death sentence must bemade by a jury);

Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638, 640-641(1989) (per curiam) ( judge may impose death penalty based

on his finding of aggravating factor because such factor isnot element of offense to be determined by jury); Spaziano
v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 465 (1984) (same). And we wouldalso find it difficult to reconcile any such rule with our precedent holding that the sentencing-related circumstances ofrecidivism are not part of the definition of the offense for
double jeopardy purposes. Graham, 224 U. S., at 623-624.For these reasons, we reject petitioner's constitutional
claim that his recidivism must be treated as an element ofhis offense.

IV
We mention one final point. Petitioner makes no sepa-rate, subsidiary, standard of proof claims with respect to his

248 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
sentencing, perhaps because he admitted his recidivism atthe time he pleaded guilty and would therefore find it difficult to show that the standard of proof could have made adifference to his case. Accordingly, we express no view on
whether some heightened standard of proof might apply tosentencing determinations that bear significantly on the
severity of sentence. Cf. United States v. Watts, 519 U. S.148, 156, and n. 2 (1997)

(per curiam) (acknowledging, butnot resolving, "divergence of opinion among the Circuits" as

to proper standard for determining the existence of "relevantconduct" that would lead to an increase in sentence).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Because Hugo Roman Almendarez-Torres illegally re-entered the United States after having been convicted of

an aggravated felony, he was subject to a maximum pos-sible sentence of 20 years' imprisonment. See 8 U. S. C.

$ 1326(b)(2). Had he not been convicted of that felony, hewould have been subject to a maximum of only two years.
See 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a). The Court today holds that

$ 1326(b)(2) does not set forth a separate offense, and thatconviction of a prior felony is merely a sentencing enhancement for the offense set forth in $ 1326(a). This causes theCourt to confront the difficult question whether the Constitution requires a fact which substantially increases the maxi-mum permissible punishment for a crime to be treated as an
element of that crime--to be charged in the indictment, andfound beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. Until the Court
said so, it was far from obvious that the answer to this question was no; on the basis of our prior law, in fact, the answerwas considerably doubtful.

In all our prior cases bearing upon the issue, however, weconfronted a criminal statute or state-court criminal ruling

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
that unambiguously relieved the prosecution of the burden
of proving a critical fact to the jury beyond a reasonable
doubt. In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986),
the statute provided that " `visibl[e] possess[ion] [of] a firearm' " " `shall not be an element of the crime,' " but shall
be determined at sentencing by " `[t]he court . . . by a preponderance of the evidence,' " id., at 81, n. 1 (quoting 42
Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9712 (1982)). In In re Winship, 397 U. S.
358 (1970), it provided that determinations of criminal action in juvenile cases " `must be based on a preponderance
of the evidence,' " id., at 360 (quoting N. Y. Family Court Act

$ 744(b)). In Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977),
the statute provided that extreme emotional disturbance " `is
an affirmative defense,' " id., at 198, n. 2 (quoting N. Y. Penal
Law $ 125.25 (McKinney 1975)). And in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), Maine's highest court had held that
in murder cases malice aforethought was presumed and had
to be negated by the defendant, id., at 689 (citing State v.
Lafferty, 309 A. 2d 647 (1973)).

In contrast to the provisions involved in these cases, 8
U. S. C. $ 1326 does not, on its face, place the constitutional
issue before us: It does not say that subsection (b)(2) is
merely a sentencing enhancement. The text of the statute
supports, if it does not indeed demand, the conclusion that
subsection (b)(2) is a separate offense that includes the violation described in subsection (a) but adds the additional element of prior felony conviction. I therefore do not reach
the difficult constitutional issue in this case because I adopt,
as I think our cases require, that reasonable interpretation
of $ 1326 which avoids the problem. Illegal reentry simpliciter ($ 1326(a)) and illegal reentry after conviction of an aggravated felony ($ 1326(b)(2)) are separate criminal offenses.
Prior conviction of an aggravated felony being an element of
the latter offense, it must be charged in the indictment.
Since it was not, petitioner's sentence must be set aside.

"[W]here a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by
one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions
arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided,
our duty is to adopt the latter." United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408
(1909). This "cardinal principle," which "has for so long
been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate," Edward
J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr.
Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), requires merely
a determination of serious constitutional doubt, and not a
determination of unconstitutionality. That must be so, of
course, for otherwise the rule would "mea[n] that our duty
is to first decide that a statute is unconstitutional and then
proceed to hold that such ruling was unnecessary because
the statute is susceptible of a meaning, which causes it not
to be repugnant to the Constitution." United States ex rel.
Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., supra, at 408.
The Court contends that neither of the two conditions for
application of this rule is present here: that the constitutional question is not doubtful, and that the statute is not
susceptible of a construction that will avoid it. I shall address the former point first.1

1 The Court asserts that we have declined to apply the doctrine "in circumstances similar to those here--where a constitutional question, while
lacking an obvious answer, does not lead a majority gravely to doubt that
the statute is constitutional." Ante, at 239. The cases it cites, however,
do not support this contention. In Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991),
the Court believed that "[t]here [was] no question but that the statutory
prohibition . . . [was] constitutional," id., at 192 (emphasis added). And in
United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84 (1985), the Court found the doctrine
inapplicable not because of lack of constitutional doubt, but because the
statutory language did not permit an interpretation that would "avoid a
constitutional question," id., at 96. Similarly, in United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600 (1989), "the language of [the statute was] plain and
unambiguous," id., at 606.

Scalia, J., dissenting
That it is genuinely doubtful whether the Constitution per-mits a judge (rather than a jury) to determine by a mere

preponderance of the evidence (rather than beyond a reason-able doubt) a fact that increases the maximum penalty to
which a criminal defendant is subject is clear enough from
our prior cases resolving questions on the margins of thisone. In

In re Winship, supra, we invalidated a New York
statute under which the burden of proof in a juvenile delin-quency proceeding was reduced to proof by a preponderance

of the evidence. We held that "the Due Process Clause pro-tects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute
the crime with which he is charged," 397 U. S., at 364, and
that the same protection extends to "a juvenile . . . charged
with an act which would constitute a crime if committed by
an adult," id., at 359.

Five years later, in Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra, we unanimously extended Winship's protections to determinations
that went not to a defendant's guilt or innocence, but simply
to the length of his sentence. We invalidated Maine's homicide law, under which all intentional murders were presumed
to be committed with malice aforethought (and, as such, were
punishable by life imprisonment), unless the defendant could
rebut this presumption with proof that he acted in the heat
of passion (in which case the conviction would be reduced
to manslaughter and the maximum sentence to 20 years).
We acknowledged that "under Maine law these facts of intent [were] not general elements of the crime of felonious
homicide[, but] [i]nstead, [bore] only on the appropriate punishment category." 421 U. S., at 699. Nonetheless, we rejected this distinction between guilt and punishment. "[I]f
Winship," we said, "were limited to those facts that constitute a crime as defined by state law, a State could undermine
many of the interests that decision sought to protect without
effecting any substantive change in its law. It would only
be necessary to redefine the elements that constitute differ523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ent crimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solelyon the extent of punishment."

Id., at 697-698.
In Patterson v. New York, we cut back on some of thebroader implications of

Mullaney. Although that case contained, we acknowledged, "some language . . . that ha[d] been
understood as perhaps construing the Due Process Clauseto require the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable

doubt any fact affecting `the degree of criminal culpability,' "we denied that we "intend[ed] . . . such far-reaching effect."
432 U. S., at 214-215, n. 15. Accordingly, we upheld in
Patterson New York's law casting upon the defendant the
burden of proving as an "affirmative defense" to seconddegree murder that he " `acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse,' " id., at 198-199, n. 2, which
defense would reduce his crime to manslaughter. We explained that "[p]roof of the nonexistence of all affirmative
defenses has never been constitutionally required," id., at
210, and that the State need not "prove beyond a reasonable
doubt every fact, the existence or nonexistence of which it is
willing to recognize as an exculpatory or mitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of
the punishment." Id., at 207. We cautioned, however, that
while our decision might "seem to permit state legislatures
to reallocate burdens of proof by labeling as affirmative defenses at least some elements of the crimes now defined in
their statutes[,] . . . there are obviously constitutional limits
beyond which the States may not go in this regard." Id.,
at 210.

Finally, and most recently, in McMillan v. Pennsylvania,
477 U. S., at 81, we upheld Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, which prescribed a mandatory minimum sentence of five years upon a judge's finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant "visibly
possessed a firearm" during the commission of certain enumerated offenses which all carried maximum sentences of

523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
more than five years. We observed that "we [had] neverattempted to define precisely the constitutional limits noted

in Patterson, i. e., the extent to which due process forbidsthe reallocation or reduction of burdens of proof in criminal
cases," but explained that, whatever those limits, Pennsylvania's law did not transgress them, id., at 86, primarily because it "neither alter[ed] the maximum penalty for the
crime committed nor create[d] a separate offense calling fora separate penalty; it operate[d] solely to limit the sentencing

court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range al-ready available to it without the special finding of visible
possession of a firearm," id., at 87-88.The feebleness of the Court's contention that here there is
no serious constitutional doubt is evidenced by the degree to
which it must ignore or distort the analysis of McMillan.As just described, that opinion emphasized--and emphasized

repeatedly--that an increase of the maximum penalty wasnot at issue. Beyond that, it specifically acknowledged that
the outcome might have been different (i. e., the statutemight have been unconstitutional) if the maximum sentence
had been affected:

"Petitioners' claim that visible possession under the
Pennsylvania statute is `really' an element of the of-fenses for which they are being punished--that Pennsylvania has in effect defined a new set of upgraded felon-ies--would have at least more superficial appeal if a
finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or
additional punishment, cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(d) (providingseparate and greater punishment for bank robberies

accomplished through `use of a dangerous weapon or
device'), but it does not." Id., at 88.

The opinion distinguished one of our own precedents on this
very ground, noting that the Colorado Sex Offenders Act invalidated in Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605 (1967), increased a sex offender's sentence from a 10-year maximum

254 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
to an indefinite term up to and including life imprisonment.477 U. S., at 88.

Despite all of that, the Court would have us believe thatthe present statute's alteration of the maximum permissible
sentence--which it acknowledges is "the major difference
between this case and McMillan," ante, at 244--militates in
favor of, rather than against, this statute's constitutionality,
because an increase of the minimum sentence (rather thanthe permissible maximum) is more disadvantageous to the

defendant. Ibid. That is certainly an arguable position (itwas argued, as the Court has the temerity to note, by the
dissent in McMillan). But it is a position which McMillan
not only rejected, but upon the converse of which McMillan
rested its judgment.

In addition to inverting the consequence of this distinction
(between statutes that prescribe a minimum sentence and
those that increase the permissible maximum sentence) the
Court seeks to minimize the importance of the distinction by
characterizing it as merely one of five factors relied on in
McMillan, and asserting that the other four factors here are
the same. Ante, at 242-243. In fact, however, McMillan
did not set forth any five-factor test; the Court selectively
recruits "factors" from various parts of the discussion. Its
first factor, for example, that " `the statute plainly does not
transgress the limits expressly set out in Patterson,' " ante,
at 242, quoting McMillan, 477 U. S, at 86--viz., that it does
not "discar[d] the presumption of innocence" or "relieve the
prosecution of its burden of proving guilt," id., at 87--merely
narrows the issue to the one before the Court, rather than
giving any clue to the resolution of that issue. It is no more
a factor in solving the constitutional problem before us than
is the observation that $ 1326 is not an ex post facto law and
does not effect an unreasonable search or seizure. The
Court's second, fourth, and part of its fifth "factors" are in
fact all subparts of the crucial third factor (the one that is
absent here), since they are all culled from the general dis523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

255Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
cussion in McMillan of how the Pennsylvania statute simplylimited a sentencing judge's discretion. We said that,

whereas in Mullaney the State had imposed " `a differentialin sentencing ranging from a nominal fine to a mandatory
life sentence' " (the Court's "second" factor), Pennsylvania's
law "neither alter[ed] the maximum penalty for the crimecommitted [the Court's `third' factor] nor create[d] a separate

offense calling for a separate penalty [the Court's `fourth'factor]; it operate[d] solely to limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already avail-able to it without the special finding of visible possession of
a firearm [the Court's `third' factor]. . . . The statute gives
no impression of having been tailored to permit the visible
possession finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the
substantive offense [part of the Court's `fifth' factor]." 477
U. S., at 87-88.

The Court's recruitment of "factors" is, as I have said, selective. Omitted, for example, is McMillan's statement that
"petitioners do not contend that the particular factor made
relevant [by the statute] . . . has historically been treated `in
the Anglo-American legal tradition' as requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 90, quoting Patterson, 432
U. S., at 226. Petitioner does make such an assertion in the
present case--correctly, as I shall discuss. But even with
its selective harvesting, the Court is incorrect in its assertion
that "most" of the "factors" it recites, ante, at 243 (and in its
implication that all except the third of them) exist in the
present case as well. The second of them contrasted the
consequence of the fact assumed in Mullaney (extension of
the permissible sentence from as little as a nominal fine to
as much as a mandatory life sentence) with the consequence
of the fact at issue in McMillan (no extension of the permissible sentence at all, but merely a "limit[ation of] the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the
range already available," 477 U. S., at 88). The present case
resembles Mullaney rather than McMillan in this regard,

since the fact at issue increases the permissible sentence ten-fold. And the only significant part of the fifth "factor"--

that the statute in McMillan " `dictated the precise weightto be given [the statutory] factor,' "

ante, at 243, quoting McMillan, supra, at 89-90--is likewise a point of difference and
not of similarity.But this parsing of various factors is really beside the

point. No one can read our pre-McMillan cases, and espe-cially

Mullaney (whose limits were adverted to in Patterson
but never precisely described), without entertaining a seri-ous doubt as to whether the statute as interpreted by the

Court in the present case is constitutional. And no one can
read McMillan, our latest opinion on the point, without perceiving that the determinative element in our validation of
the Pennsylvania statute was the fact that it merely limited
the sentencing judge's discretion within the range of penalty
already available, rather than substantially increasing the
available sentence. And even more than that: No one can
read McMillan without learning that the Court was open to
the argument that the Constitution requires a fact which
does increase the available sentence to be treated as an element of the crime (such an argument, it said, would have "at
least . . . superficial appeal," 477 U. S., at 88). If all that
were not enough, there must be added the fact that many
State Supreme Courts have concluded that a prior conviction
which increases maximum punishment must be treated as an
element of the offense under either their State Constitutions,
see, e. g., State v. McClay, 146 Me. 104, 112, 78 A. 2d 347,
352 (1951); Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 68 Mass. 505, 506 (1854)

forth in indictment); State v. Furth, 5 Wash. 2d 1, 11-19, 104

In the end, the Court cannot credibly argue that thequestion whether a fact which increases maximum permissible punishment must be found by a jury beyond a reason-able doubt is an easy one. That, perhaps, is why the Court
stresses, and stresses repeatedly, the limited subject matterthat $ 1326(b) addresses--recidivism. It even tries, with
utter lack of logic, to limit its rejection of the fair readingof

McMillan to recidivism cases. "For the reasons justgiven," it says, "and in light of the particular sentencing

factor at issue in this case--recidivism--we should take

2 It would not be, as the Court claims, "anomalous" to require jury trial
for a factor increasing the maximum sentence, "in light of existing case
law that permits a judge, rather than a jury, to determine the existence
of factors that can make a defendant eligible for the death penalty . . . ."
Ante, at 247, citing Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990); Hildwin v.
Florida, 490 U. S. 638 (1989) (per curiam); and Spaziano v. Florida,
468 U. S. 447 (1984). Neither the cases cited, nor any other case, permits
a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a
capital offense. What the cited cases hold is that, once a jury has found
the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as
its maximum penalty the sentence of death, it may be left to the judge
to decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one,
ought to be imposed--even where that decision is constrained by a statutory requirement that certain "aggravating factors" must exist. The
person who is charged with actions that expose him to the death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury trial on all the elements of the
charge.

Scalia, J., dissenting
McMillan's statement [regarding the "superficial appeal"the defendant's argument would have had if the factor at

issue increased his maximum sentence] to mean no more thanit said, and therefore not to make a determinative difference
here." Ante, at 245 (emphasis added). It is impossible to
understand how McMillan could mean one thing in a latercase where recidivism is at issue, and something else in a

later case where some other sentencing factor is at issue.One might say, of course, that recidivism

should be an exception to the general rule set forth in McMillan--but thatmore forthright characterization would display how doubtful

the constitutional question is in light of our prior case law.

In any event, there is no rational basis for making recidivism an exception. The Court is of the view that recidivism need not be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt (a view that, as I shall discuss, is precisely contrary to
the common-law tradition) because it " `goes to the punishment only.' " It relies for this conclusion upon our opinion
in Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S. 616 (1912). See ante,
at 243, quoting Graham, supra, at 624; see also ante, at 247.
The holding of Graham provides no support for the Court's
position. It upheld against due process and double jeopardy
objections a state recidivism law under which a defendant's
prior convictions were charged and tried in a separate proceeding after he was convicted of the underlying offense.
As the Court notes, ante, at 243, the prior convictions were
not charged in the same indictment as the underlying offense; but they were charged in an "information" before the
defendant was tried for the prior convictions, and, more importantly, the law explicitly preserved his right to a jury
determination on the recidivism question. See Graham,
supra, at 622-623; see also Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 453
(1962) (same). It is true, however, that if the basis for Graham's holding were accepted, one would have to conclude
that recidivism need not be tried to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. The essence of Graham's reason523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ing was that in the recidivism proceeding the defendant "wasnot held to answer for an offense," 224 U. S., at 624, since

the recidivism charge " `goes to the punishment only,' " ibid.,quoting

McDonald v. Massachusetts, 180 U. S. 311, 313
(1901).

But that basis for dispensing with the protections of jurytrial and findings beyond a reasonable doubt was explicitly

rejected in Mullaney, which accorded these protections tofacts that were "not general elements of the crime of felonious homicide . . . [but bore] only on the appropriate pun-ishment category," 421 U. S., at 699. Whatever else

Mullaney stands for, it certainly stands for the proposition that
what Graham used as the line of demarcation for double
jeopardy and some due process purposes (the matter "goes
only to the punishment") is not the line of demarcation for
purposes of the right to jury trial and to proof beyond a
reasonable doubt. So also does McMillan, which even while
narrowing Mullaney made it very clear that the mere fact
that a certain finding "goes only to the penalty" does not
end the inquiry. The Court is certainly correct that the distinctive treatment of recidivism determinations for double
jeopardy purposes takes some explaining; but it takes some
explaining for the Court no less than for me. And the explanation assuredly is not (what the Court apparently suggests)
that recidivism is never an element of the crime. It does
much less violence to our jurisprudence, and to the traditional practice of requiring a jury finding of recidivism beyond a reasonable doubt, to explain Graham as a recidivism
exception to the normal double jeopardy rule that conviction
of a lesser included offense bars later trial for the greater
crime. Our double jeopardy law, after all, is based upon traditional American and English practice, see United States v.
Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993); United States v. Wilson,

420 U. S. 332, 339-344 (1975), and that practice has allowed
recidivism to be charged and tried separately, see Spencer v.
Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 566-567 (1967); Graham, supra, at 623,

625-626, 631; McDonald, supra, at 312-313. It has not al-lowed recidivism to be determined by a judge as more likely

than not.While I have given many arguments supporting the position that the Constitution requires the recidivism finding inthis case to be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,
I do not endorse that position as necessarily correct. In-deed, that would defeat my whole purpose, which is to honor
the practice of not deciding doubtful constitutional ques-tions unnecessarily. What I have tried to establish--and all
that I need to establish--is that on the basis of our juris-prudence to date, the answer to the constitutional question
is not clear. It is the Court's burden, on the other hand, toestablish that its constitutional answer shines forth clearly
from our cases. That burden simply cannot be sustained.I think it beyond question that there was, until today's unnecessary resolution of the point, "serious doubt" whetherthe Constitution permits a defendant's sentencing exposure
to be increased tenfold on the basis of a fact that is notcharged, tried to a jury, and found beyond a reasonable
doubt. If the Court wishes to abandon the doctrine ofconstitutional doubt, it should do so forthrightly, rather
than by declaring certainty on a point that is clouded indoubt.

II
The Court contends that the doctrine of constitutionaldoubt is also inapplicable because $ 1326 is not fairly susceptible of the construction which avoids the constitutionalproblem--i. e., the construction whereby subsection (b)(2)
sets forth a separate criminal offense. Ante, at 238. TheCourt begins its statutory analysis not by examining the text
of $ 1326, but by demonstrating that the "subject matter [ofthe statute]--prior commission of a serious crime--is as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine." Ante, at 230.That is eminently demonstrable, sounds powerfully good, but
in fact proves nothing at all. It is certainly true that a

Scalia, J., dissenting
judge (whether or not bound by the Federal SentencingGuidelines) is likely to sentence nearer the maximum permitted for the offense if the defendant is a repeat offender. Butthe same can be said of many, perhaps most, factors that are
used to define aggravated offenses. For example, judges
will "typically" sentence nearer the maximum that a statuteallows if the crime of conviction is committed with a firearm,

or in the course of another felony; but that in no way sug-gests that armed robbery and felony murder are sentencing
enhancements rather than separate crimes.The

relevant question for present purposes is not whether
prior felony conviction is "typically" used as a sentencing
factor, but rather whether, in statutes that provide higher
maximum sentences for crimes committed by convicted felons, prior conviction is "typically" treated as a mere sentence enhancement or rather as an element of a separate
offense. The answer to that question is the latter. That
was the rule at common law, and was the near-uniform practice among the States at the time of the most recent study I
am aware of. See Note, Recidivist Procedures, 40 N. Y. U.
L. Rev. 332, 333-334 (1965); Note, The Pleading and Proof
of Prior Convictions in Habitual Criminal Prosecutions, 33
N. Y. U. L. Rev. 210, 215-216 (1958). At common law, the
fact of prior convictions had to be charged in the same indictment charging the underlying crime, and submitted to the
jury for determination along with that crime. See, e. g.,
Spencer v. Texas, supra, at 566; Massey v. United States, 281
F. 293, 297 (CA8 1922); Singer v. United States, 278 F. 415,
420 (CA3 1922); People v. Sickles, 156 N. Y. 541, 545, 51 N. E.
288, 289 (1898). While several States later altered this procedure by providing a separate proceeding for the determination of prior convictions, at least as late as 1965 all but
eight retained the defendant's right to a jury determination
on this issue. See Note, 40 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 333-334, 347.
I am at a loss to explain the Court's assertion that it has
"found no statute that clearly makes recidivism an offense

It is interesting that the Court drags the red herring ofrecidivism through both parts of its opinion--the "constitutional doubt" part and the "statutory interpretation" partalike. As just discussed, logic demonstrates that the nature
of that charge (the fact that it is a "typical" sentencing fac-tor) has nothing to do with what this statute means. And
as discussed earlier, the text and reasoning of McMillan,and of the cases

McMillan distinguishes, provide no basisfor saying that recidivism is exempt from the Court's clear

acknowledgment that taking away from the jury facts thatincrease the maximum sentence is constitutionally questionable. One wonders what state courts, and lower federalcourts, are supposed to do with today's mysterious utterances. Are they to pursue logic, and conclude that all am-biguous statutes adding punishment for factors accompanying the principal offense are mere enhancements, or are theyillogically to give this special treatment only to recidivism?
Are they to deem the reasoning of McMillan superseded forall cases, or does it remain an open and doubtful question,
for all cases except those involving recidivism, whether stat-utory maximums can be increased without the benefit of
jury trial? Whatever else one may say about today's opin-ion, there is no doubt that it has brought to this area of the
law more confusion than clarification.Passing over the red herring, let me turn now to the statute at issue--$ 1326 as it stood when petitioner was con3 For federal statutes of this sort, see, e. g., 15 U. S. C. $ 1264(a), 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c), and $ 2114(a). In each of these provisions, recidivism is
recited in a list of sentence-increasing aggravators that include, for example, intent to defraud or mislead (15 U. S. C. $ 1264(a)), use of a firearm
that is a machine gun, or a destructive device, or that is equipped with
a silencer (18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)), and wounding or threatening life with a
dangerous weapon ($ 2114(a)). It would do violence to the text to treat
recidivism as a mere enhancement while treating the parallel provisions
as aggravated offenses, which they obviously are.

victed. The author of today's opinion for the Court onceagreed that the "language and structure" of this enactment

"are subject to two plausible readings," one of them beingthat recidivism constitutes a separate offense.

United
States v. Forbes, 16 F. 3d 1294, 1298 (CA1 1994) (opinion of
Coffin, J., joined by Breyer, C. J.).4 This would surely beenough to satisfy the requirement expressed by Justice

Holmes, see United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394,401 (1916), and approved by the Court,

ante, at 237-238, that
the constitutional-doubt-avoiding construction be "fairly pos-sible." Today, however, the Court relegates statutory language and structure to merely two of five "factors" that
"help courts determine a statute's objectives and thereby

illuminate its text," ante, at 228.

The statutory text reads, in relevant part, as follows:

"Reentry of deported alien; criminal penalties for reentry of certain deported aliens

"(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien
who [has been deported and thereafter reenters the
United States] . . . shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.

"(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in
the case of any alien described in such subsection--

"(1) whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a
felony (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall
be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 10
years, or both; or

"(2) whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien

4 The statutory text at issue in Forbes was in all relevant respects identical to the statute before us here, except that the years of imprisonment
for the offenses were less; they were increased by a 1994 amendment, see

$ 130001(b), 108 Stat. 2023.

Scalia, J., dissenting
shall be fined under such title, imprisoned not more than20 years, or both." 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(b).

One is struck at once by the parallel structure of subsections(a) and (b). Neither subsection says that the individual it
describes "shall be guilty of a felony," and both subsectionssay that the individuals they describe "shall be fined under
title 18, or imprisoned not more than [2, 10, or 20] years."If this suffices to define a substantive offense in subsection
(a) (as all agree it does), it is hard to see why it would notdefine a substantive offense in each paragraph of subsection
(b) as well. Cf., for example, 21 U. S. C. $ 841, which has asubsection (a) entitled "Unlawful acts," and a subsection (b)
entitled "Penalties."The opening phrase of subsection (b) certainly does not
indicate that what follows merely supplements or enhancesthe penalty provision of subsection (a); what follows is to
apply "notwithstanding" all of subsection (a), i. e., "in spiteof " or "without prevention or obstruction from or by" subsection (a). See, e. g., Webster's New International Dic-tionary 1669 (2d ed. 1949). The next phrase ("in the case
of any alien described in . . . subsection [(a)]") imports byreference the substantive acts attributed to the hypothetical alien (deportation and unauthorized reentry) in sub-section (a). Significantly, this phrase does not apply subsection (b) to any alien "convicted under" subsection (a)--whichis what one would expect if the provision was merely increasing the penalty for certain subsection (a) convictions.See,

e. g., United States v. Davis, 801 F. 2d 754, 755-756 (CA51986) (noting that "predicat[ing] punishment upon conviction" of another offense is one of the "common indicia ofsentence-enhancement provisions"). Instead, subsection (b)
applies to an alien "described in" subsection (a)--one whohas been deported and has reentered illegally. And finally,
subsection (a)'s provision that it applies "[s]ubject to subsec-tion (b)" means that subsection (a) is inapplicable to an alien
covered by subsection (b), just as subsection (b) applies "not523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

withstanding" that the alien would otherwise be covered bysubsection (a).

5

The Court relies on an earlier version of $ 1326 to supportits interpretation of the statute in its current form. Ante,

at 232. While I agree that such statutory history is a legit-imate tool of construction, the statutory history of $ 1326
does not support, but rather undermines, the Court's inter-pretation. That earlier version contained a subsection (a)
that, in addition to setting forth penalties (as did the sub-parts of subsection (b)), contained the phrase (which the
subparts of subsection (b) did not) "shall be guilty of a felony,and upon conviction thereof . . . ." With such a formulation,
of course, it would be easier to conclude that subsection (a)defines the crime and sets forth the basic penalty, and subsection (b) sets forth merely penalty enhancements. But ifthat was what the additional language in subsection (a) of
the 1988 statute connoted, then what was the eliminationof that additional language (in the 1990 version of the statute at issue here) meant to achieve? See $ 543(b)(3), 104Stat. 5059. The more strongly the "shall be guilty of a
felony" language suggests that subsection (b) of the 1988statute contained only enhancements, the more strongly the
otherwise inexplicable elimination of that language sug5 The Court contends that treating subsection (b) as establishing substantive offenses renders the "notwithstanding" and "subject to" provisions redundant, because even without them our lesser included-offense
jurisprudence would prevent a defendant from being convicted under
both subsections (a) and (b). Ante, at 231. Redundancy, however, consists of the annoying practice of saying the same thing twice, not the
sensible practice of saying once, with clarity and conciseness, what the
law provides. The author of today's opinion once agreed that "[t]he fact
that each subsection makes reference to the other is simply the logical way
of indicating the relationship between the arguably two separate crimes."
United States v. Forbes, 16 F. 3d 1294, 1298 (CA1 1994). But if this be
redundancy, it is redundancy that the Court's alternative reading does not
cure--unless one believes that, without the "notwithstanding" and "subject to" language, our interpretive jurisprudence would permit the subsection (a) penalty to be added to the subsection (b) penalties.

gests that subsection (b) of the 1990 statute was meant tobe parallel with subsection (a)--i. e., that both subsections were meant to set forth not merely penalties but alsooffenses.

6

After considering the subject matter and statutory lan-guage, the third factor the Court considers in arriving at its

determination that this statute can only be read as a sentenc-ing enhancement is the title of the 1988 amendment that
added subsection (b)(2): "Criminal Penalties for Reentry ofCertain Deported Aliens." See $ 7345, 102 Stat. 4471, cited
ante, at 234. Of course, this title pertains to a subsection(b)(2) which, unlike the (b)(2) under which petitioner was
convicted, was not parallel with the preceding subsection (a).But even disregarding that, the title of the amendment
proves nothing at all. While "Criminal Penalties for Re-entry" might normally be more suggestive of an enhancement than of a separate offense, there is good reason to be-lieve it imports no such suggestion here. For the very next
provision of the same enactment, which adjusts the substantive requirements for the crime of aiding and abetting
the unlawful entry of an alien, is entitled "Criminal Penalties
for Aiding or Assisting Certain Aliens to Enter the UnitedStates." See $ 7346, 102 Stat. 4471. Evidently, new substantive offenses that were penalized were simply entitled"Criminal Penalties" for the relevant offense. Moreover,

6 Immediately after stressing the significance of the 1988 version of

$ 1326(a), the Court dismisses the 1990 amendment that eliminated the
1988 language upon which it relies, as a "housekeeping measure" by which
"Congress [did not] inten[d] to change, or to clarify, the fundamental relationship between" subsections (a) and (b). Ante, at 234. The Court offers no support for this confident characterization, unless it is the mistaken
assumption that statutory changes or clarifications unconfirmed by legislative history are inoperative. "Suffice it to say that legislative history
need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory
language before we will interpret that language according to its natural
meaning." Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 385,
n. 2 (1992).

Scalia, J., dissenting
the 1988 amendment kept the original title of $ 1326 ("Re-entry of Deported Alien") intact, leaving it to apply to both

subsection (a) and subsection (b). See $ 7345, supra; $ 276,66 Stat. 229.

The Court's fourth factor leading it to conclude that this
statute cannot reasonably be construed as establishing sub-stantive offenses is legislative history. See

ante, at 234. It
is, again, the legislative history of the provision as it existedin 1988, before subsection (a) was stripped of the language

"shall be guilty of a felony," thereby making subsections (a)and (b) parallel. Even so, it is of no help to the Court's case.
The stray statements that the Court culls from the Congressional Record prove only that the new subsection (b) was
thought to increase penalties for unlawful reentry. But
there is no dispute that it does that! The critical question
is whether it does it by adding penalties to the subsection (a)
offense, or by creating additional, more severely punished,
offenses. That technical point is not alluded to in any of the
remarks the Court recites.

The Court's fifth and last argument in support of its interpretation of the statute is the contention that "the contrary
interpretation . . . risks unfairness," ibid., because it would
require bringing the existence of the prior felony conviction
to the attention of the jury. But it is also "unfair," of course,
to deprive the defendant of a jury determination (and a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden of proof) on the critical
question of the prior conviction. This Court's own assessment of which of those disadvantages is the greater can be
of relevance here only insofar as we can presume that that
perception would have been shared by the enacting Congress. We usually presume, however, not that an earlier
Congress agreed with our current policy judgments, but
rather that it agreed with the disposition provided by traditional practice or the common law. See United States v.

United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952). As noted earlier,the Court's hostility to jury determination of prior convictions is quite simply at odds with the manner in which recidivism laws have historically been treated in this country.Moreover, even if we were free to resolve this matter

according to our current views of what is fair, the Court'sjudgment that avoiding jury "infection" is more important
than affording a jury verdict (beyond a reasonable doubt)does not seem to me sound. The Court is not correct, to
begin with, that the fact of prior conviction is "almost never
contested," ante, at 235, particularly in unlawful-entry cases.
That is clear from the very legislative history of the present
statute. Senator Chiles explained that "identifying and
prosecuting . . . illegal alien felons is a long and complex
process" because "[i]t is not uncommon for an alien who has
committed a certain felony to pay his bond and walk, only to
be apprehended for a similar crime in the next county but
with a new name and identification." 133 Cong. Rec. 8771
(1987). He went on to describe two specific aliens, one from
whom police "seized 3 passports issued to him in 3 different
names, 11 drivers licenses, immigration cards and numerous
firearms and stolen property," and the other on whom immigration officials had "5 alien files . . . with 13 aliases, different
birth dates and different social security cards." Id., at 8771,
8772. He said that "these aliens [were] not exceptions but
rather common amongst the 100,000 illegal alien felons in the
United States." Id., at 8772. Representative Smith stated
that aliens arrested for felonies "often are able to pay expensive bonds and disappear under a new identity often to reappear in court with a different name and a new offense. In
some cases, they may return to their native lands and reenter the United States with new names and papers but committing the same crimes." Id., at 28840. And on the other
side of the ledger, I doubt whether "infection" of the jury

with knowledge of the prior crime is a serious problem.See,

e. g., Spencer, 385 U. S., at 561 ("The defendants' interests [in keeping prejudicial prior convictions from the jury]are protected by limiting instructions and by the discretion

residing with the trial judge to limit or forbid the admission
of particularly prejudicial evidence even though admissibleunder an accepted rule of evidence" (citation omitted));

Old
Chief v. United States, 519 U. S. 172, 191 (1997) (it is an abuseof discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to disallow

defendant's stipulation to prior felony convictions where suchconvictions are an element of the offense); cf. Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus
Curiae 30 ("In 1996, 98.2% of all Section 1326 defendants
pleaded guilty"). If it is a problem, however, there are legislative and even judicial means for dealing with it, short of
what today's decision does: taking the matter away from the
jury in all cases. See Note, 40 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 333-334
(describing commonly used procedures under which defendant's right to a jury is invoked only "[i]f [he] denies the existence of prior convictions or stands mute"); Spencer, supra, at
567 (describing the English rule, under which the indictment
alleges both the substantive offense and prior conviction, but
the jury is not charged on the prior conviction until after it
convicts the defendant of the substantive offense).

In sum, I find none of the four nontextual factors relied
upon by the Court to support its interpretation ("typicality"
of recidivism as a sentencing factor; titles; legislative history; and risk of unfairness) persuasive. What does seem
to me significant, however, is a related statutory provision,
introduced by a 1996 amendment, which explicitly refers to
subsection (b)(2) as setting forth "offenses." See $ 334,
110 Stat. 3009-635 (instructing United States Sentencing
Commission to amend sentencing guidelines "for offenses
under . . . 1326(b)"). This later amendment can of course
not cause subsection (b)(2) to have meant, at the time of petitioner's conviction, something different from what it then

Scalia, J., dissenting
said. But Congress's expressed understanding that subsec-tion (b) creates separate offenses is surely evidence that it is

"fairly possible" to read the provision that way.7I emphasize (to conclude this part of the discussion) that
"fairly possible" is all that needs to be established. The doc-trine of constitutional doubt does not require that the
problem-avoiding construction be the preferable one--theone the Court would adopt in any event. Such a standard
would deprive the doctrine of all function. "Adopt the inter-pretation that avoids the constitutional doubt if that is the
right one" produces precisely the same result as "adopt theright interpretation." Rather, the doctrine of constitutional
doubt comes into play when the statute is "susceptible of "the problem-avoiding interpretation, Delaware & Hudson
Co., 213 U. S., at 408--when that interpretation is reason-able, though not necessarily the best. I think it quite impossible to maintain that this standard is not met by the inter-pretation of subsection (b) which regards it as creating
separate offenses. * * *

For the foregoing reasons, I think we must interpret thestatute before us here as establishing a separate offense
rather than a sentence enhancement. It can be argued that,once the constitutional doubts that require this course have
been resolved, statutes no less ambiguous than the one be-fore us here will be interpretable as sentence enhancements,

7 The Court is incorrect in its contention that the effective-date provision of the 1996 amendments reflects the opposite congressional understanding. See ante, at 237. That provision states that the amendments
"apply under [subsection (b)] . . . only to violations of [subsection (a)],"
occurring on or after the date of enactment. $ 321(c), 110 Stat. 3009-628.
There is no dispute, of course, that if subsection (b) creates separate offenses, one of the elements of the separate offenses is the lesser offense
set forth in subsection (a). The quoted language is the clearest and simplest way of saying that that element of the subsection (b) offenses must
have occurred after the date of enactment in order for the amendments to
be applicable.

so that not much will have been achieved. That begs thequestion, of course, as to how the constitutional doubt will

be resolved. Moreover, where the doctrine of constitutionaldoubt does not apply, the same result may be dictated by the
rule of lenity, which would preserve rather than destroy thecriminal defendant's right to jury findings beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., People ex rel. Cosgriff v. Craig, 195N. Y., at 197, 88 N. E., at 40 ("It is unnecessary in this case
to decide how great punishment the legislature may constitu-tionally authorize Courts of Special Sessions to impose on a
conviction without a common-law jury. It is sufficient to saythat in cases of doubtful construction or of conflicting statutory provisions, that interpretation should be given whichbest protects the rights of a person charged with an offense,
to a trial according to the common law"). Whichever doc-trine is applied for the purpose, it seems to me a sound principle that whenever Congress wishes a fact to increase themaximum sentence without altering the substantive offense,
it must make that intention unambiguously clear. Accord-ingly, I would find that $ 1326(b)(2) establishes a separate
offense, and would reverse the judgment below.

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY et al.

v. WOODARD

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 96-1769. Argued December 10, 1997--Decided March 25, 1998
After respondent Woodard's Ohio murder conviction and death sentence

were affirmed on direct appeal and this Court denied certiorari, petitioner Ohio Adult Parole Authority commenced its clemency investigation in accordance with state law, informing respondent that he could
have his voluntary interview with Authority members on a particular
date, and that his clemency hearing would be held a week later. Respondent filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that Ohio's
clemency process violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process right
and his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The District Court
granted judgment on the pleadings to the State, and the Sixth Circuit
affirmed in part and reversed in part. Noting that Connecticut Bd. of
Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 464-465, had decisively rejected
the argument that federal law can create a liberty interest in clemency,
the latter court held that respondent had failed to establish a life or
liberty interest protected by due process. The court also held, however, that respondent's "original" pretrial life and liberty interests were
protected by a "second strand" of due process analysis under Evitts v.
Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 393, although the amount of process due could be
minimal because clemency, while an "integral part" of the adjudicatory
system, is far removed from trial. The court remanded for the District
Court to decide what that process should be. Finally, the Sixth Circuit
concluded that Ohio's voluntary interview procedure presented respondent with a "Hobson's choice" between asserting his Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination and participating in Ohio's clemency
review process, thereby raising the specter of an unconstitutional
condition.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
107 F. 3d 1178, reversed.

The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Part III, concluding that giving an inmate the option of voluntarily
participating in an interview as part of the clemency process does not
violate his Fifth Amendment rights. That Amendment protects
against compelled self-incrimination. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425

U. S. 308, 316-318. Even on assumptions most favorable to respondent's claim--i. e., that nothing in the clemency procedure grants applicants immunity for what they might say or makes the interview in any
way confidential, and that the Authority will draw adverse inferences
from respondent's refusal to answer questions--his testimony at a voluntary interview would not be "compelled." He merely faces a choice
quite similar to those made by a criminal defendant in the course of
criminal proceedings. For example, a defendant who chooses to testify
in his own defense abandons the privilege against self-incrimination
when the prosecution seeks to cross-examine him, and may be impeached by proof of prior convictions. In these situations, the undoubted pressures to testify that are generated by the strength of the
government's case do not constitute "compulsion" for Fifth Amendment
purposes. See Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 84-85. Similarly, respondent here has the choice of providing information to the Authority--at the risk of damaging his case for clemency or for postconviction
relief--or of remaining silent, but the pressure to speak does not make
the interview compelled. Pp. 285-288.

The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part II that an inmate does not
establish a violation of the Due Process Clause in clemency proceedings,
under either Dumschat or Evitts, where, as here, the procedures in
question do no more than confirm that such decisions are committed, as
is the Nation's tradition, to the executive's authority. This Court reaffirms its holding in Dumschat, supra, at 464, that pardon and commutation decisions are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review.
Respondent's argument that there is a continuing life interest in clemency that is broader in scope than the "original" life interest adjudicated
at trial and sentencing is barred by Dumschat. The process respondent seeks would be inconsistent with the heart of executive clemency,
which is to grant clemency as a matter of grace, thus allowing the executive to consider a wide range of factors not comprehended by earlier judicial proceedings and sentencing determinations. Although respondent maintains a residual life interest, e. g., in not being summarily
executed by prison guards, he cannot use that interest to challenge the
clemency determination by requiring the procedural protections he
seeks. Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 7. Also rejected is respondent's claim that clemency
is entitled to due process protection under Evitts. Expressly relying
on the combination of two lines of cases to justify the conclusion that a
criminal defendant has a right to effective assistance of counsel on a
first appeal as of right, 469 U. S., at 394-396, the Evitts Court did not

purport to create a new "strand" of due process analysis, and it did not
rely on the notion of a continuum of due process rights, as respondent
claims. There is no such continuum. See, e. g., Murray v. Giarratano,
492 U. S. 1, 9-10. An examination of the function and significance of
the discretionary clemency decision at issue here readily shows that it
is far different from a first appeal as of right, and thus is not " `an integral part of the . . . system for finally adjudicating . . . guilt or innocence,' " as Evitts, supra, at 393, requires. Pp. 279-285.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded that, because a prisoner under a death
sentence has a continuing interest in his life, the question raised is what
process is constitutionally necessary to protect that interest. Although
due process demands are reduced once society has validly convicted an
individual of a crime and therefore established its right to punish, Ford
v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 429 (O'Connor, J., concurring in result in
part and dissenting in part), the Court of Appeals correctly concluded
that some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings. Judicial intervention might, for example, be warranted in the face
of a scheme whereby a state official flipped a coin to determine whether
to grant clemency, or in a case where the State arbitrarily denied a
prisoner any access to its clemency process. However, a remand to
permit the District Court to address respondent's specific allegations of
due process violations is not required. The process he received comports with Ohio's regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due
Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings. Pp. 288-290.

Rehnquist, C. J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered
the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Part III, the opinion of
the Court with respect to Part I, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy,
Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined, and an opinion

Opinion of the Court
first is whether an inmate has a protected life or liberty in-terest in clemency proceedings, under either Connecticut Bd.

of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458 (1981), or Evitts v.Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The second is whether giving
inmates the option of voluntarily participating in an inter-view as part of the clemency process violates an inmate's
Fifth Amendment rights.We reaffirm our holding in

Dumschat, supra, that "pardonand commutation decisions have not traditionally been the

business of courts; as such, they are rarely, if ever, appro-priate subjects for judicial review." Id., at 464 (footnote
omitted). The Due Process Clause is not violated where, ashere, the procedures in question do no more than confirm
that the clemency and pardon powers are committed, as isour tradition, to the authority of the executive.

1 We further

hold that a voluntary inmate interview does not violate theFifth Amendment.

I
The Ohio Constitution gives the Governor the power togrant clemency upon such conditions as he thinks proper.

Ohio Const., Art. III, $ 2. The Ohio General Assembly can-not curtail this discretionary decisionmaking power, but it
may regulate the application and investigation process.State v. Sheward, 71 Ohio St. 3d 513, 524-525, 644 N. E. 2d
369, 378 (1994). The General Assembly has delegated inlarge part the conduct of clemency review to petitioner Ohio
Adult Parole Authority (Authority). Ohio Rev. Code Ann.$ 2967.07 (1993).

In the case of an inmate under death sentence, the Author-ity must conduct a clemency hearing within 45 days of the
scheduled date of execution. Prior to the hearing, the in-mate may request an interview with one or more parole

Opinion of the Court
board members. Counsel is not allowed at that interview.
The Authority must hold the hearing, complete its clemency
review, and make a recommendation to the Governor, even
if the inmate subsequently obtains a stay of execution. If
additional information later becomes available, the Authority
may in its discretion hold another hearing or alter its
recommendation.

Respondent Eugene Woodard was sentenced to death for
aggravated murder committed in the course of a carjacking.
His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, State
v. Woodard, 68 Ohio St. 3d 70, 623 N. E. 2d 75 (1993), and
this Court denied certiorari, 512 U. S. 1246 (1994). When
respondent failed to obtain a stay of execution more than
45 days before his scheduled execution date, the Authority
commenced its clemency investigation. It informed respondent that he could have a clemency interview on September 9, 1994, if he wished, and that his clemency hearing
would be on September 16, 1994.

Respondent did not request an interview. Instead, he objected to the short notice of the interview and requested assurances that counsel could attend and participate in the interview and hearing. When the Authority failed to respond
to these requests, respondent filed suit in United States District Court on September 14, alleging under Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, that Ohio's clemency process violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and
his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

The District Court granted the State's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 107 F. 3d 1178
(1997). That court determined that under a "first strand" of
due process analysis, arising out of the clemency proceeding
itself, respondent had failed to establish a protected life or
liberty interest. It noted that our decision in Dumschat,
supra, at 464-465, "decisively rejected the argument that

278 OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD

Opinion of the Court
federal law can create a liberty interest in clemency." 107F. 3d, at 1183.

The Court of Appeals further concluded that there wasno state-created life or liberty interest in clemency.

Id., at
1184-1185. Since the Governor retains complete discretion
to make the final decision, and the Authority's recommenda-tion is purely advisory, the State has not created a protected

interest. Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238, 249 (1983).The court noted that it would reach the same conclusion
under Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995), to the extentthat decision modified the

Olim analysis.
The Court of Appeals went on to consider, however, a "second strand" of due process analysis centered on "the role of
clemency in the entire punitive scheme." 107 F. 3d, at 1186.
The court relied on our statement in Evitts that "if a State
has created appellate courts as `an integral part of the . . .
system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a
defendant,' . . . the procedures used in deciding appeals must
comport with the demands of " due process. 469 U. S., at
393 (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 18 (1956)). The
court thought this reasoning logically applied to subsequent
proceedings, including discretionary appeals, postconviction
proceedings, and clemency.

Due process thus protected respondent's "original" life and
liberty interests that he possessed before trial at each proceeding. But the amount of process due was in proportion
to the degree to which the stage was an "integral part" of
the trial process. Clemency, while not required by the Due
Process Clause, was a significant, traditionally available remedy for preventing miscarriages of justice when judicial process was exhausted. It therefore came within the Evitts
framework as an "integral part" of the adjudicatory system.
However, since clemency was far removed from trial, the
process due could be minimal. The Court did not itself
decide what that process should be, but remanded to the
District Court for that purpose.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Finally, the Court of Appeals also agreed with respondentthat the voluntary interview procedure presented him with

a "Hobson's choice" between asserting his Fifth Amendmentrights and participating in the clemency review process, raising the specter of an unconstitutional condition. 107 F. 3d,at 1189. There was no compelling state interest that would
justify forcing such a choice on the inmate. On the otherhand, the inmate had a measurable interest in avoiding incrimination in ongoing postconviction proceedings, as well aswith respect to possible charges for other crimes that could
be revealed during the interview. While noting some uncer-tainties surrounding application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the Court of Appeals concluded the doctrinecould be applied in this case.

The dissenting judge would have affirmed the DistrictCourt's judgment. Id., at 1194. He agreed with the majority's determination that there was no protected interestunder Dumschat. But he thought that the majority's finding of a due process interest under Evitts, supra, was neces-sarily inconsistent with the holding and rationale of

Dum-schat. Evitts did not purport to overrule Dumschat. He

also concluded that respondent's Fifth Amendment claimwas too speculative, given the voluntary nature of the clemency interview. We granted certiorari, 521 U. S. 1117 (1997),and we now reverse.

II
Respondent argues first, in disagreement with the Courtof Appeals, that there is a life interest in clemency broader

in scope than the "original" life interest adjudicated at trialand sentencing. Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986).
This continuing life interest, it is argued, requires due proc-ess protection until respondent is executed.

only to the application process conducted by the Authority, and not to
the final discretionary decision by the Governor. Brief for Respondent 8.

Eighth Amendment decisions holding that additional proce-dural protections are required in capital cases, see, e. g., Beck

v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 637-638 (1980), respondent assertsthat Dumschat does not control the outcome in this case because it involved only a liberty interest. Justice Stevens'dissent agrees on both counts.

Post, at 291-292.In Dumschat, an inmate claimed Connecticut's clemency

procedure violated due process because the ConnecticutBoard of Pardons failed to provide an explanation for its denial of his commutation application. The Court held that"an inmate has `no constitutional or inherent right' to commutation of his sentence." 452 U. S., at 464. It noted that,unlike probation decisions, "pardon and commutation decisions have not traditionally been the business of courts; assuch, they are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial
review." Ibid. The Court relied on its prior decision in
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Com-plex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), where it rejected the claim "that a

constitutional entitlement to release [on parole] exists in-dependently of a right explicitly conferred by the State."
Dumschat, 452 U. S., at 463-464. The individual's interestin release or commutation " `is indistinguishable from the
initial resistance to being confined,' " and that interest hasalready been extinguished by the conviction and sentence.
Id., at 464 (quoting Greenholtz, supra, at 7). The Courttherefore concluded that a petition for commutation, like an
appeal for clemency, "is simply a unilateral hope." 452 U. S.,at 465.

Respondent's claim of a broader due process interest inOhio's clemency proceedings is barred by Dumschat. The
process respondent seeks would be inconsistent with theheart of executive clemency, which is to grant clemency as a

application process. Otherwise, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted,
he is asserting merely a protected interest in process itself, which is not
a cognizable claim. 107 F. 3d 1178, 1184 (CA6 1997); see also Olim v.
Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238, 249-250 (1983).

matter of grace, thus allowing the executive to consider awide range of factors not comprehended by earlier judicial

proceedings and sentencing determinations. The dissentagrees with respondent that because "a living person" has a
constitutionally protected life interest, it is incorrect to as-sert that respondent's life interest has been "extinguished."

e. g., in not being summarily executed by prisonguards. However, as Greenholtz helps to make clear, respondent cannot use his interest in not being executed inaccord with his sentence to challenge the clemency determination by requiring the procedural protections he seeks.442 U. S., at 7.

The reasoning of Dumschat did not depend on the factthat it was not a capital case. The distinctions accorded a

life interest to which respondent and the dissent point, post,at 291-292, 293-295, are primarily relevant to trial. And
this Court has generally rejected attempts to expand anydistinctions further. See,

e. g., Murray v. Giarratano, 492U. S. 1, 8-9 (1989) (opinion of

Rehnquist, C. J.) (there is noconstitutional right to counsel in collateral proceedings for

death row inmates; cases recognizing special constraints oncapital proceedings have dealt with the trial stage);

Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249, 256 (1988) (applying traditionalstandard of appellate review to a Sixth Amendment claim in

a capital case); Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 538 (1986)(applying same standard of review on federal habeas in capi3 For the same reason, respondent's reliance on Ford v. Wainwright, 477
U. S. 399, 425 (1986), is misplaced. In Ford, the Court held that the
Eighth Amendment prevents the execution of a person who has become
insane since the time of trial. Id., at 410. This substantive constitutional
prohibition implicated due process protections. This protected interest,
however, arose subsequent to trial, and was separate from the life interest
already adjudicated in the inmate's conviction and sentence. See id., at
425 (Powell, J., concurring). This interest therefore had not been afforded
due process protection. The Court's recognition of a protected interest
thus did not rely on the notion of a continuing "original" life interest.

tal and noncapital cases); Ford, supra, at 425 (Powell, J., con-curring) (noting that the Court's decisions imposing heightened requirements on capital trials and sentencing proceed-ings do not apply in the postconviction context).

4 The

Court's analysis in Dumschat, moreover, turned not on thefact that it was a noncapital case, but on the nature of the

benefit sought: "In terms of the Due Process Clause, a Connecticut felon's expectation that a lawfully imposed sentencewill be commuted or that he will be pardoned is no more

substantial than an inmate's expectation, for example, thathe will not be transferred to another prison; it is simply a
unilateral hope." 452 U. S., at 464 (footnote omitted). Adeath row inmate's petition for clemency is also a "unilateral
hope." The defendant in effect accepts the finality of thedeath sentence for purposes of

adjudication, and appeals for
clemency as a matter of grace.

Respondent also asserts that, as in Greenholtz, Ohio hascreated protected interests by establishing mandatory clemency application and review procedures. In Greenholtz,
supra, at 11-12, the Court held that the expectancy of
release on parole created by the mandatory language ofthe Nebraska statute was entitled to some measure of constitutional protection.

Ohio's clemency procedures do not violate due process.Despite the Authority's mandatory procedures, the ultimate

decisionmaker, the Governor, retains broad discretion.Under any analysis, the Governor's executive discretion need
not be fettered by the types of procedural protections soughtby respondent. See

Greenholtz, supra, at 12-16 (recognizing the Nebraska parole statute created a protected liberty

4 The dissent provides no basis for its assertion that the special considerations afforded a capital defendant's life interest at the trial stage "apply
with special force to the final stage of the decisional process that precedes
an official deprivation of life." Post, at 295. This not only ignores our
case law to the contrary, supra, at 281 and this page, but also assumes
that executive clemency hearings are part and parcel of the judicial process preceding an execution.

interest, yet rejecting a claim that due process necessitated
a formal parole hearing and a statement of evidence relied
upon by the parole board). There is thus no substantive expectation of clemency. Moreover, under Conner, 515 U. S.,
at 484, the availability of clemency, or the manner in which
the State conducts clemency proceedings, does not impose
"atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation
to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Ibid.; see 107 F.
3d, at 1185-1186. A denial of clemency merely means that
the inmate must serve the sentence originally imposed.

Respondent also relies on the "second strand" of due process analysis adopted by the Court of Appeals. He claims
that under the rationale of Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387
(1985), clemency is an integral part of Ohio's system of adjudicating the guilt or innocence of the defendant and is therefore entitled to due process protection. Clemency, he says,
is an integral part of the judicial system because it has historically been available as a significant remedy, its availability impacts earlier stages of the criminal justice system, and
it enhances the reliability of convictions and sentences. Respondent further suggests, as did the Sixth Circuit, that
Evitts established a due process continuum across all phases
of the judicial process.

In Evitts, the Court held that there is a constitutional
right to effective assistance of counsel on a first appeal as
of right. Id., at 396. This holding, however, was expressly
based on the combination of two lines of prior decisions.
One line of cases held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant pursuing a first appeal as of
right certain minimum safeguards necessary to make that
appeal adequate and effective, including the right to counsel.
See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S., at 20; Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963). The second line of cases held that
the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at trial comprehended
the right to effective assistance of counsel. See Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963); Cuyler v. Sullivan,

284 OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
446 U. S. 335, 344 (1980). These two lines of cases justifiedthe Court's conclusion that a criminal defendant has a right

to effective assistance of counsel on a first appeal as of right.
Evitts, supra, at 394-396.

The Court did not thereby purport to create a new
"strand" of due process analysis. And it did not rely on thenotion of a continuum of due process rights. Instead, the

Court evaluated the function and significance of a first appealas of right, in light of prior cases. Related decisions similarly make clear that there is no continuum requiring vary-ing levels of process at every conceivable phase of the criminal system. See, e. g., Giarratano, 492 U. S., at 9-10 (no due
process right to counsel for capital inmates in state postconviction proceedings); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551,
555-557 (1987) (no right to counsel in state postconviction
proceedings); Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 610-611 (1974)
(no right to counsel for discretionary appeals on direct
review).

An examination of the function and significance of the discretionary clemency decision at issue here readily shows it is
far different from the first appeal of right at issue in Evitts.
Clemency proceedings are not part of the trial--or even of
the adjudicatory process. They do not determine the guilt
or innocence of the defendant, and are not intended primarily
to enhance the reliability of the trial process. They are conducted by the executive branch, independent of direct appeal
and collateral relief proceedings. Greenholtz, 442 U. S., at
7-8. And they are usually discretionary, unlike the more
structured and limited scope of judicial proceedings. While
traditionally available to capital defendants as a final and
alternative avenue of relief, clemency has not traditionally
"been the business of courts." Dumschat, 452 U. S., at 464.
Cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 411-415 (1993) (recognizing the traditional availability and significance of clemency as part of executive authority, without suggesting that
clemency proceedings are subject to judicial review); Ex

parte Grossman, 267 U. S. 87, 120-121 (1925) (executiveclemency exists to provide relief from harshness or mistake

in the judicial system, and is therefore vested in an authorityother than the courts).

Thus, clemency proceedings are not " `an integral part of
the . . . system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocenceof a defendant,' "

Evitts, supra, at 393 (quoting Griffin v.
Illinois, supra, at 18). Procedures mandated under the DueProcess Clause should be consistent with the nature of the

governmental power being invoked. Here, the executive'sclemency authority would cease to be a matter of grace committed to the executive authority if it were constrained bythe sort of procedural requirements that respondent urges.
Respondent is already under a sentence of death, determined
to have been lawfully imposed. If clemency is granted, heobtains a benefit; if it is denied, he is no worse off than he

was before.5 III

Respondent also presses on us the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the provision of a voluntary inmate interview,without the benefit of counsel or a grant of immunity for any

statements made by the inmate, implicates the inmate's Fifthand Fourteenth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.
Because there is only one guaranteed clemency review, respondent asserts, his decision to participate is not truly vol-untary. And in the interview he may be forced to answer

questions; or, if he remains silent, his silence may be usedagainst him. Respondent further asserts there is a substantial risk of incrimination since postconviction proceedingsare in progress and since he could potentially incriminate
himself on other crimes. Respondent therefore concludesthat the interview unconstitutionally conditions his assertion

5 The dissent mischaracterizes the question at issue as a determination
to deprive a person of life. Post, at 290. That determination has already
been made with all required due process protections.

Opinion of the Court
of the right to pursue clemency on his waiver of the right toremain silent. While the Court of Appeals accepted respondent's rubric of "unconstitutional conditions," we find itunnecessary to address it in deciding this case. In our opinion, the procedures of the Authority do not under any view
violate the Fifth Amendment privilege.The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled selfincrimination. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308,316-318 (1976). The record itself does not tell us what, if
any, use is made by the board of the clemency interview, orof an inmate's refusal to answer questions posed to him at
that interview. But the Authority in its brief dispels muchof the uncertainty:

"Nothing in the procedure grants clemency applicantsimmunity for what they might say or makes the interview in any way confidential. Ohio has permissibly cho-sen not to allow the inmate to say one thing in the interview and another in a habeas petition, and no amount
of discovery will alter this feature of the procedure."Reply Brief for Petitioners 6.

Assuming also that the Authority will draw adverse inferences from respondent's refusal to answer questions--whichit may do in a civil proceeding without offending the Fifth

Amendment, Palmigiano, supra, at 316-318--we do not
think that respondent's testimony at a clemency interviewwould be "compelled" within the meaning of the Fifth

Amendment. It is difficult to see how a voluntary interviewcould "compel" respondent to speak. He merely faces a
choice quite similar to the sorts of choices that a criminal
defendant must make in the course of criminal proceedings, none of which has ever been held to violate the Fifth
Amendment.

Long ago we held that a defendant who took the stand in
his own defense could not claim the privilege against selfincrimination when the prosecution sought to cross-examine

him. Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598 (1896); Brownv.

United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154-155 (1958). A defendant
who takes the stand in his own behalf may be impeachedby proof of prior convictions without violation of the Fifth

Amendment privilege. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 561
(1967). A defendant whose motion for acquittal at the closeof the government's case is denied must then elect whether

to stand on his motion or to put on a defense, with theaccompanying risk that in doing so he will augment the
government's case against him. McGautha v. California,402 U. S. 183, 215 (1971). In each of these situations, there
are undoubted pressures--generated by the strength ofthe government's case against him--pushing the criminal
defendant to testify. But it has never been suggested that
such pressures constitute "compulsion" for Fifth Amend-ment purposes.

In Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970), it was claimedthat Florida's requirement of advance notice of alibi from a
criminal defendant, in default of which he would be pre-cluded from asserting the alibi defense, violated the privilege. We said:

"Nothing in such a rule requires the defendant to rely
on an alibi or prevents him from abandoning the defense;these matters are left to his unfettered choice. That

choice must be made, but the pressures that bear on hispretrial decision are of the same nature as those that
would induce him to call alibi witnesses at the trial: the
force of historical fact beyond both his and the State'scontrol and the strength of the State's case built on

these facts. Response to that kind of pressure by offering evidence or testimony is not compelled selfincrimination transgressing the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments." Id., at 84-85 (footnote omitted).

Here, respondent has the same choice of providing information to the Authority--at the risk of damaging his case for

clemency or for postconviction relief--or of remaining silent.But this pressure to speak in the hope of improving his

chance of being granted clemency does not make the inter-view compelled. We therefore hold that the Ohio clemency
interview, even on assumptions most favorable to respond-ent's claim, does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege
against compelled self-incrimination.

IV
We hold that neither the Due Process Clause nor the FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination is violated

by Ohio's clemency proceedings. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is therefore

Reversed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part andconcurring in the judgment.

A prisoner under a death sentence remains a living personand consequently has an interest in his life. The question
this case raises is the issue of what process is constitutionallynecessary to protect that interest in the context of Ohio's
clemency procedures. It is clear that "once society has val-idly convicted an individual of a crime and therefore established its right to punish, the demands of due process arereduced accordingly."

Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399,429 (1986) (
O'Connor, J., concurring in result in part anddissenting in part). I do not, however, agree with the suggestion in the principal opinion that, because clemency iscommitted to the discretion of the executive, the Due Process Clause provides no constitutional safeguards. The
Chief Justice's reasoning rests on our decisions in Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458 (1981), andGreenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979). In those cases, the Court found thatan inmate seeking commutation of a life sentence or discre523US1 Unit: $U44 [04-29-00 20:43:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tionary parole had no protected liberty interest in releasefrom lawful confinement. When a person has been fairly

convicted and sentenced, his liberty interest, in being freefrom such confinement, has been extinguished. But it is incorrect, as Justice Stevens' dissent notes, to say that a
prisoner has been deprived of all interest in his life beforehis execution. See

post, at 291-292. Thus, although it is
true that "pardon and commutation decisions have not tradi-tionally been the business of courts,"

Dumschat, supra, at
464, and that the decision whether to grant clemency is en-trusted to the Governor under Ohio law, I believe that the

Court of Appeals correctly concluded that some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings. Judicial
intervention might, for example, be warranted in the face of
a scheme whereby a state official flipped a coin to determine
whether to grant clemency, or in a case where the State arbitrarily denied a prisoner any access to its clemency process.

In my view, however, a remand to permit the District
Court to address respondent's specific allegations of due
process violations is not required. The Ohio Death Penalty
Clemency Procedure provides that, if a stay has not yet issued, the parole board must schedule a clemency hearing 45
days before an execution for a date approximately 21 days
in advance of the execution. The board must also advise the
prisoner that he is entitled to a prehearing interview with
one or more parole board members. Although the Ohio
Adult Parole Authority complied with those instructions
here, respondent raises several objections to the process afforded him. He contends that 3 days' notice of his interview
and 10 days' notice of the hearing were inadequate; that he
did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare his clemency application because postconviction proceedings were
pending; that his counsel was improperly excluded from the
interview and permitted to participate in the hearing only
at the discretion of the parole board chair; and that he was
precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evi523US1 Unit: $U44 [04-29-00 20:43:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dence at the hearing. I do not believe that any of theseallegations amounts to a due process violation. The process

respondent received, including notice of the hearing andan opportunity to participate in an interview, comports
with Ohio's regulations and observes whatever limitationsthe Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings. Moreover, I agree that the voluntary inmate inter-view that forms part of Ohio's process did not violate
respondent's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment privilegeagainst self-incrimination.

Accordingly, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinionand concur in the judgment.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.
When a parole board conducts a hearing to determinewhether the State shall actually execute one of its death row
inmates--in other words, whether the State shall deprivethat person of life--does it have an obligation to comply with
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Inmy judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to
that question. It expressly provides that no State has thepower to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law."Without deciding what "minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible," procedural safeguards are required in clemencyproceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the
basic question presented and remanded the case to the Dis-trict Court to determine whether Ohio's procedures meet the
"minimal" requirements of due process.1 In Part II of hisopinion today, however,

The Chief Justice takes a differ-ent view--essentially concluding that a clemency proceeding

could never violate the Due Process Clause. Thus, under
such reasoning, even procedures infected by bribery, per1 107 F. 3d 1178, 1187-1188 (CA6 1997).

sonal or political animosity, or the deliberate fabrication offalse evidence would be constitutionally acceptable. Like

Justice O'Connor, I respectfully disagree with thatconclusion.

I
The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs ourattention to state action that may "deprive" a person of life,

liberty, or property. When we are evaluating claims thatthe State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state actionadversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.
Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no"liberty interest" in the place where he is confined, Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), or that an at-will em-ployee has no "property interest" in his job, Bishop v. Wood,
426 U. S. 341 (1976). There is, however, no room for legiti-mate debate about whether a living person has a constitutionally protected interest in life. He obviously does.Nor does

Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452U. S. 458 (1981), counsel a different conclusion. In that case

the Court held that a refusal to commute a prison inmate'slife sentence was not a deprivation of his liberty because the
liberty interest at stake had already been extinguished. Id.,at 461, 464. The holding was supported by the "crucial distinction between being deprived of a liberty one has, as inparole, and being denied a conditional liberty one desires."
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 9 (1979).2 That "crucial distinction" points

2 "Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt: `There is no
constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally
released before the expiration of a valid sentence. The natural desire of
an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance
to being confined. But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards,
has extinguished that liberty right: "[G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty." ' 442
U. S., at 7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted). Greenholtz pointedly dis523US1 Unit: $U44 [04-29-00 20:43:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Stevens, J.
in the opposite direction in this case because respondent iscontesting the State's decision to deprive him of life that he

still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life
interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

II
There are valid reasons for concluding that even if dueprocess is required in clemency proceedings, only the most

basic elements of fair procedure are required. Presumablya State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing
entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive vir-tually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of
appeals for mercy. Nevertheless, there are equally validreasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review. I think, for example,that no one would contend that a Governor could ignore the
commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, reli-gion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency. Our cases also support the conclusion thatif a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part
of its system for finally determining whether to deprive aperson of life, that procedure must comport with the Due
Process Clause.Even if a State has no constitutional obligation to grant
criminal defendants a right to appeal, when it does establishappellate courts, the procedures employed by those courts
must satisfy the Due Process Clause. Evitts v. Lucey, 469U. S. 387, 396 (1985). Likewise, even if a State has no duty
to authorize parole or probation, if it does exercise its discretinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that
there is a `critical' difference between denial of a prisoner's request for
initial release on parole and revocation of a parolee's conditional liberty.

tion to grant conditional liberty to convicted felons, any deci-sion to deprive a parolee or a probationer of such conditional

liberty must accord that person due process. Morrissey v.Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480-490 (1972); Gagnon v. Scarpelli,
411 U. S. 778, 781-782 (1973). Similarly, if a State estab-lishes postconviction proceedings, these proceedings must
comport with due process.3The interest in life that is at stake in this case warrants
even greater protection than the interests in liberty at stakein those cases.

4 For "death is a different kind of punishment

3 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e. g.,
Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555-557 (1987), we have never held
or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings. Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the State's postconviction proceedings comported with the "fundamental fairness mandated by the Due
Process Clause." Id., at 556-557; see also Murray v. Giarratano, 492
U. S. 1, 8 (1989) (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) (" `[T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate
supply a lawyer' " (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)). The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases "make clear
that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . .
phase of the criminal system," ante, at 284; instead, these cases simply
turned on what process is due. If there could be any question whether
state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections,
our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 484 U. S. 211, 217-218 (1988),
makes it clear that they are.

4 The Court has recognized the integral role that clemency proceedings

play in the decision whether to deprive a person of life. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 411-417 (1993). Indeed, every one of the 38 States

TEXAS v. UNITED STATES
appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbia

No. 97-29. Argued January 14, 1998--Decided March 31, 1998
In 1995, the Texas Legislature enacted a comprehensive scheme (Chapter

39) that holds local school boards accountable to the State for student
achievement in the public schools. When a school district falls short of
Chapter 39's accreditation criteria, the State Commissioner of Education
may select from 10 possible sanctions, including appointment of a master
to oversee the district's operations, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. $ 39.131(a)(7),
or appointment of a management team to direct operations in areas of
unacceptable performance or to require contracting out of services,

$ 39.131(a)(8). Texas, a covered jurisdiction under $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, submitted Chapter 39 to the United States Attorney
General for a determination whether any of the sanctions affected voting and thus required preclearance. While the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights did not object to $$ 39.131(a)(7) and (8), he cautioned
that under certain circumstances their implementation might result in
a $ 5 violation. Texas subsequently filed a complaint in the District
Court, seeking a declaration that $ 5 does not apply to the $$ 39.131(a)(7)
and (8) sanctions. The court did not reach the merits of the case because it concluded that Texas's claim was not ripe.

Held: Texas's claim is not ripe for adjudication. A claim resting upon

" `contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed
may not occur at all,' " is not fit for adjudication. Thomas v. Union
Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 580-581. Whether
the problem Texas presents will ever need solving is too speculative.
Texas will appoint a master or management team only after a school
district falls below state standards and the Commissioner has tried
other, less intrusive sanctions. Texas has not pointed to any school
district in which the application of $ 39.131(a)(7) or (8) is currently foreseen or even likely. Even if there were greater certainty regarding
implementation, the claim would not be ripe because the legal issues
Texas raises are not yet fit for judicial decision and because the hardship
to Texas of withholding court consideration until the State chooses to
implement one of the sanctions is insubstantial. See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 149. Pp. 300-302.

comprehensive scheme (Chapter 39) that holds local school
boards accountable to the State for student achievement.
Tex. Educ. Code Ann. $$ 39.021-39.131 (1996). Chapter 39
contains detailed prescriptions for assessment of student

academic skills, development of academic performance indicators, determination of accreditation status for school
districts, and imposition of accreditation sanctions. It seeks
to measure the academic performance of Texas schoolchildren, to reward the schools and school districts that achieve
the legislative goals, and to sanction those that fall short.

When a district fails to satisfy the State's accreditation
criteria, the State Commissioner of Education may select
from 10 possible sanctions that are listed in ascending order
of severity. $$ 39.131(a)(1)-(10). Those include, "to the extent the [C]ommissioner determines necessary," $ 39.131(a),
appointing a master to oversee the district's operations,

$ 39.131(a)(7), or appointing a management team to direct the
district's operations in areas of unacceptable performance or
to require the district to contract for services from another
person, $ 39.131(a)(8). When the Commissioner appoints
masters or management teams, he "shall clearly define the[ir]
powers and duties" and shall review the need for them every
90 days. $ 39.131(e). A master or management team may
approve or disapprove any action taken by a school principal,
the district superintendent, or the district's board of trustees, and may also direct them to act. $$ 39.131(e)(1), (2).
State law prohibits masters or management teams from taking any action concerning a district election, changing the
number of members on or the method of selecting the board
of trustees, setting a tax rate for the district, or adopting a
budget which establishes a different level of spending for the
district from that set by the board. $$ 39.131(e)(3)-(6).

select special masters and management teams, a detailed de-scription of their powers and duties, and the difference between their duties and those of the elected boards. TheState responded by pointing out the limits placed on masters
and management teams in $ 39.131(e), and by noting that theactual authority granted "is set by the Commissioner at the
time of appointment depending on the needs of the district."App. to Juris. Statement 99a. After receiving this information, the Assistant Attorney General concluded that the firstsix sanctions do not affect voting and therefore do not require preclearance. He did not object to $$ 39.131(a)(7) and(8), insofar as the provisions are "enabling in nature," but he
cautioned that "under certain foreseeable circumstancestheir implementation may result in a violation of Section 5"
which would require preclearance. Id., at 36a.On June 7, 1996, Texas filed a complaint in the United

Opinion of the Court

II
A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon " `con-tingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or

indeed may not occur at all.' " Thomas v. Union Carbide
Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 580-581 (1985)(quoting 13A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal

Practice and Procedure $ 3532, p. 112 (1984)). WhetherTexas will appoint a master or management team under

$$ 39.131(a)(7) and (8) is contingent on a number of factors.First, a school district must fall below the state standards.
Then, pursuant to state policy, the Commissioner must tryfirst "the imposition of sanctions which do not include the
appointment of a master or management team," App. 10(Original Complaint ||12). He may, for example, "order the
preparation of a student achievement improvement plan . . . ,the submission of the plan to the [C]ommissioner for approval, and implementation of the plan," $ 39.131(a)(3), or"appoint an agency monitor to participate in and report to
the agency on the activities of the board of trustees or thesuperintendent," $ 39.131(a)(6). It is only if these less intrusive options fail that a Commissioner may appoint a masteror management team, Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, and even then, only
"to the extent the [C]ommissioner determines necessary,"$ 39.131(a). Texas has not pointed to any particular school
district in which the application of $ 39.131(a)(7) or (8) is cur-rently foreseen or even likely. Indeed, Texas hopes that
there will be no need to appoint a master or managementteam for any district. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17. Under these
circumstances, where "we have no idea whether or whensuch [a sanction] will be ordered," the issue is not fit for
adjudication. Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U. S.158, 163 (1967); see also Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 321-
322 (1991).Even if there were greater certainty regarding ultimate
implementation of paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8) of the statute,we do not think Texas's claim would be ripe. Ripeness "re523us1$45K 01-06-99 17:39:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judi-cial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding

court consideration." Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387U. S. 136, 149 (1967). As to fitness of the issues: Texas asks
us to hold that under no circumstances can the imposition of
these sanctions constitute a change affecting voting. We donot have sufficient confidence in our powers of imagination

to affirm such a negative. The operation of the statute isbetter grasped when viewed in light of a particular application. Here, as is often true, "[d]etermination of the scope. . . of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect
in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and
abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial
function." Longshoremen v. Boyd, 347 U. S. 222, 224 (1954).
In the present case, the remoteness and abstraction are increased by the fact that Chapter 39 has yet to be interpreted
by the Texas courts. Thus, "[p]ostponing consideration of
the questions presented, until a more concrete controversy
arises, also has the advantage of permitting the state courts
further opportunity to construe" the provisions. Renne,
supra, at 323.

And as for hardship to the parties: This is not a case like
Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra, at 152, where the
regulation at issue had a "direct effect on the day-to-day
business" of the plaintiffs, because they were compelled to
affix required labeling to their products under threat of criminal sanction. Texas is not required to engage in, or to refrain from, any conduct, unless and until it chooses to implement one of the noncleared remedies. To be sure, if that
contingency should arise compliance with the preclearance
procedure could delay much needed action. (Prior to this
litigation, Texas sought preclearance for the appointment of
a master in a Dallas County school district, and despite a
request for expedition the Attorney General took 90 days to
give approval. See Brief for Appellant 37, n. 28.) But even
that inconvenience is avoidable. If Texas is confident that

523us1$45K 01-06-99 17:39:34 PAGES OPINPGT
302 TEXAS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the imposition of a master or management team does notconstitute a change affecting voting, it should simply go

ahead with the appointment. Should the Attorney Generalor a private individual bring suit (and if the matter is as
clear, even at this distance, as Texas thinks it is), we have noreason to doubt that a district court will deny a preliminary
injunction. See Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502U. S. 491, 506 (1992);

City of Lockhart v. United States, 460U. S. 125, 129, n. 3 (1983). Texas claims that it suffers the

immediate hardship of a "threat to federalism." But that isan abstraction--and an abstraction no graver than the
"threat to personal freedom" that exists whenever an agencyregulation is promulgated, which we hold inadequate to support suit unless the person's primary conduct is affected.Cf.

Toilet Goods Assn., supra, at 164.In sum, we find it too speculative whether the problem

Texas presents will ever need solving; we find the legal is-sues Texas raises not yet fit for our consideration, and the
hardship to Texas of biding its time insubstantial. Accord-ingly, we agree with the District Court that this matter is
not ripe for adjudication.The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe armed forces

No. 96-1133. Argued November 3, 1997--Decided March 31, 1998
A polygraph examination of respondent airman indicated, in the opinion

of the Air Force examiner administering the test, that there was "no
deception" in respondent's denial that he had used drugs since enlisting.
Urinalysis, however, revealed the presence of methamphetamine, and
respondent was tried by general court-martial for using that drug and
for other offenses. In denying his motion to introduce the polygraph
evidence to support his testimony that he did not knowingly use drugs,
the military judge relied on Military Rule of Evidence 707, which makes
polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial proceedings. Respondent was convicted on all counts, and the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed, holding that a per se exclusion of polygraph evidence offered by
an accused to support his credibility violates his Sixth Amendment right
to present a defense.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
44 M. J. 442, reversed.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A, and II-D, concluding that Military Rule of Evidence 707
does not unconstitutionally abridge the right of accused members of the
military to present a defense. Pp. 308-312, 315-317.

(a) A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is subject to reasonable restrictions to accommodate other legitimate interests in the
criminal trial process. See, e. g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 55.
State and federal rulemakers therefore have broad latitude under the
Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence. Such rules do not
abridge an accused's right to present a defense so long as they are not
"arbitrary" or "disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to
serve." E. g., id., at 56. This Court has found the exclusion of evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where
it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused. See, e. g., id.,
at 58. Rule 707 serves the legitimate interest of ensuring that only
reliable evidence is introduced. There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable: The scientific community and the state and
federal courts are extremely polarized on the matter. Pp. 308-312.

523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
304 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFER

Syllabus
(b) Rule 707 does not implicate a sufficiently weighty interest of the
accused to raise a constitutional concern under this Court's precedents.
The three cases principally relied upon by the Court of Appeals, Rock,
supra, at 57, Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 23, and Chambers v.
Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302-303, do not support a right to introduce
polygraph evidence, even in very narrow circumstances. The exclusions of evidence there declared unconstitutional significantly undermined fundamental elements of the accused's defense. Such is not the
case here, where the court members heard all the relevant details of the
charged offense from respondent's perspective, and Rule 707 did not
preclude him from introducing any factual evidence, but merely barred
him from introducing expert opinion testimony to bolster his own credibility. Moreover, in contrast to the rule at issue in Rock, supra, at 52,
Rule 707 did not prohibit respondent from testifying on his own behalf;
he freely exercised his choice to convey his version of the facts at trial.

306 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFER

Opinion of the Court
one of the OSI agents supervising respondent requested thathe submit to a urine test. Shortly after providing the urine

sample, but before the results of the test were known, re-spondent agreed to take a polygraph test administered by
an OSI examiner. In the opinion of the examiner, the test"indicated no deception" when respondent denied using
drugs since joining the Air Force.1On April 30, respondent unaccountably failed to appear for
work and could not be found on the base. He was absentwithout leave until May 13, when an Iowa state patrolman
arrested him following a routine traffic stop and held him forreturn to the base. OSI agents later learned that respondent's urinalysis revealed the presence of methamphetamine.Respondent was tried by general court-martial on charges
of using methamphetamine, failing to go to his appointedplace of duty, wrongfully absenting himself from the base for
13 days, and, with respect to an unrelated matter, uttering17 insufficient funds checks. He testified at trial on his own
behalf, relying upon an "innocent ingestion" theory and de-nying that he had knowingly used drugs while working for
OSI. On cross-examination, the prosecution attempted toimpeach respondent with inconsistencies between his trial
testimony and earlier statements he had made to OSI.Respondent sought to introduce the polygraph evidence in
support of his testimony that he did not knowingly usedrugs. The military judge denied the motion, relying on
Military Rule of Evidence 707, which provides, in relevantpart:

"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the re-sults of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer to take,
1 The OSI examiner asked three relevant questions: (1) "Since you've
been in the [Air Force], have you used any illegal drugs?"; (2) "Have you
lied about any of the drug information you've given OSI?"; and (3) "Besides your parents, have you told anyone you're assisting OSI?" Respondent answered "no" to each question. App. 12.

Opinion of the Court
failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination,shall not be admitted into evidence."

The military judge determined that Rule 707 was constitu-tional because "the President may, through the Rules of Evidence, determine that credibility is not an area in which afact finder needs help, and the polygraph is not a process
that has sufficient scientific acceptability to be relevant." 2App. 28. He further reasoned that the factfinder might give
undue weight to the polygraph examiner's testimony, andthat collateral arguments about such evidence could consume
"an inordinate amount of time and expense." Ibid.Respondent was convicted on all counts and was sentenced

Opinion of the Court
Rule 707 serves several legitimate interests in the crimi-nal trial process. These interests include ensuring that only

reliable evidence is introduced at trial, preserving the courtmembers' role in determining credibility, and avoiding litigation that is collateral to the primary purpose of the trial.5The Rule is neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in promoting these ends. Nor does it implicate a sufficientlyweighty interest of the defendant to raise a constitutional
concern under our precedents.

A
State and Federal Governments unquestionably have a le-gitimate interest in ensuring that reliable evidence is presented to the trier of fact in a criminal trial. Indeed, theexclusion of unreliable evidence is a principal objective of
many evidentiary rules. See, e. g., Fed. Rules Evid. 702, 802,901; see also

Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,509 U. S. 579, 589 (1993).

The contentions of respondent and the dissent notwith-standing, there is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable. To this day, the scientific community re-mains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraph
techniques. 1 D. Faigman, D. Kaye, M. Saks, & J. Sanders,Modern Scientific Evidence 565, n. #, $ 14-2.0 to $ 14-7.0
(1997); see also 1 P. Giannelli & E. Imwinkelried, Scientific

5 These interests, among others, were recognized by the drafters of Rule
707, who justified the Rule on the following grounds: the risk that court
members would be misled by polygraph evidence; the risk that the traditional responsibility of court members to ascertain the facts and adjudge
guilt or innocence would be usurped; the danger that confusion of the
issues " `could result in the court-martial degenerating into a trial of the
polygraph machine;' " the likely waste of time on collateral issues; and the
fact that the " `reliability of polygraph evidence has not been sufficiently
established.' " See 41 M. J. 683, 686 (USAF Ct. Crim. App. 1995) (citing
Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Analysis of the Military Rules
of Evidence, App. 22, p. A22-46 (1994 ed.)).

admissibility and the reliability of polygraph evidence.7 Al-though some Federal Courts of Appeals have abandoned the

per se rule excluding polygraph evidence, leaving its admis-sion or exclusion to the discretion of district courts under
Daubert, see, e. g., United States v. Posado, 57 F. 3d 428, 434(CA5 1995);

United States v. Cordoba, 104 F. 3d 225, 228(CA9 1997), at least one Federal Circuit has recently reaffirmed its per se ban, see United States v. Sanchez, 118 F. 3d192, 197 (CA4 1997), and another recently noted that it has
"not decided whether polygraphy has reached a sufficientstate of reliability to be admissible." United States v. Messina, 131 F. 3d 36, 42 (CA2 1997). Most States maintain per
se rules excluding polygraph evidence. See, e. g., State v.Porter, 241 Conn. 57, 92-95, 698 A. 2d 739, 758-759 (1997);

People v. Gard, 158 Ill. 2d 191, 202-204, 632 N. E. 2d 1026,1032 (1994); In re Odell, 672 A. 2d 457, 459 (RI 1996) (per
curiam); Perkins v. State, 902 S. W. 2d 88, 94-95 (Ct. App.Tex. 1995). New Mexico is unique in making polygraph evidence generally admissible without the prior stipulation ofthe parties and without significant restriction. See N. M.

7 Until quite recently, federal and state courts were uniform in categorically ruling polygraph evidence inadmissible under the test set forth in
Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (CADC 1923), which held that scientific
evidence must gain the general acceptance of the relevant expert community to be admissible. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
509 U. S. 579 (1993), we held that Frye had been superseded by the Federal Rules of Evidence and that expert testimony could be admitted if the
district court deemed it both relevant and reliable.

Prior to Daubert, neither federal nor state courts found any Sixth
Amendment obstacle to the categorical rule. See, e. g., Bashor v. Risley,
730 F. 2d 1228, 1238 (CA9), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 838 (1984); People v.
Price, 1 Cal. 4th 324, 419-420, 821 P. 2d 610, 663 (1991), cert. denied, 506
U. S. 851 (1992). Nothing in Daubert foreclosed, as a constitutional matter, per se exclusionary rules for certain types of expert or scientific evidence. It would be an odd inversion of our hierarchy of laws if altering
or interpreting a rule of evidence worked a corresponding change in the
meaning of the Constitution.

312 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFER

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Rule Evid. $ 11-707.8 Whatever their approach, state andfederal courts continue to express doubt about whether such

evidence is reliable. See, e. g., United States v. Messina,supra, at 42; United States v. Posado, supra, at 434; State v.
Porter, supra, at 126-127, 698 A. 2d, at 774; Perkins v. State,
supra, at 94; People v. Gard, supra, at 202-204, 632 N. E. 2d,at 1032; In re Odell, supra, at 459.

The approach taken by the President in adopting Rule707--excluding polygraph evidence in all military trials--is a
rational and proportional means of advancing the legitimateinterest in barring unreliable evidence. Although the degree of reliability of polygraph evidence may depend upon avariety of identifiable factors, there is simply no way to know
in a particular case whether a polygraph examiner's conclu-sion is accurate, because certain doubts and uncertainties
plague even the best polygraph exams. Individual jurisdic-tions therefore may reasonably reach differing conclusions
as to whether polygraph evidence should be admitted. Wecannot say, then, that presented with such widespread uncertainty, the President acted arbitrarily or disproportion-ately in promulgating a per se rule excluding all polygraph
evidence. B

It is equally clear that Rule 707 serves a second legitimategovernmental interest: Preserving the court members' core
8 Respondent argues that because the Government--and in particular
the Department of Defense--routinely uses polygraph testing, the Government must consider polygraphs reliable. Governmental use of polygraph tests, however, is primarily in the field of personnel screening, and
to a lesser extent as a tool in criminal and intelligence investigations, but
not as evidence at trials. See Brief for United States 34, n. 17; Barland,
The Polygraph Test in the USA and Elsewhere, in The Polygraph Test 76
(A. Gale ed. 1988). Such limited, out of court uses of polygraph techniques obviously differ in character from, and carry less severe consequences than, the use of polygraphs as evidence in a criminal trial. They
do not establish the reliability of polygraphs as trial evidence, and they do
not invalidate reliability as a valid concern supporting Rule 707's categorical ban.

function of making credibility determinations in criminal
trials. A fundamental premise of our criminal trial system
is that "the jury is the lie detector." United States v. Barnard, 490 F. 2d 907, 912 (CA9 1973) (emphasis added), cert.
denied, 416 U. S. 959 (1974). Determining the weight and
credibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long been
held to be the "part of every case [that] belongs to the jury,
who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the
ways of men." Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 140 U. S. 76, 88
(1891).

By its very nature, polygraph evidence may diminish the
jury's role in making credibility determinations. The common form of polygraph test measures a variety of physiological responses to a set of questions asked by the examiner,
who then interprets these physiological correlates of anxiety
and offers an opinion to the jury about whether the witness--often, as in this case, the accused--was deceptive in
answering questions about the very matters at issue in the
trial. See 1 McCormick $ 206.9 Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors'
knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or
DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply
the jury only with another opinion, in addition to its own,
about whether the witness was telling the truth. Jurisdictions, in promulgating rules of evidence, may legitimately be
concerned about the risk that juries will give excessive

9 The examiner interprets various physiological responses of the examinee, including blood pressure, perspiration, and respiration, while asking
a series of questions, commonly in three categories: direct accusatory
questions concerning the matter under investigation, irrelevant or neutral
questions, and more general "control" questions concerning wrongdoing
by the subject in general. The examiner forms an opinion of the subject's
truthfulness by comparing the physiological reactions to each set of questions. See generally Giannelli & Imwinkelried 219-222; Honts & Quick,

weight to the opinions of a polygrapher, clothed as they arein scientific expertise and at times offering, as in respondent's case, a conclusion about the ultimate issue in the trial.
Such jurisdictions may legitimately determine that the aura
of infallibility attending polygraph evidence can lead jurors
to abandon their duty to assess credibility and guilt. Those
jurisdictions may also take into account the fact that a judge
cannot determine, when ruling on a motion to admit polygraph evidence, whether a particular polygraph expert is
likely to influence the jury unduly. For these reasons, the
President is within his constitutional prerogative to promulgate a per se rule that simply excludes all such evidence.

C
A third legitimate interest served by Rule 707 is avoiding
litigation over issues other than the guilt or innocence of the
accused. Such collateral litigation prolongs criminal trials
and threatens to distract the jury from its central function
of determining guilt or innocence. Allowing proffers of
polygraph evidence would inevitably entail assessments of
such issues as whether the test and control questions were
appropriate, whether a particular polygraph examiner was
qualified and had properly interpreted the physiological responses, and whether other factors such as countermeasures
employed by the examinee had distorted the exam results.
Such assessments would be required in each and every
case.10 It thus offends no constitutional principle for the
President to conclude that a per se rule excluding all polygraph evidence is appropriate. Because litigation over the
admissibility of polygraph evidence is by its very nature col10 Although some of this litigation could take place outside the presence
of the jury, at the very least a foundation must be laid for the jury to
assess the qualifications and skill of the polygrapher and the validity of
the exam, and significant cross-examination could occur on these issues.

Opinion of the Court
lateral, a per se rule prohibiting its admission is not an arbitrary or disproportionate means of avoiding it.11

D
The three of our precedents upon which the Court of Appeals principally relied, Rock v. Arkansas, Washington v.
Texas, and Chambers v. Mississippi, do not support a right
to introduce polygraph evidence, even in very narrow circumstances. The exclusions of evidence that we declared
unconstitutional in those cases significantly undermined fundamental elements of the defendant's defense. Such is not
the case here.

In Rock, the defendant, accused of a killing to which she
was the only eyewitness, was allegedly able to remember the
facts of the killing only after having her memory hypnotically refreshed. See Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S., at 46.
Because Arkansas excluded all hypnotically refreshed testimony, the defendant was unable to testify about certain relevant facts, including whether the killing had been accidental.
See id., at 47-49. In holding that the exclusion of this evidence violated the defendant's "right to present a defense,"
we noted that the rule deprived the jury of the testimony of
the only witness who was at the scene and had firsthand
knowledge of the facts. See id., at 57. Moreover, the rule
infringed upon the defendant's interest in testifying in her
own defense--an interest that we deemed particularly significant, as it is the defendant who is the target of any crimi11 Although the Court of Appeals stated that it had "merely remove[d]
the obstacle of the per se rule against admissibility" of polygraph evidence
in cases where the accused wishes to proffer an exculpatory polygraph to
rebut an attack on his credibility, 44 M. J. 442, 446 (1996), and respondent
thus implicitly argues that the Constitution would require collateral litigation only in such cases, we cannot see a principled justification whereby a
right derived from the Constitution could be so narrowly contained.

Opinion of the Court
nal prosecution. See id., at 52. For this reason, we statedthat a defendant ought to be allowed "to present his own

version of events in his own words." Ibid.In Washington, the statutes involved prevented codefendants or coparticipants in a crime from testifying forone another and thus precluded the defendant from introducing his accomplice's testimony that the accomplice had in factcommitted the crime. See

Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S.,at 16-17. In reversing Washington's conviction, we held

that the Sixth Amendment was violated because "the Statearbitrarily denied [the defendant] the right to put on the
stand a witness who was physically and mentally capable oftestifying to events that he had personally observed."

Id.,at 23.
12

In Chambers, we found a due process violation in thecombined application of Mississippi's common-law "voucher

rule," which prevented a party from impeaching his own wit-ness, and its hearsay rule that excluded the testimony of
three persons to whom that witness had confessed. SeeChambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S., at 302. Chambers specifically confined its holding to the "facts and circumstances"presented in that case; we thus stressed that the ruling did
not "signal any diminution in the respect traditionally ac-corded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures." Id.,at 302-303.

Chambers therefore does not stand for theproposition that the defendant is denied a fair opportunity

to defend himself whenever a state or federal rule excludesfavorable evidence.

Rock, Washington, and Chambers do not require that Rule707 be invalidated, because, unlike the evidentiary rules at
issue in those cases, Rule 707 does not implicate any signifi12 In addition, we noted that the State of Texas could advance no legitimate interests in support of the evidentiary rules at issue, and those rules
burdened only the defense and not the prosecution. See 388 U. S., at 22-

cant interest of the accused. Here, the court membersheard all the relevant details of the charged offense from the

perspective of the accused, and the Rule did not precludehim from introducing any factual evidence.

13 Rather, respondent was barred merely from introducing expert opiniontestimony to bolster his own credibility. Moreover, in contrast to the rule at issue in Rock, Rule 707 did not prohibitrespondent from testifying on his own behalf; he freely exercised his choice to convey his version of the facts to thecourt-martial members. We therefore cannot conclude that
respondent's defense was significantly impaired by the exclu-sion of polygraph evidence. Rule 707 is thus constitutional
under our precedents.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, Military Rule of Evidence 707does not unconstitutionally abridge the right to present a

defense. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
13 The dissent suggests, post, at 331, that polygraph results constitute
"factual evidence." The raw results of a polygraph exam--the subject's
pulse, respiration, and perspiration rates--may be factual data, but these
are not introduced at trial, and even if they were, they would not be
"facts" about the alleged crime at hand. Rather, the evidence introduced
is the expert opinion testimony of the polygrapher about whether the subject was truthful or deceptive in answering questions about the alleged
crime. A per se rule excluding polygraph results therefore does not
prevent an accused--just as it did not prevent respondent here--from
introducing factual evidence or testimony about the crime itself, such as
alibi witness testimony, see ibid. For the same reasons, an expert polygrapher's interpretation of polygraph results is not evidence of " `the accused's whole conduct,' " see post, at 336, to which Dean Wigmore referred.
It is not evidence of the " `accused's . . . conduct' " at all, much less "conduct" concerning the actual crime at issue. It is merely the opinion of a
witness with no knowledge about any of the facts surrounding the alleged
crime, concerning whether the defendant spoke truthfully or deceptively
on another occasion.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring inpart and concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I, II-A, and II-D of the opinion of the Court.In my view it should have been sufficient to decide this
case to observe, as the principal opinion does, that variouscourts and jurisdictions "may reasonably reach differing
conclusions as to whether polygraph evidence should beadmitted." Ante, at 312. The continuing, good-faith disagreement among experts and courts on the subject of poly-graph reliability counsels against our invalidating a per se
exclusion of polygraph results or of the fact an accused hastaken or refused to take a polygraph examination. If we
were to accept respondent's position, of course, our holdingwould bind state courts, as well as military and federal
courts. Given the ongoing debate about polygraphs, I agreethe rule of exclusion is not so arbitrary or disproportionate
that it is unconstitutional.I doubt, though, that the rule of

per se exclusion is wise,and some later case might present a more compelling case

for introduction of the testimony than this one does.
Though the considerable discretion given to the trial courtin admitting or excluding scientific evidence is not a constitutional mandate, see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579, 587 (1993), there is some tension
between that rule and our holding today. And, as Justice
Stevens points out, there is much inconsistency between
the Government's extensive use of polygraphs to make vitalsecurity determinations and the argument it makes here,

stressing the inaccuracy of these tests.

With all respect, moreover, it seems the principal opinionoverreaches when it rests its holding on the additional

ground that the jury's role in making credibility determina-tions is diminished when it hears polygraph evidence. I am
in substantial agreement with Justice Stevens' observa-tion that the argument demeans and mistakes the role and

competence of jurors in deciding the factual question of guiltor innocence. Post, at 336-337. In the last analysis the

principal opinion says it is unwise to allow the jury to hear"a conclusion about the ultimate issue in the trial." Ante,
at 314. I had thought this tired argument had long sincebeen given its deserved repose as a categorical rule of exclusion. Rule 704(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states:"Except as provided in subdivision (b), testimony in the form
of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objec-tionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided
by the trier of fact." The Advisory Committee's Notes state:

"The older cases often contained strictures against al-lowing witnesses to express opinions upon ultimate issues, as a particular aspect of the rule against opinions.The rule was unduly restrictive, difficult of application,
and generally served only to deprive the trier of fact ofuseful information. 7 Wigmore $$ 1920, 1921; McCormick $ 12. The basis usually assigned for the rule, toprevent the witness from `usurping the province of

the jury,' is aptly characterized as `empty rhetoric.' 7Wigmore $ 1920, p. 17." Advisory Committee's Notes
on Fed. Rule Evid. 704, 28 U. S. C., p. 888.
The principal opinion is made less convincing by its con-tradicting the rationale of Rule 704 and the well considered

reasons the Advisory Committee recited in support of itsadoption.

The attempt to revive this outmoded theory is especiallyinapt in the context of the military justice system; for the
one narrow exception to the abolition of the ultimate issuerule still surviving in the Federal Rules of Evidence has been
omitted from the corresponding rule adopted for the military.The ultimate issue exception in the Federal Rules of Evidence is as follows:

"No expert witness testifying with respect to the mentalstate or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may

state an opinion or inference as to whether the defend-ant did or did not have the mental state or condition

constituting an element of the crime charged or of a de-fense thereto. Such ultimate issues are matters for the
trier of fact alone." Fed. Rule Evid. 704(b).
The drafting committee for the Military Rules of Evidencerenounced even this remnant. It said: "The statutory qualifications for military court members reduce the risk that mil-itary court members will be unduly influenced by the presentation of ultimate opinion testimony from psychiatricexperts." Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Analysis of the Military Rules of Evidence, App. 22, p. A22-48(1995 ed.). Any supposed need to protect the role of the
finder of fact is diminished even further by this specific ac-knowledgment that members of military courts are not likely
to give excessive weight to opinions of experts or otherwiseto be misled or confused by their testimony. Neither in the
federal system nor in the military courts, then, is it convinc-ing to say that polygraph test results should be excluded
because of some lingering concern about usurping the jury'sresponsibility to decide ultimate issues.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forcesheld that the President violated the Constitution in June

1991, when he promulgated Rule 707 of the Military Rulesof Evidence. Had I been a member of that court, I would
not have decided that question without first requiring theparties to brief and argue the antecedent question whether
Rule 707 violates Article 36(a) of the Uniform Code of Mili-tary Justice, 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a). As presently advised, I am

fense to a criminal charge and an unrealistic appraisal of theimportance of the governmental interests that undergird the

Rule. Before discussing the constitutional issue, I shallcomment briefly on the statutory question.

I
Rule 707 is a blanket rule of exclusion.1 No matter howreliable and how probative the results of a polygraph test

may be, Rule 707 categorically denies the defendant any op-portunity to persuade the court that the evidence should be
received for any purpose. Indeed, even if the parties stipulate in advance that the results of a lie detector test may beadmitted, the Rule requires exclusion.

The principal charge against the respondent in this case
was that he had knowingly used methamphetamine. His
principal defense was "innocent ingestion"; even if the urinalysis test conducted on April 7, 1992, correctly indicated
that he did ingest the substance, he claims to have been unaware of that fact. The results of the lie detector test conducted three days later, if accurate, constitute factual evidence that his physical condition at that time was consistent
with the theory of his defense and inconsistent with the theory of the prosecution. The results were also relevant because they tended to confirm the credibility of his testimony.
Under Rule 707, even if the results of the polygraph test
were more reliable than the results of the urinalysis, the
weaker evidence is admissible and the stronger evidence is
inadmissible.

Under the now discredited reasoning in a case decided
75 years ago, Frye v. United States, 54 App. D. C. 46, 293

1 Rule 707 states, in relevant part:
"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of a polygraph
examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an
offer to take, failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall
not be admitted into evidence." Mil. Rule Evid. 707(a).

F. 1013 (1923), that anomalous result would also have been
reached in nonmilitary cases tried in the federal courts. In
recent years, however, we have not only repudiated Frye's
general approach to scientific evidence, but the federal courts
have also been engaged in the process of rejecting the oncepopular view that all lie detector evidence should be categorically inadmissible.2 Well reasoned opinions are concluding,
consistently with this Court's decisions in Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993), and
General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136 (1997), that the
federal rules wisely allow district judges to exercise broad
discretion when evaluating the admissibility of scientific evidence.3 Those opinions correctly observe that the rules of
evidence generally recognized in the trial of civil and criminal cases in the federal courts do not contain any blanket
prohibition against the admissibility of polygraph evidence.

2 "There is no question that in recent years polygraph testing has gained
increasingly widespread acceptance as a useful and reliable scientific tool.
Because of the advances that have been achieved in the field which have
led to the greater use of polygraph examination, coupled with a lack of
evidence that juries are unduly swayed by polygraph evidence, we agree
with those courts which have found that a per se rule disallowing polygraph evidence is no longer warranted. . . . Thus, we believe the best
approach in this area is one which balances the need to admit all relevant
and reliable evidence against the danger that the admission of the evidence
for a given purpose will be unfairly prejudicial." United States v. Piccinonna, 885 F. 2d 1529, 1535 (CA11 1989). "[W]e do not now hold that
polygraph examinations are scientifically valid or that they will always
assist the trier of fact, in this or any other individual case. We merely
remove the obstacle of the per se rule against admissibility, which was
based on antiquated concepts about the technical ability of the polygraph
and legal precepts that have been expressly overruled by the Supreme
Court." United States v. Posado, 57 F. 3d 428, 434 (CA5 1995).

3 "The per se . . . rule excluding unstipulated polygraph evidence is inconsistent with the `flexible inquiry' assigned to the trial judge by Daubert. This is particularly evident because Frye, which was overruled by
Daubert, involved the admissibility of polygraph evidence." United
States v. Cordoba, 104 F. 3d 225, 227 (CA9 1997).

In accord with the modern trend of decisions on this ad-missibility issue, in 1987 the Court of Military Appeals held

that an accused was "entitled to attempt to lay" the founda-tion for admission of favorable polygraph evidence. United
States v. Gipson, 24 M. J. 246, 253 (1987). The Presidentresponded to

Gipson by adopting Rule 707. The governingstatute authorized him to promulgate evidentiary rules

"which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply theprinciples of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United Statesdistrict courts." 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a).

4 Thus, if there are

military concerns that warrant a special rule for military tri-bunals, the statute gives him ample authority to promulgate

special rules that take such concerns into account.Rule 707 has no counterpart in either the Federal Rules
of Evidence or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Moreover, to the extent that the use of the lie detector playsa special role in the military establishment, military practices are more favorable to a rule of admissibility than is theless structured use of lie detectors in the civilian sector of
our society. That is so because the military carefully regu-lates the administration of polygraph tests to ensure reliable
results. The military maintains "very stringent standardsfor polygraph examiners"

5 and has established its own Poly4 "Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for
cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military commissions and other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of inquiry,

considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence
generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States
district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this
chapter." 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a).

The stated reasons for the adoption of Rule 707 do not relyon any special military concern. They merely invoke three

interests: (1) the interest in excluding unreliable evidence;(2) the interest in protecting the trier of fact from being misled by an unwarranted assumption that the polygraph evi-dence has "an aura of near infallibility"; and (3) the interest
in avoiding collateral debates about the admissibility of par-ticular test results.

It seems clear that those interests pose less serious con-cerns in the military than in the civilian context. Disputes
about the qualifications of the examiners, the equipment, andthe testing procedures should seldom arise with respect to
the tests conducted by the military. Moreover, there surelyis no reason to assume that military personnel who perform
the factfinding function are less competent than ordinary ju-rors to assess the reliability of particular results, or their
relevance to the issues.8 Thus, there is no identifiable mili-tary concern that justifies the President's promulgation of a
special military rule that is more burdensome to the accusedin military trials than the evidentiary rules applicable to the
trial of civilians.It, therefore, seems fairly clear that Rule 707 does not
comply with the statute. I do not rest on this ground, how-ever, because briefing might persuade me to change my
views, and because the Court has decided only the constitu-tional question.

defense. It is not necessary to point to "any particular language in the Sixth Amendment," ante, at 307, to support the
conclusion that the right is firmly established. It is, however, appropriate to comment on the importance of that right
before discussing the three interests that the Government
relies upon to justify Rule 707.

The Sixth Amendment provides that "the accused shall
enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor." Because this right "is an essential
attribute of the adversary system itself," we have repeatedly
stated that few rights "are more fundamental than that of
an accused to present witnesses in his own defense." 9 According to Joseph Story, that provision was included in the
Bill of Rights in reaction to a notorious common-law rule
categorically excluding defense evidence in treason and felony cases.10 Our holding in Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S.
14 (1967), that this right is applicable to the States, rested
on the premises that it "is in plain terms the right to present
a defense" and that it "is a fundamental element of due proc9 "Few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present
witnesses in his own defense, see, e. g., Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S.
284, 302 (1973). Indeed, this right is an essential attribute of the adversary system itself. . . . The right to compel a witness' presence in the
courtroom could not protect the integrity of the adversary process if it did
not embrace the right to have the witness' testimony heard by the trier
of fact. The right to offer testimony is thus grounded in the Sixth
Amendment . . . ." Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 408-409 (1988).

10 "Joseph Story, in his famous Commentaries on the Constitution of the

United States, observed that the right to compulsory process was included
in the Bill of Rights in reaction to the notorious common-law rule that in
cases of treason or felony the accused was not allowed to introduce witnesses in his defense at all. Although the absolute prohibition of witnesses for the defense had been abolished in England by statute before
1787, the Framers of the Constitution felt it necessary specifically to provide that defendants in criminal cases should be provided the means of
obtaining witnesses so that their own evidence, as well as the prosecution's, might be evaluated by the jury." Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S.

ess of law." 11 Consistent with the history of the provision,
the Court in that case held that a state rule of evidence that
excluded "whole categories" of testimony on the basis of a
presumption of unreliability was unconstitutional.12

The blanket rule of inadmissibility held invalid in Washington v. Texas covered the testimony of alleged accomplices.
Both before and after that decision, the Court has recognized
the potential injustice produced by rules that exclude entire
categories of relevant evidence that is potentially unreliable.
At common law interested parties such as defendants,13 their
spouses,14 and their co-conspirators 15 were not competent

11 "The right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their
attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense,
the right to present the defendant's version of the facts as well as the
prosecution's to the jury so it may decide where the truth lies. Just as
an accused has the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses for the
purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to present his own
witnesses to establish a defense. This right is a fundamental element of
due process of law." Id., at 19.

12 "It is difficult to see how the Constitution is any less violated by arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying on the basis of a priori categories that presume them unworthy
of belief.

"The rule disqualifying an alleged accomplice from testifying on behalf
of the defendant cannot even be defended on the ground that it rationally
sets apart a group of persons who are particularly likely to commit perjury." Id., at 22.

13 "It is familiar knowledge that the old common law carefully excluded

from the witness stand parties to the record, and those who were interested in the result; and this rule extended to both civil and criminal cases.
Fear of perjury was the reason for the rule." Benson v. United States,
146 U. S. 325, 335 (1892).

14 "The common-law rule, accepted at an early date as controlling in this

country, was that husband and wife were incompetent as witnesses for or
against each other. . . .

"The Court recognized that the basic reason underlying th[e] exclusion [of
one spouse's testimony on behalf of the other] had been the practice of
disqualifying witnesses with a personal interest in the outcome of a case.
Widespread disqualifications because of interest, however, had long since

witnesses. "Nor were those named the only grounds of ex-clusion from the witness stand; conviction of crime, want of

religious belief, and other matters were held sufficient. In-deed, the theory of the common law was to admit to the witness stand only those presumably honest, appreciating the
sanctity of an oath, unaffected as a party by the result, andfree from any of the temptations of interest. The courts

were afraid to trust the intelligence of jurors." Benson v.
United States, 146 U. S. 325, 336 (1892). And, of course,
under the regime established by Frye v. United States, scien-tific evidence was inadmissible unless it met a stringent

"general acceptance" test. Over the years, with respect tocategory after category, strict rules of exclusion have been
replaced by rules that broaden the discretion of trial judges
to admit potentially unreliable evidence and to allow prop-erly instructed juries to evaluate its weight. While that

trend has included both rulemaking and nonconstitutional ju-dicial decisions, the direction of the trend has been consistent
and it has been manifested in constitutional holdings as well.Commenting on the trend that had followed the decision
in Benson, the Court in 1918 observed that in the

"years which have elapsed since the decision of the Benson Case, the disposition of courts and of legislative bodies to remove disabilities from witnesses has continued,
as that decision shows it had been going forward before,

modern trend which permitted interested witnesses to testify and left it
for the jury to assess their credibility. Certainly, since defendants were
uniformly allowed to testify in their own behalf, there was no longer a
good reason to prevent them from using their spouses as witnesses. With
the original reason for barring favorable testimony of spouses gone the
Court concluded that this aspect of the old rule should go too." Hawkins

truth is more likely to be arrived at by hearing the testimony of all persons of competent understanding who

the "defendant's right to present relevant evidence," ante, at308, must comply with the admonition in

Rock v. Arkansas,483 U. S. 44, 56 (1987), that they "may not be arbitrary or

disproportionate to the purposes they are designed toserve." Applying that admonition to Arkansas' blanket rule
prohibiting the admission of hypnotically refreshed testi-mony, we concluded that a "State's legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not extend to per se exclusionsthat may be reliable in an individual case."

bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central
to the defendant's claim of innocence. In the absence of any valid state
justification, exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor's case encounter and
`survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.' United States v.
Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984). See also Washington v. Texas, supra,

witnesses in his own defense. E. g., Webb v. Texas, 409 U. S. 95 (1972);
Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 19 (1967); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257
(1948). In the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the
State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt
and innocence. Although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to
the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of
evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed. The
testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of
trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest. That testimony also was critical to
Chambers' defense. In these circumstances, where constitutional rights
directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay

III
The constitutional requirement that a blanket exclusion ofpotentially unreliable evidence must be proportionate to the

purposes served by the rule obviously makes it necessary toevaluate the interests on both sides of the balance. Today
the Court all but ignores the strength of the defendant'sinterest in having polygraph evidence admitted in certain
cases. As the facts of this case illustrate, the Court is quitewrong in assuming that the impact of Rule 707 on respondent's defense was not significant because it did not precludethe introduction of any "factual evidence" or prevent him
from conveying "his version of the facts to the court-martialmembers." Ante, at 317. Under such reasoning, a rule
that excluded the testimony of alibi witnesses would not besignificant as long as the defendant is free to testify himself.
But given the defendant's strong interest in the outcome--an interest that was sufficient to make his testimony presumptively untrustworthy and therefore inadmissible atcommon law--his uncorroborated testimony is certain to be
less persuasive than that of a third-party witness. A rulethat bars him "from introducing expert opinion testimony to
bolster his own credibility," ibid., unquestionably impairsany "meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense";
indeed, it is sure to be outcome determinative in many cases.Moreover, in this case the results of the polygraph test,
taken just three days after the urinalysis, constitute inde-pendent factual evidence that is not otherwise available and
that strongly supports his defense of "innocent ingestion."Just as flight or other evidence of "consciousness of guilt"
may sometimes be relevant, on some occasions evidence of"consciousness of innocence" may also be relevant to the central issue at trial. Both the answers to the questions pro-pounded by the examiner, and the physical manifestations
produced by those utterances, were probative of an innocentstate of mind shortly after he ingested the drugs. In Dean
Wigmore's view, both "conduct" and "utterances" may con523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
332 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFER

Stevens, J., dissenting
stitute factual evidence of a "consciousness of innocence." 18
As the Second Circuit has held, when there is a serious factual dispute over the "basic defense [that defendant] was unaware of any criminal wrongdoing," evidence of his innocent
state of mind is "critical to a fair adjudication of criminal
charges." 19 The exclusion of the test results in this case
cannot be fairly equated with a ruling that merely prevented
the defendant from encumbering the record with cumulative
evidence. Because the Rule may well have affected the
outcome of the trial, it unquestionably "infringed upon a
weighty interest of the accused." Ante, at 308.

The question, then, is whether the three interests on which
the Government relies are powerful enough to support a categorical rule excluding the results of all polygraph tests no
matter how unfair such a rule may be in particular cases.

18 "Moreover, there are other principles by which a defendant may occasionally avail himself of conduct as evidence in his favor--in particular, of
conduct indicating consciousness of innocence, . . . of utterances asserting
his innocence . . . , and, in sedition charges, of conduct indicating a loyal
state of mind . . . ." 1A J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 56.1, p. 1180 (Tillers rev.
ed. 1983); see United States v. Reifsteck, 841 F. 2d 701, 705 (CA6 1988).

19 "Mariotta's basic defense was that he was unaware of any criminal

wrongdoing at Wedtech, that he was an innocent victim of the machinations of the sophisticated businessmen whom he had brought into the company to handle its financial affairs. That defense was seriously in issue
as to most of the charges against him, drawing considerable support from
the evidence. . . .

"With the credibility of the accusations about Mariotta's knowledge of
wrongdoing seriously challenged, evidence of his denial of such knowledge
in response to an opportunity to obtain immunity by admitting it and implicating others became highly significant to a fair presentation of his
defense. . . .

"Where evidence of a defendant's innocent state of mind, critical to a
fair adjudication of criminal charges, is excluded, we have not hesitated to
order a new trial." United States v. Biaggi, 909 F. 2d 662, 691-692 (CA2

Reliability

There are a host of studies that place the reliability of
polygraph tests at 85% to 90%.20 While critics of the polygraph argue that accuracy is much lower, even the studies
cited by the critics place polygraph accuracy at 70%.21
Moreover, to the extent that the polygraph errs, studies have
repeatedly shown that the polygraph is more likely to find
innocent people guilty than vice versa.22 Thus, exculpatory
polygraphs--like the one in this case--are likely to be more
reliable than inculpatory ones.

Of course, within the broad category of lie detector evidence, there may be a wide variation in both the validity and
the relevance 23 of particular test results. Questions about
the examiner's integrity, independence, choice of questions,
or training in the detection of deliberate attempts to provoke

specific evidence. But such questions are properly ad-dressed in adversary proceedings; they fall far short of justifying a blanket exclusion of this type of expert testimony.There is no legal requirement that expert testimony must
satisfy a particular degree of reliability to be admissible.Expert testimony about a defendant's "future dangerousness" to determine his eligibility for the death penalty, evenif wrong "most of the time," is routinely admitted.

Barefootv. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 898-901 (1983). Studies indicate

that handwriting analysis, and even fingerprint identifica-tions, may be less trustworthy than polygraph evidence in
certain cases.24 And, of course, even highly dubious eyewit24 One study compared the accuracy of fingerprinting, handwriting analysis, polygraph tests, and eyewitness identification. The study consisted
of 80 volunteers divided into 20 groups of 4. Fingerprints and handwriting samples were taken from all of the participants.

In each group of four, one person was randomly assigned the role of
"perpetrator." The perpetrator was instructed to take an envelope to a
building doorkeeper (who knew that he would later need to identify the
perpetrator), sign a receipt, and pick up a package. After the "crime,"
all participants were given a polygraph examination.

The fingerprinting expert (comparing the original fingerprints with
those on the envelope), the handwriting expert (comparing the original
samples with the signed receipt), and the polygrapher (analyzing the
tests) sought to identify the perpetrator of each group. In addition, two
days after the "crime," the doorkeeper was asked to pick the picture of
the perpetrator out of a set of four pictures.

The results of the study demonstrate that polygraph evidence compares
favorably with other types of evidence. Excluding "inconclusive" results
from each test, the fingerprinting expert resolved 100% of the cases correctly, the polygrapher resolved 95% of the cases correctly, the handwriting expert resolved 94% of the cases correctly, and the eyewitness resolved only 64% of the cases correctly. Interestingly, when "inconclusive"
results were included, the polygraph test was more accurate than any of
the other methods: The polygrapher resolved 90% of the cases correctly,
compared with 85% for the handwriting expert, 35% for the eyewitness,
and 20% for the fingerprinting expert. Widacki & Horvath, An Experimental Investigation of the Relative Validity and Utility of the Polygraph
Technique and Three Other Common Methods of Criminal Identification,

ness testimony is, and should be, admitted and tested in thecrucible of cross-examination. The Court's reliance on potential unreliability as a justification for a categorical rule ofinadmissibility reveals that it is "overly pessimistic about the
capabilities of the jury and of the adversary system gener-ally. Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof arethe traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but
admissible evidence." Daubert, 509 U. S., at 596.25

25 The Government argues that there is a widespread danger that people
will learn to "fool" the polygraph, and that this possibility undermines any
claim of reliability. For example, the Government points to the availability of a book called Beat the Box: The Insider's Guide to Outwitting the
Lie Detector. Tr. of Oral Arg. 53; Brief for United States 25, n. 10. Beat
the Box, however, actually cuts against a per se ban on polygraph evidence. As the preface to the book states:

"Dr. Kalashnikov [the author] is a polygraph professional. If you go up
against him, or someone like him, he'll probably catch you at your game.
That's because he knows his work and does it by the book.

"What most people don't realize is that there are a lot of not so professional polygraph examiners out there. It's very possible that you may be
tested by someone who is more concerned about the number of tests he
will run this week (and his Christmas bonus) than he is about the precision
of each individual test.. . . . .

"Remember, the adage is that you can't beat the polygraph system but
you can beat the operator. This book is gleefully dedicated to the idea of
a sporting chance." V. Kalashnikov, Beat the Box: The Insider's Guide to
Outwitting the Lie Detector (1983) (preface); id., at 9 ("[W]hile the system
is all but unbeatable, you can surely beat the examiner").

Thus, Beat the Box actually supports the notion that polygraphs are reliable when conducted by a highly trained examiner--like the one in this
case.

Nonetheless, some research has indicated that people can be trained to
use "countermeasures" to fool the polygraph. See, e. g., Honts, Raskin, &
Kircher, Mental and Physical Countermeasures Reduce the Accuracy of
Polygraph Tests, 79 J. Applied Psychology 252 (1994). This possibility,
however, does not justify a per se ban. First, research indicates that individuals must receive specific training before they can fool the polygraph
(i. e., information alone is not enough). Honts, Hodes, & Raskin, Effects

The Role of the Jury

It is the function of the jury to make credibility determi-nations. In my judgment evidence that tends to establish

either a consciousness of guilt or a consciousness of inno-cence may be of assistance to the jury in making such determinations. That also was the opinion of Dean Wigmore:

"Let the accused's whole conduct come in; and whetherit tells for consciousness of guilt or for consciousness of

innocence, let us take it for what it is worth, remember-ing that in either case it is open to varying explanations
and is not to be emphasized. Let us not deprive an in-nocent person, falsely accused, of the inference which
common sense draws from a consciousness of innocenceand its natural manifestations." 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 293, p. 232 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1979).
There is, of course, some risk that some "juries will giveexcessive weight to the opinions of a polygrapher, clothed as

they are in scientific expertise," ante, at 313-314. In myjudgment, however, it is much more likely that juries will be
guided by the instructions of the trial judge concerning thecredibility of expert as well as lay witnesses. The strong
presumption that juries will follow the court's instructions,see,

e. g., Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 211 (1987), ap-plies to exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence. Comof Physical Countermeasures on the Physiological Detection of Deception,
70 J. Applied Psychology 177, 185 (1985); see also Honts, Raskin, Kircher, & Hodes, Effects of Spontaneous Countermeasures on the Physiological Detection of Deception, 16 J. Police Science and Administration 91, 93
(1988) (spontaneous countermeasures ineffective). Second, as countermeasures are discovered, it is fair to assume that polygraphers will develop ways to detect these countermeasures. See, e. g., Abrams & Davidson, Counter-Countermeasures in Polygraph Testing, 17 Polygraph 16,
17-19 (1988); Raskin, Honts, & Kircher, The Case for Polygraph Tests, in
Faigman 577-578. Of course, in any trial, jurors would be instructed on
the possibility of countermeasures and could give this possibility its appropriate weight.

mon sense suggests that the testimony of disinterested third
parties that is relevant to the jury's credibility determination
will assist rather than impair the jury's deliberations. As
with the reliance on the potential unreliability of this type
of evidence, the reliance on a fear that the average jury is
not able to assess the weight of this testimony reflects a distressing lack of confidence in the intelligence of the average
American.26

Collateral Litigation

The potential burden of collateral proceedings to determine the examiner's qualifications is a manifestly insufficient

justification for a categorical exclusion of expert testimony.
Such proceedings are a routine predicate for the admission of
any expert testimony, and may always give rise to searching
cross-examination. If testimony that is critical to a fair determination of guilt or innocence could be excluded for that
reason, the right to a meaningful opportunity to present a
defense would be an illusion.

It is incongruous for the party that selected the examiner,
the equipment, the testing procedures, and the questions
asked of the defendant to complain about the examinee's burden of proving that the test was properly conducted. While
there may well be a need for substantial collateral proceedings when the party objecting to admissibility has a basis for
questioning some aspect of the examination, it seems quite
obvious that the Government is in no position to challenge

26 Indeed, research indicates that jurors do not "blindly" accept polygraph evidence, but that they instead weigh polygraph evidence along
with other evidence. Cavoukian & Heslegrave, The Admissibility of Polygraph Evidence in Court: Some Empirical Findings, 4 Law and Human
Behavior 117, 123, 127-128, 130 (1980) (hereinafter Cavoukian & Heslegrave); see also Honts & Perry 366-367. One study found that expert
testimony about the limits of the polygraph "completely eliminated the
effect of the polygraph evidence" on the jury. Cavoukian & Heslegrave
128-129 (emphasis added).

Stevens, J., dissenting
the competence of the procedures that it has developed andrelied upon in hundreds of thousands of cases.

In all events the concern about the burden of collateraldebates about the integrity of a particular examination, or
the competence of a particular examiner, provides no supportfor a categorical rule that requires exclusion even when the
test is taken pursuant to a stipulation and even when therehas been a stipulation resolving all potential collateral issues.
Indeed, in this very case there would have been no need forany collateral proceedings because respondent did not question the qualifications of the expert who examined him, andsurely the Government is in no position to argue that one
who has successfully completed its carefully developed train-ing program

27 is unqualified. The interest in avoiding burdensome collateral proceedings might support a rule pre-scribing minimum standards that must be met before any

test is admissible,28 but it surely does not support the blun-derbuss at issue.

29

IV
The Government's concerns would unquestionably supportthe exclusion of polygraph evidence in particular cases, and

may well be sufficient to support a narrower rule designedto respond to specific concerns. In my judgment, however,

27 See n. 5, supra.
28 See N. M. Rule Evid. $ 11-707.
29 It has been suggested that if exculpatory polygraph evidence may be

adduced by the defendant, the prosecutor should also be allowed to introduce inculpatory test results. That conclusion would not be dictated by a
holding that vindicates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to summon
witnesses. Moreover, as noted above, studies indicate that exculpatory
polygraphs are more reliable than inculpatory ones. See n. 22, supra. In
any event, a concern about possible future legal developments is surely
not implicated by the narrow issue presented by the holding of the Court
of Appeals for the Armed Forces in this case. Even if it were, I can see
nothing fundamentally unfair about permitting the results of a test taken
pursuant to stipulation being admitted into evidence to prove consciousness of guilt as well as consciousness of innocence.

those concerns are plainly insufficient to support a categori-cal rule that prohibits the admission of polygraph evidence

in all cases, no matter how reliable or probative the evidencemay be. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

FELTNER v. COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION,

INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1768. Argued January 21, 1998--Decided March 31, 1998
Respondent Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., terminated agreements licensing several television series to three television stations owned by
petitioner Feltner after the stations' royalty payments became delinquent. When the stations continued to broadcast the programs, Columbia sued Feltner and others for, inter alia, copyright infringement. Columbia won partial summary judgment as to liability on its copyright
infringement claims and then exercised the option afforded by $ 504(c)
of the Copyright Act of 1976 (Act) to recover statutory damages in lieu
of actual damages. The District Court denied Feltner's request for a
jury trial, and awarded Columbia statutory damages following a bench
trial. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that neither $ 504(c) nor the
Seventh Amendment provides a right to a jury trial on statutory
damages.

Held:

1. There is no statutory right to a jury trial when a copyright owner
elects to recover statutory damages. Section 504(c) makes no mention
of a right to a jury trial or to juries at all, providing instead that damages should be assessed in an amount "the court deems just," and that
in the event that "the court finds" an infringement that is willful or
innocent, "the court in its discretion" may increase or decrease the statutory damages. The word "court" in this context appears to mean
judge, not jury. Other remedies provisions in the Act use the term
"court" in contexts generally thought to confer authority on a judge,
and the Act does not use the term "court" when addressing awards of
actual damages and profits, see $ 504(b), which generally are thought to
constitute legal relief, Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469, 477.
Feltner's reliance on Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 585, for a contrary
interpretation is misplaced. There being no statutory right to a jury
trial on statutory damages, the constitutional question must be addressed. See Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412, 417. Pp. 345-347.

2. The Seventh Amendment provides a right to a jury trial on all
issues pertinent to an award of statutory damages under $ 504(c), including the amount itself. Pp. 347-355.

Syllabus
(a) The Seventh Amendment applies to both common-law causes of
action and to statutory actions more analogous to cases tried in 18thcentury courts of law than to suits customarily tried in courts of equity
or admiralty. Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 42. To
determine the proper analogue, this Court examines both the nature of
the statutory action and the remedy sought. See ibid. Pp. 347-348.

(b) There are close 18th-century analogues to $ 504(c) statutory
damages actions. Before the adoption of the Seventh Amendment, the
common law and statutes in England and this country granted copyright
owners causes of action for infringement. More importantly, copyright
suits for monetary damages were tried in courts of law, and thus before
juries. There is no evidence that the first federal copyright law, the
Copyright Act of 1790, changed this practice; and damages actions under
the Copyright Act of 1831 were consistently tried before juries. The
Court is unpersuaded by Columbia's contention that, despite this undisputed historical evidence, statutory damages are clearly equitable in
nature. Pp. 348-353.

(c) The right to a jury trial includes the right to have a jury determine the amount of statutory damages, if any, awarded to the copyright
owner. There is overwhelming evidence that the consistent commonlaw practice was for juries to award damages. More specifically, this
was the consistent practice in copyright cases. Tull v. United States,
supra--in which this Court determined that, although the Seventh
Amendment grants a right to a jury trial on liability for civil penalties
under the Clean Water Act, Congress could constitutionally authorize
trial judges to assess the amount of the civil penalties--is inapposite to
this case. In Tull, there was no evidence that juries historically had
determined the amount of civil penalties to be paid to the Government,
and the awarding of such penalties could be viewed as analogous to
sentencing in a criminal proceeding. Here there is no similar analogy,
and there is clear and direct historical evidence that juries, both as a
general matter and in copyright cases, set the amount of damages
awarded to a successful plaintiff. Pp. 353-355.

Opinion of the Court
Henry J. Tashman argued the cause for respondent.With him on the brief was Gregory J. Kopta.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act of 1976 permits a copy-right owner "to recover, instead of actual damages and

profits, an award of statutory damages . . . , in a sum of notless than $500 or more than $20,000 as the court considers
just." 90 Stat. 2585, as amended, 17 U. S. C. $ 504(c)(1). Inthis case, we consider whether $ 504(c) or the Seventh
Amendment grants a right to a jury trial when a copyrightowner elects to recover statutory damages. We hold that
although the statute is silent on the point, the SeventhAmendment provides a right to a jury trial, which includes
a right to a jury determination of the amount of statutorydamages. We therefore reverse.

cense agreements in October 1991. Despite Columbia's ter-mination, the stations continued broadcasting the programs.

Columbia sued Feltner, Krypton, the stations, variousKrypton subsidiaries, and certain Krypton officers in Federal
District Court alleging, inter alia, copyright infringementarising from the stations' unauthorized broadcasting of the
programs. Columbia sought various forms of relief underthe Copyright Act of 1976 (Copyright Act), 17 U. S. C. $ 101
et seq., including a permanent injunction, $ 502; impoundmentof all copies of the programs, $ 503; actual damages or, in the
alternative, statutory damages, $ 504; and costs and attor-ney's fees, $ 505. On Columbia's motion, the District Court
entered partial summary judgment as to liability for Colum-bia on its copyright infringement claims.

Columbia exercised the option afforded by $ 504(c) of theCopyright Act to recover "Statutory Damages" in lieu of

actual damages. In relevant part, $ 504(c) provides:

"Statutory Damages--"(1) Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the copyright owner may elect, at any time beforefinal judgment is rendered, to recover, instead of actual
damages and profits, an award of statutory damages forall infringements involved in the action, with respect to
any one work, . . . in a sum of not less than $500 or more
than $20,000 as the court considers just. . . ."(2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the

burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringementwas committed willfully, the court in its discretion may
increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of
not more than $100,000. In a case where the infringersustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that

such infringer was not aware and had no reason to be-lieve that his or her acts constituted an infringement of

$200. . . ." 17 U. S. C. $ 504(c).
The District Court denied Feltner's request for a jury trialon statutory damages, ruling instead that such issues would

be determined at a bench trial. After two days of trial, thetrial judge held that each episode of each series constituted
a separate work and that the airing of the same episode bydifferent stations controlled by Feltner constituted separate
violations; accordingly, the trial judge determined that therehad been a total of 440 acts of infringement. The trial judge
further found that Feltner's infringement was willful andfixed statutory damages at $20,000 per act of infringement.
Applying that amount to the number of acts of infringement,the trial judge determined that Columbia was entitled to
$8,800,000 in statutory damages, plus costs and attorney'sfees.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in allrelevant respects.

Most importantly for present purposes, the court rejectedFeltner's argument that he was entitled to have a jury determine statutory damages. Relying on Sid & Marty Krofft
Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., 562 F. 2d1157 (CA9 1977)--which held that $ 25(b) of the Copyright

just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow
the amounts as hereinafter stated, but in the case of a newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph[,] such damages shall not exceed the

Opinion of the Court
Appeals held that $ 504(c) does not grant a right to a jurydetermination of statutory damages. The court reasoned

that "[i]f Congress intended to overrule Krofft by having thejury determine the proper award of statutory damages, it
would have altered" the language "as the court considersjust" in $ 504(c). 106 F. 3d, at 293. The Court of Appeals
further concluded that the "Seventh Amendment does notprovide a right to a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages because an award of such damages is equitable in na-ture."

Ibid. We granted certiorari. 521 U. S. 1151 (1997).

Before inquiring into the applicability of the SeventhAmendment, we must " `first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitu-tional] question may be avoided.' " Tull v. United States,
481 U. S. 412, 417, n. 3 (1987) (quoting Curtis v. Loether, 415U. S. 189, 192, n. 6 (1974)). Such a construction is not possible here, for we cannot discern "any congressional intent togrant . . . the right to a jury trial," 481 U. S., at 417, n. 3, on
an award of statutory damages.4The language of $ 504(c) does not grant a right to have a
jury assess statutory damages. Statutory damages are tobe assessed in an amount that "the court considers just."

$ 504(c)(1). Further, in the event that "the court finds" theinfringement was willful or innocent, "the court in its discretion" may, within limits, increase or decrease the amount of
no other case exceed the sum of [$5,000] nor be less than the sum of [$250]
. . ." Act of Mar. 4, 1909, $ 25(b), 35 Stat. 1081 (later amended and codified
at 17 U. S. C. $ 101(b)).

4 The Courts of Appeals have unanimously held that $ 504(c) is not susceptible of an interpretation that would avoid the Seventh Amendment
question. See, e. g., Cass County Music Co. v. C. H. L. R., Inc., 88 F. 3d

Opinion of the Court
statutory damages. $ 504(c)(2). These phrases, like the entire statutory provision, make no mention of a right to a jury
trial or, for that matter, to juries at all.

The word "court" in this context appears to mean judge,
not jury. Cf. F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts,
Inc., 344 U. S. 228, 232 (1952) (referring to the "judicial discretion" necessary for "the court's choice between a computed measure of damage and that imputed by" the Copyright Act of 1909 (emphasis added)). In fact, the other
remedies provisions of the Copyright Act use the term
"court" in contexts generally thought to confer authority on
a judge, rather than a jury. See, e. g., $ 502 ("court . . . may
. . . grant temporary and final injunctions"); $ 503(a) ("[T]he
court may order the impounding . . . of all copies or phonorecords"); $ 503(b) ("As part of a final judgment or decree, the
court may order the destruction or other reasonable disposition of all copies or phonorecords"); $ 505 ("[T]he court in its
discretion may allow the recovery of full costs" of litigation,
and "the court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee").
In contrast, the Copyright Act does not use the term "court"
in the subsection addressing awards of actual damages and

Opinion of the Court
Feltner relies on Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 585(1978), in which we held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, 29 U. S. C. $ 621et seq., provides a statutory right to a jury trial in an action
for unpaid wages even though the statute authorizes "thecourt . . . to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be
appropriate," $ 626(b). That holding, however, turned ontwo crucial factors: The ADEA's remedial provisions were
expressly to be enforced in accordance with the Fair LaborStandards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 101

et seq.,which had been uniformly interpreted to provide a right to

a jury trial, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 580-581; and thestatute used the word "legal," which we found to be a "term
of art" used in cases "in which legal relief is available andlegal rights are determined" by juries,

id., at 583. Section504(c), in contrast, does not make explicit reference to another statute that has been uniformly interpreted to providea right to jury trial and does not use the word "legal" or
other language denoting legal relief or rights.5We thus discern no statutory right to a jury trial when a
copyright owner elects to recover statutory damages. Ac-cordingly, we must reach the constitutional question.

The Seventh Amendment provides that "[i]n Suits at com-mon law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty

dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . ."U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. Since Justice Story's time, the Court

5 In addition, a copyright plaintiff may elect statutory damages "at any
time before final judgment is rendered." $ 504(c)(1). The parties agree,
and we have found no indication to the contrary, that election may occur
even after a jury has returned a verdict on liability and an award of actual
damages. It is at least unlikely that Congress intended that a jury, having already made a determination of actual damages, should be reconvened
to make a determination of statutory damages.

has understood "Suits at common law" to refer "not merely
[to] suits, which the common law recognized among its old
and settled proceedings, but [to] suits in which legal rights
were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those where equitable rights alone were recognized,
and equitable remedies were administered." Parsons v.
Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 447 (1830) (emphasis in original). The
Seventh Amendment thus applies not only to common-law
causes of action, but also to "actions brought to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to common-law causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th
century, as opposed to those customarily heard by courts of
equity or admiralty." Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg,
492 U. S. 33, 42 (1989) (citing Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S.,
at 193). To determine whether a statutory action is more
analogous to cases tried in courts of law than to suits tried
in courts of equity or admiralty, we examine both the nature
of the statutory action and the remedy sought. See 492
U. S., at 42.

Unlike many of our recent Seventh Amendment cases,
which have involved modern statutory rights unknown to
18th-century England, see, e. g., Wooddell v. Electrical
Workers, 502 U. S. 93 (1991) (alleged violations of union's
duties under Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959);
Granfinanciera v. Nordberg, supra (action to rescind fraudulent preference under Bankruptcy Act); Tull v. United
States, 481 U. S. 412 (1987) (Government's claim for civil penalties under Clean Water Act); Curtis v. Loether, supra
(claim under Title VIII of Civil Rights Act of 1968), in this
case there are close analogues to actions seeking statutory
damages under $ 504(c). Before the adoption of the Seventh
Amendment, the common law and statutes in England and
this country granted copyright owners causes of action for
infringement. More importantly, copyright suits for mone523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tary damages were tried in courts of law, and thus before
juries.

By the middle of the 17th century, the common law recognized an author's right to prevent the unauthorized publication of his manuscript. See, e. g., Stationers Co. v. Patentees, Carter's Rep. 89, 124 Eng. Rep. 842 (C. P. 1666). This
protection derived from the principle that the manuscript
was the product of intellectual labor and was as much the
author's property as the material on which it was written.
See Millar v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2303, 2398, 98 Eng. Rep. 201,
252 (K. B. 1769) (opinion of Mansfield, C. J.) (common-law
copyright derived from principle that "it is just, that an Author should reap the pecuniary Profits of his own ingenuity and Labour"); 1 W. Patry, Copyright Law and Practice
3 (1994). Actions seeking damages for infringement of
common-law copyright, like actions seeking damages for invasions of other property rights, were tried in courts of law
in actions on the case. See Millar v. Taylor, supra, at 2396-
2397, 98 Eng. Rep., at 251. Actions on the case, like other
actions at law, were tried before juries. See McClenachan
v. McCarty, 1 Dall. 375, 378 (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1788); 5 J.
Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ||38.11[5] (2d ed. 1996); 1
J. Chitty, Treatise on Pleading and Parties to Actions 164
(1892).

In 1710, the first English copyright statute, the Statute of
Anne, was enacted to protect published books. 8 Anne ch.
19 (1710). Under the Statute of Anne, damages for infringement were set at "one Penny for every Sheet which shall be
found in [the infringer's] custody, either printed or printing,
published, or exposed to Sale," half ("one Moiety") to go to
the Crown and half to the copyright owner, and were "to be
recovered . . . by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information."

$ 1. Like the earlier practice with regard to common-law
copyright claims for damages, actions seeking damages
under the Statute of Anne were tried in courts of law. See

Beckford v. Hood, 7 T. R. 621, 627, 101 Eng. Rep. 1164, 1167
(K. B. 1798) (opinion of Kenyon, C. J.) ("[T]he statute having
vested that right in the author, the common law gives the
remedy by action on the case for the violation of it").

The practice of trying copyright damages actions at law
before juries was followed in this country, where statutory
copyright protections were enacted even before adoption of
the Constitution. In 1783, the Continental Congress passed
a resolution recommending that the States secure copyright
protections for authors. See U. S. Copyright Office, Copyright Enactments: Laws Passed in the United States Since
1783 Relating to Copyright, Bulletin No. 3, p. 1 (rev. ed. 1963)
(hereinafter Copyright Enactments). Twelve States (all except Delaware) responded by enacting copyright statutes,
each of which provided a cause of action for damages, and
none of which made any reference to equity jurisdiction. At
least three of these state statutes expressly stated that damages were to be recovered through actions at law, see id., at
2 (in Connecticut, damages for double the value of the infringed copy "to be recovered . . . in any court of law in this
State"); id., at 17 (in Georgia, similar damages enforceable
"in due course of law"); id., at 19 (in New York, similar damages enforceable in "any court of law"), while four others
provided that damages would be recovered in an "action of
debt," a prototypical action brought in a court of law before
a jury. See F. Maitland, Forms of Action at Common Law
357 (1929) (hereinafter Maitland); see Copyright Enactments
4-9 (in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island,
damages enforceable by "action of debt"); id., at 12 (in South
Carolina, damages of one shilling per sheet enforceable by
"debt, bill, plaint or information"). Although these statutes
were short-lived, and hence few courts had occasion to interpret them, the available evidence suggests that the practice
was for copyright actions seeking damages to be tried to a
jury. See Hudson & Goodwin v. Patten, 1 Root 133, 134

Opinion of the Court
(Conn. Super. Ct. 1789) ( jury awarded copyright owner #100under Connecticut copyright statute).

Moreover, three of the state statutes specifically author-ized an award of damages from a statutory range, just as

$ 504(c) does today. See Copyright Enactments 4 (in Massachusetts, damages of not less than #5 and not more than#3,000);

id., at 8 (in New Hampshire, damages of not less
than #5 and not more than #1,000); id., at 9 (in Rhode Island,damages of not less than #5 and not more than #3,000). Although we have found no direct evidence of the practiceunder these statutes, there is no reason to suppose that such
actions were intended to deviate from the traditional practice: The damages were to be recovered by an "action of
debt," see id., at 4-9, which was an action at law, see Maitland 357.

In 1790, Congress passed the first federal copyright statute, the Copyright Act of 1790, which similarly authorized
the awarding of damages for copyright infringements. Act
of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, $$ 2, 6, 1 Stat. 124, 125. The Copyright Act of 1790 provided that damages for copyright infringement of published works would be "the sum of fifty
cents for every sheet which shall be found in [the infringer's]
possession, . . . to be recovered by action of debt in any court
of record in the United States, wherein the same is cognizable." $ 2. Like the Statute of Anne, the Copyright Act of
1790 provided that half ("one moiety") of such damages were
to go to the copyright owner and half to the United States.
For infringement of an unpublished manuscript, the statute
entitled a copyright owner to "all damages occasioned by
such injury, to be recovered by a special action on the case
founded upon this act, in any court having cognizance
thereof." $ 6.

There is no evidence that the Copyright Act of 1790
changed the practice of trying copyright actions for damages
in courts of law before juries. As we have noted, actions on
the case and actions of debt were actions at law for which a

Opinion of the Court
jury was required. See supra, at 349, 350.6 Moreover, actions to recover damages under the Copyright Act of 1831--
which differed from the Copyright Act of 1790 only in the
amount (increased to $1 from 50 cents) authorized to be recovered for certain infringing sheets--were consistently
tried to juries. See, e. g., Backus v. Gould, 7 How. 798, 802
(1849) ( jury awarded damages of $2,069.75); Reed v. Carusi,
20 F. Cas. 431, 432 (No. 11,642) (CC Md. 1845) ( jury awarded
damages of $200); Millett v. Snowden, 17 F. Cas. 374, 375
(No. 9,600) (SDNY 1844) ( jury awarded damages of $625);
Dwight v. Appleton, 8 F. Cas. 183, 185 (No. 4,215) (SDNY
1843) ( jury awarded damages of $2,000).

Columbia does not dispute this historical evidence. In
fact, Columbia makes no attempt to draw an analogy between an action for statutory damages under $ 504(c) and any
historical cause of action--including those actions for monetary relief that we have characterized as equitable, such as
actions for disgorgement of improper profits. See Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 570-571 (1990); Tull v. United
States, 481 U. S., at 424. Rather, Columbia merely contends
that statutory damages are clearly equitable in nature.

We are not persuaded. We have recognized the "general
rule" that monetary relief is legal, Teamsters v. Terry, supra,
at 570, and an award of statutory damages may serve purposes traditionally associated with legal relief, such as compensation and punishment. See Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S.,
at 196 (actual damages are "traditional form of relief offered
in the courts of law"); Tull v. United States, 481 U. S., at 422

6 The Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide for equitable remedies at
all, and in Stevens v. Gladding, 17 How. 447 (1855), we held that, even
after Congress had provided for equity jurisdiction under the Copyright
Act, see Act of Feb. 15, 1819, ch. 19, 3 Stat. 481, the statute's damages
provision could not be enforced through a suit in equity. 17 How., at 455;
see also Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617, 663 (1888) (Stevens v. Gladding
determined that "the penalties given by $ 7 of the copyright act of 1831
cannot be enforced in a suit in equity").

Opinion of the Court
("Remedies intended to punish culpable individuals . . . wereissued by courts of law, not courts of equity"). Nor, as we

have previously stated, is a monetary remedy rendered equi-table simply because it is "not fixed or readily calculable
from a fixed formula." Id., at 422, n. 7. And there is historical evidence that cases involving discretionary monetary re-lief were tried before juries. See,

e. g., Coryell v. Colbaugh,
1 N. J. L. 77 (1791) ( jury award of "exemplary damages" inan action on a promise of marriage). Accordingly, we must

conclude that the Seventh Amendment provides a right to ajury trial where the copyright owner elects to recover statutory damages.

The right to a jury trial includes the right to have a jury
determine the amount of statutory damages, if any, awarded
to the copyright owner. It has long been recognized that
"by the law the jury are judges of the damages." Lord
Townshend v. Hughes, 2 Mod. 150, 151, 86 Eng. Rep. 994,
994-995 (C. P. 1677). Thus in Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S.
474 (1935), the Court stated that "the common law rule as it
existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution" was
that "in cases where the amount of damages was uncertain[,]
their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury that the Court should not alter it." Id., at
480 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). And
there is overwhelming evidence that the consistent practice
at common law was for juries to award damages. See, e. g.,
Duke of York v. Pilkington, 2 Show. 246, 89 Eng. Rep. 918
(K. B. 1760) ( jury award of #100,000 in a slander action);
Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 19, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 499 (C. P. 1763)
( jury award of #1,000 in an action of trespass); Huckle v.
Money, 2 Wils. 205, 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (C. P. 1763) (upholding
jury award of #300 in an action for trespass, assault and imprisonment); Genay v. Norris, 1 S. C. L. 6, 7 (1784) ( jury
award of #400); Coryell v. Colbaugh, supra (sustaining correctness of jury award of exemplary damages in an action on
a promise of marriage); see also K. Redden, Punitive Dam523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ages $ 2.2, p. 27 (1980) (describing "primacy of the jury in theawarding of damages").

More specifically, this was the consistent practice in copy-right cases. In

Hudson & Goodwin v. Patten, 1 Root, at
134, for example, a jury awarded a copyright owner #100
under the Connecticut copyright statute, which permitteddamages in an amount double the value of the infringed copy.

In addition, juries assessed the amount of damages under theCopyright Act of 1831, even though that statute, like the
Copyright Act of 1790, fixed damages at a set amount perinfringing sheet. See

Backus v. Gould, supra, at 802 ( jury
awarded damages of $2,069.75); Reed v. Carusi, supra, at 432(same, but $200);

Dwight v. Appleton, supra, at 185 (same,
but $2,000); Millett v. Snowden, supra, at 375 (same, but
$625).Relying on

Tull v. United States, supra, Columbia contends that the Seventh Amendment does not provide a rightto a jury determination of the amount of the award. In

Tull, we held that the Seventh Amendment grants a right toa jury trial on all issues relating to liability for civil penalties
under the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. $$ 1251, 1319(d),7 see481 U. S., at 425, but then went on to decide that Congress
could constitutionally authorize trial judges to assess theamount of the civil penalties, see

id., at 426-427.8 According
to Columbia, Tull demonstrates that a jury determination ofthe amount of statutory damages is not necessary "to preserve `the substance of the common-law right of trial by
jury.' " Id., at 426 (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149,
157 (1973)).

7 Section 1319(d) of the Clean Water Act provided that violators of certain sections of the Act "shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
$10,000 per day" during the period of the violation. 481 U. S., at 414.

8 This portion of our opinion was arguably dicta, for our holding that

there was a right to a jury trial on issues relating to liability required us
to reverse the lower court's liability determination.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
In Tull, however, we were presented with no evidence thatjuries historically had determined the amount of civil penalties to be paid to the Government.9 Moreover, the awardingof civil penalties to the Government could be viewed as analogous to sentencing in a criminal proceeding. See 481 U. S.,at 428 (S

calia, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart).
10 Here, of course, there is no similar analogy, and

there is clear and direct historical evidence that juries, bothas a general matter and in copyright cases, set the amount

of damages awarded to a successful plaintiff. Tull is thusinapposite. As a result, if a party so demands, a jury must
determine the actual amount of statutory damages under$ 504(c) in order "to preserve `the substance of the commonlaw right of trial by jury.' " Id., at 426.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the SeventhAmendment provides a right to a jury trial on all issues pertinent to an award of statutory damages under $ 504(c) of theCopyright Act, including the amount itself. The judgment
below is reversed, and we remand the case for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
It is often enough that we must hold an enactment of Con-gress to be unconstitutional. I see no reason to do so here--

9 It should be noted that Tull is at least in tension with Bank of Hamilton v. Lessee of Dudley, 2 Pet. 492 (1829), in which the Court held in light
of the Seventh Amendment that a jury must determine the amount of
compensation for improvements to real estate, and with Dimick v.
Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474 (1935), in which the Court held that the Seventh
Amendment bars the use of additur.

10 As we have noted, even under the Statute of Anne and the Copyright

Act of 1790, the amount awarded to the Government ("one Moiety") was
determined by a jury.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
not because I believe that jury trial is not constitutionallyrequired (I do not reach that issue), but because the statute

can and therefore should be read to provide jury trial."[W]here a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by
one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions
arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided,our duty is to adopt the latter."

United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408(1909). The Copyright Act of 1976 authorizes statutory

damages for copyright infringement "in a sum of not lessthan $500 or more than $20,000 as the court considers just."
17 U. S. C. $ 504(c). The Court concludes that it is not "fairly
possible," ante, at 345 (internal quotation marks omitted), to
read $ 504(c) as authorizing jury determination of the amount
of those damages. I disagree.

In common legal parlance, the word "court" can mean
"[t]he judge or judges, as distinguished from the counsel or
jury." Webster's New International Dictionary 611 (2d ed.
1949) (def. 10d). But it also has a broader meaning, which
includes both judge and jury. See, e. g., ibid. (def. 10b: "The
persons duly assembled under authority of law for the administration of justice"); Black's Law Dictionary 318 (5th ed.
1979) (". . . A body organized to administer justice, and
including both judge and jury"). We held in Lorillard v.
Pons, 434 U. S. 575 (1978), that a statute authorizing "the
court . . . to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be
appropriate," 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b), could fairly be read to
afford a right to jury trial on claims for backpay under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.

As the Court correctly observes, ante, at 347, there was
more evidence in Lorillard than there is in the present case

that "court" was being used to include the jury. The remedial provision at issue explicitly referred to the " `powers,
remedies, and procedures' " of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
under which "it was well established that there was a right
to a jury trial," Lorillard, 434 U. S., at 580. The provision's

523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

357Cite as: 523 U. S. 340 (1998)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
reference to "legal . . . relief " also strongly suggested a stat-utory right to jury trial.

Id., at 583. The text of $ 504(c)
lacks such clear indications that "court" is being used in itsbroader sense. But their absence hardly demonstrates that

the broader reading is not "fairly possible," e. g., Tull v.
United States, 481 U. S. 412, 417, n. 3 (1987). The only sig-nificant evidence cited by the Court for

that proposition is
that the "Copyright Act use[s] the term `court' in contextsgenerally thought to confer authority on a judge, rather than

a jury," ante, at 346, but "does not use the term `court' inthe subsection addressing awards of actual damages and
profits, see $ 504(b), which generally are thought to constitute legal relief," ibid. That is a fair observation, but it is
not, in my view, probative enough to compel an interpretation that is constitutionally doubtful.

That is at least so in light of contradictory evidence from
the statutory history, which the Court chooses to ignore.
Section 504(c) is the direct descendant of a remedy created
for unauthorized performance of dramatic compositions in an
1856 copyright statute. That statute provided for damages
"not less than one hundred dollars for the first, and fifty dollars for every subsequent performance, as to the court having cognizance thereof shall appear to be just," enforced
through an "action on the case or other equivalent remedy."
Act of Aug. 18, 1856, ch. 169, 11 Stat. 138, 139. Because
actions on the case were historically tried at law, it seems
clear that this original statute permitted juries to assess
such damages. See Lorillard, supra, at 583. Although
subsequent revisions omitted the reference to "action[s] on
the case," they carried forward the language specifying damages "as to the court shall appear to be just." See Act of
July 8, 1870, ch. 230, $ 101, 16 Stat. 214; Act of Jan. 6, 1897,
ch. 4, 29 Stat. 482. In 1909, Congress extended those provisions to permit all copyright owners to recover "in lieu of
actual damages and profits such damages as to the court
shall appear just . . . ." Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, $ 25(b),

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
35 Stat. 1081. We have recognized that, although the priorstatutory damages provisions

"were broadened [in 1909] so as to include other copy-rights and the limitations were changed in amount, . . .
the principle on which they proceeded--that of commit-ting the amount of damages to be recovered to the
court's discretion and sense of justice, subject to pre-scribed limitations--was retained. The new provision,
like one of the old, says the damages shall be such `as tothe court shall appear to be just.' "

L. A. WestermannCo. v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U. S. 100, 107 (1919).

If a right to jury trial was consistent with the meaning ofthe phrase "as to the court . . . shall appear to be just" in the
1856 statutory damages provision, I see no reason to insistthat the phrase "as the court considers just" has a different
meaning in that provision's latest reenactment. "[W]here,as here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections
of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to havehad knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute."
Lorillard, supra, at 581.I do not contend that reading "court" to include "jury" is

necessarily the best interpretation of this statutory text.The Court is perhaps correct that the indications pointing to
a change in meaning from the 1856 statute predominate. AsI have written elsewhere, however:

"The doctrine of constitutional doubt does not requirethat the problem-avoiding construction be the preferable one--the one the Court would adopt in any event.Such a standard would deprive the doctrine of all function. `Adopt the interpretation that avoids the constitu-tional doubt if that is the right one' produces precisely
the same result as `adopt the right interpretation.'Rather, the doctrine of constitutional doubt comes into
play when the statute is `susceptible of ' the problem523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

As the majority's discussion amply demonstrates, therewould be considerable doubt about the constitutionality of

$ 504(c) if it did not permit jury determination of the amountof statutory damages. Because an interpretation of $ 504(c)
that avoids the Seventh Amendment question is at least"fairly possible," I would adopt that interpretation, prevent
the invalidation of this statute, and reserve the constitu-tional issue for another day.

UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES SHOE CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 97-372. Argued March 4, 1998--Decided March 31, 1998
The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) obligates exporters, importers, and

domestic shippers, 26 U. S. C. $ 4461(c)(1), to pay 0.125 percent of the
value of the commercial cargo they ship through the Nation's ports,

$ 4461(a). The HMT is imposed at the time of loading for exports and
unloading for other shipments. $ 4461(c)(2). It is collected by the Customs Service and deposited in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
(Fund), from which Congress may appropriate amounts to pay for harbor maintenance and development projects and related expenses.

$ 9505. Respondent United States Shoe Corporation (U. S. Shoe) paid
the HMT for articles the company exported during the period April to
June 1994 and then filed a protest with the Customs Service alleging
that, to the extent the toll applies to exports, it violates the Export
Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5, which states: "No Tax or Duty shall
be laid on Articles exported from any State." The Customs Service
responded to U. S. Shoe with a form letter stating that the HMT is a
statutorily mandated user fee, not an unconstitutional tax on exports.
U. S. Shoe then sued for a refund, asserting that the HMT violates the
Export Clause as applied to exports. In granting U. S. Shoe summary
judgment, the Court of International Trade (CIT) held that it had jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1581(i) and that the HMT qualifies as a tax.
Rejecting the Government's characterization of the HMT as a user fee,
the CIT reasoned that the tax is assessed ad valorem directly upon the
value of the cargo itself, not upon any services rendered for the cargo.
The Federal Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. The CIT properly entertained jurisdiction in this case. Section
1581(i)(4) gives that court residual jurisdiction over "any civil action . . .
against the United States . . . that arises out of any [federal] law . . .
providing for . . . administration and enforcement with respect to the
matters referred to in [$ 1581(i)(1)]," which in turn applies to "revenue
from imports." This dispute involves such a law. The HMT statute,
although applied to exports here, applies equally to imports. That

$ 1581(i) does not use the word "exports" is hardly surprising in view of
the Export Clause, which confines customs duties to imports. More523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
over, 26 U. S. C. $ 4462(f)(2) directs that the HMT "be treated as . . . a
customs duty" for jurisdictional purposes. Such duties, by their very
nature, provide for revenue from imports and are encompassed within
28 U. S. C. $ 1581(i)(1). Accordingly, CIT jurisdiction over controversies regarding HMT administration and enforcement accords with

$ 1581(i)(4). Pp. 365-366.

2. Although the Export Clause categorically bars Congress from imposing any tax on exports, United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843 (IBM), it does not rule out a "user fee" that
lacks the attributes of a generally applicable tax or duty and is, instead,
a charge designed as compensation for Government-supplied services,
facilities, or benefits, see Pace v. Burgess, 92 U. S. 372, 375-376. The
HMT, however, is a tax, and thus violates the Export Clause as applied
to exports. Pp. 366-370.

(a) The HMT bears the indicia of a tax: Congress expressly described it as such, 26 U. S. C. $ 4461(a), codified it as part of the Internal
Revenue Code, and provided that, for administrative, enforcement, and
jurisdictional purposes, it should be treated "as if [it] were a customs
duty," $$ 4462(f)(1), (2). Prior cases in which this Court upheld flat and
ad valorem charges as valid user fees do not govern here because they
involved constitutional provisions other than the Export Clause. IBM
plainly stated that the Export Clause's simple, direct, unqualified prohibition on any taxes or duties distinguishes it from other constitutional
limitations on governmental taxing authority. 517 U. S., at 851, 852,
857, 861. Pp. 366-369.

(b) The guiding precedent for determining what constitutes a bona
fide user fee in the Export Clause context remains this Court's timetested Pace decision. The Pace Court upheld a fee for stamps placed
on tobacco packaged for export. The stamp was required to prevent
fraud, and the charge for it, the Court said, served as "compensation
given for services [in fact] rendered." 92 U. S., at 375. In holding that
the fee was not a duty, the Court emphasized that the charge bore no
relationship to the quantity or value of the goods stamped for export.
Ibid. Pace establishes that, under the Export Clause, the connection
between a service the Government renders and the compensation it receives for that service must be closer than is present here. Unlike the
fee at issue in Pace, the HMT is determined entirely on an ad valorem
basis. The value of export cargo, however, does not correlate reliably
with the federal harbor services, facilities, and benefits used or usable
by the exporter. The Court's holding does not mean that exporters are
exempt from any and all user fees designed to defray the cost of harbor

must fairly match the exporters' use of port services and facilities.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5. We held in United States v.International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843 (1996)

(IBM), that the Export Clause categorically bars Congressfrom imposing any tax on exports. The Clause, however,
does not rule out a "user fee," provided that the fee lacksthe attributes of a generally applicable tax or duty and is,
instead, a charge designed as compensation for Government-supplied services, facilities, or benefits. See

Pace v. Bur-gess, 92 U. S. 372, 375-376 (1876). This case presents the

question whether the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT), 26U. S. C. $ 4461(a), as applied to goods loaded at United States
ports for export, is an impermissible tax on exports or, in-stead, a legitimate user fee. We hold, in accord with the
Federal Circuit, that the tax, which is imposed on an ad valo-rem basis, is not a fair approximation of services, facilities,
or benefits furnished to the exporters, and therefore does notqualify as a permissible user fee.

I
The HMT, enacted as part of the Water Resources Devel-opment Act of 1986, 26 U. S. C. $$ 4461-4462, imposes a uniform charge on shipments of commercial cargo through theNation's ports. The charge is currently set at 0.125 percent
of the cargo's value. Exporters, importers, and domesticshippers are liable for the HMT, $ 4461(c)(1), which is imposed at the time of loading for exports and unloading forother shipments, $ 4461(c)(2). The HMT is collected by the
Customs Service and deposited in the Harbor MaintenanceTrust Fund (Fund). Congress may appropriate amounts
from the Fund to pay for harbor maintenance and develop-ment projects, including costs associated with the St. Lawrence Seaway, or related expenses. $ 9505.Respondent United States Shoe Corporation (U. S. Shoe)

Opinion of the Court
to the extent it applies to exports. The Customs Service
responded with a form letter stating that the HMT is a statutorily mandated fee assessment on port users, not an unconstitutional tax on exports. On November 3, 1994, U. S. Shoe
brought this action against the Government in the Court of
International Trade (CIT). The company sought a refund
on the ground that the HMT is unconstitutional as applied
to exports.

Sitting as a three-judge court, the CIT held that its jurisdiction was properly invoked under 28 U. S. C. $ 1581(i); on
the merits, the CIT agreed with U. S. Shoe that the HMT
qualifies as a tax. 907 F. Supp. 408 (1995). Rejecting the
Government's characterization of the HMT as a user fee
rather than a tax, the CIT reasoned: "The Tax is assessed
ad valorem directly upon the value of the cargo itself, not
upon any services rendered for the cargo . . . . Congress
could not have imposed the Tax any closer to exportation,
or more immediate to the articles exported." Id., at 418.
Relying on the Export Clause, the CIT entered summary
judgment for U. S. Shoe.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting as a
five-judge panel, affirmed. 114 F. 3d 1564 (1997). On auxiliary questions, the Federal Circuit upheld the CIT's exercise
of jurisdiction under $ 1581(i) and agreed with the lower
court that the HMT applied to goods in export transit.1
Concluding that the HMT is not based on a fair approximation of port use, the Federal Circuit also agreed that the
HMT imposes a tax, not a user fee. In making this determination, the Court of Appeals emphasized that the HMT does
not depend on the amount or manner of port use, but is determined solely by the value of cargo. Judge Mayer dissented; in his view, Congress properly designed the HMT as
a user fee, a toll on shippers that supplies funds not for the

Opinion of the Court
general support of government, but exclusively for the facilitation of commercial navigation.

Numerous cases challenging the constitutionality of the
HMT as applied to exports are currently pending in the CIT
and the Court of Federal Claims.2 We granted certiorari,
522 U. S. 944 (1997), to review the Federal Circuit's determination that the HMT violates the Export Clause.

II
As an initial matter, we conclude that the CIT properly
entertained jurisdiction in this case. The complaint alleged
exclusive original jurisdiction in that tribunal under 28
U. S. C. $ 1581(a) or, alternatively, $ 1581(i). App. 26. We
agree with the CIT and the Federal Circuit that $ 1581(i) is
the applicable jurisdictional prescription. The key directive
is stated in 26 U. S. C. $ 4462(f)(2), which instructs that for
jurisdictional purposes, the HMT "shall be treated as if such
tax were a customs duty."

Section 1581(a) surely concerns customs duties. It confers exclusive original jurisdiction on the CIT in "any civil
action commenced to contest the [Customs Service's] denial
of a protest." A protest, as indicated in 19 U. S. C. $ 1514,
is an essential prerequisite when one challenges an actual
Customs decision. As to the HMT, however, the Federal
Circuit correctly noted that protests are not pivotal, for Customs "performs no active role," it undertakes "no analysis
[or adjudication]," "issues no directives," "imposes no liabilities"; instead, Customs "merely passively collects" HMT payments. 114 F. 3d, at 1569.

Section 1581(i) describes the CIT's residual jurisdiction
over

2 According to the Government, some 4,000 cases raising this claim are
currently stayed in the CIT, with more than 100 additional cases stayed
in the Court of Federal Claims. See Brief for United States 4.

Opinion of the Court
"any civil action commenced against the United States. . . that arises out of any law of the United States providing for --
"(1) revenue from imports or tonnage;. . . . .

"(4) administration and enforcement with respect tothe matters referred to in paragraphs (1)-(3) of this
subsection . . . ."
This dispute, as the Federal Circuit stated, "involve[s] the`administration and enforcement' of a law providing for revenue from imports because the HMT statute, although appliedto exports here, does apply equally to imports." 114 F. 3d,
at 1571. True, $ 1581(i) does not use the word "exports."But that is hardly surprising in view of the Export Clause,
which confines customs duties to imports. Revenue fromimports and revenue from customs duties are thus synonymous in this setting. In short, as the CIT correctly con-cluded and the Federal Circuit correctly affirmed, "Congress
[in $ 4462(f)(2)] directed [that] the [HMT] be treated as a cus-toms duty for purposes of jurisdiction. Such duties, by their
very nature, provide for revenue from imports, and are en-compassed within [$ ]1581(i)(1)." 907 F. Supp., at 421. Accordingly, CIT jurisdiction over controversies regarding theadministration and enforcement of the HMT accords with

$ 1581(i)(4).3 III

Two Terms ago, in IBM, this Court considered the ques-tion whether a tax on insurance premiums paid to protect
3 Because we determine that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over
challenges to the HMT under $ 1581(i)(4), it follows that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over the challenges to the HMT currently
pending there. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(b). The plaintiffs in these challenges may invoke $ 1631, which authorizes intercourt transfers, when "in
the interest of justice," to cure want of jurisdiction. See also $ 610 (as
used in Title 28, the term "court" includes the Court of Federal Claims
and the CIT).

Opinion of the Court
exports against loss violated the Export Clause. Distin-guishing case law developed under the Commerce Clause,

517 U. S., at 850-852, and the Import-Export Clause, id., at857-861, the Court held that the Export Clause allows no
room for any federal tax, however generally applicable or
nondiscriminatory, on goods in export transit. Before thisCourt's decision in

IBM, the Government argued that the
HMT, even if characterized as a "tax" rather than a "userfee," should survive constitutional review "because it applies

without discrimination to exports, imports and domesticcommerce alike." Reply Brief for United States 9, n. 2.
Recognizing that IBM "rejected an indistinguishable contention," the Government now asserts only that HMT is " `a
permissible user fee,' " Reply Brief for United States 9,
n. 2, a toll within the tolerance of Export Clause precedent.
Adhering to the Court's reasoning in IBM, we reject the
Government's current position.

The HMT bears the indicia of a tax. Congress expressly
described it as "a tax on any port use," 26 U. S. C. $ 4461(a)
(emphasis added), and codified the HMT as part of the Internal Revenue Code. In like vein, Congress provided that, for
administrative, enforcement, and jurisdictional purposes, the
HMT should be treated "as if [it] were a customs duty."

$$ 4462(f )(1), (2). However, "we must regard things rather
than names," Pace v. Burgess, 92 U. S., at 376, in determining
whether an imposition on exports ranks as a tax. The crucial question is whether the HMT is a tax on exports in operation as well as nomenclature or whether, despite the label
Congress has put on it, the exaction is instead a bona fide
user fee.

In arguing that the HMT constitutes a user fee, the Government relies on our decisions in United States v. Sperry
Corp., 493 U. S. 52 (1989), Massachusetts v. United States,
435 U. S. 444 (1978), and Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport
Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972).
In those cases, this Court upheld flat and ad valorem charges

Opinion of the Court
as valid user fees. See United States v. Sperry Corp., 493U. S., at 62 (1

1/2 percent ad valorem fee applied to awards

certified by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal qualifiesas a user fee and is not so excessive as to violate the Takings

Clause); Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S., at 463-
467 (flat federal registration fee imposed annually on all civilaircraft meets genuine user fee standards and, as applied to

state-owned aircraft, does not dishonor State's immunityfrom federal taxation);

Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority, 405 U. S., at 717-721 (flat charge for each passengerenplaning, levied for the maintenance of State's airport facilities, does not run afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause).
Those decisions involved constitutional provisions other than
the Export Clause, however, and thus do not govern here.

IBM plainly stated that the Export Clause's simple, direct,
unqualified prohibition on any taxes or duties distinguishes it
from other constitutional limitations on governmental taxing
authority. The Court there emphasized that the "text of the
Export Clause . . . expressly prohibits Congress from laying
any tax or duty on exports." 517 U. S., at 852; see also id.,
at 861 ("[T]he Framers sought to alleviate . . . concerns [that
Northern States would tax exports to the disadvantage of
Southern States] by completely denying to Congress the
power to tax exports at all."). Accordingly, the Court reasoned in IBM, "[o]ur decades-long struggle over the meaning
of the nontextual negative command of the dormant Commerce Clause does not lead to the conclusion that our interpretation of the textual command of the Export Clause is
equally fluid." Id., at 851; see also id., at 857 ("We have
good reason to hesitate before adopting the analysis of our
recent Import-Export Clause cases into our Export Clause
jurisprudence. . . . [M]eaningful textual differences exist [between the two Clauses] and should not be overlooked."). In
Sperry, moreover, we noted that the Takings Clause imposes
fewer constraints on user fees than does the dormant Commerce Clause. See 493 U. S., at 61, n. 7 (analysis under Tak523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

369Cite as: 523 U. S. 360 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ings Clause is less "exacting" than under the dormant Com-merce Clause).

A fortiori, therefore, the Takings Clause is
less restrictive than the Export Clause.The guiding precedent for determining what constitutes a

bona fide user fee in the Export Clause context remains our
time-tested decision in Pace. Pace involved a federal excisetax on tobacco. Congress provided that the tax would not

apply to tobacco intended for export. To prevent fraud,however, Congress required that tobacco the manufacturer
planned to export carry a stamp indicating that intention.Each stamp cost 25 cents (later 10 cents) per package of tobacco. Congress did not limit the quantity or value of the
tobacco packaged for export or the size of the stamped package; "[t]hese were unlimited, except by the discretion of the
exporter or the convenience of handling." 92 U. S., at 375.

The Court upheld the charge, concluding that it was "in no
sense a duty on exportation," but rather "compensation
given for services [in fact] rendered." Ibid. In so ruling,
the Court emphasized two characteristics of the charge: It
"bore no proportion whatever to the quantity or value of the
package on which [the stamp] was affixed"; and the fee was
not excessive, taking into account the cost of arrangements
needed both "to give to the exporter the benefit of exemption from taxation, and . . . to secure . . . against the perpetration of fraud." Ibid.

Pace establishes that, under the Export Clause, the connection between a service the Government renders and the
compensation it receives for that service must be closer than
is present here. Unlike the stamp charge in Pace, the HMT
is determined entirely on an ad valorem basis. The value of
export cargo, however, does not correlate reliably with the
federal harbor services used or usable by the exporter. As
the Federal Circuit noted, the extent and manner of port use
depend on factors such as the size and tonnage of a vessel,
the length of time it spends in port, and the services it requires, for instance, harbor dredging. See 114 F. 3d, at 1572.

Opinion of the Court
In sum, if we are "to guard against . . . the imposition ofa [tax] under the pretext of fixing a fee," Pace v. Burgess, 92

U. S., at 376, and resist erosion of the Court's decision inIBM, we must hold that the HMT violates the Export Clause
as applied to exports. This does not mean that exportersare exempt from any and all user fees designed to defray the
cost of harbor development and maintenance. It does mean,however, that such a fee must fairly match the exporters'
use of port services and facilities.

BREARD v. GREENE, WARDEN
on application for stay and on petition for writ ofcertiorari to the united states court of appeals

for the fourth circuit
No. 97-8214 (A-732). Decided April 14, 1998*
Petitioner Breard, a Paraguayan citizen, was convicted and sentenced to

death in Virginia state court. He filed a motion for habeas relief in
Federal District Court, arguing for the first time that his convictions
and sentences should be overturned because Virginia authorities violated the Vienna Convention by failing to inform him that, as a foreign
national, he had a right to contact the Paraguayan Consulate. The
court held, however, that he procedurally defaulted his claim when he
failed to raise it in state court and that he could not demonstrate cause
and prejudice for this default. The Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Republic of Paraguay and its officials also brought suit in the District
Court, alleging that their separate rights under the Convention had
been violated by Virginia's failure to inform Breard of his Convention
rights and to inform the Paraguayan Consulate of his arrest, conviction,
and sentence. The Paraguayan Consul General also asserted a 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 claim. The court concluded that it lacked subject-matter
jurisdiction because Paraguay was not alleging a continuing violation of
federal law and therefore could not bring its claims within the Eleventh
Amendment immunity exception. The Fourth Circuit affirmed. Paraguay also instituted proceedings against the United States in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), alleging that the United States violated
the Convention at Breard's arrest. The ICJ issued an order requesting
the United States to "take all measures at its disposal to ensure that . . .
Breard is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings."
Breard then filed a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus and a

Per Curiam
stay application in this Court to "enforce" the ICJ's order, and Paraguay
filed a motion for leave to file an original bill of complaint.

Held: Breard is not entitled to relief on any theory offered. He procedurally defaulted his Vienna Convention claim, if any, by failing to raise
it in the state courts. The argument that the claim may be heard in
federal court because the Convention is the "supreme law of the land"
and thus trumps the procedural default doctrine is plainly incorrect for
two reasons. First, a well-established rule of international law, embodied in the Convention itself, specifies that, absent a clear and express
statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State. In this country,
assertions of error in criminal proceedings must first be raised in
state court in order to form the basis for relief in habeas. Wainwright
v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72. Second, Breard's ability to obtain relief based
on Convention violations is subject to the subsequently enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which denies a habeas petitioner alleging that he is held in violation of treaties an evidentiary
hearing if he has failed to develop the claim's factual basis in statecourt proceedings. See, e. g., Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 18. As for
Paraguay's suits, neither the Convention's text nor its history clearly
provides a foreign nation a private right of action in United States'
courts to set aside a criminal conviction and sentence for violating consular notification provisions. The Eleventh Amendment's "fundamental principle" that "the States, in the absence of consent, are immune
from suits brought against them . . . by a foreign State," Principality
of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 329-330, provides a separate
reason why Paraguay's suit may not proceed. The Consul General's

$ 1983 suit is not cognizable because Paraguay, for whose benefit the
suit is brought, is not a "person within the jurisdiction" of the United
States authorized to bring suit under that section. See, e. g., Moor v.
County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 699. It is the Virginia Governor's
prerogative to stay Breard's execution pending the ICJ's decision;
nothing in this Court's existing case law allows it to make that decision
for him.

Habeas corpus, motion for leave to file bill of complaint, certiorari, and

Angel Francisco Breard is scheduled to be executed by theCommonwealth of Virginia this evening at 9 p.m. Breard, a

citizen of Paraguay, came to the United States in 1986, at the

age of 20. In 1992, Breard was charged with the attempted
rape and capital murder of Ruth Dickie. At his trial in 1993,
the State presented overwhelming evidence of guilt, including semen found on Dickie's body matching Breard's DNA
profile and hairs on Dickie's body identical in all microscopic
characteristics to hair samples taken from Breard. Breard
chose to take the witness stand in his defense. During his
testimony, Breard confessed to killing Dickie, but explained
that he had only done so because of a Satanic curse placed
on him by his father-in-law. Following a jury trial in the
Circuit Court of Arlington County, Virginia, Breard was convicted of both charges and sentenced to death. On appeal,
the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed Breard's convictions
and sentences, Breard v. Commonwealth, 248 Va. 68, 445
S. E. 2d 670 (1994), and we denied certiorari, 513 U. S. 971
(1994). State collateral relief was subsequently denied as
well.

Breard then filed a motion for habeas relief under 28
U. S. C. $ 2254 in Federal District Court on August 20, 1996.
In that motion, Breard argued for the first time that his convictions and sentences should be overturned because of alleged violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), April 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T.
77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, at the time of his arrest. Specifically,
Breard alleged that the Vienna Convention was violated
when the arresting authorities failed to inform him that, as a
foreign national, he had the right to contact the Paraguayan
Consulate. The District Court rejected this claim, concluding that Breard procedurally defaulted the claim when he
failed to raise it in state court and that Breard could not
demonstrate cause and prejudice for this default. Breard v.
Netherland, 949 F. Supp. 1255, 1266 (ED Va. 1996). The
Fourth Circuit affirmed. Breard v. Pruett, 134 F. 3d 615,
620 (1998). Breard has petitioned this Court for a writ of
certiorari.

374 BREARD v. GREENE

Per Curiam
In September 1996, the Republic of Paraguay, the Ambas-sador of Paraguay to the United States, and the Consul General of Paraguay to the United States (collectively Paraguay)brought suit in Federal District Court against certain Virginia officials, alleging that their separate rights under the
Vienna Convention had been violated by the Common-wealth's failure to inform Breard of his rights under the

treaty and to inform the Paraguayan Consulate of Breard'sarrest, convictions, and sentences. In addition, the Consul
General asserted a parallel claim under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging a denial of his rights under the
Vienna Convention. The District Court concluded that it
lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over these suits because
Paraguay was not alleging a "continuing violation of federal
law" and therefore could not bring its claims within the
exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity established in
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Republic of Paraguay
v. Allen, 949 F. Supp. 1269, 1272-1273 (ED Va. 1996). The
Fourth Circuit affirmed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.
Republic of Paraguay v. Allen, 134 F. 3d 622 (1998). Paraguay has also petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.

On April 3, 1998, nearly five years after Breard's convictions became final, the Republic of Paraguay instituted
proceedings against the United States in the International
Court of Justice (ICJ), alleging that the United States violated the Vienna Convention at the time of Breard's arrest.
On April 9, the ICJ noted jurisdiction and issued an order
requesting that the United States "take all measures at its
disposal to ensure that Angel Francisco Breard is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings . . . ."
The ICJ set a briefing schedule for this matter, with oral
argument likely to be held this November. Breard then
filed a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus and a
stay application in this Court in order to "enforce" the ICJ's
order. Paraguay filed a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint in this Court, citing this Court's original jurisdiction

over cases "affecting Ambassadors . . . and Consuls." U. S.Const., Art. III, $ 2.

It is clear that Breard procedurally defaulted his claim, ifany, under the Vienna Convention by failing to raise that
claim in the state courts. Nevertheless, in their petitions
for certiorari, both Breard and Paraguay contend thatBreard's Vienna Convention claim may be heard in federal court because the Convention is the "supreme law ofthe land" and thus trumps the procedural default doctrine.
Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, pp. 15-18; Pet. for Cert. inNo. 97-1390, p. 14, n. 8. This argument is plainly incorrect
for two reasons.

First, while we should give respectful consideration to the
interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such, it has
been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and
express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of
the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in
that State. See Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723
(1988); Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, 486
U. S. 694, 700 (1988); Socie'te' Nationale Industrielle Ae'rospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of
Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 539 (1987). This proposition is embodied in the Vienna Convention itself, which provides that the
rights expressed in the Convention "shall be exercised in
conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving
State," provided that "said laws and regulations must enable
full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights
accorded under this Article are intended." Article 36(2),
[1970] 21 U. S. T., at 101. It is the rule in this country that
assertions of error in criminal proceedings must first be
raised in state court in order to form the basis for relief in
habeas. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977). Claims
not so raised are considered defaulted. Ibid. By not asserting his Vienna Convention claim in state court, Breard
failed to exercise his rights under the Vienna Convention

376 BREARD v. GREENE

Per Curiam
in conformity with the laws of the United States and theCommonwealth of Virginia. Having failed to do so, he cannot raise a claim of violation of those rights now on federalhabeas review.

Second, although treaties are recognized by our Constitution as the supreme law of the land, that status is no lesstrue of provisions of the Constitution itself, to which rules

of procedural default apply. We have held "that an Act ofCongress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty, and that when
a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with atreaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty
null." Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion); see also Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194 (1888)
(holding that if a treaty and a federal statute conflict, "the
one last in date will control the other"). The Vienna Convention--which arguably confers on an individual the right
to consular assistance following arrest--has continuously
been in effect since 1969. But in 1996, before Breard filed
his habeas petition raising claims under the Vienna Convention, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which provides that a habeas
petitioner alleging that he is held in violation of "treaties
of the United States" will, as a general rule, not be afforded
an evidentiary hearing if he "has failed to develop the factual basis of [the] claim in State court proceedings." 28
U. S. C. $$ 2254(a), (e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). Breard's ability to obtain relief based on violations of the Vienna Convention is subject to this subsequently enacted rule, just as any
claim arising under the United States Constitution would be.
This rule prevents Breard from establishing that the violation of his Vienna Convention rights prejudiced him. Without a hearing, Breard cannot establish how the Consul would
have advised him, how the advice of his attorneys differed
from the advice the Consul could have provided, and what
factors he considered in electing to reject the plea bargain
that the State offered him. That limitation, Breard also ar523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
gues, is not justified because his Vienna Convention claimswere so novel that he could not have discovered them any

earlier. Assuming that were true, such novel claims wouldbe barred on habeas review under

Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.
288 (1989).

Even were Breard's Vienna Convention claim properlyraised and proved, it is extremely doubtful that the violation

should result in the overturning of a final judgment of con-viction without some showing that the violation had an effect
on the trial. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991).In this action, no such showing could even arguably be
made. Breard decided not to plead guilty and to testify at
his own trial contrary to the advice of his attorneys, who
were likely far better able to explain the United States legal
system to him than any consular official would have been.
Breard's asserted prejudice--that had the Vienna Convention been followed, he would have accepted the State's offer
to forgo the death penalty in return for a plea of guilty--
is far more speculative than the claims of prejudice courts
routinely reject in those cases where an inmate alleges that
his plea of guilty was infected by attorney error. See, e. g.,
Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).

As for Paraguay's suits (both the original action and the
case coming to us on petition for certiorari), neither the text
nor the history of the Vienna Convention clearly provides a
foreign nation a private right of action in United States
courts to set aside a criminal conviction and sentence for
violation of consular notification provisions. The Eleventh
Amendment provides a separate reason why Paraguay's suit
might not succeed. That Amendment's "fundamental principle" that "the States, in the absence of consent, are immune
from suits brought against them . . . by a foreign State" was
enunciated in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292
U. S. 313, 329-330 (1934). Though Paraguay claims that its
suit is within an exemption dealing with continuing consequences of past violations of federal rights, see Milliken v.

378 BREARD v. GREENE

Per Curiam
Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977), we do not agree. The failure
to notify the Paraguayan Consul occurred long ago and has
no continuing effect. The causal link present in Milliken is
absent in this suit.

Insofar as the Consul General seeks to base his claims on

$ 1983, his suit is not cognizable. Section 1983 provides a
cause of action to any "person within the jurisdiction" of the
United States for the deprivation "of any rights, privileges,
or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws." As
an initial matter, it is clear that Paraguay is not authorized
to bring suit under $ 1983. Paraguay is not a "person" as
that term is used in $ 1983. See Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 699 (1973); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 323-324 (1966); cf. Will v. Michigan Dept.

of State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989). Nor is Paraguay "within
the jurisdiction" of the United States. And since the Consul
General is acting only in his official capacity, he has no
greater ability to proceed under $ 1983 than does the country
he represents. Any rights that the Consul General might
have by virtue of the Vienna Convention exist for the benefit
of Paraguay, not for him as an individual.

It is unfortunate that this matter comes before us while
proceedings are pending before the ICJ that might have
been brought to that court earlier. Nonetheless, this Court
must decide questions presented to it on the basis of law.
The Executive Branch, on the other hand, in exercising its
authority over foreign relations may, and in this case did,
utilize diplomatic discussion with Paraguay. Last night the
Secretary of State sent a letter to the Governor of Virginia
requesting that he stay Breard's execution. If the Governor
wishes to wait for the decision of the ICJ, that is his prerogative. But nothing in our existing case law allows us to make
that choice for him.

For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for an
original writ of habeas corpus, the motion for leave to file a

bill of complaint, the petitions for certiorari, and the accom-panying stay applications filed by Breard and Paraguay.

Statement of Justice Souter.
I agree with the Court that the lack of any reasonablyarguable causal connection between the alleged treaty violations and Breard's convictions and sentences disentitle him
to relief on any theory offered. Moreover, I have substan-tial doubts that either Paraguay or any official acting for it

is a "person" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 andthat the Vienna Convention is enforceable in any judicial proceeding now underway. For these reasons, I believe thestay requests should be denied, with the result that Paraguay's claims will be mooted. Accordingly, I have voted todeny Paraguay's and Breard's respective petitions for certiorari (Nos. 97-1390 and 97-8214), Paraguay's motion for leave
to file a bill of complaint (No. 125, Orig.), Breard's applicationfor an original writ of habeas corpus (No. 97-8660), and the

associated requests for a stay of execution.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Court of Appeals' decision denying petitioner Breard's
first application for a federal writ of habeas corpus became
final on February 18, 1998. Under this Court's Rules, a
timely petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision
could have been filed as late as May 19, 1998. See Rule 13.1
("[A] petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment
in any case, civil or criminal, entered by . . . a United States
court of appeals . . . is timely when it is filed with the Clerk
of this Court within 90 days after entry of the judgment").
Ordinary review of that petition pursuant to our Rules would
have given us additional time thereafter to consider its merits in the light of the response filed by the Commonwealth of
Virginia. We have, however, been deprived of the normal
time for considered deliberation by the Commonwealth's
decision to set the date of petitioner's execution for today.

Breyer, J., dissenting
There is no compelling reason for refusing to follow the pro-cedures that we have adopted for the orderly disposition of

noncapital cases. Indeed, the international aspects of thiscase provide an additional reason for adhering to our established Rules and procedures. I would therefore grant the
applications for a stay, and I respectfully dissent from thedecision to act hastily rather than with the deliberation that

is appropriate in a case of this character.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting in No. 97-8214 (A-732).
I would grant the application for a stay of execution in
order to consider in the ordinary course the instant petition,Breard's first federal petition for writ of habeas corpus.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
In my view, several of the issues raised here are of
sufficient difficulty to warrant less speedy consideration.Breard argues, for example, that the novelty of his Vienna

Convention claim is sufficient to create "cause" for his having
failed to present that claim to the Virginia state courts.
Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, pp. 20-22. He might add that
the nature of his claim, were we to accept it, is such as to
create a "watershed rule of criminal procedure," which
might overcome the bar to consideration otherwise posed
by Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989). He additionally
says that what the Solicitor General describes as Virginia's
violation of the Convention "prejudiced" him by isolating
him at a critical moment from Consular Officials who might
have advised him to try to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty. Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, p. 22; see Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae in Nos. 97-1390 and
97-8214, p. 12 ("[T]he Executive Branch has conceded that
the Vienna Convention was violated"). I cannot say, without examining the record more fully, that these arguments
are obviously without merit. Nor am I willing to accept
without fuller briefing and consideration the positions taken

by the majority on all of the sometimes difficult issues thatthe majority addresses.

At the same time, the international aspects of the caseshave provided us with the advantage of additional briefing
even in the short time available. More time would likelymean additional briefing and argument, perhaps, for example, on the potential relevance of proceedings in an interna-tional forum.

Finally, as Justice Stevens points out, Virginia is nowpursuing an execution schedule that leaves less time for argument and for Court consideration than the Court's Rulesprovide for ordinary cases. Like

Justice Stevens, I canfind no special reason here to truncate the period of time

that the Court's Rules would otherwise make available.For these reasons, taken together, I would grant the
requested stay of execution and consider the petitions forcertiorari in the ordinary course.

ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. v. COMMIS-SIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-147. Argued March 2, 1998--Decided April 21, 1998
Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Internal Revenue

Code gave property and casualty (PC) insurers a full deduction for "loss
reserves": estimated amounts of losses reported but not yet paid, losses
incurred but not yet reported, and administrative costs of resolving
claims. In each taxable year, not only losses paid, but the full amount
of the loss reserves, reduced by the amount of the loss reserves claimed
for the prior taxable year, were treated as a business expense. Section
1023 of the 1986 Act required PC insurers, beginning with the 1987
taxable year, to discount unpaid losses to present value when claiming
them as a deduction. Requiring insurers to subtract undiscounted
year-end 1986 reserves from discounted year-end 1987 reserves in computing 1987 losses would produce artificially low deductions, so the Act
included a transitional rule requiring insurers to discount 1986 reserves
as well. This rule changed the "method of accounting" for computing
taxable income. To avoid requiring PC insurers to recognize as income
the difference between undiscounted and discounted year-end 1986 loss
reserves, the Act afforded them a "fresh start," to wit, an exclusion from
taxable income of the difference between undiscounted and discounted
year-end 1986 loss reserves. $ 1023(e)(3)(A). It foreclosed the possibility that they would inflate reserves to manipulate the "fresh start" by
excepting "reserve strengthening" from the exclusion. $ 1023(e)(3)(B).
Treasury Regulation $ 1.846-3(c)(3)(ii) defines "reserve strengthening"
to include any net additions to reserves. Respondent Commissioner
determined that petitioner, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., and its subsidiary, a PC insurer, made net additions to loss reserves in 1986, reducing the "fresh start" entitlement and resulting in a tax deficiency. The
Tax Court disagreed, holding that "reserve strengthening" refers to
only those increases that result from changes in computation methods
or assumptions. In reversing, the Third Circuit concluded that the
Treasury Regulation's definition of "reserve strengthening" is based on
a permissible statutory construction.

Held: The Treasury Regulation represents a reasonable interpretation

of the term "reserve strengthening." Neither prior legislation nor industry use establishes the plain meaning Atlantic ascribes to that term:

Opinion of the Court
reserve increases attributable to changes in methods or assumptions.
Since the term is ambiguous, the question is not whether the Treasury Regulation represents the best interpretation of the statute, but
whether it represents a reasonable one. See Cottage Savings Assn. v.
Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560-561. As a purely linguistic matter,
the phrase is broad enough to embrace all increases in the reserve's
amount, for whatever reason and from whatever source. The provision
at issue is a limitation upon an extraordinary deduction accorded to PC
insurers. There was no need for the deduction to be microscopically
fair, and the interpretation adopted in the Treasury Regulation seems
to be a reasonable accommodation of the competing interests of fairness, administrability, and avoidance of abuse. Given the hundreds
(or more likely thousands) of claims involved, claims resolved for less
than estimated reserves will tend to offset claims that settle for more
than estimated reserves. Any discrepancy would not approach the unrealistic proportions claimed by Atlantic. Pp. 387-391.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Property and casualty insurance companies maintain ac-counting reserves for "unpaid losses." Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, increases in loss reserves that constitute"reserve strengthening" do not qualify for a certain one-time
tax benefit. We must decide whether the term "reservestrengthening" reasonably encompasses any increase in re*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for Ambase Corp.

Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. is the common parent of anaffiliated group of corporations, including Centennial Insurance Co., a property and casualty (PC) insurer. From 1985to 1993, the two corporations (Atlantic) maintained what insurers call "loss reserves." Loss reserves are estimates ofamounts insurers will have to pay for losses that have been
reported but not yet paid, for losses that have been incurredbut not yet reported, and for administrative costs of resolving claims.Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L.
99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, the Internal Revenue Code gave PCinsurers a full deduction for loss reserves as "losses incurred." In each taxable year, not only losses paid, but thefull amount of the loss reserves, reduced by the amount of
the loss reserves claimed for the prior taxable year, wouldbe treated as a business expense. 26 U. S. C. $$ 832(b)(5)
and (c)(4) (1982 ed.). This designation enabled the PC in-surer to take, in effect, a current deduction for future loss
payments without adjusting for the "time value of money"--the fact that " `[a] dollar today is worth more than a dollar
tomorrow,' " D. Herwitz & M. Barrett, Accounting for Law-yers 221 (2d ed. 1997). Section 1023 of the 1986 Act
amended the Code to require PC insurers, for taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1986, to discount unpaid losses
to present value when claiming them as a deduction. 100Stat. 2399, 2404, 26 U. S. C. $$ 832(b)(5)(A), 846 (1982 ed.,
Supp. V). Absent a transitional rule, PC insurers wouldhave been left to subtract undiscounted year-end 1986 reserves from discounted year-end 1987 reserves for purposesof computing losses incurred for taxable year 1987--producing artificially low deductions. The 1986 Act softened thisconsequence by requiring PC insurers, for purposes of that

Opinion of the Court
1987 tax computation, to discount 1986 reserves as well.
100 Stat. 2404, note following 26 U. S. C. $ 846.

Because the requirement that PC insurers discount 1986
reserves changed the "method of accounting" for computing
taxable income, PC insurers, absent another transitional
rule, would have been required to recognize as income the
difference between undiscounted and discounted year-end
1986 loss reserves. See 26 U. S. C. $ 481(a) (1988 ed.). To
avoid this consequence, $ 1023(e)(3)(A) of the 1986 Act afforded PC insurers a "fresh start," to wit, an exclusion from
taxable income of the difference between undiscounted and
discounted year-end 1986 loss reserves. 100 Stat. 2404, note
following 26 U. S. C. $ 846. Of course the greater the 1986
reserves, the greater the exclusion. Section 1023(e)(3)(B) of
the 1986 Act foreclosed the possibility that insurers would
inflate reserves to manipulate the "fresh start" by excepting
"reserve strengthening" from the exclusion:

"(B) Reserve strengthening in years after
1985.--Subparagraph (A) [the fresh-start provision] shall
not apply to any reserve strengthening in a taxable year
beginning in 1986, and such strengthening shall be
treated as occurring in the taxpayer's 1st taxable year
beginning after December 31, 1986." 100 Stat. 2404,
note following 26 U. S. C. $ 846.

Regulations promulgated by the Treasury Department set
forth rules for determining the amount of "reserve
strengthening":

"(1) In general. The amount of reserve strengthening (weakening) is the amount that is determined under
paragraph (c)(2) or (3) to have been added to (subtracted
from) an unpaid loss reserve in a taxable year beginning
in 1986. For purposes of section 1023(e)(3)(B) of the
1986 Act, the amount of reserve strengthening (weakening) must be determined separately for each unpaid loss

reserve by applying the rules of this paragraph (c).
This determination is made without regard to the reasonableness of the amount of the unpaid loss reserve and
without regard to the taxpayer's discretion, or lack
thereof, in establishing the amount of the unpaid loss
reserve. . . .. . . . .

"(3) Accident years before 1986--(i) In general. For
each taxable year beginning in 1986, the amount of
reserve strengthening (weakening) for an unpaid loss
reserve for an accident year before 1986 is the amount

reserve. . . ." Treas. Reg. $ 1.846-3(c), 26 CFR $ 1.846-
3(c) (1997).

In short, any net additions to reserves (with two exceptions not here at issue, $ 1.846-3(c)(3)(ii)) constitute "reserve
strengthening" under the regulation.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that
Atlantic made net additions to reserves--"reserve strengthening"--during 1986, reducing the "fresh start" entitlement
by an amount that resulted in a tax deficiency of $519,987.
The Tax Court disagreed, holding that Atlantic had not
strengthened its reserves. "Reserve strengthening," the
Tax Court held, refers only to increases in reserves that result from changes in the methods or assumptions used to
compute them. (Atlantic's reserve increases, there is no
dispute, did not result from any such change.) The United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the
Tax Court, concluding that the Treasury Regulation's defini523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of "reserve strengthening" to include any net additions
to reserves is based on a permissible construction of the statute. 111 F. 3d 1056 (1997). (It expressly disagreed with
the Eighth Circuit's conclusion in Western National Mutual
Insurance Co. v. Commissioner, 65 F. 3d 90 (1995), that the
Treasury Regulation is invalid.) We granted certiorari.
522 U. S. 931 (1997).

II

The 1986 Act does not define "reserve strengthening."
Atlantic contends that the term has a plain meaning under
the statute: reserve increases attributable to changes in
methods or assumptions. If that is what the term plainly
means, Atlantic must prevail, "for the court, as well as the
agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed
intent of Congress." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984).

Atlantic contends that the plain meaning of "reserve
strengthening" can be discerned, first, from its use in the PC
insurance industry. It presented at trial two expert reports
which, by "constructing a working definition of the term"
that requires "a material change in methodology and/or assumptions," App. 68, 74, purport to demonstrate that Atlantic "did not strengthen reserves," id., at 99. Our task, of
course, is to determine not what the term ought to mean,
but what it does mean. Atlantic's first expert, before "constructing" a definition, expressly acknowledged that "reserve strengthening" is "not a well-defined PC insurance or
actuarial term of art to be found in PC actuarial, accounting,
or insurance regulatory literature." Id., at 60. On this
point she was in agreement with the Commissioner's experts: "In the property-casualty industry the term `reserve
strengthening' has various meanings, rather than a single
universal meaning," id., at 124. If the expert reports establish anything, it is that "reserve strengthening" does not
have an established meaning in the PC insurance industry.

388 ATLANTIC MUT. INS. CO. v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion of the Court
Atlantic next contends that a plain meaning can be discerned from prior use of the term in life insurance tax legislation. According to Atlantic, the term has its roots in the
Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, which provided tax consequences for changes in the "basis" for determining life insurance reserves. 73 Stat. 125, 26 U. S. C.

$ 810(d) (1958 ed., Supp. I). But that provision does not define, or for that matter even use, the term "reserve strengthening." Though the regulation that implemented the provision uses the term "reserve strengthening" in a caption,
Treas. Reg. $ 1.810-3(a), 26 CFR $ 1.810-3(a) (1997), its text
does not mention the term, and one of its Examples speaks
only of "reserve strengthening attributable to the change in
basis which occurred in 1959," $ 1.810-3(b), Ex. 2. If, as Atlantic argues, "basis" and "assumptions or methodologies"
are interchangeable terms, Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 8, and
a change in basis is necessary for "reserve strengthening,"
it is redundant to say "reserve strengthening attributable to
the change in basis which occurred in 1959," much as it would
be to say "a sunburn attributable to the sun in 1959." On
Atlantic's assumptions, the more natural formulation would
have been simply "reserve strengthening in 1959." Thus,
the 1959 Act and implementing regulation suggest, if anything, that a change in basis is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition for "reserve strengthening."

Atlantic further contends that the term "reserve strengthening" draws a plain meaning from a provision of the Tax
Reform Act of 1984 that accorded a "fresh start" adjustment
to life insurance reserves. Div. A, 98 Stat. 758, note following 26 U. S. C. $ 801 (1984 Act). That provision, like the
"fresh start" adjustment for PC insurers in the 1986 Act,
said that the "fresh start" would not apply to reserve
strengthening, specifically, "to any reserve strengthening reported for Federal income tax purposes after September 27,
1983, for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1984." 98

523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

389Cite as: 523 U. S. 382 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Stat. 759. Unlike the 1986 Act, however, the 1984 Act ex-pressly provided that "reserve strengthening" would not be

excluded from the "fresh start" if the insurer "employs thereserve practice used for purposes of the most recent annual
statement filed before September 27, 1983 . . . ." Ibid. If,as Atlantic contends, reserve strengthening encompasses
only reserve increases that result from a change in reservepractices (viz., change in methods or assumptions), the saving clause is superfluous. Thus, to the extent the definitionof "reserve strengthening" in the life insurance context is
relevant to its meaning here (which is questionable, see 111F. 3d, at 1061-1062), the 1984 Act, like the regulations under
the 1959 Act, tends to contradict, rather than support, pe-titioner's interpretation. We conclude that neither prior
legislation nor industry use establishes the plain meaningAtlantic ascribes to "reserve strengthening."

III
Since the term "reserve strengthening" is ambiguous, thetask that confronts us is to decide, not whether the Treasury

Regulation represents the best interpretation of the stat-ute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. See Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560-561(1991). We conclude that it does.

As a purely linguistic matter, the phrase is certainly broadenough to embrace

all increases in (all "strengthening of ")the amount of the reserve, for whatever reason and from

whatever source. Atlantic contends that this interpretationis unreasonable because, in theory, it produces absurd results, as the following example supposedly illustrates: As-sume that in 1985 a PC insurer had four case reserves of
$500 each (total reserves of $2,000). If two cases settled in
1986 for $750 each ($1,500 total), the remaining loss reservewould be $1,000. Under the regulation, according to Atlantic, the Commissioner would find "reserve strengthening" of

523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
390 ATLANTIC MUT. INS. CO. v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion of the Court
$500 (1986 loss reserves ($1,000) less (first year reserves
($2,000) less second year payments ($1,500))), even though
reserves did not increase. The Commissioner denies this
consequence, contending that under the stipulation in this
case the increase in the reserve would be "reduced to zero"
by an offsetting adjustment when the payment is made, and
that adjustments in the IBNR reserve (reserve for claims
"incurred but not reported") may result from payments in
excess of prior reserve amounts, offsetting changes in other
reserves. Brief for Respondent 36-39.

We need not resolve that dispute, because we agree with
the Commissioner that Atlantic's horrific example is in any
event unrealistic. The property and casualty insurer that
had only four cases would not be in business very long, with
or without the benefit of the tax adjustment--or if he would,
his talents could be put to better use in Las Vegas. The
whole point of the insurance business is to spread the insured
risk over a large number of cases, where experience and the
law of probabilities can be relied upon. And where hundreds (or more likely thousands) of claims are involved,
claims resolved for less than estimated reserves will tend to
offset claims that settle for more than estimated reserves.
See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Discounted Unpaid
Losses, FI-139-86, 1991-2 Cum. Bull. 946, 947 ("For most
unpaid loss reserves . . . any potential inaccuracies are likely
to offset each other in the aggregate"). There may, to be
sure, be some discrepancy in one direction or the other, but
it would not approach the relative proportions claimed by
Atlantic.

It should be borne in mind that the provision at issue here
is a limitation upon an extraordinary deduction accorded to
PC insurers. There was certainly no need for that deduction to be microscopically fair, and the interpretation
adopted by the Treasury Regulation seems to us a reasonable accommodation--and one that the statute very likely

Because the Treasury Regulation represents a reason-able interpretation of the term "reserve strengthening,"

CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the court of appeal of louisiana,third circuit

No. 96-1584. Argued January 20, 1998--Decided April 21, 1998
A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Campbell for second-degree murder. In light of evidence that, for the prior
161/2 years, no black person had served as grand jury foreperson in the
Parish even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were
black, Campbell filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground
that his grand jury was constituted in violation of his Fourteenth
Amendment equal protection and due process rights and the Sixth
Amendment's fair-cross-section requirement. The trial judge denied
the motion because Campbell, a white man accused of killing another
white man, lacked standing to complain about the exclusion of black
persons from serving as forepersons. He was convicted, but the Louisiana Court of Appeal ordered an evidentiary hearing, holding that
Campbell could object to the alleged discrimination under the holding
in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, that a white defendant had standing
to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of
peremptory challenges. In reversing, the State Supreme Court declined to extend Powers to a claim such as Campbell's. It also found
that he was not afforded standing to raise a due process objection by
Hobby v. United States, 468 U. S. 339, in which the Court held that no
relief could be granted to a white defendant even if his due process
rights had been violated by discrimination in the selection of a federal
grand jury foreperson whose duties were purely "ministerial." Noting
that the Louisiana foreperson's role was similarly ministerial, the court
held that any discrimination had little, if any, effect on Campbell's due
process right of fundamental fairness.

Held:

1. A white criminal defendant has the requisite standing to raise
equal protection and due process objections to discrimination against
black persons in the selection of grand jurors. Pp. 396-403.

(a) This case must be treated as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors, not just of a grand jury foreperson. In the federal
system and in most States using grand juries, the foreperson is selected
from the ranks of the already seated jurors. In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before
the remaining members are chosen by lot. In addition to his other

523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

393Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)
Syllabus
duties, the Louisiana foreperson has the same full voting powers as
other grand jury members. As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury
outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that
body. Pp. 396-397.

(b) Campbell, like any other white defendant, has standing under
Powers, supra, to raise an equal protection challenge to the discriminatory selection of his grand jury. The excluded jurors' own right not to
be discriminatorily denied grand jury service can be asserted by Campbell because he satisfies the three preconditions for third-party standing
outlined in Powers, supra, at 411. First, regardless of skin color, an
accused suffers a significant "injury in fact" when the grand jury's composition is tainted by racial discrimination. The integrity of the body's
decisions depends on the integrity of the process used to select the
grand jurors. If that process is infected with racial discrimination,
doubt is cast over the fairness of all subsequent decisions. See Rose v.
Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 555-556. The Court rejects the State's argument that no harm is inflicted when a single grand juror is selected
based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the
grand jurors on that panel, and only becomes apparent when a pattern
emerges over the course of years. This argument underestimates the
seriousness of the allegations here: If they are true, the impartiality and
discretion of the judge himself would be called into question. Second,
Campbell has a "close relationship" to the excluded jurors, who share
with him a common interest in eradicating discrimination from the
grand jury selection process, and a vital interest in asserting their
rights because his conviction may be overturned as a result. See, e. g.,
Powers, 499 U. S., at 413-414. The State's argument that Campbell has
but a tenuous connection to jurors excluded in the past confuses his
underlying claim--that black persons were excluded from his grand
jury--with the evidence needed to prove it--that similarly situated venirepersons were excluded in previous cases on account of intentional
discrimination. Third, given the economic burdens of litigation and the
small financial reward available, a grand juror excluded because of race
has little incentive to sue to vindicate his own rights. See id., at 415.
Pp. 397-400.

(c) A white defendant alleging discriminatory selection of grand
jurors has standing to litigate whether his conviction was procured by
means or procedures which contravene due process. Hobby, supra, at
350, proceeded on the implied assumption that such standing exists.
The Louisiana Supreme Court's reading of Hobby as foreclosing Campbell's standing is inconsistent with that implicit assumption and with the
Court's explicit reasoning in Hobby. Campbell's challenge is different

Opinion of the Court
in kind and degree from the one there at issue because it implicates
the impermissible appointment of a member of the grand jury. What
concerns Campbell is not the foreperson's performance of his ministerial duty to preside, but his performance as a grand juror, namely,
voting to charge Campbell with second-degree murder. The significance of this distinction was acknowledged in Hobby, supra, at 348. By
its own terms, then, Hobby does not address a claim like Campbell's.
Pp. 400-403.

2. The Court declines to address whether Campbell also has standing
to raise a fair-cross-section claim. Neither of the Louisiana appellate
courts discussed this contention, and Campbell has made no effort to
meet his burden of showing the issue was properly presented to those
courts. See Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 86 (per curiam). P. 403.

murder. Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial mo-tion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury

was constituted in violation of his equal protection and dueprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the Sixth Amendment's fair-cross-section requirement. Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racialdiscrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in

the parish. His sole piece of evidence is that, between Janu-ary 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand
jury foreperson in the parish, even though more than 20 per-cent of the registered voters were black persons. See Brief
for Petitioner 16. The State does not dispute this evidence.
The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because
"Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another
white man," lacked standing to complain "where all of the
forepersons were white." App. to Pet. for Cert. G-33.

After Campbell's first trial resulted in a mistrial, he was
retried, convicted of second-degree murder, and sentenced to
life in prison without possibility of parole. Campbell renewed his challenge to the grand jury foreperson selection
procedures in a motion for new trial, which was denied. See
id., at I-2. The Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed, because, under our decision in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400
(1991), Campbell had standing to object to the alleged discrimination even though he is white. 651 So. 2d 412 (1995).
The Court of Appeal remanded the case for an evidentiary
hearing because it found Campbell's evidence of discrimination inadequate. Id., at 413.

The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed. It distinguished
Powers as turning on the "considerable and substantial impact" that a prosecutor's discriminatory use of peremptory
challenges has on a defendant's trial as well as on the integrity of the judicial system. See 661 So. 2d 1321, 1324 (1995).
The court declined to extend Powers to a claim of discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreperson. It also
found Hobby v. United States, 468 U. S. 339 (1984), did not

Opinion of the Court
afford Campbell standing to raise a due process objection.In Hobby, this Court held no relief could be granted to a

white defendant even if his due process rights were violatedby discrimination in the selection of a federal grand jury
foreperson. Noting that Hobby turned on the ministerialnature of the federal grand jury foreperson's duties, the Louisiana Supreme Court held "[t]he role of the grand jury fore-man in Louisiana appears to be similarly ministerial" such
that any discrimination "has little, if any, effect on the de-fendant's due process right of fundamental fairness." 661
So. 2d, at 1324. Because the Court of Appeal had not ad-dressed Campbell's other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case. After the Court ofAppeal rejected Campbell's remaining claims, 673 So. 2d
1061 (1996), the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to recon-sider its ruling on the grand jury issue, 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).
We granted certiorari to address the narrow question ofCampbell's standing to raise equal protection, due process,
and fair-cross-section claims. 521 U. S. 1151 (1997).

II
As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains aboutmore than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury

foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the compo-sition of the grand jury itself. In the federal system and in
most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is se-lected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.
See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman, & M. Elston, GrandJury Law and Practice $ 4:6, pp. 4-20 to 4-21 (2d ed. 1997)
(either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grandjurors elect him or her). Under those systems, the title
"foreperson" is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurorswithout any change in the grand jury's composition. In
Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson fromthe grand jury venire before the remaining members of the
grand jury have been chosen by lot. La. Code Crim. Proc.

Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also 1 Beale, supra,at 4-22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use

procedures similar to Louisiana's). In addition to his otherduties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the
same full voting powers as other grand jury members. Asa result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson,
he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of thedrawing system used to compose the balance of that body.
These considerations require us to treat the case as one al-leging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

III
Standing to litigate often turns on imprecise distinctionsand requires difficult line-drawing. On occasion, however,

we can ascertain standing with relative ease by applyingrules established in prior cases. See

Allen v. Wright, 468U. S. 737, 751 (1984). Campbell's equal protection claim is

such an instance.In

Powers v. Ohio, supra, we found a white defendant hadstanding to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges. We determinedthe defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights
of the excluded jurors. Recognizing our general reluctanceto permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we
found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defend-ant suffered an "injury in fact"; (2) he had a "close relationship" to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hin-drance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.
Powers, supra, at 411 (citing Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S.106 (1976)). We concluded a white defendant suffers a serious injury in fact because discrimination at the voir direstage " `casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process'
. . . and places the fairness of a criminal proceeding in doubt."499 U. S., at 411. This cloud of doubt deprives the defendant
of the certainty that a verdict in his case "is given in accord-ance with the law by persons who are fair." Id., at 413.

523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
398 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of the Court
Second, the excluded juror and criminal defendant have aclose relationship: They share a common interest in eliminating discrimination, and the criminal defendant has an in-centive to serve as an effective advocate because a victory
may result in overturning his conviction. Id., at 413-414.
Third, given the economic burdens of litigation and the smallfinancial reward available, "a juror dismissed because of race

probably will leave the courtroom possessing little incentiveto set in motion the arduous process needed to vindicate his
own rights." Id., at 415. Upon consideration of these fac-tors, we concluded a white defendant had standing to bring
an equal protection challenge to racial discrimination against
black persons in the petit jury selection process.

Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of
grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, Powers' reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing. Our prior
cases have not decided whether a white defendant's own
equal protection rights are violated when the composition
of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black
persons. We do not need to address this issue because
Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand
jury service on the basis of their race. See Tr. 9 (Dec. 2,
1993); see also Carter v. Jury Comm'n of Greene Cty., 396
U. S. 320, 329-330 (1970) (racial exclusion of prospective
grand and petit jurors violates their constitutional rights).
Campbell satisfies the three preconditions for third-party
standing outlined in Powers.

Regardless of his or her skin color, the accused suffers a
significant injury in fact when the composition of the grand
jury is tainted by racial discrimination. "[D]iscrimination
on the basis of race in the selection of members of a grand
jury . . . strikes at the fundamental values of our judicial
system" because the grand jury is a central component of the
criminal justice process. Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 556
(1979). The Fifth Amendment requires the Federal Gov523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

399Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ernment to use a grand jury to initiate a prosecution, and 22States adopt a similar rule as a matter of state law. See 1

Beale, supra, $ 1:2, at 1-3; see also Hurtado v. California,110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement is not binding on the States). The grand jury, like the
petit jury, "acts as a vital check against the wrongful exer-cise of power by the State and its prosecutors."

Powers,
supra, at 411. It controls not only the initial decision to in-dict, but also significant decisions such as how many counts

to charge and whether to charge a greater or lesser offense,including the important decision to charge a capital crime.
See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263 (1986). The integrity of these decisions depends on the integrity of the process
used to select the grand jurors. If that process is infected
with racial discrimination, doubt is cast over the fairness of
all subsequent decisions. See Rose, supra, at 555-556 ("Selection of members of a grand jury because they are of one
race and not another destroys the appearance of justice and
thereby casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process").

Powers emphasized the harm inflicted when a prosecutor
discriminates by striking racial minorities in open court and
in front of the entire jury pool. The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless
in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412-413. The State
suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single
grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the
discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel;
it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the
course of years. See Brief for Respondent 16. This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations. In Powers, even if the prosecutor had been motivated
by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant's
fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias. If,
by contrast, the allegations here are true, the impartiality
and discretion of the judge himself would be called into
question.

400 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of the Court
The remaining two preconditions to establish third-partystanding are satisfied with little trouble. We find no reason

why a white defendant would be any less effective as an ad-vocate for excluded grand jurors than for excluded petit jurors. See Powers, supra, at 413-414. The defendant andthe excluded grand juror share a common interest in eradicating discrimination from the grand jury selection process,and the defendant has a vital interest in asserting the excluded juror's rights because his conviction may be over-turned as a result. See

Vasquez, supra, at 264; Rose, supra,at 551; Cassell v. Texas, 339 U. S. 282 (1950). The State contends Campbell's connection to "the excluded class of . . .jurors . . . who were not called to serve . . . for the prior
161/2 years is tenuous, at best." Brief for Respondent 22.This argument confuses Campbell's underlying claim with
the evidence needed to prove it. To assert the rights ofthose venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the
grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusionwas on account of intentional discrimination. He seeks to
do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venire-persons in other cases, see

Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U. S.482, 494 (1977), but this does not mean he seeks to assert

those venirepersons' rights. As a final matter, excludedgrand jurors have the same economic disincentives to assert
their own rights as do excluded petit jurors. See Powers,
supra, at 415. We find Campbell, like any other white de-fendant, has standing to raise an equal protection challenge

It is axiomatic that one has standing to litigate his or herown due process rights. We need not explore the nature

and extent of a defendant's due process rights when he al-leges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, and confine
our holding to his standing to raise the issue. Our decisionin Peters v. Kiff addressed the due process question, al523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

401Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
though a majority of Justices could not agree on a comprehensive statement of the rule or an appropriate remedy for
any violation. See 407 U. S. 493, 504 (1972) (opinion of Marshall, J.) ("[W]hatever his race, a criminal defendant has
standing to challenge the system used to select his grand . . .
jury, on the ground that it arbitrarily excludes . . . members
of any race, and thereby denies him due process of law"); id.,
at 507 (White, J., joined by Brennan and Powell, JJ., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he strong statutory policy of [18
U. S. C.] $ 243, which reflects the central concern of the Fourteenth Amendment" permits a white defendant to challenge
discrimination in grand jury selection). Our more recent
decision in Hobby v. United States proceeded on the implied
assumption that a white defendant had standing to raise a
due process objection to discriminatory appointment of a federal grand jury foreperson and skipped ahead to the question
whether a remedy was available. 468 U. S., at 350. It is
unnecessary here to discuss the nature and full extent of due
process protection in the context of grand jury selection.
That issue, to the extent it is still open based upon our earlier
precedents, should be determined on the merits, assuming a
court finds it necessary to reach the point in light of the
concomitant equal protection claim. The relevant assumption of Hobby, and our holding here, is that a defendant has
standing to litigate whether his conviction was procured by
means or procedures which contravene due process.

The Louisiana Supreme Court erred in reading Hobby to
foreclose Campbell's standing to bring a due process challenge. 661 So. 2d, at 1324. In Hobby, we held discrimination in the selection of a federal grand jury foreperson did
not infringe principles of fundamental fairness because the
foreperson's duties were "ministerial." See Hobby, supra,
at 345-346. In this case, the Louisiana Supreme Court decided a Louisiana grand jury foreperson's duties were ministerial too, but then couched its decision in terms of Camp523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
402 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of the Court
bell's lack of standing to litigate a due process claim. 661So. 2d, at 1324.

The Louisiana Supreme Court was wrong on both counts.Its interpretation of

Hobby is inconsistent with the implicit
assumption of standing we have just noted and with our explicit reasoning in that case. In Hobby, a federal grand juryforeperson was selected from the existing grand jurors, so

the decision to pick one grand juror over another, at leastarguably, affected the defendant only if the foreperson was
given some significant duties that he would not have hadas a regular grand juror. See

supra, at 396. Against this
background, the Court rejected the defendant's claim because the ministerial role of a federal grand jury foreperson
"is not such a vital one that discrimination in the appointment of an individual to that post significantly invades" due
process. Hobby, supra, at 346. Campbell's challenge is different in kind and degree because it implicates the impermissible appointment of a member of the grand jury. See
supra, at 396-397. What concerns Campbell is not the foreperson's performance of his duty to preside, but performance
as a grand juror, namely, voting to charge Campbell with
second-degree murder.

The significance of this distinction was acknowledged by
Hobby's discussion of a previous case, Rose v. Mitchell, 443
U. S. 545 (1979). In Rose, we assumed relief could be
granted for a constitutional challenge to discrimination in the
appointment of a state grand jury foreperson. See id., at
556. Hobby distinguished Rose in part because it involved
Tennessee's grand jury system. Under the Tennessee law
then in effect, 12 members of the grand jury were selected
at random, and then the judge appointed a 13th member who
also served as foreperson. See Hobby, 468 U. S., at 347. As
a result, Hobby pointed out discrimination in selection of
the foreperson in Tennessee was much more serious than
in the federal system because the former can affect the composition of the grand jury whereas the latter cannot: "So

Opinion of Thomas, J.
long as the grand jury itself is properly constituted, thereis no risk that the appointment of any one of its members

as foreman will distort the overall composition of the arrayor otherwise taint the operation of the judicial process."
Id., at 348. By its own terms, then, Hobby does not addressa claim like Campbell's.

V
One of the questions raised on certiorari is whether Camp-bell also has standing to raise a fair-cross-section claim. It

appears neither the Louisiana Supreme Court nor the Louisi-ana Court of Appeal discussed this contention. "With `very
rare exceptions,' . . . we will not consider a petitioner's fed-eral claim unless it was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we havebeen asked to review."

Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83,86 (1997) (per curiam). Campbell has made no effort to

meet his burden of showing this issue was properly pre-sented to the Louisiana appellate courts, even after the State
pointed out this omission before this Court. See Brief forRespondent 29-30. In fact, Campbell devotes no more than
one page of text in his brief to his fair-cross-section claim.See Brief for Petitioner 31-32. We decline to address the
issue.The judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is reversed.
The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsist-ent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I fail to understand how the rights of blacks excluded fromjury service can be vindicated by letting a white murderer
go free. Yet, in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991), theCourt held that a white criminal defendant had standing to
challenge his criminal conviction based upon alleged viola-tions of the equal protection rights of black prospective ju523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of Thomas, J.
rors. Today's decision, rather than merely reaffirming Powers' misguided doctrine of third-party standing, applies that
doctrine to a context in which even Powers' rationales are
inapplicable. Because Powers is both incorrect as an initial
matter and inapposite to the case at hand, I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion. I join Parts I, II,
IV, and V and concur in the judgment reversing and remanding to the Louisiana Supreme Court.

Powers broke new ground by holding for the first time
that a criminal defendant may raise an equal protection challenge to the use of peremptory strikes to exclude jurors of a
different race. See id., at 422 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (explaining that Powers was inconsistent with "a vast body of
clear statement" in our precedents). Recognizing that the
defendant could not claim that his own equal protection
rights had been denied, the Court held that the defendant
had standing to assert the equal protection rights of veniremen excluded from the jury. Id., at 410-416. The Court
concluded that the defendant had such "third party standing" because three criteria had been met: he had suffered an
"injury in fact"; he had a "close relation" to the excluded
jurors; and there was "some hindrance" to the jurors' ability
to protect their own interests. Id., at 410-411.

Powers distorted standing principles and equal protection
law and should be overruled.1 As Justice Scalia explained at length in his dissent, the defendant in Powers

1 As I have explained elsewhere, the entire line of cases following Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986) (holding that the Equal Protection
Clause applies to the use of peremptory strikes), including Powers, is a
misguided effort to remedy a general societal wrong by using the Constitution to regulate the traditionally discretionary exercise of peremptory challenges. The Batson doctrine, rather than helping to ensure the
fairness of criminal trials, serves only to undercut that fairness by emphasizing the rights of excluded jurors at the expense of the traditional
protections accorded criminal defendants of all races. See Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 60-62 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
could not satisfy even the first element of standing--injury
in fact. Id., at 426-429. The defendant, though certainly
displeased with his conviction, failed to demonstrate that the
alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges against
veniremen of another race had any effect on the outcome of
his trial. The Court instead found that the defendant had
suffered a "cognizable" injury because racial discrimination
in jury selection " `casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial
process' " and "invites cynicism respecting the jury's neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law." Id., at 411-412.
But the severity of an alleged wrong and a perception of
unfairness do not constitute injury in fact. Indeed, " `[i]njury in perception' would seem to be the very antithesis of
`injury in fact.' " Id., at 427 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Furthermore, there is no reason why a violation of a third party's right to serve on a jury should be grounds for reversal
when other violations of third-party rights, such as obtaining
evidence against the defendant in violation of another person's Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights, are not. Id., at
429 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Powers further rested on an alleged "close relation[ship]"
that arises between a defendant and veniremen because voir
dire permits them "to establish a relation, if not a bond of
trust," that continues throughout the trial. Id., at 411, 413.
According to the Court, excluded veniremen share the accused's interest in eliminating racial discrimination because
a peremptory strike inflicts upon a venireman a "profound
personal humiliation heightened by its public character."
Id., at 413-414. But there was simply no basis for the
Court's finding of a "close relation[ship]" or "common interest," id., at 413, between black veniremen and white defendants. Regardless of whether black veniremen wish to serve
on a particular jury, they do not share the white defendant's
interest in obtaining a reversal of his conviction. Surely a
black venireman would be dismayed to learn that a white

Opinion of Thomas, J.
defendant used the venireman's constitutional rights as ameans to overturn the defendant's conviction.

2

Finally, Powers concluded that there are substantial ob-stacles to suit by excluded veniremen, including the costs

of proceeding individually and the difficulty of establishinga likelihood of recurrence.

Id., at 414-415. These obsta-cles, though perhaps often present in the context of Batson

v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), are alone insufficient tojustify third-party standing.

Even if the Powers justifications were persuasive, theywould still be wholly inapplicable to this case, which involves
neither peremptory strikes nor discrimination in the selec-tion of the petit jury. The "injury in fact" allegedly present
in Powers is wholly absent from the context at hand. Powers reasoned that repeated peremptory strikes of membersof one race constituted an "overt wrong, often apparent to

the entire jury panel," that threatened to "cas[t] doubt overthe obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court
to adhere to the law throughout the trial of the cause."
Powers, 499 U. S., at 412. Here, in contrast, the judgeselected one member of the grand jury venire to serve as

foreman, and the remaining members of the grand jury wereselected at random. Even if discriminatory, the judge's
selection (rather than exclusion) of a single member of thegrand jury could hardly constitute an "overt" wrong that
would affect the remainder of the grand jury proceedings,much less the subsequent trial. The Court therefore resorts
to emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation of racial dis-crimination (as though repetition conveys some talismanic
power), but that, of course, cannot substitute for injury infact.

In this case, unlike Powers, petitioner's allegation of injuryin fact is not merely unsupported; it is directly foreclosed.
There is no allegation in this case that the composition of

2 Of course, the same sense of dismay would arise if the defendant and
the excluded venireman were of the same race.

407Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
petitioner's trial jury was affected by discrimination. In-stead, the allegation is merely that there was discrimination

in the selection of the grand jury (and of only one member).The properly constituted petit jury's verdict of guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt was in no way affected by the compo-sition of the grand jury. Indeed, to the extent that race
played any part in the composition of petitioner's petit jury,it was by petitioner's own actions, as petitioner used 5 of his
12 peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit juryvenire. Petitioner's attempt to assert that he was injured
by the alleged exclusion of blacks at the grand jury stage is
belied by his own use of peremptory strikes against blacks
at the petit jury stage.It would be to no avail to suggest that the alleged discrimination in grand jury selection could have caused an indict-ment improperly to be rendered, because the petit jury's verdict conclusively establishes that no reasonable grand jurycould have failed to indict petitioner.

3 Nor can the Court

find support in our precedents allowing a defendant to chal-lenge his conviction based upon discrimination in grand jury

selection, because all of those cases involved defendants'assertions of

their own rights. See, e. g., Rose v. Mitchell,
443 U. S. 545 (1979); Cassell v. Texas, 339 U. S. 282 (1950).Although we often do not require a criminal defendant to

establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the proce-dural illegality and the subsequent conviction when the defendant asserts a denial of his own rights, see 499 U. S., at
427-428 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (noting that the governmentgenerally bears the burden of establishing harmlessness of

such errors), even the Powers majority acknowledged that

3 For this reason, it is unlikely that petitioner ultimately will prevail on
the merits of his due process claim. However, I agree with the Court's
conclusion that petitioner has standing to raise that claim because petitioner asserts his own due process right. I join Part IV of the Court's
opinion because it addresses only standing and does not address "the
nature and extent" of petitioner's due process right. Ante, at 400.

523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
408 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of Thomas, J.
such a showing is the foremost requirement of third-party
standing, as evidenced by the lengths to which it went in an
attempt to justify its finding of injury in fact.

The Court's finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen
whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.
The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights
petitioner seeks to vindicate. Is it all veniremen who were
not chosen as foreman? Is it all nonwhite veniremen? All
black veniremen? Or just the black veniremen who were
not ultimately chosen for the grand jury? Leaving aside
the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I
fail to see how a "close relationship" could have developed
between petitioner and the veniremen. Even if a "bond,"
Powers v. Ohio, supra, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during voir dire, such a bond could not
develop in the context of a judge's selection of a grand jury
foreman--a context in which the defendant plays no role.
Nor can any "common interest" between a defendant and
excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation
suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish's process of selecting foremen does not constitute "overt" action against particular veniremen. Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one)
are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.

Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of
another race to do so for them. In contrast to the Batson
line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination
in the defendant's case alone, in this case petitioner alleges
systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish. Such systematic discrimination
provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportu523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
nity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeatedviolations.

For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner--who doesnot claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the out-come of his trial--lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen. Accordingly, I joinParts I, II, IV, and V of the Court's opinion and concur in
the judgment.

Syllabus

BEACH et ux. v. OCWEN FEDERAL BANK
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 97-5310. Argued March 2, 1998--Decided April 21, 1998
Petitioners David and Linda Beach refinanced their Florida house in 1986

with a loan from Great Western Bank. In 1991, they stopped making
mortgage payments, and in 1992 Great Western began this foreclosure
proceeding. Respondent bank was thereafter substituted as the plaintiff. The Beaches acknowledged their default but raised affirmative defenses, alleging, inter alia, that the bank's failure to make disclosures
required by the Truth in Lending Act gave them the right under 15
U. S. C. $ 1635 to rescind the mortgage agreement. The Florida trial
court rejected that defense, holding, among other things, that any right
to rescind had expired in 1989 under $ 1635(f), which provides that the
right of rescission "shall expire" three years after the loan closes. The
State's intermediate appellate court affirmed, as did the Florida Supreme Court. That court remarked that $ 1635(f)'s plain language evidences an unconditional congressional intent to limit the right of rescission to three years and distinguished its prior cases permitting a
recoupment defense by ostensibly barred claims as involving statutes of
limitation, not statutes extinguishing rights defensively asserted.

Held: A borrower may not assert the $ 1635 right to rescind as an affirmative defense in a collection action brought by the lender after $ 1635(f)'s
3-year period has run. Absent "the clearest congressional language"
to the contrary, Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S. 258, 264, a defendant may
raise a claim in recoupment, a " `defense arising out of some feature of
the transaction upon which the plaintiff's action is grounded,' " Rothensies v. Electric Storage Battery Co., 329 U. S. 296, 299 (quoting Bull v.
United States, 295 U. S. 247, 262), even if the applicable statute of limitation would otherwise bar the claim as an independent cause of action.
The 3-year period of $ 1635(f), however, is not a statute of limitation
that governs only the institution of suit; instead, it operates, with the
lapse of time, to extinguish the right of rescission. The section's uncompromising statement that the borrower's right "shall expire" with
the running of time manifests a congressional intent to extinguish completely the right of rescission at the end of the 3-year period. The
absence of a provision authorizing rescission as a defense stands in stark
contrast to $ 1640(e), which expressly provides that the Act's 1-year limitation on actions for recovery of damages "does not bar . . . assert[ion
of] a violation . . . in an action . . . brought more than one year from the

Opinion of the Court
date of the . . . violation as a matter of defense by recoupment." This
quite different treatment of recoupment of damages and rescission in the
nature of recoupment must be understood to reflect a deliberate intent on the part of Congress, see Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29-

30, and makes perfectly good sense. Since a statutory rescission right
could cloud a bank's title on foreclosure, Congress may well have chosen
to circumscribe that risk, while permitting recoupment of damages regardless of the date a collection action may be brought. Pp. 415-419.

Under the Truth in Lending Act, 82 Stat. 146, 15 U. S. C.$ 1601 et seq., when a loan made in a consumer credit transaction is secured by the borrower's principal dwelling, theborrower may rescind the loan agreement if the lender fails
to deliver certain forms or to disclose important terms accu-rately. See 15 U. S. C. $ 1635. Under $ 1635(f) of the statute, this right of rescission "shall expire" in the usual casethree years after the loan closes or upon the sale of the secured property, whichever date is earlier.

of the transaction. We answer no and hold that $ 1635(f)completely extinguishes the right of rescission at the end of

the 3-year period. I

The declared purpose of the Act is "to assure a meaningfuldisclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able
to compare more readily the various credit terms availableto him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect
the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing andcredit card practices." 15 U. S. C. $ 1601(a); see

Mourningv. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U. S. 356, 363-368

(1973). Accordingly, the Act requires creditors to provideborrowers with clear and accurate disclosures of terms dealing with things like finance charges, annual percentage ratesof interest, and the borrower's rights. See $$ 1631, 1632,
1635, 1638. Failure to satisfy the Act subjects a lender tocriminal penalties for noncompliance, see $ 1611, as well as
to statutory and actual damages traceable to a lender's fail-ure to make the requisite disclosures, see $ 1640. Section
1640(e) provides that an action for such damages "may bebrought" within one year after a violation of the Act, but
that a borrower may assert the right to damages "as a mat-ter of defense by recoupment or set-off " in a collection action
brought by the lender even after the one year is up.Going beyond these rights to damages, the Act also authorizes a borrower whose loan is secured with his "principaldwelling," and who has been denied the requisite disclosures,
to rescind the loan transaction entirely "until midnight ofthe third business day following the consummation of the
transaction or the delivery of the information and rescis-sion forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under thissubchapter, whichever is later." $ 1635(a). A borrower
who exercises this right to rescind "is not liable for any fi-nance or other charge, and any security interest given by
[him], including any such interest arising by operation of law,becomes void" upon rescission. $ 1635(b). Within 20 days

Opinion of the Court
after receiving notice of rescission, the lender must "returnto the [borrower] any money or property given as earnest

money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any ac-tion necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of
any security interest created under the transaction." Ibid.The Act provides, however, that the borrower's right of rescission "shall expire three years after the date of consum-mation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property,
whichever occurs first," even if the required disclosures havenever been made. $ 1635(f ).

1 The Act gives a borrower no

express permission to assert the right of rescission as anaffirmative defense after the expiration of the 3-year period.

The borrowers in this case, petitioners David and LindaBeach, built a house in Jupiter, Florida, in 1986 with a secured $85,000 construction loan from Fidelity Federal Sav-ings Bank of Florida. In the same year, the Beaches refinanced the house with a loan from Great Western Bank.2 In1991, the Beaches stopped making mortgage payments, and
in 1992 the bank began this foreclosure proceeding. TheBeaches acknowledged their default but raised affirmative
defenses, alleging that the bank's failure to make disclosuresrequired by the Act

"(1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter
institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within

rate, in violation of $ 1638(a)(4); (4) the number, amounts, and timing of

414 BEACH v. OCWEN FED. BANK

Opinion of the Court
1640 to rescind the mortgage agreement and to reduce thebank's claim by the amount of their actual and statutory

damages.The Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida
agreed that under $ 1640 the Beaches were entitled to "off-set the amount owed to Great Western" by $396 in actual
damages and $1,000 in statutory damages because the bankhad overstated the monthly mortgage payment by $0.58 and
the finance charge by $201.84. But the court rejected theBeaches' effort to rescind the mortgage under $ 1635, holding
that the loan at issue was immune to rescission as part of a"residential mortgage transaction" (defined in $ 1602(w)) and,
in the alternative, that any right to rescind had expired afterthree years, in 1989. The court found it telling that Congress had included no saving clause to revive an expiredright of rescission as a defense in the nature of recoupment
or setoff.The State's intermediate appellate court affirmed, Beach
v. Great Western Bank, 670 So. 2d 986 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct.App. 1996), and so did the Supreme Court of Florida, which
addressed only the issue of rescission as a defense, Beach
v. Great Western Bank, 692 So. 2d 146 (1997).4 That courtremarked on the plain language of $ 1635(f) as evidence of

unconditional congressional intent to limit the right of rescission to three years and explained that its prior cases permit-ting a defense of recoupment by an ostensibly barred claim

were distinguishable because, among other things, they involved statutes of limitation, not statutes extinguishingrights defensively asserted.

Because the reading of $ 1635(f) given by the SupremeCourt of Florida conflicts with the decisions of several other

payments scheduled to repay the obligation, in violation of $ 1638(a)(6);
and (5) the total of payments, in violation of $ 1638(a)(5).

4 Although the per curiam opinion posed the question as one "[u]nder

Florida law," 692 So. 2d, at 147, it distinguished cases based on state law
as inapposite and held that a defense of rescission was unavailable under
the Act after three years.

courts,5 we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 912 (1997), to deter-mine whether under federal law the statutory right of rescission provided by $ 1635 may be revived as an affirmativedefense after its expiration under $ 1635(f ). We affirm.

II
The Beaches concede that any right they may have had toinstitute an independent proceeding for rescission under

$ 1635 lapsed in 1989, three years after they closed the loanwith the bank, but they argue that the restriction to three
years in $ 1635(f) is a statute of limitation governing onlythe institution of suit and accordingly has no effect when a
borrower claims a $ 1635 right of rescission as a "defense inrecoupment" to a collection action. They are, of course, correct that as a general matter a defendant's right to plead"recoupment," a " `defense arising out of some feature of the
transaction upon which the plaintiff 's action is grounded,' "Rothensies v. Electric Storage Battery Co., 329 U. S. 296, 299
(1946) (quoting Bull v. United States, 295 U. S. 247, 262(1935)), survives the expiration of the period provided by a
statute of limitation that would otherwise bar the recoup-ment claim as an independent cause of action. So long as
the plaintiff 's action is timely, see ibid., a defendant mayraise a claim in recoupment even if he could no longer bring
it independently, absent " `the clearest congressional lan-guage' " to the contrary.

Opinion of the Court
applied to bar an otherwise legitimate defense to a timely
lawsuit, for limitation statutes "are aimed at lawsuits, not at
the consideration of particular issues in lawsuits," ibid.

The Beaches come up short, however, on the question
whether this is a case for the general rule at all. The issue
here is not whether limitation statutes affect recoupment
rights, but whether $ 1635(f) is a statute of limitation, that
is, "whether [it] operates, with the lapse of time, to extinguish the right which is the foundation for the claim" or
"merely to bar the remedy for its enforcement." Midstate
Horticultural Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 320 U. S. 356, 358-
359, and n. 4 (1943). The "ultimate question" is whether
Congress intended that "the right shall be enforceable in any
event after the prescribed time," id., at 360; accord, Burnett
v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U. S. 424 (1965), and in this

instance, the answer is apparent from the plain language of

$ 1635(f ). See Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508
U. S. 402, 409 (1993).

The terms of a typical statute of limitation provide that a
cause of action may or must be brought within a certain period of time. So, in Reiter v. Cooper, supra, at 263-264, we
concluded that 49 U. S. C. $ 11706(c)(2), providing that a shipper " `must begin a civil action to recover damages under
[$ 11705(b)(3)] within two years after the claim accrues,' "
was a statute of limitation raising no bar to a claim made in
recoupment. See Note, Developments in the Law: Statutes
of Limitations, 63 Harv. L. Rev. 1177, 1179 (1950) (most statutes of limitation provide either that "all actions . . . shall
be brought within" or "no action . . . shall be brought more
than" so many years after "the cause thereof accrued" (internal quotation marks omitted)); H. Wood, 1 Limitation of
Actions $ 1, pp. 2-3 (4th ed. 1916) ("[S]tatutes which provide that no action shall be brought, or right enforced, unless
brought or enforced within a certain time, are . . . statutes
of limitation").

Opinion of the Court
To be sure, a limitation provision may be held to be nothing more than a bar to bringing suit, even though its terms
are ostensibly more ambitious than the language of the classic formulations cited above. Thus, for example, in Distribution Servs., Ltd. v. Eddie Parker Interests, Inc., 897 F. 2d
811 (1990), the Fifth Circuit concluded that $ 3(6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act is a statute of limitation permitting counterclaim brought by way of recoupment, despite its
fierce-sounding provision that "the carrier and the ship shall
be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage
unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the
goods," 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1303(6).

Section 1635(f), however, takes us beyond any question
whether it limits more than the time for bringing a suit, by
governing the life of the underlying right as well. The subsection says nothing in terms of bringing an action but instead provides that the "right of rescission [under the Act]
shall expire" at the end of the time period. It talks not of
a suit's commencement but of a right's duration, which it addresses in terms so straightforward as to render any limitation on the time for seeking a remedy superfluous. There is
no reason, then, even to resort to the canons of construction
that we use to resolve doubtful cases, such as the rule that
the creation of a right in the same statute that provides a
limitation is some evidence that the right was meant to be
limited, not just the remedy. See Midstate Horticultural
Co., supra, at 360; Burnett, supra, at 427, n. 2; Davis v. Mills,
194 U. S. 451, 454 (1904).

The Act, however, has left even less to chance (if that is
possible) than its "expire" provision would allow, standing
alone. It is useful to look ahead to $ 1640 with its provisions for recovery of damages. Subsection (e) reads that the
1-year limit on actions for damages "does not bar a person
from asserting a violation of this subchapter in an action to
collect the debt which was brought more than one year from

Opinion of the Court
the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter ofdefense by recoupment or set-off in such action, except as

otherwise provided by State law." 15 U. S. C. $ 1640(e).Thus the effect of the 1-year limitation provision on damages
actions is expressly deflected from recoupment claims. Thequite different treatment of rescission stands in stark contrast to this, however, there being no provision for rescissionas a defense that would mitigate the uncompromising provision of $ 1635(f) that the borrower's right "shall expire" withthe running of the time. Indeed, when Congress amended
the Act in 1995 to soften certain restrictions on rescission asa defense in $ 8, 109 Stat. 275-276, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1635(i)(1)
and (2) (1994 ed., Supp. I), it took care to provide thatany such liberality was "subject to the [three year] time period provided in subsection (f)," ibid., and it left a borrower'sonly hope for further recoupment in the slim promise of

$ 1635(i)(3), that "[n]othing in this subsection affects a con-sumer's right of rescission in recoupment under State law."

$ 8, 109 Stat. 276.6 Thus, recoupment of damages and rescis-sion in the nature of recoupment receive unmistakably different treatments, which under the normal rule of constructionare understood to reflect a deliberate intent on the part of
Congress. See Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29-30(1997) (" ` "[W]here Congress includes particular language
in one section of a statute but omits it in another section ofthe same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts
intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or ex-clusion" ' ") (quoting

Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,23 (1983), in turn quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,

472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)). And the distinction thusindicated makes perfectly good sense. Since a statutory
right of rescission could cloud a bank's title on foreclosure,

6 Since there is no claim before us that Florida law purports to provide
any right to rescind defensively on the grounds relevant under the Act,
we have no occasion to explore how state recoupment law might work
when raised in a foreclosure proceeding outside the 3-year period.

Opinion of the Court
Congress may well have chosen to circumscribe that risk,while permitting recoupment damages regardless of the date

a collection action may be brought. See Board of Governorsof Federal Reserve System, Annual Report to Congress on
Truth in Lending for the Year 1971, p. 19 (Jan. 3, 1972); Na-tional Commission on Consumer Finance, Consumer Credit
in the United States 189-190 (Dec. 1972).We respect Congress's manifest intent by concluding that
the Act permits no federal right to rescind, defensively orotherwise, after the 3-year period of $ 1635(f ) has run. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court ofFlorida.

It is so ordered.

MILLER v. ALBRIGHT, SECRETARY OF STATE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 96-1060. Argued November 4, 1997--Decided April 22, 1998
Petitioner was born out of wedlock in 1970 in the Philippines. Her

mother is a Filipino national. Her father, Charlie Miller, is an American citizen residing in Texas who served in the United States military
in the Philippines at the time of petitioner's conception. He never married petitioner's mother, and there is no evidence that he was in the
Philippines at the time of her birth or that he ever returned there after
completing his tour of duty. In 1992, the State Department denied petitioner's application for registration as a United States citizen. After a
Texas court granted Mr. Miller's petition for a paternity decree finding
him to be her father, petitioner reapplied for citizenship status, which
was again denied on the ground that the Texas decree did not satisfy 8
U. S. C. $ 1409(a)(4)'s requirement that a child born out of wedlock and
outside the United States to an alien mother and an American father be
legitimated before age 18 in order to acquire citizenship. Petitioner
and Mr. Miller then sued the Secretary of State in Federal District
Court in Texas, seeking a judgment declaring her to be a United States
citizen. They emphasized that the citizenship of an out-of-wedlock,
foreign-born child of an alien father and an American mother is established at birth under $ 1409(c), and alleged that $ 1409's different treatment of citizen fathers and citizen mothers violated Mr. Miller's Fifth
Amendment equal protection right by utilizing the suspect classification
of gender without justification. Concluding that Mr. Miller did not have
standing, the court dismissed him as a party and transferred venue to
the District Court for the District of Columbia. That court dismissed
the suit on the ground that federal courts do not have power to grant
citizenship. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had
standing to sue, but concluding that the $ 1409 requirements imposed on
a child like her, but not on the foreign-born, out-of-wedlock child of an
American mother, were justified by governmental interests in fostering
the child's ties with this country and with her citizen parent.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
96 F. 3d 1467, affirmed.

Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice, concluded that

$ 1409(a)(4)'s requirement that children born abroad and out of
wedlock to citizen fathers, but not to citizen mothers, obtain formal

Syllabus
proof of paternity by age 18 does not violate the Fifth Amendment.
Pp. 428-445.

(a) The foregoing is the only issue presented by this case's facts.
Certain other issues need not be resolved: Whether Fiallo v. Bell, 430
U. S. 787, dictates the outcome here; the validity of the distinction
drawn by $$ 1401(g) and 1409(c) between residency requirements for
unmarried citizen fathers and unmarried citizen mothers wishing to
transmit citizenship at birth to their foreign-born, out-of-wedlock children; and the validity of $$ 1409(a)(1) and (a)(3), which impose additional
requirements on citizen fathers wishing to transmit such citizenship.
Because petitioner is contesting the Government's refusal to register
and treat her as a citizen, a judgment in her favor would confirm her
pre-existing citizenship rather than grant her rights that she does not
now possess. The Court of Appeals was therefore correct that she has
standing to invoke the federal courts' jurisdiction. Moreover, because
her claim relies heavily on the proposition that her citizen father should
have the same right to transmit citizenship as would a citizen mother,
the Court should evaluate the alleged discrimination against him, as
well as its impact on her. See, e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 193-
197. Pp. 428-433.

(b) The $ 1409(a)(4) rule applicable to each class of out-of-wedlock children born abroad is eminently reasonable and justified by important
Government interests: ensuring reliable proof that a person born out of
wedlock who claims citizenship by birth actually shares a blood relationship with an American citizen; encouraging the development of a
healthy relationship between the citizen parent and the child while the
child is a minor; and fostering ties between the child and the United
States. Male and female parents of foreign-born, out-of-wedlock children are differently situated in several pertinent respects. The child's
blood relationship to its birth mother is immediately obvious and is
typically established by hospital records and birth certificates, but the
relationship to the unmarried father may often be undisclosed and unrecorded in any contemporary public record. Similarly, the child's birth
mother certainly knows of the child's existence and typically will have
immediate custody, whereas, due to the normal interval of nine months
between conception and birth, an unmarried father may not even know
that his child exists, and the child may not know the father's identity.
Section 1409(a)(4)'s requirement--that children born out of wedlock to
citizen fathers obtain formal proof of paternity by age 18, either through
legitimation, written acknowledgment by the father under oath, or
adjudication by a competent court--is well tailored to address these
concerns. The conclusion that Congress may require an affirmative act
by unmarried fathers and their children, but not mothers and their

children, is directly supported by Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248.
Pp. 433-441.

(c) The argument that $ 1409(a)(4) is unconstitutional because it is a
stereotypical "gender-based classification" must be rejected. None of
the governmental interests underlying $ 1409(a)(4) can be fairly characterized as an accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about
the members of either sex. The biological differences between single
men and single women provide a relevant basis for differing rules governing their ability to confer citizenship on children born out of wedlock
in foreign lands, and an impartial analysis of those differences rebuts
the strong presumption that gender-based legal distinctions are suspect.
Pp. 442-445.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy, concluded that petitioner should not be accorded standing to raise her father's gender discrimination claim. This Court applies a presumption against thirdparty standing as a prudential limitation on the exercise of federal
jurisdiction, see, e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 113, and that
presumption may only be rebutted in particular circumstances: where a
litigant has suffered injury in fact and has a close relation to a third
party, and where some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect
his or her own interests exists, see Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 411.
Petitioner has not demonstrated a genuine obstacle to her father's ability to assert his own rights that rises to the level of a hindrance. Accordingly, she is precluded from raising his equal protection claims in
this case. Although petitioner may still assert her own rights, she cannot invoke a gender discrimination claim that would trigger heightened
scrutiny. Section 1409 draws a distinction based on the gender of the
parent, not the child, and any claim of discrimination based on differential treatment of illegitimate versus legitimate children is not presented
in the question on which certiorari was granted. Thus, petitioner's own
constitutional challenge is subject only to rational basis scrutiny. Even
though $ 1409 could not withstand heightened scrutiny, it is sustainable
under the lower standard. Pp. 445-452.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed with the outcome of this case on the ground that the complaint must be dismissed
because the Court has no power to provide the relief requested: conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by Congress.
Petitioner, having been born outside United States territory, can only
become a citizen by naturalization under congressional authority. See,
e. g., United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 702-703. If there
is no congressional enactment granting her citizenship, she remains an
alien. By its plain language, 8 U. S. C. $ 1409 sets forth a precondition
to the acquisition of citizenship that petitioner admittedly has not met.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Thus, even if the Court were to agree that the difference in treatment
between the illegitimate children of citizen fathers and citizen mothers
is unconstitutional, it could not, consistent with the extremely limited
judicial power in this area, see, e. g., Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 792,
remedy that constitutional infirmity by declaring petitioner to be a citizen or ordering the State Department to approve her application for
citizenship, see INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S. 875, 884. This is not a case
in which the Court may remedy an alleged equal protection violation by
either expanding or limiting the benefits conferred so as to deny or
grant them equally to all. Pp. 452-459.

jurisdiction thereof, becomes at once a citizen of the UnitedStates, and needs no naturalization." 169 U. S., at 702.

Persons not born in the United States acquire citizenship bybirth only as provided by Acts of Congress. Id., at 703.

The petitioner in this case challenges the constitutionalityof the statutory provisions governing the acquisition of citizenship at birth by children born out of wedlock and outsideof the United States. The specific challenge is to the distinction drawn by $ 309 of the Immigration and Nationality Act(INA), 66 Stat. 238, as amended, 8 U. S. C. $ 1409, between
the child of an alien father and a citizen mother, on the onehand, and the child of an alien mother and a citizen father, on
the other. Subject to residence requirements for the citizenparent, the citizenship of the former is established at birth;
the citizenship of the latter is not established unless and untileither the father or his child takes certain affirmative steps
to create or confirm their relationship. Petitioner contendsthat the statutory requirement that those steps be taken
while the child is a minor violates the Fifth Amendment be-cause the statute contains no limitation on the time within
which the child of a citizen mother may prove that she be-came a citizen at birth.

We find no merit in the challenge because the statute doesnot impose any limitation on the time within which the members of either class of children may prove that they qualifyfor citizenship. It does establish different qualifications for
citizenship for the two classes of children, but we are per-suaded that the qualifications for the members of each of
those classes, so far as they are implicated by the facts ofthis case, are well supported by valid governmental interests. We therefore conclude that the statutory distinctionis neither arbitrary nor invidious.

later, that she was named Lorena Pen~ ero, that her mother
was Luz Pen~ ero, a Filipino national, and that her birth was

and the nationality of the father are blank.

Petitioner grew up and received her high school and college education in the Philippines. At least until after her
21st birthday, she never lived in the United States. App.

resided outside of the Philippines.1

Petitioner's father, Charlie Miller, is an American citizen
residing in Texas.2 He apparently served in the United
States Air Force and was stationed in the Philippines at the
time of petitioner's conception. Id., at 21. He never married petitioner's mother, and there is no evidence that he was
in the Philippines at the time of petitioner's birth or that he
ever returned there after completing his tour of duty. In
1992, Miller filed a petition in a Texas court to establish his
relationship with petitioner. The petition was unopposed
and the court entered a "Voluntary Paternity Decree" finding him "to be the biological and legal father of Lorelyn Penero Miller." The decree provided that "[t]he parent-child
relationship is created between the father and the child as if
the child were born to the father and mother during marriage." App. to Pet. for Cert. 38.

her mother married a man named Frank Raspotnik and raised a family in
Angeles City. App. 22.

2 Although there is no formal finding that his paternity has been established by clear and convincing evidence, it is undisputed. In a letter to
petitioner's attorney, the State Department acknowledged that it was "satisfied that Mr. Charlie R. Miller, the putative father, is a U. S. citizen, that
he possesses sufficient physical presence in the United States to transmit
citizenship, and that there is sufficient evidence that he had access to the
applicant's mother at the probable time of conception." App. to Pet. for

426 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In November 1991, petitioner filed an application for regis-tration as a United States citizen with the State Department.

The application was denied in March 1992, and petitionerreapplied after her father obtained the paternity decree in
Texas in July 1992. The reapplication was also denied on
the ground that the Texas decree did not satisfy "the re-quirements of Section 309(a)(4) INA, which requires that a

child born out of wedlock be legitimated before age eighteenin order to acquire U. S. citizenship under Section 301(g)
INA (formerly Section 301(a)(7) INA)." Id., at 33. In fur-ther explanation of its reliance on $ 309(a)(4), the denial letter
added: "Without such legitimation before age eighteen, there
is no legally recognized relationship under the INA and the
child acquires no rights of citizenship through an American
citizen parent." 3 Ibid.

II

In 1993, petitioner and her father filed an amended complaint against the Secretary of State in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, seeking a
judgment declaring that petitioner is a citizen of the United
States and that she therefore has the right to possess an
American passport. They alleged that the INA's different
treatment of citizen mothers and citizen fathers violated Mr.
Miller's "right to equal protection under the laws by utilizing
the suspect classification of gender without justification."
App. 11. In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the

3 The comment, of course, related only to cases in which the child born
out of wedlock claims citizenship through her father. Moreover, the reference to age 18 was inaccurate; petitioner was born prior to 1986, when

$ 309(a) was amended to change the relevant age from 21 to 18, see Pub.
L. 99-653, $ 13, 100 Stat. 3657, and she falls within a narrow age bracket
whose members may elect to have the preamendment law apply, see note
following 8 U. S. C. $ 1409 (Effective Date of 1986 Amendment) (quoting

$ 23(e), as added, Pub. L. 100-525, $ 8(r), 102 Stat. 2619). This oversight
does not affect her case, however, because she was over 21 when the Texas
decree was entered.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Government, the District Court concluded that Mr. Millerdid not have standing and dismissed him as a party. Because venue in Texas was therefore improper, see 28 U. S. C.$ 1391(e), the court transferred the case to the District Court
for the District of Columbia, the site of the Secretary's resi-dence. The Government renewed its motion in that forum,
and that court concluded that even though petitioner had suf-fered an injury caused by the Secretary's refusal to register
her as a citizen, the injury was not "redressable" becausefederal courts do not have the power to "grant citizenship."
870 F. Supp. 1, 3 (1994) (citing INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S.875, 884 (1988)).

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitaffirmed, but on different grounds. It first held that petitioner does have standing to challenge the constitutionalityof 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a). If her challenge should succeed, the
court could enter a judgment declaring that she was alreadya citizen pursuant to other provisions of the INA. 96 F. 3d
1467, 1470 (1996). On the merits, however, the court con-cluded that the requirements imposed on the "illegitimate"
child of an American citizen father, but not on the child of acitizen mother, were justified by the interest in fostering the

1409(a)(3) and (4). Ablang [v. Reno], 52 F. 3d at 806.Furthermore, we find it entirely reasonable for Congress to require special evidence of such ties between anillegitimate child and its father. A mother is far less
likely to ignore the child she has carried in her wombthan is the natural father, who may not even be aware
of its existence. As the Court has recognized, `mothersand fathers of illegitimate children are not similarly situated.' Parham v. Hughes, 441 U. S. 347, 355 (1979).

`The putative father often goes his way unconscious ofthe birth of the child. Even if conscious, he is very

often totally unconcerned because of the absence of anyties to the mother.' Id. at 355 n. 7 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). This sex-based distinctionseems especially warranted where, as here, the applicant
for citizenship was fathered by a U. S. serviceman whileserving a tour of duty overseas."

Id., at 1472.

Judge Wald concurred in the judgment despite her opinionthat there is "no rational basis for a law that requires a U. S.

citizen father, but not a U. S. citizen mother, to formally le-gitimate a child before she reaches majority as well as agree
in writing to provide financial support until that date or for-ever forfeit the right to transmit citizenship."

Id., at 1473.While she agreed that "requiring some sort of minimal `family ties' between parent and child, as well as fostering anearly connection between child and country, is rational government policy," she did not agree that those goals justify "aset of procedural hurdles for men--and only men--who wish
to confer citizenship on their children." Id., at 1474. Shenevertheless regretfully concurred in the judgment because
she believed that our decision in Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787(1977), required the court to uphold the constitutionality of

`illegitimate' children of United States citizen fathers aviolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution?" 520 U. S. 1208 (1997).

issues that need not be resolved. First, we need not decidewhether Fiallo v. Bell dictates the outcome of this case, because that case involved the claims of several aliens to a spe-cial immigration preference, whereas here petitioner claims
that she is, and for years has been, an American citizen.4Additionally, Fiallo involved challenges to the statutory distinctions between "illegitimate" and "legitimate" children,which are not encompassed in the question presented in this
case and which we therefore do not consider.

The statutory provision at issue in this case, 8 U. S. C.$ 1409, draws two types of distinctions between citizen fathers and citizen mothers of children born out of wedlock.The first relates to the class of unmarried persons who may
transmit citizenship at birth to their offspring, and the second defines the affirmative steps that are required to trans-mit such citizenship.

With respect to the eligible class of parents, an unmarriedfather may not transmit his citizenship to a child born abroad
to an alien mother unless he satisfies the residency require4 The sections of the INA challenged in Fiallo defined the terms "child"
and "parent," which determine eligibility for the special preference immigration status accorded to the "children" and "parents" of United States
citizens and lawful permanent residents. Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787,
788-789 (1977). " `Child' " was defined to include " `an illegitimate child,
by, through whom, or on whose behalf a status, privilege, or benefit is
sought by virtue of the relationship of the child to its natural mother.' "
Id., at 788-789, n. 1 (quoting 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(b)(1)(D) (1976 ed.)). Thus,
the statute did not permit an illegitimate child to seek preference by
virtue of relationship with its citizen or resident father, nor could an
alien father seek preference based on his illegitimate child's citizenship
or residence. 430 U. S., at 789. Following this Court's decision in Fiallo
upholding those provisions, in 1986 Congress amended the INA to recognize "child" and "parent" status where the preference is sought based on
the relationship of a child born out of wedlock to its natural father "if

the father has or had a bona fide parent-child relationship with the person." Pub. L. 99-603, $ 315(a), 100 Stat. 3439, as amended, 8 U. S. C.

ment in $ 1401(g) that applies to a citizen parent who is married to an alien.5 Under that provision, the citizen parent
must have resided in the United States for a total of at least
five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age
of 14 years.6 If the citizen parent is an unmarried mother,
however, $ 1409(c) rather than $ 1401(g) applies; under that
subsection she need only have had one year of continuous
residence in the United States in order to confer citizenship
on her offspring.7 Since petitioner's father satisfied the residency requirement in $ 1401(g), the validity of the distinction
between that requirement and the unusually generous provision in $ 1409(c) is not at issue.8

5 See 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a) (directing that $$ 1401(c), (d), (e), (g) and 1408(2)
"shall apply" if the specified conditions of $ 1409(a) are met).

6 Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1401 provides:

"The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at
birth:. . . . .

"(g) a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States
and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the
other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person,
was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for
a period or periods totaling not less than five years, at least two of which
were after attaining the age of fourteen years . . . ."

Prior to its amendment in 1986, the section had required residence of
10 total years, at least 5 of which were after attaining the age of 14. See

$ 301(a)(7), 66 Stat. 236.

7 Section 309(c) of the INA, codified in 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(c), provides:

"(c) Notwithstanding the provision of subsection (a) of this section, a person born, after December 23, 1952, outside the United States and out of
wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of
his mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the
time of such person's birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a
continuous period of one year."

8 The Government has offered two explanations for the special rule applicable to unmarried citizen mothers who give birth abroad: first, an assumption that the citizen mother would probably have custody, and second,

431Cite as: 523 U. S. 420 (1998)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
As for affirmative steps, $ 1409(a), as amended in 1986, imposes four requirements concerning unmarried citizen fathers that must be satisfied to confer citizenship "as of the
date of birth" on a person born out of wedlock to an alien
mother in another country. Citizenship for such persons is
established if:

"(1) a blood relationship between the person and the
father is established by clear and convincing evidence,

"(2) the father had the nationality of the United
States at the time of the person's birth,

"(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing
to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years, and

"(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years--
"(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the
person's residence or domicile,

"(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person
in writing under oath, or

"(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court." 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a).

Only the second of these four requirements is expressly
included in $ 1409(c), the provision applicable to unwed citizen mothers. See n. 7, supra. Petitioner, relying heavily
on Judge Wald's separate opinion below, argues that there is
no rational basis for imposing the other three requirements
on children of citizen fathers but not citizen mothers. The
first requirement is not at issue here, however, because the
Government does not question Mr. Miller's blood relationship
with petitioner.

that in most foreign countries the nationality of an illegitimate child is
that of the mother unless paternity has been established. The Government submits that the special rule would minimize the risk that such a
child might otherwise be stateless. See Brief for Respondent 32-34.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Moreover, even though the parties have disputed the validity of the third condition 9--and even though that condition
is repeatedly targeted in Justice Breyer's dissent--we
need not resolve that debate because it is unclear whether
the requirement even applies in petitioner's case; it was
added in 1986, after her birth, and she falls within a special
interim provision that allows her to elect application of the
preamendment $ 1409(a), which required only legitimation
before age 21. See n. 3, supra. And even if the condition
did apply to her claim of citizenship, the State Department's
refusal to register petitioner as a citizen was expressly based
on $ 1409(a)(4). Indeed, since that subsection is written in
the disjunctive, it is only necessary to uphold the least onerous of the three alternative methods of compliance to sustain
the Government's position. Thus, the only issue presented
by the facts of this case is whether the requirement in

$ 1409(a)(4)--that children born out of wedlock to citizen
fathers, but not citizen mothers, obtain formal proof of paternity by age 18, either through legitimation, written acknowledgment by the father under oath, or adjudication by a competent court--violates the Fifth Amendment.

It is of significance that the petitioner in this case, unlike
the petitioners in Fiallo, see 430 U. S., at 790, and n. 3, is
not challenging the denial of an application for special status.
She is contesting the Government's refusal to register and
treat her as a citizen. If she were to prevail, the judgment
in her favor would confirm her pre-existing citizenship
rather than grant her rights that she does not now possess.

9 The Government asserts that the purpose of $ 1409(a)(3) is " `to facilitate the enforcement of a child support order and, thus, lessen the chance
that the child could become a financial burden to the states.' " Brief for

IV
Under the terms of the INA, the joint conduct of a citizenand an alien that results in conception is not sufficient to

produce an American citizen, regardless of whether the citi-zen parent is the male or the female partner. If the two
parties engage in a second joint act--if they agree to marryone another--citizenship will follow. The provision at issue
in this case, however, deals only with cases in which no rele-vant joint conduct occurs after conception; it determines the
ability of each of those parties, acting separately, to confercitizenship on a child born outside of the United States.

If the citizen is the unmarried female, she must first chooseto carry the pregnancy to term and reject the alternative of
abortion--an alternative that is available by law to many,and in reality to most, women around the world. She must
then actually give birth to the child. Section 1409(c) re10 As a threshold matter, the Government now argues--though it never
asserted this position below or in opposition to certiorari--that an alien
outside the territory of the United States "has no substantive rights cognizable under the Fifth Amendment." Brief for Respondent 11-12. Even
if that is so, the question to be decided is whether petitioner is such an
alien or whether, as she claims, she is a citizen. Thus, we must address
the merits to determine whether the predicate for this argument is accurate. In the cases on which the Government relies, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), and United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494
U. S. 259 (1990), it was perfectly clear that the complaining aliens were
not citizens or nationals of the United States.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
wards that choice and that labor by conferring citizenship onher child.

If the citizen is the unmarried male, he need not partici-pate in the decision to give birth rather than to choose an
abortion; he need not be present at the birth; and for at least17 years thereafter he need not provide any parental support, either moral or financial, to either the mother or thechild, in order to preserve his right to confer citizenship on
the child pursuant to $ 1409(a). In order retroactively totransmit his citizenship to the child as of the date of the
child's birth, all that $ 1409(a)(4) requires is that he be willingand able to acknowledge his paternity in writing under oath
while the child is still a minor. 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a)(4)(B). Infact, $ 1409(a)(4) requires even less of the unmarried father--
that provision is alternatively satisfied if, before the childturns 18, its paternity "is established by adjudication of a
competent court." $ 1409(a)(4)(C). It would appear thatthe child could obtain such an adjudication absent any
affirmative act by the father, and perhaps even over hisexpress objection.

There is thus a vast difference between the burdens im-posed on the respective parents of potential citizens born
out of wedlock in a foreign land. It seems obvious that theburdens imposed on the female citizen are more severe than
those imposed on the male citizen by $ 1409(a)(4), the onlyprovision at issue in this case. It is nevertheless argued
that the male citizen and his offspring are the victims ofirrational discrimination because $ 1409(a)(4) is the product
of " `overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilities of menand women.' " Brief for Petitioner 8. We find the argument singularly unpersuasive.11

11 Though petitioner claims to be a citizen from birth, rather than claiming an immigration preference, citizenship does not pass by descent. Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 830 (1971). Thus she must still meet the
statutory requirements set by Congress for citizenship. Id., at 828-830;
United States v. Ginsberg, 243 U. S. 472, 474 (1917). Deference to the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Insofar as the argument rests on the fact that the malecitizen parent will "forever forfeit the right to transmit citizenship" if he does not come forward while the child is aminor, whereas there is no limit on the time within which
the citizen mother may prove her blood relationship, the ar-gument overlooks the difference between a substantive condition and a procedural limitation. The substantive conductof the unmarried citizen mother that qualifies her child for
citizenship is completed at the moment of birth; the relevantconduct of the unmarried citizen father or his child may
occur at any time within 18 years thereafter. There is, how-ever, no procedural hurdle that limits the time or the method
by which either parent (or the child) may provide the StateDepartment with evidence that the necessary steps were
taken to transmit citizenship to the child.The substantive requirement embodied in $ 1409(a)(4)
serves, at least in part, to ensure that a person born out ofwedlock who claims citizenship by birth actually shares a
blood relationship with an American citizen. As originallyenacted in 1952, $ 1409(a) required simply that "the paternity
of such child [born out of wedlock] is established while suchchild is under the age of twenty-one years by legitimation."
66 Stat. 238. The section offered no other means of provinga biological relationship. In 1986, at the same time that it
modified the INA provisions at issue in Fiallo in favor ofunmarried fathers and their out-of-wedlock children, see n. 4,
supra, Congress expanded $ 1409(a) to allow the two otheralternatives now found in subsections (4)(B) and (4)(C).

political branches dictates "a narrow standard of review of decisions made
by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization." Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 82 (1976). Even if, as petitioner
and her amici argue, the heightened scrutiny that normally governs
gender discrimination claims applied in this context, see United States v.
Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 532-534 (1996), we are persuaded that the requirement imposed by $ 1409(a)(4) on children of unmarried male, but
not female, citizens is substantially related to important governmental
objectives.

436 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Pub. L. 99-653, $ 13, 100 Stat. 3657. The purpose of the
amendment was to "simplify and facilitate determinations of
acquisition of citizenship by children born out of wedlock to
an American citizen father, by eliminating the necessity of
determining the father's residence or domicile and establishing satisfaction of the legitimation provisions of the jurisdiction." Hearings, at 150. The 1986 amendment also added

$ 1409(a)(1), which requires paternity to be established by
clear and convincing evidence, in order to deter fraudulent
claims; but that standard of proof was viewed as an ancillary
measure, not a replacement for proof of paternity by legitimation or a formal alternative. See id., at 150, 155.

There is no doubt that ensuring reliable proof of a biological relationship between the potential citizen and its citizen
parent is an important governmental objective. See Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U. S. 762, 770-771 (1977); Fiallo, 430 U. S.,
at 799, n. 8. Nor can it be denied that the male and female
parents are differently situated in this respect. The blood
relationship to the birth mother is immediately obvious and
is typically established by hospital records and birth certificates; the relationship to the unmarried father may often be
undisclosed and unrecorded in any contemporary public record. Thus, the requirement that the father make a timely
written acknowledgment under oath, or that the child obtain
a court adjudication of paternity, produces the rough equivalent of the documentation that is already available to evidence the blood relationship between the mother and the
child. If the statute had required the citizen parent,
whether male or female, to obtain appropriate formal documentation within 30 days after birth, it would have been
"gender-neutral" on its face, even though in practical operation it would disfavor unmarried males because in virtually
every case such a requirement would be superfluous for the
mother. Surely the fact that the statute allows 18 years in
which to provide evidence that is comparable to what the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
mother provides immediately after birth cannot be viewedas discriminating against the father or his child.

Nevertheless, petitioner reiterates the suggestion that itis irrational to require a formal act such as a written acknowledgment or a court adjudication because the advent ofreliable genetic testing fully addresses the problem of proving paternity, and subsection (a)(1) already requires proof ofpaternity by clear and convincing evidence. See 96 F. 3d,
at 1474. We respectfully disagree. Nothing in subsection(a)(1) requires the citizen father or his child to obtain a genetic paternity test. It is difficult, moreover, to understandwhy signing a paternity acknowledgment under oath prior
to the child's 18th birthday is more burdensome than obtain-ing a genetic test, which is relatively expensive,

12 normally

requires physical intrusion for both the putative father andchild,

13 and often is not available in foreign countries.14

Congress could fairly conclude that despite recent scientificadvances, it still remains preferable to require some formal

legal act to establish paternity, coupled with a clear-and-convincing evidence standard to deter fraud. The time limi12 See 7 U. S. Dept. of State, Foreign Affairs Manual $ 1131.5-4(c) (1996)

13 Laboratories that conduct genetic paternity testing typically use

either blood samples or cells scraped from the inside of the cheek of the
putative father, the child, and often the mother as well. See, e. g., 1 D.

tation, in turn, provides assurance that the formal act isbased upon reliable evidence, and also deters fraud.

15 Congress is of course free to revise its collective judgment andpermit genetic proof of paternity rather than requiring some

formal legal act by the father or a court,16 but the Constitu-tion does not now require any such change.

Section 1409 also serves two other important purposesthat are unrelated to the determination of paternity: the interest in encouraging the development of a healthy relation-ship between the citizen parent and the child while the child
is a minor; and the related interest in fostering ties between
the foreign-born child and the United States. When a childis born out of wedlock outside of the United States, the citizen mother, unlike the citizen father, certainly knows of her
child's existence and typically will have custody of the childimmediately after the birth. Such a child thus has the opportunity to develop ties with its citizen mother at an earlyage, and may even grow up in the United States if the
mother returns. By contrast, due to the normal interval ofnine months between conception and birth, the unmarried
father may not even know that his child exists, and the childmay not know the father's identity. Section 1409(a)(4) requires a relatively easy, formal step by either the citizen father or his child that shows beyond doubt that at least oneof the two knows of their blood relationship, thus assuring

at least the opportunity for them to develop a personalrelationship.

The facts of this very case provide a ready example of theconcern. Mr. Miller and petitioner both failed to take any
steps to establish a legal relationship with each other before

15 Once a child reaches the legal age of majority, a male citizen could
make a fraudulent claim of paternity on the person's behalf without any
risk of liability for child support.

16 In a different context Congress has already recognized the value of

genetic paternity testing. See 96 F. 3d 1467, 1474-1475 (CADC 1996) (discussing Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984).

petitioner's 21st birthday, and there is no indication in therecord that they had any contact whatsoever before she applied for a United States passport. Given the size of theAmerican military establishment that has been stationed in
various parts of the world for the past half century, it isreasonable to assume that this case is not unusual. In 1970,
when petitioner was born, about 683,000 service personnelwere stationed in the Far East, 24,000 of whom were in the
Philippines. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Statistical Abstractof the United States 381 (99th ed. 1978). Of all Americans
in the military at that time, only one percent were female.17
These figures, coupled with the interval between conceptionand birth and the fact that military personnel regularly return to the United States when a tour of duty ends, suggestthat Congress had legitimate concerns about a class of children born abroad out of wedlock to alien mothers and to
American servicemen who would not necessarily knowabout, or be known by, their children. It was surely reasonable when the INA was enacted in 1952, and remains equallyreasonable today, for Congress to condition the award of citizenship to such children on an act that demonstrates, at aminimum, the possibility that those who become citizens will
develop ties with this country--a requirement that performsa meaningful purpose for citizen fathers but normally would
be superfluous for citizen mothers.

It is of course possible that any child born in a foreigncountry may ultimately fail to establish ties with its citizen

parent and with this country, even though the child's citizenparent has engaged in the conduct that qualifies the child for
citizenship. A citizen mother may abandon her child before

returning to the States, and a citizen father, even after ac-knowledging paternity, may die or abscond before his child

has an opportunity to bond with him or visit this country.The fact that the interest in fostering ties with this country
may not be fully achieved for either class of children doesnot qualify the legitimacy or the importance of that interest.
If, as Congress reasonably may have assumed, the formalrequirements in $ 1409(a)(4) tend to make it just as likely that
fathers will have the opportunity to develop a meaningfulrelationship with their children as does the fact that the
mother knows of her baby's existence and often has custodyat birth, the statute's effect will reduce, rather than aggravate, the disparity between the two classes of children.We are convinced not only that strong governmental interests justify the additional requirement imposed on childrenof citizen fathers, but also that the particular means used in

$ 1409(a)(4) are well tailored to serve those interests. It isperfectly appropriate to require some formal act, not just
any evidence that the father or his child know of the other'sexistence. Such a formal act, whether legitimation, written
acknowledgment by the father, or a court adjudication, less-ens the risk of fraudulent claims made years after the relevant conduct was required. As for the requirement that theformal act take place while the child is a minor, Congress
obviously has a powerful interest in fostering ties with thechild's citizen parent and the United States during his or her
formative years. If there is no reliable, contemporaneousproof that the child and the citizen father had the opportunity to form familial bonds before the child turned 18, Con-gress reasonably may demand that the child show sufficient
ties to this country on its own rather than through its citizenparent in order to be a citizen.

18 The same policy presently applies to foreign-born persons not eligible

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Our conclusion that Congress may require an affirmativeact by unmarried fathers and their children, but not mothers

and their children, is directly supported by our decision inLehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248 (1983). That case involved
a New York law that automatically provided mothers of "ille-gitimate" children with prior notice of an adoption proceeding and the right to veto an adoption, but only extendedthose rights to unmarried fathers whose claim of paternity
was supported by some formal public act, such as a courtadjudication, the filing of a notice of intent to claim paternity,
or written acknowledgment by the mother. Id., at 251-252,n. 5, 266. The petitioner in

Lehr, an unmarried putative fa-ther, need only have mailed a postcard to the State's "putative father registry" to enjoy the same rights as the child'sundisputed mother,

id., at 264, yet he argued that thisgender-based requirement violated the Equal Protection

Clause. We rejected that argument, and we find the compa-rable claim in this case, if anything, even less persuasive.
Whereas the putative father in Lehr was deprived of certainrights because he failed to take some affirmative step within
about two years of the child's birth (when the adoption pro-ceeding took place), here the unfavorable gender-based
treatment was attributable to Mr. Miller's failure to take ap-propriate action within 21 years of petitioner's birth

andpetitioner's own failure to obtain a paternity adjudication by

a "competent court" before she turned 18.19Even though the rule applicable to each class of children
born abroad is eminently reasonable and justified by impor-tant Government policies, petitioner and her

amici arguethat $ 1409 is unconstitutional because it is a "gender-based

classification." We shall comment briefly on that argument.

19 Justice Breyer questions the relevance of Lehr because it was decided before advances in genetic testing, see post, at 487; there was, however, no question about the paternity of the father in that case. As in
this case, the father there failed to act promptly to establish a relationship
with his child.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

The words "stereotype," "stereotyping," and "stereotypi-cal" are used repeatedly in petitioner's and her

amici'sbriefs. They note that we have condemned statutory classifications that rest on the assumption that gender may serveas a proxy for relevant qualifications to serve as the administrator of an estate, Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), to en-gage in professional nursing,

Mississippi Univ. for Womenv. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982), or to train for military service,

United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996), to name a fewexamples. Moreover, we have expressly repudiated cases
that rested on the assumption that only the members of onesex could suitably practice law or tend bar. See Hogan, 458
U. S., at 725, n. 10 (commenting on Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall.130 (1873), and

Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948)).Discrimination that "is merely the accidental byproduct of a

traditional way of thinking about females" is unacceptable.Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 223 (1977) (

Stevens, J.,concurring in judgment).

The gender equality principle that was implicated in thosecases is only indirectly involved in this case for two reasons.

20

First, the conclusion that petitioner is not a citizen rests onseveral coinciding factors, not just the gender of her citizen

parent. On the facts of this case, even if petitioner's motherhad been a citizen

21 and her father had been the alien, petitioner would not qualify for citizenship because her motherhas never been to the United States. Alternatively, if her

citizen parent had been a female member of the Air Forceand, like Mr. Miller, had returned to the States at the end
of her tour of duty, $ 1409 quite probably would have beenirrelevant and petitioner would have become a citizen at

20 Of course, the sex of the person claiming citizenship is irrelevant; if
she were a male, petitioner's case would be no stronger.

21 Theoretically she might have been the child of an American soldier

stationed in the Philippines during World War II. See Ablang v. Reno,
52 F. 3d 801, 802 (CA9 1995), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1043 (1996).

birth by force of the Constitution itself.22 Second, it is notmerely the sex of the citizen parent that determines whether

the child is a citizen under the terms of the statute; rather,it is an event creating a legal relationship between parent
and child--the birth itself for citizen mothers, but postbirthconduct for citizen fathers and their offspring. Nevertheless, we may assume that if the classification in $ 1409 weremerely the product of an outmoded stereotype, it would be
invalid.The "gender stereotypes" on which $ 1409 is supposedly
premised are (1) "that the American father is never anythingmore than the proverbial breadwinner who remains aloof
from day-to-day child rearing duties," 23 and (2) "that amother will be closer to her child born out of wedlock than
a father will be to his." 24 Even disregarding the statute'sseparate, nonstereotypical purpose of ensuring reliable proof
of a blood relationship, neither of those propositions fairlyreflects the justifications for the classification actually at
issue.Section 1409(a)(4) is not concerned with either the average
father or even the average father of a child born out of wed-lock. It is concerned with a father (a) whose child was born
in a foreign country, and (b) who is unwilling or unable toacknowledge his paternity, and whose child is unable or unwilling to obtain a court paternity adjudication. A congres-sional assumption that such a father and his child are especially unlikely to develop a relationship, and thus to fosterthe child's ties with this country, has a solid basis even if we
assume that all fathers who have made some effort tobecome acquainted with their children are as good, if not
better, parents than members of the opposite sex.

444 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Nor does the statute assume that all mothers of illegiti-mate children will necessarily have a closer relationship with

their children than will fathers. It does assume that all ofthem will be present at the event that transmits their citizenship to the child, that hospital records and birth certifi-cates will normally make a further acknowledgment and formal proof of parentage unnecessary, and that their initialcustody will at least give them the opportunity to develop a
caring relationship with the child. Section 1409(a)(4)--theonly provision that we need consider--is therefore supported
by the undisputed assumption that fathers are less likelythan mothers to have the

opportunity to develop relation-ships, not simply, as
Justice Breyer contends, post, at 482-483, that they are less likely to take advantage of that opportunity when it exists.25 These assumptions are firmlygrounded and adequately explain why Congress found it unnecessary to impose requirements on the mother that wereentirely appropriate for the father.

None of the premises on which the statutory classificationis grounded can be fairly characterized as an accidental
byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about the mem25 Justice Breyer does not dispute the fact that the unmarried father
of a child born abroad is less likely than the unmarried mother to have
the opportunity to develop a relationship with the child. He nevertheless
would replace the gender-based distinction with either a "knowledge of
birth" requirement or a distinction between "Caretaker and Noncaretaker
Parents." Post, at 487. Neither substitute seems a likely candidate for
serious congressional consideration. The former in practice would be just
as gender based as the present requirement, for surely every mother has
knowledge of the birth when it occurs; nor would that option eliminate the
need for formal steps and time limits to ensure that the parent truly had
knowledge during the child's youth. The latter would be confusing at
best, for Justice Breyer does not tell us how he would decide whether
a father like Mr. Miller would qualify as a "caretaker" or a "noncaretaker"; and it would also be far less protective of families than the
present statute, for it would deny citizenship to out-of-wedlock children
who have relationships with their citizen parents but are not in the primary care or custody of those parents.

bers of either sex. The biological differences between sin-gle men and single women provide a relevant basis for differing rules governing their ability to confer citizenship onchildren born in foreign lands. Indeed, it is the suggestion
that simply because Congress has authorized citizenship atbirth for children born abroad to unmarried mothers, it cannot impose any postbirth conditions upon the granting of citi-zenship to the foreign-born children of citizen fathers, that
might be characterized as merely a byproduct of the strongpresumption that gender-based legal distinctions are suspect. An impartial analysis of the relevant differences be-tween citizen mothers and citizen fathers plainly rebuts
that presumption.26The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,concurring in the judgment.

This Court has long applied a presumption against third-party standing as a prudential limitation on the exercise of
federal jurisdiction. Federal courts, we have held, "musthesitate before resolving a controversy, even one within
their constitutional power to resolve, on the basis of therights of third persons not parties to the litigation." Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 113 (1976); see also Warth v. Sel-din, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975). Contrary to this prudential
rule, the principal opinion recognizes that petitioner hasstanding to raise an equal protection challenge to 8 U. S. C.

498, n. 4 (1981) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia argues that
petitioner's suit must be dismissed because the courts have "no power to
provide the relief requested." Post, at 453. Because we conclude that
there is no constitutional violation to remedy, we express no opinion on
this question.

446 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
although petitioner is clearly injured by the fact that she hasbeen denied citizenship, the

discriminatory impact of the
provision falls on petitioner's father, Charlie Miller, who isno longer a party to this suit. Consequently, I do not believe that we should consider petitioner's gender discrimination claim.The principal opinion recognizes that petitioner's claim

turns on "the proposition that her citizen father should havethe same right to transmit citizenship as would a citizen
mother" and resolves to "evaluate the alleged discriminationagainst [petitioner's father] as well as its impact on [petitioner]." Ante, at 433. But even when "the very same allegedly illegal act that affects the litigant also affects a third
party," a plaintiff "cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal
rights and interests of [the] third part[y]." Department of
Labor v. Triplett, 494 U. S. 715, 720 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). A party raising a constitutional challenge to a statute must demonstrate not only "that the alleged unconstitutional feature [of the statute] injures him"
but also that "he is within the class of persons with respect
to whom the act is unconstitutional." Heald v. District of
Columbia, 259 U. S. 114, 123 (1922). This requirement
arises from the understanding that the third-party rightholder may not, in fact, wish to assert the claim in question,
as well as from the belief that "third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their rights." Singleton,
supra, at 113-114; see also Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366,
397 (1898).

In support of the decision to consider Charlie Miller's
claim, both Justice Stevens, in the principal opinion, and
Justice Breyer, in dissent, cite Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S.
190 (1976). In that case, we allowed a vendor to challenge
a state law that permitted sales of 3.2% beer to females who
had reached the age of 18 but prohibited such sales to males
until they turned 21. Because the law proscribed the sale
rather than the consumption of beer, the Court determined

523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

447Cite as: 523 U. S. 420 (1998)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
that a vendor was the "least awkward challenger" to the
gender-based distinction. Id., at 197. We reasoned that
prudential objectives would not be served by rejecting
third-party standing because "the lower court already ha[d]
entertained the relevant constitutional challenge." Id., at
193. Here, however, the court below expressly did not take
account of Charlie Miller's equal protection rights, instead
reviewing petitioner's challenge as a first-party claim of gender discrimination against the children of citizen fathers as
opposed to the children of citizen mothers. See 96 F. 3d
1467, 1470 (CADC 1996).

More importantly, since this Court decided Craig, we have
articulated the contours of the third-party standing inquiry
in greater detail. In Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991),
we stated that a litigant seeking to assert the rights of another party must satisfy three interrelated criteria: "The litigant must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving him
or her a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the
issue in dispute; the litigant must have a close relation to the
third party; and there must exist some hindrance to the third
party's ability to protect his or her own interests." Id., at
411 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also
Campbell v. Louisiana, ante, at 397-398. While it seems
clear that petitioner has a significant stake in challenging the
statute and a close relationship with her father, she has not
demonstrated a substantial hindrance to her father's ability
to assert his own rights. Powers and our earlier precedents
suggest that the absence of such an obstacle precludes thirdparty standing. See 499 U. S., at 411 (explaining that "[all]
three important criteria [must be] satisfied," i. e., that there
"must exist some hindrance to the third party's ability to
protect his or her own interests" before the presumption is
rebutted); see also Singleton, supra, at 116 ("Even where
the relationship is close, the reasons for requiring persons to
assert their own rights will generally still apply").

448 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Petitioner has not demonstrated that Charlie Miller con-fronted a "genuine obstacle" to the assertion of his own

rights that rises to the level of a hindrance. 428 U. S., at116; see also

Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 257 (1953)
(third-party standing accorded because it "would be difficult
if not impossible for the persons whose rights are asserted topresent their grievance before any court"). In fact, Charlie

Miller originally filed suit and asserted his own rights butthen opted not to pursue his claim throughout this litigation.
It is true that he was wrongly dismissed from the action bythe Eastern District of Texas, and that the Government
made the misguided argument before that court that "[t]he
rights, if any, which have been injured are those of Lorelyn
Penero Miller, the true plaintiff in this action." See Motion
to Dismiss Plaintiff 's First Amended Complaint or, in the
Alternative, to Transfer Venue 4. But because he failed to
appeal the erroneous dismissal of his claim, any hindrance
to the vindication of Charlie Miller's constitutional rights is
ultimately self imposed.

I am reluctant to accept that the Government's litigation
strategy, or an unfavorable ruling in the lower courts, could
be a sufficiently severe obstacle to the assertion of a litigant's
own rights to warrant an exception to our prudential standing requirements. Those requirements were adopted to
serve the institutional interests of the federal courts, not the
convenience of the litigants. See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,
493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990); Bender v. Williamsport Area
School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541 (1986). Justice Breyer asserts that appeals take time and money, and that a change
of venue left Charlie Miller uncertain where to appeal. See
post, at 474. But the only obstacle was the inconvenience
caused by the normal course of litigation, which often involves a transfer of venue. Charlie Miller never indicated
any intent to challenge his dismissal from the suit, and there
is no suggestion that he faced any unusual practical or legal
barriers to filing a notice of appeal. Instituting a suit is it523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
self burdensome--arguably as burdensome as filing an ap-peal from the denial of a claim--and to conclude that the

course of events that transpired in this case constituted ahindrance to Charlie Miller's ability to assert his rights
would be a step toward eliminating the hindrance prong
altogether.Thus far, we have permitted third-party standing only

where more "daunting" barriers deterred the rightholder.
Powers, supra, at 414. To take an extreme example, in
Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704 (1987), we concluded that plain-tiffs had third-party standing to assert the rights of their

deceased parents. Id., at 711-712. And in Powers, we
noted that potential jurors are not parties to the proceeding,
cannot easily obtain declaratory or injunctive relief from a
prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges, would find it
difficult to demonstrate a likelihood that discrimination
against them would recur, and have economic disincentives
to filing suit. 499 U. S., at 414-415. Privacy concerns may
also provide a compelling explanation for a third party's absence from the litigation. In Carey v. Population Services
Int'l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977), we determined that a vendor could
challenge the law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to minors because the desire to avoid publicity would
deter potential purchasers from defending their own rights.
Id., at 684, n. 4; see also Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438,
446 (1972). Likewise, in NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958), the Court held that an organization
could raise the privacy rights of its members because litigation initiated by those members would disclose their identity
and destroy the very privacy they sought to protect. Id., at
459. Where insurmountable procedural obstacles preclude
a rightholder's own suit, the Court has also accorded thirdparty standing. In Singleton, we concluded that physicians
could assert the rights of indigent women denied funding for
abortion because imminent mootness prevented the women
from bringing their claims. See 428 U. S., at 108. Simi523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
450 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
larly, Barrows involved the constitutional rights of the pro-spective victims of a racially restrictive real estate covenant,

who were unidentified and thus not before the Court. See346 U. S., at 254. And in

Craig, the case from which the
Court garners its sole support for according third-party
standing here, the named plaintiff turned 21 during thecourse of the litigation, which mooted his challenge to the

beer-sale restriction. See 429 U. S., at 192.Where legitimate obstacles such as these exist, which lie
beyond the control of the rightholder, that party's absencefrom a suit more likely stems from disability than from disinterest. A hindrance signals that the rightholder did not
simply decline to bring the claim on his own behalf, but could
not in fact do so. See Singleton, supra, at 116 ("If there is
some genuine obstacle . . . the third party's absence from
court loses its tendency to suggest that his right is not truly
at stake, or truly important to him, and the party who is in
court becomes by default the right's best available proponent"). Furthermore, where a hindrance impedes the assertion of a claim, the right likely will not be asserted--and
thus the relevant law will not be enforced--unless the Court
recognizes third-party standing. In Barrows, for example,
the Court permitted third-party standing because "the reasons which underlie [the] rule denying standing to raise
another's rights" were "outweighed by the need to protect
the fundamental rights" which would otherwise have been
denied. 346 U. S., at 257.

Moreover, in contrast to this case, the white property
owner contesting the racially restrictive covenant in Barrows was its "only effective adversary" because she was "the
one in whose charge and keeping repose[d] the power to continue to use her property to discriminate or to discontinue
such use." Id., at 259. Here, although we have an injured
party before us, the party actually discriminated against is
both best suited to challenging the statute and available to
undertake that task. See Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of

Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91, 100 (1979) (prudential barriers seek"to limit access to the federal courts to those litigants best

suited to assert a particular claim"). In light of petitioner'suncertain constitutional status and the potential problems
with fashioning a remedy for her injury, see post, at 452-458
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), allowing her to assertCharlie Miller's claim will likely dilute rather than protect

his constitutional rights.Although petitioner cannot raise her father's rights, she
may raise her own. While it is unclear whether an alienmay assert constitutional objections when he or she is outside the territory of the United States, see Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), and United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259 (1990), I will assume that petitioner
may challenge the constitutionality of $ 1409. Her challenge, however, triggers only rational basis scrutiny. As
pointed out above, see supra, at 445, $ 1409 does not draw a
distinction based on the gender of the child, so petitioner
cannot claim that she has been injured by gender discrimination. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984) (an injury arising from discrimination "accords a basis for standing
only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct") (internal
quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the grant of certiorari
was limited to the question whether $ 1409 discriminates
"between `illegitimate' children of United States citizen
mothers and `illegitimate' children of United States citizen
fathers," so any claim of discrimination based on differential
treatment of illegitimate versus legitimate children is not
presented. See 520 U. S. 1208 (1997).

Given that petitioner cannot raise a claim of discrimination
triggering heightened scrutiny, she can argue only that

$ 1409 irrationally discriminates between illegitimate children of citizen fathers and citizen mothers. Although I do
not share Justice Stevens' assessment that the provision
withstands heightened scrutiny, ante, at 433-444, I believe

it passes rational scrutiny for the reasons he gives for sus-taining it under the higher standard. It is unlikely, in my

opinion, that any gender classifications based on stereotypescan survive heightened scrutiny, but under rational scrutiny,
a statute may be defended based on generalized classifica-tions unsupported by empirical evidence. See

Heller v. Doe,509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993) ("[A] classification must be upheld

against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonablyconceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis
for the classification. A State, moreover, has no obligationto produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory
classification" (internal quotation marks and citations omit-ted)). This is particularly true when the classification is
adopted with reference to immigration, an area where Con-gress frequently must base its decisions on generalizations
about groups of people.

* * *
We adopted the presumption against third-party standingto preserve the court's "properly limited" role, Warth, 422

U. S., at 498, and we have identified a particular set ofcircumstances that will rebut that presumption. I believe
that we should treat those considerations, in particular thehindrance prong, as meaningful criteria. Consequently, I
would not accord petitioner standing to raise her father'sclaim of gender discrimination. Petitioner's own constitutional challenge triggers only rational basis scrutiny, and$ 1409 is sustainable under that standard. Accordingly, I
concur in the judgment affirming the Court of Appeals'decision.

$ 1409(a) passes "heightened scrutiny" or any other testMembers of the Court might choose to apply. The complaint

must be dismissed because the Court has no power to pro-vide the relief requested: conferral of citizenship on a basis
other than that prescribed by Congress.The Constitution "contemplates two sources of citizenship,
and two only: birth and naturalization." United States v.
Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 702 (1898). Under the Four-teenth Amendment, "[e]very person born in the United

States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, becomes atonce a citizen of the United States, and needs no naturalization." Ibid. Petitioner, having been born outside the terri-tory of the United States, is an alien as far as the Constitution is concerned, and "can only become a citizen by beingnaturalized, either by treaty, as in the case of the annexation
of foreign territory; or by authority of Congress." Id., at702-703; see also

Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 827 (1971).Here it is the "authority of Congress" that is appealed to--

its power under Art. I, $ 8, cl. 4, to "establish an uniformRule of Naturalization." If there is no congressional enactment granting petitioner citizenship, she remains an alien.The enactment on which petitioner relies is $ 309 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 238, asamended, 8 U. S. C. $ 1409, which establishes the requirements for the acquisition of citizenship by a child born out ofwedlock when the child's father is a United States citizen.
Section 1409(a) provides, in relevant part, that $ 1401(g),which confers citizenship on foreign-born children when one
parent is an alien and the other a citizen of the United States,shall apply:

"(a) . . . as of the date of birth to a person born out ofwedlock if--
"(1) a blood relationship between the person and thefather is established by clear and convincing evidence,
"(2) the father had the nationality of the UnitedStates at the time of the person's birth,

"(A) the person is legitimated under the law of theperson's residence or domicile,
"(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the personin writing under oath, or
"(C) the paternity of the person is established by ad-judication of a competent court."

By its plain language, $ 1409(a) sets forth a precondition tothe acquisition of citizenship under $ 1401(g) by the illegitimate child of a citizen-father. Petitioner does not come intofederal court claiming that she met that precondition, and
that the State Department's conclusion to the contrary wasfactually in error. Rather, she acknowledges that she did
not meet the last two requirements of that precondition,$$ 1409(a)(3) and (4). She nonetheless asks for a "declaratory judgment that [she] is a citizen of the United States"and an order to the Secretary of State requiring the State
Department to grant her application for citizenship, App. 11-12, because the requirements she did not meet are not also
imposed upon illegitimate children of citizen-mothers, andtherefore violate the Equal Protection Clause.

on her own behalf. Justice Breyer finds that she has third-party standing to make the claim because "[s]he has a `close' and relevant relationship"
with her father, and "there was `some hindrance' to her father's asserting
his own rights." Post, at 473 (quoting from Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,
411 (1991)). As an original matter, I would agree with Justice O'Connor that this ground is inadequate, but I do not read our cases as demanding so significant an impairment of the rightholder's ability to sue as she
does. For example, in Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976), although
the rightholder who was one of the named plaintiffs had indeed lost his
ability to sue because he had turned 21, there was "no barrier whatever"
to assertion of the constitutional claim by other Oklahoma males between
18 and 20. Id., at 216 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). Certainly here, as in

were to agree that the difference in treatment between illegitimate children of citizen-fathers and citizen-mothers is
unconstitutional, we could not, consistent with the limited
judicial power in this area, remedy that constitutional infirmity by declaring petitioner to be a citizen or ordering the
State Department to approve her application for citizenship. "Once it has been determined that a person does not

has the power to set the requirements for acquisition of citizenship by persons not born within the territory of theUnited States, federal courts cannot exercise that power

under the guise of their remedial authority. "Neither by ap-plication of the doctrine of estoppel, nor by invocation of equitable powers, nor by any other means does a court havethe power to confer citizenship in violation of [statutory] limitations." Pangilinan, supra, at 885. "An alien who seeks
political rights as a member of this Nation can rightfully obtain them only upon terms and conditions specified by Congress. Courts are without authority to sanction changes or
modifications." United States v. Ginsberg, 243 U. S. 472,
474 (1917) (emphasis added).

Petitioner argues, and Justice Breyer's dissent seems
to agree, see post, at 488-489, that because she meets the
requirements of $ 1401(g), the Court may declare her a citizen "at birth" under that provision and ignore $ 1409(a)
entirely, which allegedly unconstitutionally takes away that
citizenship. Brief for Petitioner 14-15. This argument
adopts a fanciful view of the statute, whereby $ 1409(a) takes
away what $ 1401(g) has unconditionally conferred--as
though $ 1409(a) were some sort of a condition subsequent to
the conveyance of real estate in a will. If anything, of
course, it would be a condition precedent, since it says that

$ 1401(g) "shall apply as of the date of birth to a person born
out of wedlock if " the person meets the requirements there
set forth. 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a) (emphasis added). But a unitary statute is not to be picked apart in this fashion. To be
sure, $ 1401(g), read in isolation, might refer to both married
and unmarried parents. We do not, however, read statutory
provisions in isolation, as if other provisions in the same Act
do not exist, see King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
221 (1991). Section 1401(g) does not confer citizenship uponchildren born out of wedlock unless the requirements in

$ 1409 are satisfied.It can be argued that in exempting an applicant from an
unconstitutional requirement (either part or all of $ 1409(a))
a court is not rewriting the law, but simply ignoring thatportion of the law which is a nullity. See

post, at 488-489
(Breyer, J., dissenting). That assumes, however, a judicialpower to sever the unconstitutional portion from the remainder, and to apply the remainder unencumbered. Such apower exists in other cases--and is exercised on the basis of
the Court's assessment as to whether Congress would have
enacted the remainder of the law without the invalidated
provision. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186
(1992). I know of no instance, however, in which this Court
has severed an unconstitutional restriction upon the grant of
immigration or citizenship. It is in my view incompatible
with the plenary power of Congress over those fields for
judges to speculate as to what Congress would have enacted
if it had not enacted what it did--whether it would, for
example, have preferred to extend the requirements of

$$ 1409(a)(3) and (4) to mothers instead of eliminating them
for fathers, or even to deny citizenship to illegitimate children entirely. ("[T]he Court has specifically recognized the
power of Congress not to grant a United States citizen the
right to transmit citizenship by descent." Rogers, 401 U. S.,
at 830.) Moreover, if the mere character of the naturalization power were not enough to render the severing of a limitation upon citizenship improper, the INA itself contains a
clear statement of congressional intent: "A person may only
be naturalized as a citizen of the United States in the manner
and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and
not otherwise." 8 U. S. C. $ 1421(d) (emphasis added). Justice Breyer's reliance upon the INA's general severability
clause, 66 Stat. 281, $ 406, is misplaced because the specific
governs the general, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines,

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384-385 (1992). The question of sever-ance ultimately turns on "whether the provisions are inseparable by virtue of inherent character," Carter v. Carter Coal
Co., 298 U. S. 238, 322 (1936), which must be gleaned from
the structure and nature of the Act.

Another obstacle to judicial deletion of the challenged re-quirements is the fact that when a statutory violation of

equal protection has occurred, it is not foreordained whichparticular statutory provision is invalid. The constitutional
vice consists of unequal treatment, which may as logicallybe attributed to the disparately generous provision (here,
supposedly, the provision governing citizenship of illegitimate children of citizen-mothers) as to the disparately parsimonious one (the provision governing citizenship of illegitimate children of citizen-fathers). "[W]e have noted that a
court sustaining [an equal protection] claim faces `two remedial alternatives: [It] may either declare [the statute] a nullity and order that its benefits not extend to the class that
the legislature intended to benefit, or it may extend the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by
the exclusion.' " Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 738
(1984), quoting Welsh v. United States, 398 U. S. 333, 361
(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Given the nature of
the law at issue here, and given the clear command of 8
U. S. C. $ 1421(d) ("under the conditions prescribed in this
subchapter and not otherwise"), there is no doubt which of
those alternatives the Court must employ. It cannot confer
citizenship where Congress has not done so.

In any event, this is not like the ordinary equal protection
case, in which one class is subjected to a restriction from
which the other class is exempt. See, e. g., Craig v. Boren,
429 U. S. 190, 191-192 (1976) (men can be served alcoholic
beverages only if over 21 years of age, whereas women need
be only 18). Here each class is subjected to restrictions
from which the other is exempt. While illegitimate children
of citizen-fathers must meet the requirements of $ 1409(a)

459Cite as: 523 U. S. 420 (1998)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
from which illegitimate children of citizen-mothers are exempt, illegitimate children of citizen-mothers must meet the
quite different requirements of $ 1409(c), from which illegitimate children of citizen-fathers are exempt.2 In this situation, eliminating the restrictions on fathers does not produce
a law that complies with the Equal Protection Clause (assuming it is initially in violation), but rather produces a law
that treats fathers more favorably than mothers. There is
no way a court can "fix" the law by merely disregarding one
provision or the other as unconstitutional. It would have to
disregard them both, either leaving no restrictions whatever
upon citizenship of illegitimate children or (what I think the
more proper course) denying naturalization of illegitimate
children entirely (since $ 1401(g) was not meant to apply by
its unqualified terms to illegitimate children). Even outside
the particularly sensitive area of immigration and naturalization, I am aware of no case that has engaged in such radical
statutory surgery, and it certainly cannot be engaged in here.

In sum, this is not a case in which we have the power
to remedy the alleged equal protection violation by either
expanding or limiting the benefits conferred so as to deny or
grant them equally to all. "We are dealing here with an
exercise of the Nation's sovereign power to admit or exclude
foreigners in accordance with perceived national interests."
Fiallo, 430 U. S., at 795, n. 6. Federal judges may not
decide what those national interests are, and what requirements for citizenship best serve them.

Because petitioner is not a citizen under any Act of Congress, we cannot give her the declaratory judgment or affirmative relief she requests. I therefore concur in the
judgment.

2 Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(c) provides that an illegitimate child born to a
citizen-mother shall be a citizen "if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a
continuous period of one year."

460 MILLER v. ALBRIGHT

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

As Justice Breyer convincingly demonstrates, 8 U. S. C.$ 1409 classifies unconstitutionally on the basis of gender in

determining the capacity of a parent to qualify a child forcitizenship. The section rests on familiar generalizations:
mothers, as a rule, are responsible for a child born out ofwedlock; fathers unmarried to the child's mother, ordinarily,
are not. The law at issue might have made custody or sup-port the relevant criterion. Instead, it treats mothers one
way, fathers another, shaping Government policy to fit andreinforce the stereotype or historic pattern.

Characteristic of sex-based classifications, the stereotypesunderlying this legislation may hold true for many, even
most, individuals. But in prior decisions the Court has re-jected official actions that classify unnecessarily and overbroadly by gender when more accurate and impartial func-tional lines can be drawn. While the Court is divided on
Lorelyn Miller's standing to sue, a solid majority adheres tothat vital understanding. As

Justice O'Connor's opinionmakes plain, distinctions based on gender trigger heightened

scrutiny and "[i]t is unlikely . . . that any gender classifica-tions based on stereotypes can survive heightened scrutiny."
Ante, at 452 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 482-488 (

Breyer, J., dissenting).
On the surface, $ 1409 treats females favorably. Indeed,it might be seen as a benign preference, an affirmative action

of sorts. Compare Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,458 U. S. 718, 731, and n. 17 (1982), with

id., at 740-744 (Powell, J., dissenting). Two Justices today apparently take this
view. Justice Stevens' opinion, in which The Chief Justice joins, portrays $ 1409 as helpfully recognizing the different situations of unmarried mothers and fathers duringthe prenatal period and at birth, and fairly equalizing the

"burdens" that each parent bears. See ante, at 433-434,438. But pages of history place the provision in real-world

perspective. Section 1409 is one of the few provisions re-maining in the United States Code that uses sex as a criterion in delineating citizens' rights. It is an innovation inthis respect: During most of our Nation's past, laws on the
transmission of citizenship from parent to child discrimi-nated adversely against citizen mothers, not against citizen
fathers. I

The first statute on the citizenship of children born abroad,enacted in 1790, stated: "[T]he children of citizens of the
United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of thelimits of the United States, shall be considered as natural
born citizens: Provided, That the right of citizenship shallnot descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States." Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, 1Stat. 104. Statutes passed in 1795 and 1802 similarly conditioned the citizenship of the child born abroad on the father'sat least one-time residence in the United States. Act of Jan.
29, 1795, $ 3, 1 Stat. 415; Act of Apr. 14, 1802, $ 4, 2 Stat. 155.This father's residence requirement suggests that Congress
intended a child born abroad to gain citizenship only whenthe father was a citizen. That, indeed, was the law of England at the time. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on AmericanLaw *50-*51 (hereinafter Kent's Commentaries); 4 Geo. 2,
ch. 21 (1731). The statutory language Congress adopted,however, was ambiguous. One could read the words "children of citizens" to mean that the child of a United Statescitizen mother and a foreign father would qualify for citizenship if the father had at some point resided in the country.See Binney, The Alienigenae of the United States, 2 Am. L.
Reg. 193, 203-205 (1854). Or, as Chancellor Kent observed,the words might mean that both parents had to be United
States citizens for citizenship to pass. 2 Kent's Commentar-ies *53.

Under the 1802 legislation, children born abroad could notbecome citizens unless their parents were citizens in 1802,

which meant that as the years passed few foreign-born per-sons could qualify. Daniel Webster, among others, proposed

remedial legislation. His bill would have granted citizen-ship to children born abroad to United States-born citizen
mothers as well as fathers. His effort was unsuccessful.
See Cong. Globe, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., 827 (1848); F.Franklin, The Legislative History of Naturalization in the

United States 271-276 (reprint ed. 1971). Instead, in 1855,Congress clarified that citizenship would pass to children
born abroad only when the father was a United States citi-zen. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, $ 2, 10 Stat. 604. Codified as

$ 1993 of the Revised Statutes, the provision originating in1855 read: "All children heretofore born or hereafter born
out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, whose
fathers were or may be at the time of their birth citizensthereof, are declared to be citizens of the United States; but

the rights of citizenship shall not descend to children whosefathers never resided in the United States." Rev. Stat.

$ 1993.In these early statutes, Congress did not differentiate between children born abroad to married parents and thoseborn out of wedlock. Section 1993, as applied, allowed
transmission of citizenship to children born out of wedlock if
the father legitimated the child. See, e. g., 32 Op. Atty. Gen.
162, 164-165 (1920); see also Guyer v. Smith, 22 Md. 239
(1864) (foreign-born children who remain illegitimate do not
qualify for citizenship). In several reported instances, children legitimated by their fathers gained citizenship even
though the legitimation occurred, as it did in Lorelyn Miller's
case, after the child reached majority. See In re P, 4 I. &
N. Dec. 354 (C. O. 1951); 7 C. Gordon, S. Mailman, &
S. Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure $ 93.04[2][d],
pp. 93-43 to 93-44 (1992) (hereinafter Gordon). But see 3

a case in which legitimation postmajority was deemed sufficient, but maintaining that "[n]ormally the legitimation must
take place during the minority of the child").

See 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 398 (1939).Women's inability to transmit their United States citizenship to children born abroad was one among many genderbased distinctions drawn in our immigration and nationalitylaws. The woman who married a foreign citizen risked losing her United States nationality. In early days, "marriagewith an alien, whether a friend or an enemy, produce[d] no
dissolution of the native allegiance of the wife." Shanks v.
Dupont, 3 Pet. 242, 246 (1830) (Story, J.). By the end of the
19th century, however, a few courts adopted the view thata woman's nationality followed her husband's, see,

e. g.,
Pequignot v. Detroit, 16 F. 211, 216 (CC ED Mich. 1883),
particularly when the woman resided abroad in her husband's country, see, e. g., Ruckgaber v. Moore, 104 F. 947,
948-949 (CC ED NY 1900). See generally C. Bredbenner,
A Nationality of Her Own: Women, Marriage, and the Law

Women, Citizenship, and Nationality: Immigration and Naturalization Policies in the United States, 13 Politics & Soc. 1,

this view as well. See L. Gettys, The Law of Citizenship in
the United States 118 (1934). In 1907, Congress settled the
matter: It provided by statute that a female United States
citizen automatically lost her citizenship upon marriage to an
alien. Act of Mar. 2, 1907, $ 3, 34 Stat. 1228. This Court
upheld the statute, noting that "[t]he identity of husband and

wife is an ancient principle of our jurisprudence." Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915).

The statutory rule that women relinquished their UnitedStates citizenship upon marriage to an alien encountered increasing opposition, fueled in large part by the women's suffrage movement and the enhanced importance of citizenshipto women as they obtained the right to vote. See Bredbenner 64, 68-81; Sapiro, supra, at 12-13. In response, Con-gress provided a measure of relief. Under the 1922 Cable
Act, marriage to an alien no longer stripped a woman of hercitizenship automatically. Act of Sept. 22, 1922 (Cable Act),
ch. 411, $ 3, 42 Stat. 1022. But equal respect for a woman's
nationality remained only partially realized. A woman still
lost her United States citizenship if she married an alien ineligible for citizenship; she could not become a citizen by naturalization if her husband did not qualify for citizenship; she
was presumed to have renounced her citizenship if she lived
abroad in her husband's country for two years, or if she lived
abroad elsewhere for five years. Id., $$ 3, 5; see also Sapiro,
supra, at 11-12. A woman who became a naturalized citizen
was unable to transmit her citizenship to her children if her
noncitizen husband remained alive and they were not separated. See In re Citizenship Status of Minor Children, 25
F. 2d 210 (NJ 1928) ("the status of the wife was dependent
upon that of her husband, and therefore the children acquired their citizenship from the same source as had been
theretofore existent under the common law"); see also Gettys, supra, at 56-57. No restrictions of like kind applied to
male United States citizens.

Instead, Congress treated wives and children of male
United States citizens or immigrants benevolently. The
1855 legislation automatically granted citizenship to women
who married United States citizens. Act of Feb. 10, 1855,
ch. 71, $ 2, 10 Stat. 604; see also Kelly v. Owen, 7 Wall. 496,

out further action); Bredbenner 15. Under an 1804 statute,if a male alien died after completing the United States residence requirement but before actual naturalization, hiswidow and children would be "considered as citizens." Act
of Mar. 26, 1804, $ 2, 2 Stat. 292, 293. That 1804 measuregranted no corresponding dispensation to the husband and
children of an alien woman. In addition, Congress providedstatutory exemptions to entry requirements for the wives
and children of men but not for the husbands and children ofwomen. See,

e. g., Act of Mar. 3, 1903, $ 37, 32 Stat. 1213,1221 (wives and children entering the country to join permanent resident aliens and found to have contracted contagiousdiseases during transit shall not be deported if the diseases
were easily curable or did not present a danger to others);S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 415-417 (1950) (wives
exempt from literacy and quota requirements).In 1934, Congress moved in a new direction. It terminated the discrimination against United States citizen moth-ers in regard to children born abroad. Specifically, Congress amended $ 1993 to read:

"Any child hereafter born out of the limits and jurisdic-tion of the United States, whose father or mother or

both at the time of the birth of such child is a citizen ofthe United States, is declared to be a citizen of the
United States; but the rights of citizenship shall notdescend to any such child unless the citizen father or

of May 24, 1934, $ 1, 48 Stat. 797.1
1 A 1921 bill contained a similar provision allowing United States citizen
women to transmit citizenship to their children born abroad. The bill
provided: "A child born at any time without the United States, either
parent being at the time of such birth a citizen of the United States, may,
if not a citizen under section 1993 of the Revised Statutes, derive United
States citizenship under this section." H. R. Rep. No. 15603, 66th Cong.,

child born abroad . . . out of wedlock under the same condi-tions as a child born in wedlock." 7 Gordon $ 93.04[2][b], at
93-42; see also id., $ 93.04[2][d][iii], at 93-46.The 1934 Act's equal respect for the citizenship stature of
mothers and fathers of children born abroad did not remainunmodified. Six years later, Congress passed the Nationality Act of 1940, which replaced the Revised Statutes' singleprovision on citizenship of children born abroad with an
array of provisions that turned on whether the child wasborn in an outlying possession of the United States, whether
one or both of the child's parents were United States citizens,and whether the child was born in or out of wedlock. The
1940 Act preserved Congress' earlier recognition of parentalequality in regard to children born in wedlock, but established a different regime for children born out of wedlock,one that disadvantaged United States citizen fathers and
their children.Under the 1940 Act, if the mother of the child born abroad
out of wedlock held United States citizenship and previouslyhad resided in the country or in a United States possession,
the child gained the mother's nationality from birth, pro-vided the child's paternity was not established by legitimaAct, passed the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization but

for United States citizenship only upon legitimation or adju-dication of paternity during the child's minority. Furthermore, the child generally had to live in the United States forfive years before the age of 21. The same residency requirement applied to children born abroad to married couples withonly one United States citizen parent, whether that parent
was the mother or the father. Nationality Act of 1940,$$ 201, 205, 54 Stat. 1138-1140.

Subsequent legislation retained the gender lines drawn inthe 1940 Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952

made only one significant change regarding the citizenship ofchildren born abroad out of wedlock. It removed the provision that a mother could pass on her nationality to her childonly if the paternity of the child had not been established.

2 Nationality and citizenship are not entirely synonymous; one can be a
national of the United States and yet not a citizen. 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(22).
The distinction has little practical impact today, however, for the only remaining noncitizen nationals are residents of American Samoa and Swains
Island. See T. Aleinikoff, D. Martin, & H. Motomura, Immigration: Process and Policy 974-975, n. 2 (3d ed. 1995). The provision that a child born
abroad out of wedlock to a United States citizen mother gains her nationality has been interpreted to mean that the child gains her citizenship as
well; thus if the mother is not just a United States national but also a
United States citizen, the child is a United States citizen. See 7 Gordon

$ 93.04[2][b], at 93-42; id., $ 93.04[2][d][viii], at 93-49.

3 The provision granting citizenship to children born abroad out of wedlock applied retroactively; the provision granting citizenship to children
born in wedlock did not. The 1934 Act, too, was nonretroactive. The net
result was that a child born abroad out of wedlock to a United States
citizen mother in 1933 or earlier had United States citizenship after the
1940 Act, but a child born in wedlock did not until 1994 when Congress
enacted legislation making the 1934 Act retroactive. Pub. L. 103-416,
Tit. I, $ 101(a)(2), 108 Stat. 4306, codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1401(h).

abroad could count toward satisfying the parental residency requirement
in regard to a child born after January 13, 1941. Immigration and Nation523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Immigration and Nationality Act, $ 309, 66 Stat. 238-239.In 1986, however, Congress added further gender-based differentials. The Legislature that year permitted substitu-tion of a written acknowledgment under oath or adjudication
of paternity prior to age 18 in place of formal legitimation.To that extent, Congress eased access to citizenship by a
child born abroad out of wedlock to a United States citizenfather. At the same time, however, Congress imposed on
such a child two further requirements: production of clearand convincing evidence of paternity, also a written statement from the father promising support until the childturned 18. The requirements for a child of a United States
citizen mother remained the same; such a child obtained themother's nationality if the mother had resided in the United
States or its territorial possessions for at least a year beforethe child's birth. Act of Nov. 14, 1986, $ 13, 100 Stat. 3657,
codified as amended at 8 U. S. C. $ 1409. No substantivechange has been made since 1986 in the law governing citizenship of children born abroad out of wedlock.

II
The history of the treatment of children born abroad toUnited States citizen parents counsels skeptical examination

of the Government's prime explanation for the gender linedrawn by $ 1409--the close connection of mother to child, in
contrast to the distant or fleeting father-child link. Or, as
Justice Stevens puts it, a mother's presence at birth, iden-tification on the birth certificate, and likely "initial custody"

of the child give her an "opportunity to develop a caringrelationship with the child," ante, at 444, which Congress
legitimately could assume a father lacks. For most of ourNation's past, Congress demonstrated no high regard or respect for the mother-child affiliation. It bears emphasis,too, that in 1934, when Congress allowed United States citiality Act of 1952, $$ 301(a)(7), 309(b), 66 Stat. 236, 238, codified as amended

zen mothers to transmit their citizenship to their foreignborn children, Congress simultaneously and for the first time
required that such children (unless both parents were citizens) fulfill a residence requirement: "[T]he right of citizenship shall not descend unless the child comes to the United
States and resides therein for at least five years continuously
immediately previous to his eighteenth birthday." Act of
May 24, 1934, $ 1, 48 Stat. 797. Commentary underscores
what the text conveys. Congress largely relied on a residence requirement, not the sex of the child's citizen parent,
to assure an abiding affiliation with the United States. See
Proposed Code 10-11, 14.

Even if one accepts at face value the Government's current
rationale, it is surely based on generalizations (stereotypes)
about the way women (or men) are. These generalizations
pervade the opinion of Justice Stevens, which constantly
relates and relies on what "typically," or "normally," or
"probably" happens "often." E. g., ante, at 436, 437, 442.

We have repeatedly cautioned, however, that when the
Government controls "gates to opportunity," it "may not exclude qualified individuals based on `fixed notions concerning
the roles and abilities of males and females.' " United
States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 541 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S., at 725); see also
Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268, 283 (1979) ("Where, as here, the
State's . . . purposes are as well served by a gender-neutral
classification as one that gender classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the State cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of sex."). Only an

Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment) (noting that prevailing case law "reveal[s] a strong presumption that gender classifications areinvalid").

One can demur to the Government's observation that moreUnited States citizen mothers of children born abroad out of
wedlock actually raise their children than do United Statescitizen fathers of such children. As

Justice Breyer haselucidated, this observation does not justify distinctions between male and female United States citizens who take re-sponsibility, or avoid responsibility, for raising their children.
Nor does it justify reliance on gender distinctions when thealleged purpose--assuring close ties to the United States--
can be achieved without reference to gender. As JudgeWald commented in discussing an analogous claim when this
case was before the Court of Appeals,

"Congress is free to promote close family ties by ensur-ing that citizenship is conferred only on children who

have at least minimal contact with citizen parents dur-ing their early and formative years. . . . But this putative
interest provides absolutely no basis for requiring fa-thers, and only fathers, to formally declare parentage
and agree to provide financial support before a childreaches age 18." Miller v. Christopher, 96 F. 3d 1467,
1476 (CADC 1996) (opinion concurring in judgment).

In 1934, it was no doubt true that many female UnitedStates citizens who gave birth abroad had married foreigners

and moved to their husbands' country, and that the childrenof such marriages were brought up as natives of a foreign
land. And if a female United States citizen were married toa United States citizen, her children born abroad could obtain United States citizenship through their father. Thus,the historic restriction of citizenship to children born abroad

of United States citizen fathers may not have affected manywomen. But, in the words of one woman who testified in

favor of the 1934 Act (and later became the first woman tosit as a federal district court judge), "[w]hether there are a
lot of people who suffer or whether there are a few who
suffer, it seems to us that the principle of equal applicationof the law to men and women ought to receive recognition."

Hearings on H. R. 3673 and H. R. 77 before the House Com-mittee on Immigration and Naturalization, 73d Cong., 1st
Sess., 36 (1933) (testimony of Burnita Shelton Matthews).Congress recognized this equality principle in 1934, and is
positioned to restore that impartiality before the century isout.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Since the founding of our Nation, American statutory law,
reflecting a long-established legal tradition, has provided
for the transmission of American citizenship from parent
to child--even when the child is born abroad. Today's case
focuses upon statutes that make those children, when born
out of wedlock, "citizens of the United States at birth."
8 U. S. C. $$ 1401 and 1409. The statutes, as applied where
only one parent is American, require the American parent--
whether father or mother--to prove the child is his or hers
and to meet a residency requirement. The statutes go on
to require (1) that the American parent promise to provide
financial support for the child until the child is 18, and (2)
that the American parent (or a court) legitimate or formally
acknowledge the child before the child turns 18--if and only
if the American parent is the father, but not if the parent is
the mother.

What sense does it make to apply these latter two conditions only to fathers and not to mothers in today's world--
where paternity can readily be proved and where women and
men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace? As

Justice O'Connor has observed, and as a majority of theCourt agrees, "[i]t is unlikely . . . that any gender classifications based on stereotypes can survive heightened scrutiny."Ante, at 452. These two gender-based distinctions lack the
" `exceedingly persuasive' " support that the Constitution re-quires.

United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 530 (1996).Consequently, the statute that imposes them violates the

Fifth Amendment's "equal protection" guarantee. See Bol-ling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500 (1954).

I
The family whose rights are at issue here consists of Char-lie Miller, an American citizen, Luz Pen~ ero, a citizen of the

Philippines, and their daughter, Lorelyn. Lorelyn was bornout of wedlock in 1970 in the Philippines. The relevant citizenship statutes state that a child born out of wedlock shallbe a "citize[n] of the United States at birth," $ 1401, if the
child is born to a father who "had the nationality of theUnited States at the time of the person's birth," if the "blood
relationship between the person and the father is establishedby clear and convincing evidence," if the father had been
physically present in the United States for five years, and:

"(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writingto provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years, and"(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years--

"(A) the person is legitimated under the law of theperson's residence or domicile,
"(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the personin writing under oath, or
"(C) the paternity of the person is established by ad-judication of a competent court." 8 U. S. C. $$ 1409(a)
and 1401(g).

fore us is whether the Constitution forbids the application ofthose requirements for the reason that the statute imposed

them only where the child's American parent is the child'sfather, not the mother. In my view the Constitution does
forbid their application. II

I agree with Justice Stevens' resolution of the Govern-ment's three threshold claims. First, the Government takes
issue with Lorelyn's argument that provisions (3) and (4) un-constitutionally infringe the rights of her father, Charlie, an
American citizen. Brief for Respondent 11. It adds thatCharlie, not Lorelyn, should assert those rights himself and
that Lorelyn lacks legal "standing" to do so. Id., at 11, andn. 2. This Court has made clear, however, that a party can
"assert" the constitutional rights of another person, where(1) that party has "suffered an `injury in fact' "; (2) the party
and the other person have a "close relationship"; and (3)"there was some hindrance" to the other person's "asserting" his "own rights." Campbell v. Louisiana, ante, at 397;see also Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 411 (1991). And these
three requirements are met here.Lorelyn has suffered an "injury in fact." She has a
"close" and relevant relationship with the other person,namely, her father. And there was "some hindrance" to her
father's asserting his own rights. Charlie began this law-suit (originally filed in Texas) as a party, raising his own
equal protection claim. The Government originally movedto dismiss the complaint, contending that

Charlie "should bedismissed from this suit because he lack[ed] standing." Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff 's First Amended Complaint, or, inthe Alternative, to Transfer Venue 6. The District Court
agreed with the Government that Charlie lacked "standing,"and he was dismissed from the suit. App. 11a. Lorelyn remained as the sole plaintiff, and for reasons of venue, see 28U. S. C. $ 1391(e)(1), the court then transferred the case to
the District of Columbia pursuant to $ 1406(a). App. 11a.

Breyer, J., dissenting
The conclusion that the Government "hindered" Charlie's
assertion of his own rights in this case is irresistible.

The Government points out that Charlie might have appealed the adverse Texas District Court ruling. Brief for
Respondent 11, n. 2. But appeals take time and money; the
transfer of venue left the plaintiffs uncertain about where to
appeal; the case was being heard with Lorelyn as plaintiff
in any event; and the resulting comparison of costs and benefits (viewed prospectively) likely would have discouraged
Charlie's pursuit of the alternative appeal route. The Government's successful dismissal motion thus had practical consequences that "hindered" Charlie at least as much as those
we have elsewhere said create "hindrances" sufficient to satisfy this portion of the "third-party standing" test. See,
e. g., Campbell, supra, at 398 (criminal defendant can assert
rights of racially excluded petit jurors because of "arduous"
process surrounding, and small benefits accruing to, juror effort to vindicate own rights); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S.
190, 193-194 (1976) ("decision . . . to forgo consideration of
the constitutional merits . . . to await" another party's identical claim would "foster repetitive and time-consuming litigation under the guise of caution and prudence").

Second, the Government, citing United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259 (1990), and Johnson v. Eisentrager,
339 U. S. 763 (1950), argues that the Fifth Amendment does
not protect an alien, such as Lorelyn, living outside the
United States. Brief for Respondent 11-12. The rights to
be vindicated here, however, are Charlie's, not Lorelyn's.
And, in any event, those cases, as Justice Stevens points
out, are irrelevant, for the matter at issue here is whether
or not Lorelyn is a citizen. See Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S.
815 (1971) (considering on the merits a putative citizen's
claim that he was a citizen due to the operation of the Fifth
Amendment, even though he apparently was living outside
the United States at the time he filed suit).

Third, the Government argues that Lorelyn cannot suc-ceed because a federal court lacks the power to grant her

the relief she seeks, namely, a grant of citizenship. Brief forRespondent 43-50. As I shall later explain in more detail,
however, this argument is beside the point, for, once the two
unconstitutional clauses are excised from the statute, thatstatute operates automatically to confer citizenship upon

Lorelyn "at birth." 8 U. S. C. $ 1401; see Part V, infra.J

ustice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy, says
that Lorelyn cannot assert her father's rights because "shehas not demonstrated a substantial hindrance to her father's

ability to assert his own rights." Ante, at 447. But the
obstacles that the Government placed in her father's path
substantially hindered his efforts to do so in practice. See
supra, at 473-474. Several of the cases mentioned in Justice O'Connor's opinion involved the denial of standing, but
none of those cases involved any "hindrance," and Justice
O'Connor does not claim that they do. See FW/PBS, Inc.
v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 234 (1990) (husband lacks standing
to assert wife's moot claim); Bender v. Williamsport Area
School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 544-545 (1986) (school board
member lacks standing to defend on board's behalf a claim
that all other board members voted not to defend); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91, 112,
n. 25 (1979) (nonresidents lack standing to challenge local
real estate practices as discriminatory); Heald v. District of
Columbia, 259 U. S. 114, 123 (1922) (District resident lacks
standing to claim local tax unconstitutional as applied to
bonds held by nonresidents outside District). I have previously pointed to cases in which the Court has found thirdparty standing where the "hindrance" was of the same kind
and approximate degree as that present here. Supra, at
474. There are, of course, other cases finding standing that
arguably involve even greater hindrance. See, e. g., Hodel
v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 711-712 (1987); Carey v. Population
Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 684, n. 4 (1977); Singleton v.

ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 459 (1958); Barrows v. Jack-son, 346 U. S. 249, 254 (1953). But they set no inner limit.

Nor do I agree with Justice O'Connor's determinationthat "rational scrutiny" must apply to Lorelyn's assertion of
her own rights. Lorelyn belongs to a class made up of chil-dren of citizen fathers, whom the law distinguishes from the
class of children of citizen mothers, solely on grounds of theparent's gender. This Court, I assume, would use heightened scrutiny were it to review discriminatory laws basedupon ancestry, say, laws that denied voting rights or educational opportunity based upon the religion, or the racialmakeup, of a parent or grandparent. And, if that is so, I am
not certain that it makes a significant difference whether onecalls the rights at issue those of Lorelyn or of her father.
Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984), does not hold to thecontrary. Id., at 755 (black schoolchildren's parents who
claimed a "stigmatizing injury" due to Internal RevenueService decision to grant tax exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools had not been "personally deniedequal treatment," and thus had not been injured).

Regardless, like Justice O'Connor, I "do not share," andthus I believe a Court majority does not share, "

Justice
Stevens' assessment that the provision withstands height-ened scrutiny."

Ante, at 451. I also agree with Justice
O'Connor that "[i]t is unlikely" that "gender classificationsbased on stereotypes can survive heightened scrutiny," ante,

at 452, a view shared by at least five Members of this Court.Indeed, for reasons to which I shall now turn, we must subject the provisions here at issue to "heightened scrutiny."And those provisions cannot survive.

Rusk, 387 U. S. 253, 268 (1967) ("[This Nation's] citizenry

in other circumstances by itself has warranted special consti-tutional protection. See,

e. g., Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.

have held that, under the equal protection principle, such

Breyer, J., dissenting
classifications may not rest on generalizations about thedifferent capacities of males and females when neutral categories would serve the legislature's end. United States v.
Virginia, 518 U. S., at 540-546.

These circumstances mean that courts should not diminish
the quality of review--that they should not apply speciallylenient standards--when they review these statutes. The

statutes focus upon two of the most serious of human rela-tionships, that of parent to child and that of individual to the
State. They tie each to the other, transforming both whilestrengthening the bonds of loyalty that connect family with
Nation. Yet because they confer the status of citizenship
"at birth," they do not involve the transfer of loyalties that
underlies the naturalization of aliens, where precedent sets
a more lenient standard of review. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430
U. S. 787 (1977).

To the contrary, the same standard of review must apply
when a married American couple travel abroad or temporarily work abroad and have a child as when a single American
parent has a child born abroad out of wedlock. If the standard that the law applies is specially lenient, then statutes
conferring citizenship upon these children could discriminate
virtually free of independent judicial review. And as a result, many such children, lacking citizenship, would be placed
outside the domain of basic constituti onal protections.
Nothing in the Constitution requires so anomalous a result.

I recognize that, ever since the Civil War, the transmission
of American citizenship from parent to child, jus sanguinis,
has played a role secondary to that of the transmission of
citizenship by birthplace, jus soli. See Rogers v. Bellei, 401
U. S., at 828; see also Weedin v. Chin Bow, 274 U. S. 657,
669-671 (1927) (citing United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169
U. S. 649, 674 (1898), and id., at 714 (Fuller, C. J., dissenting)).
That lesser role reflects the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause does not mention statutes that
might confer citizenship "at birth" to children of Americans

born abroad. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1 (stating that "[a]llpersons born or naturalized in the United States . . . are

citizens"). But that omission, though it may give Congressthe power to decide whether or not to extend citizenship to
children born outside the United States, see Rogers v. Bellei,
supra, at 835, does not justify more lenient "equal protec-tion" review of statutes that embody a congressional decision

to do so.Nothing in the language of the Citizenship Clause argues
for less close scrutiny of those laws conferring citizenship atbirth that Congress decides to enact. Nor have I found any
support for a lesser standard in either the history of the
Clause or its purpose. To the contrary, those who wrote the
Citizenship Clause hoped thereby to assure that courts
would not exclude newly freed slaves--born within the
United States--from the protections the Fourteenth Amendment provided, including "equal protection of the laws."
See, e. g., Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U. S., at 262; id., at 283-284
(Harlan, J., dissenting); H. Flack, Adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment 83-97 (1908). They took special care, lest deprivation of citizenship undermine the Amendment's guarantee of "equal protection of the laws." Care is no less necessary when statutes, transferring citizenship between
American parent and child, make the child a citizen "at
birth." How then could the Fourteenth Amendment itself
provide support for a diminished standard of review?

Nor have I found any such support in the history of the
jus sanguinis statutes. That history shows a virtually unbroken tradition of transmitting American citizenship from
parent to child "at birth," under statutes that imposed certain residence requirements. Supra, at 477; see also Bellei,
supra, at 835. A single gap occurred when, for a brief period of time, the relevant statutes (perhaps inadvertently)
failed to confer citizenship upon what must have been a small
group of children born abroad between 1802 and 1855 whose
citizen fathers were also born between 1802 and 1855. See

supra, at 663-664; Wong Kim Ark, supra, at 673-674. But
even then, some courts, recognizing the importance of theright, found common-law authority for the transmission to

those children of their parent's American citizenship. See
Ludlam v. Ludlam, 26 N. Y. 356, 362-372 (1863); see also
Lynch v. Clarke, 1 Sandf. Ch. 583, 659-663 (N. Y. 1844).

The history of these statutes does reveal considerablediscrimination against women, particularly from 1855 to

1934. See ante, at 463-465 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Butthat discrimination then cannot justify this discrimination
now, when much discrimination that the law once tolerated,
including "de jure segregation and the total exclusion of
women from juries," is "now unconstitutional even though
[it] once coexisted with the Equal Protection Clause."
J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 143, n. 15
(1994).

Neither have I found case law that could justify use here
of a more lenient standard of review. Justice Stevens
points out that this Court has said it will apply a more lenient standard in matters of " `immigration and naturalization.' " Ante, at 435, n. 11 (quoting Mathews v. Diaz, 426
U. S. 67, 82 (1976)). But that language arises in a case involving aliens. The Court did not say it intended that
phrase to include statutes that confer citizenship "at birth."
And Congress does not believe that this kind of citizenship
involves "naturalization." 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(23) ("The
term `naturalization' means the conferring of nationality of a
state upon a person after birth, by any means whatsoever"
(emphasis added)). The Court to my knowledge has never
said, or held, or reasoned that statutes automatically conferring citizenship "at birth" upon the American child of American parents receive a more lenient standard of review.

The Court has applied a deferential standard of review in
cases involving aliens, not in cases in which only citizens'
rights were at issue. See Mathews, supra (rights of alien

residents); Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U. S. 753 (1972) (citi-zens' rights related to treatment of alien); Fiallo v. Bell, 430

U. S. 787 (1977) (citizens' rights to obtain immigration prefer-ences for relatives who are aliens). When the Court has
considered the latter kind of case, it has not lowered thestandard of review. See

Bellei, 401 U. S., at 828-836 (evalu-ating due process challenge to citizenship statute under generally applicable standard).In sum, the statutes that automatically transfer American
citizenship from parent to child "at birth" differ significantlyfrom those that confer citizenship on those who originally
owed loyalty to a different nation. To fail to recognize thisdifference, and consequently to apply an unusually lenient
constitutional standard of review here, could deprive thechildren of millions of Americans, married and unmarried,
working abroad, traveling, say, even temporarily to Canadaor Mexico, of the most basic kind of constitutional protection.
See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, StatisticalAbstract of the United States 53 (1997) (Table 54) (reporting
that, as of 1990, 1.86 million United States citizens were bornabroad or at sea to American parents); see also Hearing before the Subcommittee on International Operations of theHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.,
114 (1991) (testimony of Andrew P. Sundberg) ("According tothe most recent survey carried out by the State Department,
40,000 children are born abroad each year to a U. S. citizenparent"). Thus, generally prevailing, not specially lenient,
standards of review must apply.

IV
If we apply undiluted equal protection standards, we musthold the two statutory provisions at issue unconstitutional.

The statutes discriminate on the basis of gender, making itsignificantly more difficult for American fathers than for
American mothers to transmit American citizenship to theirchildren born out of wedlock. If the citizen parent is a man,

either. $ 1409(c).Distinctions of this kind--based upon gender--are subject

to a " `strong presumption' " of constitutional invalidity.
Virginia, 518 U. S., at 532 (quoting J. E. B., supra, at 152
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)). The Equal Protec-tion Clause permits them only if the Government meets the

"demanding" burden of showing an " `exceedingly persuasive' " justification for the distinction. Virginia, supra, at
533; see also J. E. B., supra, at 136; Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982); Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 273 (1979);
Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 461 (1981). That distinction must further important governmental objectives,
and the discriminatory means employed must be "substantially related" to the achievement of those objectives. Virginia, supra, at 533 (citing Mississippi Univ. for Women,
supra, at 724). This justification "must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation."
Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533. Further, "it must not rely on
overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females." Ibid.; see also
J. E. B., supra, at 139-140, and n. 11; Craig, 429 U. S., at 201;
Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 223-224 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld,
420 U. S. 636, 643 (1975). The fact that the statutes "discriminat[e] against males rather than against females" is
beside the point. Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S.,
at 723.

The statutory distinctions here violate these standards.
They depend for their validity upon the generalization that
mothers are significantly more likely than fathers to care for

their children, or to develop caring relationships with theirchildren. But consider how the statutes work once one

abandons that generalization as the illegitimate basis for leg-islative line-drawing we have held it to be.

Id., at 726, 730.
First, assume that the American citizen is also the Caretaker
Parent. The statute would then require a Male CaretakerParent to acknowledge his child prior to the child's 18th

birthday (or for the parent or child to obtain a court equiva-lent) and to provide financial support. It would not require
a Female Caretaker Parent to do either. The gender-baseddistinction that would impose added burdens only upon
the Male Caretaker Parent would serve no purpose at all.
Second, assume that the American citizen is the NonCaretaker Parent. In that circumstance, the statute would
forgive a Female Non-Caretaker Parent from complying
with the requirements (for formal acknowledgment and written promises to provide financial support) that it would
impose upon a Male Non-Caretaker Parent. Again, the
gender-based distinction that would impose lesser burdens
only upon the Female Non-Caretaker Parent would serve
no purpose.

To illustrate the point, compare the family before us--
Charlie, Lorelyn, and Luz--with an imagined family--Carlos, a Philippine citizen, Lucy, his daughter, and Lenora,
Lucy's mother and an American citizen. Suppose that Lenora, Lucy's unmarried mother, returned to the United
States soon after Lucy's birth, leaving Carlos to raise his
daughter. Why, under those circumstances, should Lenora
not be required to fulfill the same statutory requirements
that here apply to Charlie? Alternatively, imagine that
Charlie had taken his daughter Lorelyn back to the United
States to raise. The statute would not make Lorelyn an
American from birth unless Charlie satisfied its two conditions. But had our imaginary family mother, Lenora, taken
her child Lucy back to the United States, the statute would
have automatically made her an American from birth with523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
out anyone having satisfied the two conditions. The ex-ample suggests how arbitrary the statute's gender-based

distinction is once one abandons the generalization thatmothers, not fathers, will act as caretaker parents.

Let me now deal more specifically with the justifications
that Justice Stevens finds adequate. Justice Stevensasserts that subsection (a)(4) serves two interests: first, "ensuring reliable proof of a biological relationship between thepotential citizen and its citizen parent,"

ante, at 436, and second, "encouraging" certain relationships or ties, namely, "thedevelopment of a healthy relationship between the citizen

parent and the child while the child is a minor," ante, at 438,
as well as "the related interest in fostering ties between the
foreign-born child and the United States," ibid. I have no
doubt that these interests are important. But the relationship between the statutory requirements and those particular objectives is one of total misfit.

Subsection (a)(4) requires, for example, the American citizen father to "acknowledg[e]" paternity before the child
reaches 18 years of age, or for the child or parent to obtain
a court equivalent (legitimation or adjudication of paternity).
Justice Stevens suggests that this requirement "produces
the rough equivalent of the documentation," such as a birth
certificate memorialized in hospital records, "already available to evidence the blood relationship between the mother
and the child." Ante, at 436. But, even if I assume the
"equivalency" (only for argument's sake, since birth certificates do not invariably carry a mother's true name or omit
the father's), I still do not understand the need for the priorto-18 legitimation-or-acknowledgment requirement. When
the statute was written, one might have seen the requirement as offering some protection against false paternity
claims. But that added protection is unnecessary in light
of inexpensive DNA testing that will prove paternity with
certainty. See Shapiro, Reifler, and Psome, The DNA Paternity Test: Legislating the Future Paternity Action, 7 J.

Law & Health 1, 29 (1992-1993) (current testing methods candetermine probability of paternity to 99.999999% accuracy);

see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-527, p. 38 (1983).Moreover, a different provision of the statute, subsection
(a)(1), already requires proof of paternity by "clear and convincing evidence." No one contests the validity of that pro-vision, and I believe that biological differences between men

and women would justify its imposition where paternity isat issue. In light of that provision, subsection (a)(4)'s
protection against false claims is not needed. Indeed, theGovernment concedes that, in light of the "clear and convincing evidence" requirement, the "time limit for meeting

the legitimation-or-acknowledgement requirement of Section
309(a)(4) must . . . reflect, at least in part, some other congressional concern." Brief for Respondent 27 (emphasis
added).

Justice Stevens says that this "other concern" is a concern for the establishment of relationships and ties, to the
father and to the United States, all before the child is 18.
Ante, at 438. According to Justice Stevens, the way in
which the requirement serves this purpose is by making certain the father knows of the child's existence--in the same
way, it says, that a mother, by giving birth, automatically
knows that the child exists. Ibid.

The distance between this knowledge and the claimed objectives, however, is far too great to satisfy any legal requirement of tailoring or proportionality. And the assumption that this knowledge of birth could make a significant
gender-related difference rests upon a host of unproved
gender-related hypotheses. Simple knowledge of a child's
existence may, or may not, be followed by the kinds of relationships for which Justice Stevens hopes. A mother or
a father, knowing of a child's birth, may nonetheless fail to
care for the child or even to acknowledge the child. A father with strong ties to the child may, simply by lack of
knowledge, fail to comply with the statute's formal require523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ments. A father with weak ties might readily comply.Moreover, the statute does little to assure any tie for, as

Justice Stevens acknowledges, a child might obtain anadjudication of paternity "absent any affirmative act by the
father, and perhaps even over his express objection." Ante,
at 434.To make plausible the connection between the statute's

requirement and the asserted "relationship" goals, Justice
Stevens must find a factual scenario where a father's
knowledge--equivalent to the mother's knowledge that shehas given birth--could lead to the establishment of a more

meaningful parenting relationship or tie to America. He
therefore points to what one might term the "war baby"
problem--the problem created by American servicemen fathering children overseas and returning to America unaware
of the related pregnancy or birth. The statutory remedy
before us, however, is disproportionately broad even when
considered in relation to that problem. Justice Stevens
refers to 683,000 service personnel stationed in the Far East
in 1970 when Lorelyn was born. Ante, at 439. The statute
applies, however, to all Americans who live or travel abroad,
including the 3.2 million private citizens, and the 925,000
Federal Government employees, who live, or who are stationed, abroad--of whom today only 240,000 are active duty
military employees, many of whom are women. U. S. Dept.
of State, Private American Citizens Residing Abroad (Nov.
21, 1997); U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census,

Selected Manpower Statistics 23, 44 (DIOR/MO1-96 1996).
Nor does the statute seem to have been aimed at the "war
baby" problem, for the precursor to the provisions at issue
was first proposed in a 1938 report and was first adopted in
the Nationality Act of 1940, which was enacted before the
United States entered World War II. Nationality Laws of

issue here, for, were Congress truly interested in achieving
the goals Justice Stevens posits in the way Justice Stevens suggests, it could simply substitute a requirement of
knowledge of birth for the present subsection (a)(4); or itcould distinguish between Caretaker and Noncaretaker Parents, rather than between men and women. A statute thatdoes not do so, but instead relies upon gender-based distinctions, appears rational only, as I have said, supra, at 482-484,
if one accepts the legitimacy of gender-based generalizations
that, for example, would equate gender and caretaking--
generalizations of a kind that this Court has previously
found constitutionally impermissible. See, e. g., Virginia,
518 U. S., at 542, 546 (striking down men-only admissions
policy at Virginia Military Institute even assuming that
"most women would not choose VMI's adversative method");
J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 139, n. 11 (invalidating gender-based

found in some of the gender stereotypes used to justify"
them); Craig, 429 U. S., at 201 (invalidating Oklahoma law
that established different drinking ages for men and women,
although the evidence supporting the age differential was
"not trivial in a statistical sense"); Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at
645 (holding unconstitutional statutory classification giving
to widowed mothers benefits not available to widowed fathers even though "the notion that men are more likely than
women to be the primary supporters of their spouses and
children is not entirely without empirical support"). Although Justice Stevens cites Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S.
248 (1983), for support, ante, at 441, that case was decided
before the DNA advances described earlier.

For similar reasons, subsection (3) denies Charlie Miller
"equal protection" of the laws. That subsection requires an

Breyer, J., dissenting
American father to "agre[e] . . . to provide financial support"for the child until the child "reaches the age of 18," but does

not require the same of an American mother. I agree withthe Government that this provision has as one objective
helping to assure ties between father and child. Brief forRespondent 26. But I do not see why the same need does
not exist with respect to a mother. And, where the Ameri-can parent is the Non-Caretaker Parent, the need for such
assurances would seem the same in respect to either sex.Where the American parent is the Caretaker Parent, there
would seem no need for the assurance regardless of gender.Since either men or women may be caretakers, and since
either men or women may be "breadwinners," one could jus-tify the gender distinction only on the ground that more
women are caretakers than men, and more men are "bread-winners" than women. This, again, is the kind of generalization that we have rejected as justifying a gender-baseddistinction in other cases. Virginia, supra, at 540-546;
J. E. B., supra, at 139, n. 11; Craig, supra, at 201; Wiesenfeld,
supra, at 645.For these reasons, I can find no "exceedingly persuasive"

justification for the gender-based distinctions that the stat-ute draws.

V
Justice Scalia argues that, if the provisions at issue vio-late the Constitution, we nonetheless are powerless to find a

remedy. But that is not so. The remedy is simply that ofstriking from the statute the two subsections that offend the
Constitution's equal protection requirement, namely, subsec-tions (a)(3) and (a)(4). With those subsections omitted, the
statute says that the daughter, Lorelyn, of one who, likeCharlie, has proved paternity by "clear and convincing evidence," is an American citizen, and has lived in the UnitedStates for five years, is a "citize[n] of the United States at
birth." 8 U. S. C. $$ 1409(a) and 1401. Whatever limita-tions there may be upon the Court's powers to grant citizen523US2 Unit: $U53 [04-29-00 17:52:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

489Cite as: 523 U. S. 420 (1998)
Breyer, J., dissenting
ship, those limitations are not applicable here, for the Courtneed not grant citizenship. The statute itself grants citizenship automatically, and "at birth." And this Court need onlydeclare that that is so. INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S. 875
(1988), which Justice Scalia cites in support, is beside thepoint, for the plaintiffs in that case, conceding that the statute at issue did not make them citizens, asked the courts toconfer citizenship as a remedy in equity. Cf.

Bellei, 401U. S., at 828-836 (assessing claim that statute conferred citizenship in the absence of a provision argued to be unconsti-tutional, without identifying any special remedial problems).

Of course, we can excise the two provisions only if Con-gress likely would prefer their excision, rather than imposing
similar requirements upon mothers. Califano v. Westcott,443 U. S. 76, 89-93 (1979);

Welsh v. United States, 398 U. S.333, 361 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). But, since

the provisions at issue seem designed in significant part toaddress difficulties in proving paternity (along with providing encouragement for fathers to legitimate the child)and, since DNA advances have overcome the paternity-proof
difficulties, I believe that Congress would have preferredseverance.

Justice Scalia is also wrong, I believe, when he says that"the INA itself contains a clear statement of congressional
intent" not to sever, ante, at 457, for the Act in fact containsthe following explicit severability provision:

"If any particular provision of this Act, or the applica-tion thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application ofsuch provision to other persons or circumstances shall
not be affected thereby." $ 406, 66 Stat. 281; see notefollowing 8 U. S. C. $ 1101, p. 38, "Separability."

The provision cited by Justice Scalia says:

"A person may be naturalized as a citizen of theUnited States in the manner and under the conditions

prescribed in this title and not otherwise." $ 310(d), 66Stat. 239, 8 U. S. C. $ 1421(d).

As "naturalization" under this statute does not include theconferral of citizenship at birth, the provision does not apply
here. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(23) ("The term `naturalization'means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person
after birth" (emphasis added)).

Justice Scalia also says that the law, as excised, wouldfavor fathers over mothers.

Ante, at 459. The law, how-ever, would require both fathers and mothers to prove their

parentage; it would require that one or the other be anAmerican, it would impose residency requirements that, if
anything, would disfavor fathers. I cannot find the reversefavoritism that

Justice Scalia fears.For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the

Court of Appeals.

CALIFORNIA et al. v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH,

INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1400. Argued December 1, 1997--Decided April 22, 1998
The S. S. Brother Jonathan and its cargo sank off the coast of California

in 1865. Shortly after the disaster, five insurance companies paid
claims for the loss of certain cargo, but it is unclear whether the ship
and the remaining cargo were insured. There is no evidence that either
the State or the insurance companies have attempted to locate or recover the wreckage. In this action, respondent Deep Sea Research,
Inc. (DSR), which has located the wreck, seeks rights to the vessel and
cargo under the Federal District Court's in rem admiralty jurisdiction.
California moved to dismiss, claiming that it possesses title to the wreck
either under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (ASA)--which provides that the Federal Government asserts and transfers title to a State
of any "abandoned shipwreck" embedded in the State's submerged lands
or on a State's submerged lands and included, or eligible for inclusion,
in the National Register--or under Cal. Pub. Res. Code Ann. $ 6313--
which vests title in the State to all abandoned shipwrecks on or in the
State's tide and submerged lands--and therefore DSR's in rem action is
an action against the State in violation of the Eleventh Amendment.
DSR countered that the ASA could not divest the federal courts of the
exclusive admiralty and maritime jurisdiction conferred by Article III,

$ 2, of the Constitution and requested a warrant for the arrest of the
vessel and its cargo. The District Court concluded that the State failed
to demonstrate a "colorable claim" to the wreck under the ASA; found
that the ASA pre-empts $ 6313; issued a warrant for the vessel's arrest;
appointed DSR the vessel's custodian and made it the exclusive salvor;
and decided that it would defer adjudication of title until after DSR
completed the salvage operation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing
that the ASA pre-empts $ 6313; that the Eleventh Amendment does not
bar the federal court's jurisdiction over the in rem proceeding as to the
application of the ASA; that the State did not prove that the Brother
Jonathan is abandoned under the ASA; and that the wreck's uninsured
portion should not be treated as abandoned.

Syllabus
Held:

1. The Eleventh Amendment does not bar a federal court's jurisdiction over an in rem admiralty action where the res is not within the
State's possession. Pp. 501-508.

(a) The federal courts have a unique role in admiralty cases as conferred by Article III, $ 2, cl. 1, of the Constitution. That jurisdiction
encompasses proceedings in rem. The jurisdiction of federal courts is
also constrained, however, by the Eleventh Amendment. Early cases
appear to have assumed the federal courts' jurisdiction over admiralty
in rem actions despite the Eleventh Amendment. Subsequent decisions altered the role of federal courts by explaining that admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction is not wholly exempt from the Eleventh Amendment. Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490 (New York I). Thus, this
Court held that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over an in rem
action against a tugboat operated by New York State, Ex parte New
York, 256 U. S. 503 (New York II), and that Florida could not invoke the
Eleventh Amendment to block the arrest of maritime artifacts in the
State's possession where that possession was unlawful, Florida Dept.
of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670 (plurality opinion).
However, those opinions did not address situations comparable to this
case, in which DSR asserts rights to a res not in the State's possession.
The action in New York I, although styled as an in rem action, was
actually, as the Court explained in that decision, an in personam action
against a state official; and the action in New York II was an in rem suit
against a vessel that was property of the State, in its possession and
employed for governmental use. Assertions in the opinions in Treasure
Salvors, which might be read to suggest that a federal court may not
undertake in rem adjudication of the State's interest in property without the State's consent, regardless of the status of the res, should not
be divorced from the context of that case and reflexively applied to the
very different circumstances presented by this case. Also, because
Treasure Salvors addressed only the District Court's authority to issue
a warrant to arrest artifacts, any references to what the lower courts
could have done if adjudicating the artifacts' title do not control the
outcome here. Nor does the fact that Treasure Salvors has been cited
for the general proposition that federal courts cannot adjudicate a
State's claim of title to property prevent a more nuanced application
of that decision in the context of the federal courts' in rem admiralty
jurisdiction. Pp. 501-506.

(b) In considering whether the Eleventh Amendment applies where
the State asserts claim in an admiralty action to a res not in its posses523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
sion, this Court's decisions involving the Federal Government's sovereign immunity in in rem admiralty actions provide guidance, for the
Court has recognized a correlation between sovereign immunity principles applicable to States and the Federal Government. Based on the
longstanding precedent that the federal courts' in rem admiralty jurisdiction is barred only where the Federal Government actually possesses
the disputed res, e. g., The Davis, 10 Wall. 15, the Eleventh Amendment
does not bar federal jurisdiction over the Brother Jonathan, and the
District Court may adjudicate DSR's and the State's claims to the shipwreck. Pp. 506-508.

2. Because the lower courts' conclusion that the Brother Jonathan
was not abandoned for ASA purposes was influenced by the assumption
that the Eleventh Amendment was relevant to the courts' inquiry, the
case is remanded for reconsideration of the abandonment issue, with the
clarification that the meaning of "abandoned" under the ASA conforms
with its meaning under admiralty law. The District Court's full consideration of the ASA's application on remand might negate the need to

Opinion of the Court
of a federal court over an in rem admiralty action where theres is not within the State's possession.

I
The dispute before us arises out of respondent DSR's as-sertion of rights to both the vessel and cargo of the Brother

Jonathan, a 220-foot, wooden-hulled, double side-wheeledsteamship that struck a submerged rock in July 1865 during
a voyage between San Francisco and Vancouver. It tookless than an hour for the

Brother Jonathan to sink, and mostof the ship's passengers and crew perished. The ship's

cargo, also lost in the accident, included a shipment of up to$2 million in gold and a United States Army payroll that
some estimates place at $250,000. See Nolte, Shipwreck:Brother Jonathan Discovered, San Francisco Chronicle, Feb.
25, 1994, p. 1, reprinted in App. 127-131. One of few partsof the ship recovered was the wheel, which was later displayed in a saloon in Crescent City, California. R. Phelan,The Gold Chain 242 (1987).

Shortly after the disaster, five insurance companies paidclaims totaling $48,490 for the loss of certain cargo. It is
unclear whether the remaining cargo and the ship itself wereinsured. See Wreck of the Steamship Brother Jonathan,
New York Times, Aug. 26, 1865, reprinted in App. 140-147.Prior to DSR's location of the vessel, the only recovery of
cargo from the shipwreck may have occurred in the 1930's,when a fisherman found 22 pounds of gold bars minted in
1865 and believed to have come from the Brother Jonathan.The fisherman died, however, without revealing the source
of his treasure. Nolte, supra, App. 130. There appears tobe no evidence that either the State of California or the insurance companies that paid claims have attempted to locateor recover the wreckage.

In 1991, DSR filed an action in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California seeking rights
to the wreck of the Brother Jonathan and its cargo under

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
496 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
that court's in rem admiralty jurisdiction. California inter-vened, asserting an interest in the

Brother Jonathan based
on the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (ASA), 102 Stat.432, 43 U. S. C. $$ 2101-2106, which provides that the Federal

Government asserts and transfers title to a State of any
"abandoned shipwreck" that either is embedded in sub-merged lands of a State or is on a State's submerged lands

"and is included in or determined eligible for inclusion in theNational Register," $ 2105(a)(3). According to California,
the ASA applies because the Brother Jonathan is abandonedand is both embedded on state land and eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places (National Register). California also laid claim to the Brother Jonathan
under Cal. Pub. Res. Code Ann. $ 6313 (West Supp. 1998)
(hereinafter $ 6313), which vests title in the State "to all
abandoned shipwrecks . . . on or in the tide and submerged
lands of California."

The District Court initially dismissed DSR's action without prejudice at DSR's initiative. The case was reinstated
in 1994 after DSR actually located the Brother Jonathan 41/2
miles off the coast of Crescent City, where it apparently rests
upright on the sea floor under more than 200 feet of water.
Based on its possession of several artifacts from the Brother
Jonathan, including china, a full bottle of champagne, and a
brass spike from the ship's hull, DSR sought either an award
of title to the ship and its cargo or a salvage award for its
efforts in recovering the ship. DSR also claimed a right of
ownership based on its purchase of subrogation interests
from some of the insurance companies that had paid claims
on the ship's cargo.

In response, the State of California entered an appearance
for the limited purpose of filing a motion to dismiss DSR's in
rem complaint for lack of jurisdiction. According to the
State, it possesses title to the Brother Jonathan under either
the ASA or $ 6313, and therefore, DSR's in rem action
against the vessel is an action against the State in violation

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

497Cite as: 523 U. S. 491 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
of the Eleventh Amendment. DSR disputed both of theState's statutory ownership claims, and argued that the ASA

could not divest the federal courts of the exclusive admiraltyand maritime jurisdiction conferred by Article III, $ 2, of
the United States Constitution. DSR also filed a motion
requesting that the District Court issue a warrant for thearrest of the

Brother Jonathan and its cargo, as well as an
order appointing DSR the exclusive salvor of the shipwreck.The District Court held two hearings on the motions.

The first focused on whether the wreck is located within Cal-ifornia's territorial waters, and the second concerned the
possible abandonment, embeddedness, and historical significance of the shipwreck, issues relevant to California's claims
to the res. For purposes of the pending motions, DSR stipulated that the Brother Jonathan is located upon submerged
lands belonging to California.

After the hearings, the District Court concluded that the
State failed to demonstrate a "colorable claim" to the Brother
Jonathan under federal law, reasoning that the State had
not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the
ship is abandoned, embedded in the sea floor, or eligible for
listing in the National Register as is required to establish
title under the ASA. 883 F. Supp. 1343, 1357 (ND Cal. 1995).
As for California's state law claim, the court determined that
the ASA pre-empts $ 6313. Accordingly, the court issued a
warrant for the arrest of the Brother Jonathan, appointed
DSR custodian of the shipwreck subject to further order of
the court, and ordered DSR to take possession of the shipwreck as its exclusive salvor pending the court's determination of "the manner in which the wreck and its cargo, or the
proceeds therefrom, should be distributed." Id., at 1364.

The District Court stated that it was not deciding whether
"any individual items of cargo or personal property have
been abandoned," explaining that "[a]t this stage in the litigation, DSR is not asking the court to award it salvage fees
from the res of the wreck, or to otherwise make any order

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
498 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
regarding title to or distribution of the wreck or its con-tents."

Id., at 1354. The District Court thought that the
most prudent course would be to adjudicate title after DSRcompletes the salvage operation. Following the District

Court's ruling, the United States asserted a claim to any
property on the Brother Jonathan belonging to the FederalGovernment.

The State appealed, arguing that its immunity from suitunder the Eleventh Amendment does not hinge upon the
demonstration by a preponderance of the evidence that theASA applies to the

Brother Jonathan. 102 F. 3d 379, 383
(CA9 1996). According to the State, it had established sufficient claim to the shipwreck under state law by "assert[ing]
that the Brother Jonathan is on its submerged lands and
that . . . $ 6313 vests title in the State to abandoned shipwrecks on its submerged lands." Id., at 385. Underlying
the State's argument was a challenge to the District Court's
ruling that the ASA pre-empts the California statute. The
State also maintained that it had a colorable claim to the
Brother Jonathan under the ASA, arguing that it presented
ample evidence of both abandonment and embeddedness,
and that the District Court applied the wrong test by "requir[ing] that abandonment be shown by an affirmative act
on the part of the original owner demonstrating intent to
renounce ownership." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
District Court's orders. The court first concluded that

$ 6313 is pre-empted by the ASA because the state statute
"takes title to shipwrecks that do not meet the requirements
of the ASA and which are therefore within the exclusive
admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts." Id., at 384.
With respect to the State's claim under the ASA, the court
presumed that "a federal court has both the power and duty
to determine whether a case falls within its subject matter
jurisdiction," and concluded that "it was appropriate for the
district court to require the State to present evidence that

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

499Cite as: 523 U. S. 491 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
the ASA applied to the Brother Jonathan, i. e., that it wasabandoned and either embedded or eligible for listing in the

National Register, before dismissing the case." Id., at 386.According to the court's reasoning, "in addressing the questions of abandonment, embeddedness, and historical significance of the wreck under the ASA, a federal court does notadjudicate the state's rights," because the ASA establishes

the Federal Government's title to a qualifying shipwreck,which is then transferred to a State.

Id., at 387. Consequently, in the court's view, "a federal court may adjudicatethe question of whether a wreck meets the requirements of

the ASA without implicating the Eleventh Amendment."
Ibid.

As to the specifics of the State's claim under the ASA, the
court held that the District Court did not err in concluding
that the State failed to prove that the Brother Jonathan is
abandoned within the meaning of the statute. The court
reasoned that, in the absence of a definition of abandonment
in the ASA, "Congress presumably intended that courts
apply the definition of abandonment that has evolved under
maritime law." Ibid. In maritime law, the court explained,
abandonment occurs either when title to a vessel has been
affirmatively renounced or when circumstances give rise to
an inference of abandonment. Here, the Court of Appeals
concluded, the District Court's "failure to infer abandonment
from the evidence presented by the State was not clearly
erroneous," given the insurance companies' claims to the
ship's insured cargo and undisputed evidence presented by
DSR that the technology required to salvage the Brother
Jonathan has been developed only recently. Id., at 388.
The court also rejected the State's bid to treat the uninsured
portion of the wreck as abandoned, explaining that the District Court did not address the status of individual items of
cargo or personal property, and that "divid[ing] the wreck
of the Brother Jonathan into abandoned and unabandoned
portions for the purposes of the ASA" would lead to both

500 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
federal and state courts adjudicating the wreck's fate, which,in the court's view, would be "confusing and inefficient," and

also "inconsistent with the general rule in maritime law oftreating wrecks as a legally unified res." Id., at 389.

Summarizing its reasoning, the court stated that, "[b]e-cause the law is reluctant to find abandonment, and because
a finding of partial abandonment would deprive those holdingtitle to the unabandoned portion of the wreck access to the
federal forum, we hold that the Brother Jonathan is notabandoned."

Ibid. (citation omitted). The court reservedthe question whether there might be some point at which

the insured portion of a shipwreck "becomes so negligible"that the entire wreck would be abandoned under the ASA.
Ibid. The court also declined to take judicial notice of evi-dence that, during pendency of the appeal, the

Brother Jona-than was determined eligible for inclusion in the National

Register.By concluding that the State must prove its claim to the
Brother Jonathan by a preponderance of the evidence inorder to invoke the immunity afforded by the Eleventh
Amendment, the Ninth Circuit diverged from other Courts
of Appeals that have held that a State need only make a bareassertion to ownership of a res. See

1263 (1997). II

The judicial power of federal courts extends "to all Casesof admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction." Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1.
The federal courts have had a unique role in admiralty casessince the birth of this Nation, because "[m]aritime commerce
was . . . the jugular vein of the Thirteen States." F. Frank-furter & J. Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court 7
(1927). Accordingly, "[t]he need for a body of law applicablethroughout the nation was recognized by every shade of
opinion in the Constitutional Convention." Ibid. The con-stitutional provision was incorporated into the first Judiciary
Act in 1789, and federal courts have retained "admiralty ormaritime jurisdiction" since then. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1).
That jurisdiction encompasses "maritime causes of actionbegun and carried on as proceedings in rem, that is, where
a vessel or thing is itself treated as the offender and madethe defendant by name or description in order to enforce a
lien." Madruga v. Superior Court of Cal., County of SanDiego, 346 U. S. 556, 560 (1954).

The jurisdiction of the federal courts is constrained, how-ever, by the Eleventh Amendment, under which "[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed toextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted
against one of the United States by Citizens of another State,
or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." Althoughthe Amendment, by its terms, "would appear to restrict only

the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts,"
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996), theCourt has interpreted the Amendment more broadly. See,

e. g., Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775,779 (1991). According to this Court's precedents, a State
may not be sued in federal court by one of its own citizens,

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
502 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
see Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), and a state officialis immune from suit in federal court for actions taken in an

official capacity, see Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900).The Court has not always charted a clear path in explaining the interaction between the Eleventh Amendment andthe federal courts'

in rem admiralty jurisdiction. Earlycases involving the disposition of "prize" vessels captured

during wartime appear to have assumed that federal courtscould adjudicate the in rem disposition of the bounty even
when state officials raised an objection. See United Statesv. Peters, 5 Cranch 115, 139-141 (1809). As Justice Story
explained, in admiralty actions in rem,

"the jurisdiction of the [federal] court is founded uponthe possession of the thing; and if the State should interpose a claim for the property, it does not act merely inthe character of a defendant, but as an actor. Besides,
the language of the [Eleventh] [A]mendment is, that `thejudicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity.' But asuit in the admiralty is not, correctly speaking, a suit in
law or in equity; but is often spoken of in contradistinc-tion to both." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States $ 1689, pp. 491-492 (5th ed.1891).

Justice Washington, riding Circuit, expressed the same viewin

United States v. Bright, 24 F. Cas. 1232, 1236 (No. 14,647)(CC Pa. 1809), where he reasoned:

"[I]n cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction theproperty in dispute is generally in the possession of the
court, or of persons bound to produce it, or its equiva-lent, and the proceedings are in rem. The court decides
in whom the right is, and distributes the proceeds ac-cordingly. In such a case the court need not depend
upon the good will of a state claiming an interest in thething to enable it to execute its decree. All the world

Opinion of the Court
are parties to such a suit, and of course are bound bythe sentence. The state may interpose her claim and

have it decided. But she cannot lie by, and, after thedecree is passed say that she was a party, and therefore
not bound, for want of jurisdiction in the court."
Although those statements might suggest that the Elev-enth Amendment has little application in

in rem admiraltyproceedings, subsequent decisions have altered that understanding of the federal courts' role. In Ex parte New York,256 U. S. 490 (1921)

(New York I), the Court explained thatadmiralty and maritime jurisdiction is not wholly exempt

from the operation of the Eleventh Amendment, thereby re-jecting the views of Justices Story and Washington. Id., at
497-498. On the same day, in its opinion in Ex parte NewYork, 256 U. S. 503 (1921) (New York II), the Court likewise
concluded that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over awrongful death action brought

in rem against a tugboat op-erated by the State of New York on the Erie Canal, although

the Court did not specifically rely on the Eleventh Amend-ment in its holding.

The Court's most recent case involving an in rem ad-miralty action, Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors,
Inc., 458 U. S. 670 (1982), addressed whether the EleventhAmendment "bars an in rem admiralty action seeking to recover property owned by a state." Id., at 682 (internal quo-tation marks omitted). A plurality of the Court suggested
that New York II could be distinguished on the ground that,in

Treasure Salvors, the State's possession of maritime arti-facts was unauthorized, and the State therefore could not

invoke the Eleventh Amendment to block their arrest. 458U. S., at 695-699 (citing

Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908),and Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204 (1897)). As the plurality

explained, "since the state officials do not have a colorableclaim to possession of the artifacts, they may not invoke the
Eleventh Amendment to block execution of the warrant ofarrest." 458 U. S., at 697.

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
504 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
That reference to a "colorable claim" is at the crux of thiscase. Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit interpreted the "colorable claim" requirement as imposing a bur-den on the State to demonstrate by a preponderance of the
evidence that the Brother Jonathan meets the criteria set
forth in the ASA. See 102 F. 3d, at 386; 883 F. Supp., at1349. Other Courts of Appeals have concluded that a State

need only make a bare assertion to ownership of a res inorder to establish its sovereign immunity in an

in rem admiralty action. See, e. g., Zych, 960 F. 2d, at 670.By our reasoning, however, either approach glosses over

an important distinction present here. In this case, unlike
in Treasure Salvors, DSR asserts rights to a res that is not
in the possession of the State. The Eleventh Amendment's
role in that type of dispute was not decided by the plurality
opinion in Treasure Salvors, which decided "whether a federal court exercising admiralty in rem jurisdiction may seize
property held by state officials under a claim that the property belongs to the State." 458 U. S., at 683; see also id., at
697 ("In ruling that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar
execution of the warrant, we need not decide the extent to
which a federal district court exercising admiralty in rem
jurisdiction over property before the court may adjudicate
the rights of claimants to that property as against sovereigns
that did not appear and voluntarily assert any claim that
they had to the res").

Nor did the opinions in New York I or New York II address
a situation comparable to this case. The holding in New
York I explained that, although the suit at issue was styled
as an in rem libel action seeking recovery of damages against
tugboats chartered by the State, the proceedings were actually "in the nature of an action in personam against [the
Superintendent of Public Works of the State of New York],
not individually, but in his [official] capacity." 256 U. S., at
501. The action in New York II was an in rem suit against
a vessel described as being "at all times mentioned in the

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

505Cite as: 523 U. S. 491 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
libel and at present . . . the absolute property of the State ofNew York, in its possession and control, and employed in the

public service of the State for governmental uses and pur-poses . . . ." 256 U. S., at 508. As Justice White explained
in his opinion in Treasure Salvors:

"The In re New York cases . . . reflect the special concern in admiralty that maritime property of the sover-eign is not to be seized. . . . [They] are but the most

apposite examples of the line of cases concerning in remactions brought against vessels in which an official of the
State, the Federal Government, or a foreign government
has asserted ownership of the res. The Court's consist-ent interpretation of the respective but related immunity doctrines pertaining to such vessels has been, uponproper presentation that the sovereign entity claims
ownership of a res in its possession, to dismiss the suitor modify its judgment accordingly." 458 U. S., at 709-
710 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added).

It is true that statements in the fractured opinions in
Treasure Salvors might be read to suggest that a federal
court may not undertake in rem adjudication of the State'sinterest in property without the State's consent, regardless

of the status of the res. See, e. g., id., at 682 (plurality opinion) ("The court did not have power . . . to adjudicate theState's interest in the property without the State's consent");

id., at 711 (White, J., concurring in judgment in part anddissenting in part) ("It is . . . beyond reasonable dispute that
the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from deciding
the rights and obligations of a State in a contract unless the
State consents"). Those assertions, however, should not be
divorced from the context of Treasure Salvors and reflexively applied to the very different circumstances presented
by this case. In Treasure Salvors, the State had possession--albeit unlawfully--of the artifacts at issue. Also, the

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
506 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Opinion of the Court
opinion addressed the District Court's authority to issue awarrant to arrest the artifacts, not the disposition of title to

them. As the plurality explained, "[t]he proper resolutionof [the Eleventh Amendment] issue . . . does not

require--
or permit--a determination of the State's ownership of the
artifacts." Id., at 699 (emphasis added); see also id., at 700(noting that while adjudication of the State's right to the

artifacts "would be justified if the State voluntarily advanceda claim to [them], it may not be justified as part of the Eleventh Amendment analysis, the only issue before us"). Thus,any references in

Treasure Salvors to what the lower courts
could have done if they had solely adjudicated title to the
artifacts, rather than issued a warrant to arrest the res, do
not control the outcome of this case, particularly given that
it comes before us in a very different posture, i. e., in an
admiralty action in rem where the State makes no claim of
actual possession of the res.

Nor does the fact that Treasure Salvors has been cited for
the general proposition that federal courts cannot adjudicate
a State's claim of title to property, see, e. g., Idaho v. Coeur
d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 289-290 (1997) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id.,
at 305-306 (Souter, J., dissenting), prevent a more nuanced
application of Treasure Salvors in the context of the federal
courts' in rem admiralty jurisdiction. Although the Eleventh Amendment bars federal jurisdiction over general title
disputes relating to state property interests, it does not necessarily follow that it applies to in rem admiralty actions, or
that in such actions, federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction over property that the State does not actually possess.

In considering whether the Eleventh Amendment applies
where the State asserts a claim in admiralty to a res not in
its possession, this Court's decisions in cases involving the
sovereign immunity of the Federal Government in in rem
admiralty actions provide guidance, for this Court has recognized a correlation between sovereign immunity principles

applicable to States and the Federal Government. See Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S., at 213; see also Treasure Salvors,
supra, at 710 (White, J., concurring in judgment in part anddissenting in part) (discussing analogy between immunity in

United States are only forbidden in cases where, in order tosustain the proceeding, the possession of the United States

must be invaded under process of the court." Id., at 20.
The possession referred to was "an actual possession, and
not that mere constructive possession which is very often
implied by reason of ownership under circumstances favorable to such implication." Id., at 21; see also The Siren, 7
Wall. 152, 159 (1869) (describing "exemption of the government from a direct proceeding in rem against the vessel
whilst in its custody"). The Court's jurisprudence respecting the sovereign immunity of foreign governments has likewise turned on the sovereign's possession of the res at issue.
See, e. g., The Pesaro, 255 U. S. 216, 219 (1921) (federal court's
in rem jurisdiction not barred by mere suggestion of foreign
government's ownership of vessel).

While this Court's decision in The Davis was issued over
a century ago, its fundamental premise remains valid in in
rem admiralty actions, in light of the federal courts' constitutionally established jurisdiction in that area and the fact that
a requirement that a State possess the disputed res in such
cases is "consistent with the principle which exempts the
[State] from suit and its possession from disturbance by virtue of judicial process." The Davis, supra, at 21. Based on
longstanding precedent respecting the federal courts' assumption of in rem admiralty jurisdiction over vessels that
are not in the possession of a sovereign, we conclude that
the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction

Opinion of the Court
over the Brother Jonathan and, therefore, that the DistrictCourt may adjudicate DSR's and the State's claims to the

shipwreck. We have no occasion in this case to considerany other circumstances under which an in rem admiralty
action might proceed in federal court despite the EleventhAmendment.

III
There remains the issue whether the courts below prop-erly concluded that the

Brother Jonathan was not aban-doned for purposes of the ASA. That conclusion was necessarily influenced by the assumption that the EleventhAmendment was relevant to the courts' inquiry. The Court
of Appeals' determination that the wreck and its contentsare not abandoned for purposes of the ASA was affected by
concerns that if "the vessel had been partially abandoned,both the federal court and the state court would be adjudicating the fate of the Brother Jonathan." 102 F. 3d, at 389.Moreover, the District Court's inquiry was a preliminary
one, based on the concern that it was premature "for thecourt to find that any individual items of cargo or personal
property have been abandoned." 883 F. Supp., at 1354. Inlight of our ruling that the Eleventh Amendment does not
bar complete adjudication of the competing claims to the
Brother Jonathan in federal court, the application of theASA must be reevaluated. Because the record before this

Court is limited to the preliminary issues before the DistrictCourt, we decline to resolve whether the Brother Jonathan
is abandoned within the meaning of the ASA. We leave thatissue for reconsideration on remand, with the clarification
that the meaning of "abandoned" under the ASA conformswith its meaning under admiralty law.

Our grant of certiorari also encompassed the questionwhether the courts below properly concluded that the ASA
pre-empts $ 6313, which apparently operates to transfer titleto abandoned shipwrecks not covered by the ASA to the
State. Because the District Court's full consideration of the

523US2 Unit: $U54 [04-29-00 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

509Cite as: 523 U. S. 491 (1998)
Stevens, J., concurring
application of the ASA on remand might negate the needto address the pre-emption issue, we decline to undertake

that analysis.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals assuming jurisdiction over this case is affirmed, its judgment in allother respects is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
In Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458U. S. 670 (1982), both the four Members of the plurality and

the four dissenters agreed that the District Court "did nothave power . . . to adjudicate the State's interest in the property without the State's consent." Id., at 682; see also id.,at 699-700;

id., at 703, n. (White, J., concurring in judgmentin part and dissenting in part). Our reasons for reaching

that common conclusion were different, but I am now per-suaded that all of us might well have reached a different
conclusion if the position of Justices Story and Washington(that the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to any

in rem admi-ralty action) had been brought to our attention. I believe

that both opinions made the mistake of assuming that theEleventh Amendment has the same application to an

in remadmiralty action as to any other action seeking possession of

property in the control of state officers.My error, in writing for the plurality, was the assumption
that the reasoning in Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204 (1897),and United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882), which
supported our holding that Treasure Salvors was entitled topossession of the artifacts, also precluded a binding determination of the State's interest in the property. Under thereasoning of those cases, the fact that the state officials were
acting without lawful authority meant that a judgmentagainst them would not bind the State. See 458 U. S., at
687-688 ("In holding that the action was not barred by the

510 CALIFORNIA v. DEEP SEA RESEARCH, INC.

Kennedy, J., concurring
Eleventh Amendment, the Court in Tindal emphasized thatany judgment awarding possession to the plaintiff would not

subsequently bind the State"). That reasoning would havebeen sound if we were deciding an ejectment action in which
the right to possession of a parcel of real estate was indispute; moreover, it seemed appropriate in

Treasure Sal-vors because we were focusing on the validity of the arrest

warrant.Having given further consideration to the special characteristics of in rem admiralty actions, and more particularlyto the statements by Justice Story and Justice Washington
quoted in the Court's opinion, ante, at 502-503* I am nowconvinced that we should have affirmed the

Treasure Sal-vors judgment in its entirety. Accordingly, I agree with the

Court's holding that the State of California may be bound bya federal court's in rem adjudication of rights to the Brother
Jonathan and its cargo.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court. In my view, the opinion'sdiscussion of

Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors,Inc., 458 U. S. 670 (1982), does not embed in our law the

distinction between a State's possession or nonpossession forpurposes of Eleventh Amendment analysis in admiralty
cases. In light of the subsisting doubts surrounding thatcase and

Justice Stevens' concurring opinion today, itought to be evident that the issue is open to reconsideration.

basis for this interpretation).

EDWARDS et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 96-8732. Argued February 23, 1998--Decided April 28, 1998
At petitioners' trial under 21 U. S. C. $$ 841 and 846 for "conspir[ing]" to

"possess with intent to . . . distribute [mixtures containing two] controlled substance[s]," namely, cocaine and cocaine base (i. e., "crack"),
the jury was instructed that the Government must prove that the conspiracy involved measurable amounts of "cocaine or cocaine base."
(Emphasis added.) The jury returned a general verdict of guilty, and
the District Judge imposed sentences based on his finding that each
petitioner's illegal conduct involved both cocaine and crack. Petitioners
argued (for the first time) in the Seventh Circuit that their sentences
were unlawful insofar as they were based upon crack, because the word
"or" in the jury instruction meant that the judge must assume that the
conspiracy involved only cocaine, which is treated more leniently than
crack by United States Sentencing Guidelines $ 2D1.1(c). However, the
court held that the judge need not assume that only cocaine was involved, pointing out that, because the Guidelines require the sentencing
judge, not the jury, to determine both the kind and the amount of the
drugs at issue in a drug conspiracy, the jury's belief about which drugs
were involved--cocaine, crack, or both--was beside the point.

Held: Because the Guidelines instruct the judge in a case like this to determine both the amount and kind of controlled substances for which a
defendant should be held accountable, and then to impose a sentence
that varies depending upon those determinations, see, e. g., Witte v.
United States, 515 U. S. 389, it is the judge who is required to determine
whether the "controlled substances" at issue--and how much of them--
consisted of cocaine, crack, or both. That is what the judge did in this
case, and the jury's beliefs about the conspiracy are irrelevant. This
Court need not, and does not, consider the merits of petitioners' claims
that the drug statutes and the Constitution required the judge to assume that the jury convicted them of a conspiracy involving only cocaine. Even if that were so, it would make no difference here. The
Guidelines instruct the judge to base a drug-conspiracy offender's sentence on his "relevant conduct," $ 1B1.3, which includes both conduct
that constitutes the "offense of conviction," $ 1B1.3(a)(1), and conduct
that is "part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan
as the offense of conviction," $ 1B1.3(a)(2). Thus, the judge below would

Opinion of the Court
have had to determine the total amount of drugs, whether they consisted of cocaine, crack, or both, and the total amount of each--regardless of whether he believed that petitioners' crack-related conduct was
part of the "offense of conviction" or "part of the same course of conduct
or common scheme or plan." The Guidelines sentencing range--on
either belief--is identical. Petitioners' statutory and constitutional
claims could make a difference if they could argue that their sentences
exceeded the statutory maximum for a cocaine-only conspiracy, or that
their crack-related activities did not constitute part of the "same course
of conduct," etc., but the record indicates that such arguments could not
succeed. Their argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the
judge might have made different factual findings had he known that the
law required him to assume the jury had found a cocaine-only conspiracy
is unpersuasive. Pp. 513-516.

The statutes at issue in this case make it a crime to"conspir[e]" to "possess with intent to . . . distribute . . . a

controlled substance." 21 U. S. C. $$ 841 and 846. TheGovernment charged petitioners with violating these statutes by conspiring "to possess with intent to distribute . . .

mixtures containing" two controlled substances, namely,"cocaine . . . and cocaine base" (

i. e., "crack"). App. 6. The
District Judge instructed the jury that "the governmentmust prove that the conspiracy . . . involved measurable

amounts of cocaine or cocaine base." App. 16 (emphasis
added). The jury returned a general verdict of guilty. Andthe judge imposed sentences based on his finding that each

petitioner's illegal conduct had involved both cocaine andcrack.

Petitioners argued (for the first time) in the Court of Ap-peals for the Seventh Circuit that the judge's sentences were
unlawful insofar as they were based upon crack. They said
that the word "or" in the judge's instruction (permitting a
guilty verdict if the conspiracy involved either cocaine or
crack) meant that the judge must assume that the conspiracy
involved only cocaine, which drug, they added, the Sentencing Guidelines treat more leniently than crack. See United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2D1.1(c)
(Nov. 1994) (drug table) (USSG). The Court of Appeals,
however, held that the judge need not assume that only cocaine was involved. 105 F. 3d 1179 (1997). It pointed out
that the Sentencing Guidelines require the sentencing judge,
not the jury, to determine both the kind and the amount of
the drugs at issue in a drug conspiracy. Id., at 1180. And
it reasoned that the jury's belief about which drugs were
involved--cocaine, crack, or both--was therefore beside the
point. Id., at 1181. In light of a potential conflict among
the Circuits on this question, see, e. g., United States v.
Bounds, 985 F. 2d 188, 194-195 (CA5 1993); United States v.
Pace, 981 F. 2d 1123 (CA10 1992); United States v. Owens,
904 F. 2d 411 (CA8 1990), we granted certiorari.

We agree that in the circumstances of this case the judge
was authorized to determine for sentencing purposes
whether crack, as well as cocaine, was involved in the
offense-related activities. The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the judge in a case like this one to determine both the

Opinion of the Court
amount and the kind of "controlled substances" for which a
defendant should be held accountable--and then to impose a
sentence that varies depending upon amount and kind. See
United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148 (1997) (per curiam)
( judge may consider drug charge of which offender has been
acquitted by jury in determining Guidelines sentence); Witte
v. United States, 515 U. S. 389 (1995) ( judge may impose
higher Guidelines sentence on offender convicted of possessing marijuana based on judge's finding that offender also
engaged in uncharged cocaine conspiracy). Consequently,
regardless of the jury's actual, or assumed, beliefs about the
conspiracy, the Guidelines nonetheless require the judge to
determine whether the "controlled substances" at issue--and
how much of those substances--consisted of cocaine, crack,
or both. And that is what the judge did in this case.

Virtually conceding this Guidelines-related point, petitioners argue that the drug statutes, as well as the Constitution,
required the judge to assume that the jury convicted them
of a conspiracy involving only cocaine. Petitioners misapprehend the significance of this contention, however, for even
if they are correct, it would make no difference to their case.
That is because the Guidelines instruct a sentencing judge
to base a drug-conspiracy offender's sentence on the offender's "relevant conduct." USSG $ 1B1.3. And "relevant
conduct," in a case like this, includes both conduct that
constitutes the "offense of conviction," id., $ 1B1.3(a)(1),
and conduct that is "part of the same course of conduct or
common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction," id.,

$ 1B1.3(a)(2). Thus, the sentencing judge here would have
had to determine the total amount of drugs, determine
whether the drugs consisted of cocaine, crack, or both, and
determine the total amount of each--regardless of whether
the judge believed that petitioners' crack-related conduct
was part of the "offense of conviction," or the judge believed
that it was "part of the same course of conduct or common

Opinion of the Court
scheme or plan." The Guidelines sentencing range--on
either belief--is identical.

Of course, petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims
would make a difference if it were possible to argue, say,
that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the
statutes permit for a cocaine-only conspiracy. That is because a maximum sentence set by statute trumps a higher
sentence set forth in the Guidelines. USSG $ 5G1.1. But,
as the Government points out, the sentences imposed here
were within the statutory limits applicable to a cocaine-only
conspiracy, given the quantities of that drug attributed to
each petitioner. Brief for United States 15-16, and nn. 6-7;
see 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)-(3); App. 42-47, 72-82, 107-112,
136-141, 163-169 (cocaine attributed to each petitioner). Cf.
United States v. Orozca-Prada, 732 F. 2d 1076, 1083-1084
(CA2 1984) (court may not sentence defendant under statutory penalties for cocaine conspiracy when jury may have
found only marijuana conspiracy). Petitioners' statutory
and constitutional claims also could have made a difference
had it been possible to argue that their crack-related activities did not constitute part of the "same course of conduct or
common scheme or plan." Then, of course, the crack (had it
not been part of the "offense of conviction") would not have
been part of the sentence-related "relevant conduct" at all.
But petitioners have not made this argument, and, after reviewing the record (which shows a series of interrelated drug
transactions involving both cocaine and crack), we do not see
how any such claim could succeed.

Instead, petitioners argue that the judge might have made
different factual findings if only the judge had known that
the law required him to assume the jury had found a
cocaine-only, not a cocaine-and-crack, conspiracy. It is sufficient for present purposes, however, to point out that petitioners did not make this particular argument in the District
Court. Indeed, they seem to have raised their entire argu523US2 Unit: $U55 [04-29-00 18:20:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ment for the first time in the Court of Appeals. Thus, peti-tioners did not explain to the sentencing judge how their

"jury-found-only-cocaine" assumption could have made a dif-ference to the judge's own findings, nor did they explain how
this assumption (given the judge's findings) should lead togreater leniency. Moreover, our own review of the record
indicates that the judge's Guidelines-based factfinding, whileresting upon the

evidence before the jury, did not depend onany particular assumption about the type of conspiracy the

jury found. Nor is there any indication that the assumptionpetitioners urge (a cocaine-only conspiracy) would likely
have made a difference in respect to discretionary leniency.For these reasons, we need not, and we do not, consider
the merits of petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANI et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of pennsylvania

No. 96-1613. Argued January 12, 1998--Decided April 29, 1998
After a third party perfected a $400,000 judgment lien under Pennsylvania

law on Francis Romani's Cambria County real property, the Internal
Revenue Service filed notices of tax liens on the property, totaling some
$490,000. When Mr. Romani died, his entire estate consisted of real
estate worth only $53,001. Because the property was encumbered by
both the judgment lien and the federal tax liens, the estate's administrator sought the county court's permission to transfer the property to
the judgment creditor in lieu of execution. The court authorized the
conveyance, overruling the Federal Government's objection that the
transfer violated the federal priority statute, 31 U. S. C. $ 3713(a), which
provides that a Government claim "shall be paid first" when a decedent's
estate cannot pay all of its debts. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania
affirmed, as did the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The latter court determined that there was a "plain inconsistency" between $ 3713 and the
Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, which provides that a federal tax lien
"shall not be valid" against judgment lien creditors until a prescribed
notice has been given, 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a). The court concluded that
the 1966 Act effectively limited $ 3713's operation as to tax debts, relying on United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715, 738, which
noted that the 1966 Act modified the Government's preferred position
in the tax area and recognized the priority of many state claims over
federal tax liens.

Held: Section 3713(a) does not require that a federal tax claim be given

preference over a judgment creditor's perfected lien on real property.
Pp. 522-534.

(a) There is no dispute about the meaning of either the Pennsylvania
lien statute or the Tax Lien Act. It is undisputed that, under the state
law, the judgment creditor acquired a valid lien on Romani's real property before his death and before the Government served notice of its
tax liens. That lien was therefore perfected in the sense that there is
nothing more to be done to have a choate lien. E. g., United States v.
City of New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84. And a review of the Tax Lien
Act's history reveals that each time Congress has revisited the federal
tax lien, it has ameliorated pre-existing harsh consequences for the delinquent taxpayer's other secured creditors. Here, all agree that by

523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
518 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANI

Syllabus

$ 6323(a)'s terms, the Government's liens are not valid as against the
earlier recorded judgment lien. Pp. 522-524.

(b) Because this Court has never definitively resolved the basic question whether the federal priority statute gives the United States a preference only over other unsecured creditors, or whether it also applies
to the antecedent perfected liens of secured creditors, see, e. g., United
States v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351, 358, n. 8, it does not seem appropriate
to view the issue here as whether the Tax Lien Act has implicitly
amended or repealed $ 3713(a). Instead, the proper inquiry is how best
to harmonize the two statutes' impact on the Government's power to
collect delinquent taxes. Pp. 524-530.

(c) Nothing in the federal priority statute's text or its long history
justifies the conclusion that it authorizes the equivalent of a secret lien
as a substitute for the expressly authorized tax lien that the Tax Lien
Act declares "shall not be valid" in a case of this kind. On several
occasions, this Court has concluded that a specific policy embodied in a
later federal statute should control interpretation of the older federal
priority statute, despite that law's literal, unconditional text and the
fact that it had not been expressly amended by the later Act. See,
e. g., Cook County Nat. Bank v. United States, 107 U. S. 445, 448-451.
United States v. Emory, 314 U. S. 423, 429-433, and United States v.
Key, 397 U. S. 322, 324-333, distinguished. So too here, there are sound
reasons for treating the Tax Lien Act as the governing statute. That
Act is the later statute, the more specific statute, and its provisions are
comprehensive, reflecting an obvious attempt to accommodate the
strong policy objections to the enforcement of secret liens. It represents Congress' detailed judgment as to when the Government's claims
for unpaid taxes should yield to many different sorts of interests (including, e. g., judgment liens, mechanic's liens, and attorney's liens) in many
different types of property (including, e. g., real property, securities, and
motor vehicles). See $ 6323. Indeed, given this Court's unambiguous
determination that the federal interest in the collection of taxes is paramount to its interest in enforcing other claims, see Kimbell Foods, Inc.,
440 U. S., at 733-735, it would be anomalous to conclude that Congress
intended the priority statute to impose greater burdens on the citizen
than those specifically crafted for tax collection purposes. Pp. 530-534.

547 Pa. 41, 688 A. 2d 703, affirmed.

The federal priority statute, 31 U. S. C. $ 3713(a), providesthat a claim of the United States Government "shall be paid

first" when a decedent's estate cannot pay all of its debts.1The question presented is whether that statute requires that
a federal tax claim be given preference over a judgmentcreditor's perfected lien on real property even though such
a preference is not authorized by the Federal Tax Lien Actof 1966, 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 et seq.

Opinion of the Court
J. Romani. The judgment was recorded in the clerk's office
and therefore, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, it became
a lien on all of the defendant's real property in Cambria
County. Thereafter, the Internal Revenue Service filed a
series of notices of tax liens on Mr. Romani's property. The
claims for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties described in
those notices amounted to approximately $490,000.

When Mr. Romani died on January 13, 1992, his entire estate consisted of real estate worth only $53,001. Because
the property was encumbered by both the judgment lien and
the federal tax liens, the estate's administrator sought permission from the Court of Common Pleas to transfer the
property to the judgment creditor, Romani Industries, in lieu
of execution. The Federal Government acknowledged that
its tax liens were not valid as against the earlier judgment
lien; but, giving new meaning to Franklin's aphorism that "in
this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death
and taxes," 2 it opposed the transfer on the ground that the
priority statute ($ 3713) gave it the right to "be paid first."

The Court of Common Pleas overruled the Government's
objection and authorized the conveyance. The Superior
Court of Pennsylvania affirmed, and the Supreme Court of
the State also affirmed. 547 Pa. 41, 688 A. 2d 703 (1997).
That court first determined that there was a "plain inconsistency" between $ 3713, which appears to give the United
States "absolute priority" over all competing claims, and the
Tax Lien Act of 1966, which provides that the federal tax
lien "shall not be valid" against judgment lien creditors until
a prescribed notice has been given. Id., at 45, 688 A. 2d,

2 Letter of Nov. 13, 1789, to Jean Baptiste Le Roy, in 10 Writings of
Benjamin Franklin 69 (A. Smyth ed. 1907). As is often the case, the original meaning of the aphorism is clarified somewhat by its context: "Our
new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises

Opinion of the Court
at 705.3 Then, relying on the reasoning in United States v.Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715 (1979), which had noted

that the Tax Lien Act of 1966 modified the Federal Govern-ment's preferred position in the tax area and recognized the
priority of many state claims over federal tax liens, id., at738, the court concluded that the 1966 Act had the effect of
limiting the operation of $ 3713 as to tax debts.The decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court conflicts
with two Federal Court of Appeals decisions, Kentucky ex

that " `[o]nly the plainest inconsistency would warrant ourfinding an implied exception to the operation of so clear a

Emory, 314 U. S. 423, 433 (1941)). We granted certiorari,521 U. S. 1117 (1997), to resolve the conflict and to consider
whether Thelusson, Key, or any of our other cases constru-ing the priority statute requires a different result.

II
There is no dispute about the meaning of two of the threestatutes that control the disposition of this case. It is therefore appropriate to comment on the Pennsylvania lien statuteand the Federal Tax Lien Act before considering the applicability of the priority statute to property encumbered by anantecedent judgment creditor's lien.

The Pennsylvania statute expressly provides that a judg-ment shall create a lien against real property when it is recorded in the county where the property is located. 42 Pa.Cons. Stat. $ 4303(a) (1995). After the judgment has been
recorded, the judgment creditor has the same right to noticeof a tax sale as a mortgagee.

4 The recording in one county

does not, of course, create a lien on property located else-where. In this case, however, it is undisputed that the judgment creditor acquired a valid lien on the real property in

4 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has elaborated:
"We must now decide whether judgment creditors are also entitled to
personal or general notice by the [County Tax Claim] Bureau as a matter
of due process of law.

"Judgment liens are a product of centuries of statutes which authorize
a judgment creditor to seize and sell the land of debtors at a judicial sale
to satisfy their debts out of the proceeds of the sale. The judgment represents a binding judicial determination of the rights and duties between
the parties, and establishes their debtor-creditor relationship for all the
world to notice when the judgment is recorded in a Prothonotary's Office.
When entered of record, the judgment also operates as a lien upon all real
property of the debtor in that county." In re Upset Sale, Tax Claim

Cambria County before the judgment debtor's death and before the Government served notice of its tax liens. Romani
Industries' lien was "perfected in the sense that there is
nothing more to be done to have a choate lien--when the
identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and
the amount of the lien are established." United States v.
City of New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84 (1954); see also Illinois
ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U. S. 362, 375 (1946).

The Federal Government's right to a lien on a delinquent
taxpayer's property has been a part of our law at least since
1865.5 Originally the lien applied, without exception, to all
property of the taxpayer immediately upon the neglect or
failure to pay the tax upon demand.6 An unrecorded tax
lien against a delinquent taxpayer's property was valid even
against a bona fide purchaser who had no notice of the lien.
United States v. Snyder, 149 U. S. 210, 213-215 (1893). In
1913, Congress amended the statute to provide that the fed5 The post-Civil War Reconstruction Congress imposed a tax of three
cents per pound on "the producer, owner, or holder" of cotton and a lien
on the cotton until the tax was paid. Act of July 13, 1866, $ 1, 14 Stat. 98.
The same statute also imposed a general lien on all of a delinquent taxpayer's property, see $ 9, 14 Stat. 107, which was nearly identical to a provision in the revenue Act of Mar. 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 470-471, quoted in n. 6,
infra.

6 The 1865 revenue Act contained the following sentence: "And if any

person, bank, association, company, or corporation, liable to pay any duty,
shall neglect or refuse to pay the same after demand, the amount shall be
a lien in favor of the United States from the time it was due until paid,
with the interests, penalties, and costs that may accrue in addition thereto,
upon all property and rights to property; and the collector, after demand,
may levy or by warrant may authorize a deputy collector to levy upon all
property and rights to property belonging to such person, bank, association, company, or corporation, or on which the said lien exists, for the
payment of the sum due as aforesaid, with interest and penalty for nonpayment, and also of such further sum as shall be sufficient for the fees,
costs, and expenses of such levy." 13 Stat. 470-471. This provision, as
amended, became $ 3186 of the Revised Statutes.

eral tax lien "shall not be valid as against any mortgagee,purchaser, or judgment creditor" until notice has been filed

with the clerk of the federal district court or with the appro-priate local authorities in the district or county in which the
property subject to the lien is located. Act of Mar. 4, 1913,37 Stat. 1016. In 1939, Congress broadened the protection
against unfiled tax liens to include pledgees and the holdersof certain securities. Act of June 29, 1939, $ 401, 53 Stat.
882-883. The Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 again broad-ened that protection to encompass a variety of additional
secured transactions, and also included detailed provisionsprotecting certain secured interests even when a notice of
the federal lien previously has been filed. 80 Stat. 1125-1132, as amended, 26 U. S. C. $ 6323.

In sum, each time Congress revisited the federal tax lien,it ameliorated its original harsh impact on other secured
creditors of the delinquent taxpayer.7 In this case, it isagreed that by the terms of $ 6323(a), the Federal Government's liens are not valid as against the lien created by theearlier recording of Romani Industries' judgment.

III
The text of the priority statute on which the Governmentplaces its entire reliance is virtually unchanged since its

enactment in 1797.8 As we pointed out in United States v.

reactions to this Court's tax lien decisions, see Kennedy, The Relative

Opinion of the Court
Moore, 423 U. S. 77 (1975), not only were there earlier ver-sions of the statute,

9 but "its roots reach back even further

into the English common law," id., at 80. The sovereignprerogative that was exercised by the English Crown and by

many of the States as "an inherent incident of sovereignty,"
ibid., applied only to unsecured claims. As Justice Brandeisnoted in Marshall v. New York, 254 U. S. 380, 384 (1920),

the common-law priority "[did] not obtain over a specific liencreated by the debtor before the sovereign undertakes to
enforce its right." Moreover, the statute itself does not cre-ate a lien in favor of the United States.

10 Given this background, respondent argues that the statute should be read as

be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall be deemed to
extend, as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property
to pay all his debts, shall make a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which
the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor, shall
be attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall be committed." Compare $ 3466 of the Revised Statutes with
the present statute quoted in n. 1, supra.

It has long been settled that the federal priority covers the Government's claims for unpaid taxes. Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 499-
502 (1926); Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611, 625-626, and
n. 24 (1948).

9 "The earliest priority statute was enacted in the Act of July 31, 1789,

1 Stat. 29, which dealt with bonds posted by importers in lieu of payment
of duties for release of imported goods. It provided that the `debt due to
the United States' for such duties shall be discharged first `in all cases of
insolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administrators
shall be insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased . . . .' $ 21,
1 Stat. 42. A 1792 enactment broadened the Act's coverage by providing
that the language `cases of insolvency' should be taken to include cases in
which a debtor makes a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors,
and the other situations that $ 3466, 31 U. S. C. $ 191, now covers. 1 Stat.
263." United States v. Moore, 423 U. S., at 81.

10 "In construing the statutes on this subject, it has been stated by the

court, on great deliberation, that the priority to which the United States
are entitled, does not partake of the character of a lien on the property of
public debtors. This distinction is always to be recollected." United
States v. Hooe, 3 Cranch 73, 90 (1805).

Opinion of the Court
giving the United States a preference over other unsecuredcreditors but not over secured creditors.

11

There are dicta in our earlier cases that support this con-tention as well as dicta that tend to refute it. Perhaps the

strongest support is found in Justice Story's statement:

"What then is the nature of the priority, thus limitedand established in favour of the United States? Is it a

right, which supersedes and overrules the assignment ofthe debtor, as to any property which the United States
may afterwards elect to take in execution, so as to pre-vent such property from passing by virtue of such assignment to the assignees? Or, is it a mere right ofprior payment, out of the general funds of the debtor, in
the hands of the assignees? We are of opinion that itclearly falls, within the latter description. The language employed is that which naturally would be em-ployed to express such an intent; and it must be strained
from its ordinary import, to speak any other." Conardv.

Atlantic Ins. Co. of N. Y., 1 Pet. 386, 439 (1828).

Justice Story's opinion that the language employed in thestatute "must be strained" to give it any other meaning is

entitled to special respect because he was more familiar with18th-century usage than judges who view the statute from a
20th-century perspective.We cannot, however, ignore the Court's earlier judgment
in Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat., at 426, or the more recentdicta in United States v. Key, 397 U. S., at 324-325. In Thelusson, the Court held that the priority statute gave theUnited States a preference over the claim of a judgment
creditor who had a general lien on the debtor's real property.

11 Although this argument was not presented to the state courts, respondent may defend the judgment on a ground not previously raised.
Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468-469, n. 12 (1983). We will rarely
consider such an argument, however. Ibid.; see also Matsushita Elec.

Opinion of the Court
The Court's brief opinion 12 is subject to the interpretation
that the statutory priority always accords the Government
a preference over judgment creditors. For two reasons, we
do not accept that reading of the opinion.

First, as a factual matter, in 1817 when the case was decided, there was no procedure for recording a judgment and
thereby creating a choate lien on a specific parcel of real
estate. See generally 2 L. Dembitz, A Treatise on Land
Titles in the United States $ 127, pp. 948-952 (1895). Notwithstanding the judgment, a bona fide purchaser could
have acquired the debtor's property free from any claims
of the judgment creditor. See Semple v. Burd, 7 Serg. &
Rawle 286, 291 (Pa. 1821) ("The prevailing object of the Legislature, has uniformly been, to support the security of a
judgment creditor, by confirming his lien, except when it
interferes with the circulation of property by embarrassing
a fair purchaser"). That is not the case with respect to

12 The relevant portion of the opinion reads, in full, as follows:
"These [statutory] expressions are as general as any which could have
been used, and exclude all debts due to individuals, whatever may be their
dignity. . . . The law makes no exception in favour of prior judgment creditors; and no reason has been, or we think can be, shown to warrant this
court in making one.

". . . The United States are to be first satisfied; but then it must be out
of the debtor's estate. If, therefore, before the right of preference has
accrued to the United States, the debtor has made a bona fide conveyance
of his estate to a third person, or has mortgaged the same to secure a
debt; or if his property has been seized under a fi. fa., the property is
devested out of the debtor, and cannot be made liable to the United States.
A judgment gives to the judgment creditor a lien on the debtor's lands,
and a preference over all subsequent judgment creditors. But the act of
congress defeats this preference in favour of the United States, in the
cases specified in the 65th section of the act of 1799." Thelusson v. Smith,
2 Wheat. 396, 425-426 (1817).

In the later Conard case, Justice Story apologized for Thelusson: "The
reasons for that opinion are not, owing to accidental circumstances, as
fully given as they are usually given in this Court." Conard v. Atlantic
Ins. Co. of N. Y., 1 Pet. 386, 442 (1828).

528 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANI

Opinion of the Court
Romani Industries' choate lien on the property in CambriaCounty.

Second, and of greater importance, in his opinion for theCourt in the Conard case, which was joined by Justice Washington, the author of Thelusson,13 Justice Story explainedwhy that holding was fully consistent with his interpretation
of the text of the priority statute:

"The real ground of the decision, was, that the judgmentcreditor had never perfected his title, by any execution

and levy on the Sedgely estate; that he had acquired notitle to the proceeds as his property, and that if the proceeds were to be deemed general funds of the debtor,the priority of the United States to payment had attached against all other creditors; and that a mere po-tential lien on land, did not carry a legal title to the
proceeds of a sale, made under an adverse execution.This is the manner in which this case has been understood, by the Judges who concurred in the decision; andit is obvious, that it established no such proposition, as
that a specific and perfected lien, can be displaced by themere priority of the United States; since that priority
is not of itself equivalent to a lien." Conard, 1 Pet.,at 444.

14

The Government also relies upon dicta from our opinion inUnited States v. Key, 397 U. S., at 324-325, which quoted

from our earlier opinion in United States v. Emory, 314 U. S.,at 433: "Only the plainest inconsistency would warrant our

13 Justice Washington's opinion for this Court in Thelusson affirmed, and
was essentially the same as, his own opinion delivered in the Circuit Court
as a Circuit Justice. 2 Wheat., at 426, n. h.

14 Relying on this and several other cases, in 1857 the Attorney General

of the United States issued an opinion concluding that Thelusson "has
been distinctly overruled" and that the priority of the United States under
this statute "will not reach back over any lien, whether it be general or
specific." 9 Op. Atty. Gen. 28, 29. See also Kennedy 908-911 (advancing
this same interpretation of the early priority Act decisions).

Opinion of the Court
finding an implied exception to the operation of so clear acommand as that of [$ 3713]." Because both

Key and Emory
were cases in which the competing claims were unsecured,the statutory command was perfectly clear even under Justice Story's construction of the statute. The statements
made in that context, of course, shed no light on the clarityof the command when the United States relies on the statute

as a basis for claiming a preference over a secured creditor.Indeed, the

Key opinion itself made this specific point: "This
case does not raise the question, never decided by this Court,whether $ 3466 grants the Government priority over the

prior specific liens of secured creditors. See United States
v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U. S. 361, 365-366 (1953)."
397 U. S., at 332, n. 11.

The Key opinion is only one of many in which the Court
has noted that despite the age of the statute, and despite the
fact that it has been the subject of a great deal of litigation,
the question whether it has any application to antecedent
perfected liens has never been answered definitively. See
United States v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351, 358, n. 8 (1964) (citing cases). In his dissent in United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U. S. 361 (1953), Justice Frankfurter referred
to the Court's reluctance to decide the issue "not only today
but for almost a century and a half." 345 U. S., at 367.

The Government's priority as against specific, perfected
security interests is, if possible, even less settled with regard
to real property. The Court has sometimes concluded that
a competing creditor who has not "divested" the debtor of
"either title or possession" has only a "general, unperfected
lien" that is defeated by the Government's priority. E. g.,
id., at 366. Assuming the validity of this "title or possession" test for deciding whether a lien on personal property
is sufficiently choate for purposes of the priority statute (a
question of federal law, see Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U. S., at 371), we are not aware of any decisions
since Thelusson applying that theory to claims for real prop523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
530 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANI

Opinion of the Court
erty, or of any reason to require a lienor or mortgagee toacquire possession in order to perfect an interest in real

estate.Given the fact that this basic question of interpretation
remains unresolved, it does not seem appropriate to view theissue in this case as whether the Tax Lien Act of 1966 has
implicitly amended or repealed the priority statute. In-stead, we think the proper inquiry is how best to harmonize
the impact of the two statutes on the Government's powerto collect delinquent taxes.

IV
In his dissent from a particularly harsh application of thepriority statute, Justice Jackson emphasized the importance

of considering other relevant federal policies. Joined bythree other Justices, he wrote:

"This decision announces an unnecessarily ruthless in-terpretation of a statute that at its best is an arbitrary
one. The statute by which the Federal Governmentgives its own claims against an insolvent priority over
claims in favor of a state government must be appliedby courts, not because federal claims are more meritorious or equitable, but only because that Government hasmore power. But the priority statute is an assertion of
federal supremacy as against any contrary state policy.It is not a limitation on the Federal Government itself,
not an assertion that the priority policy shall prevailover all other federal policies. Its generalities should
not lightly be construed to frustrate a specific policyembodied in a later federal statute."

Massachusetts v.United States, 333 U. S. 611, 635 (1948).

On several prior occasions the Court had followed this ap-proach and concluded that a specific policy embodied in a
later federal statute should control our construction of thepriority statute, even though it had not been expressly

523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
amended. Thus, in Cook County Nat. Bank v. UnitedStates, 107 U. S. 445, 448-451 (1883), the Court concluded

that the priority statute did not apply to federal claimsagainst national banks because the National Bank Act comprehensively regulated banks' obligations and the distribu-tion of insolvent banks' assets. And in

United States v.Guaranty Trust Co. of N. Y., 280 U. S. 478, 485 (1930), we

determined that the Transportation Act of 1920 had effec-tively superseded the priority statute with respect to federal
claims against the railroads arising under that Act.The bankruptcy law provides an additional context in
which another federal statute was given effect despite the
priority statute's literal, unconditional text. The early fed-eral bankruptcy statutes had accorded to " `all debts due to

the United States, and all taxes and assessments under thelaws thereof ' " a preference that was "coextensive" with that
established by the priority statute. Guarantee Title &
Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., 224 U. S. 152, 158
(1912) (quoting the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, Rev. Stat.$ 5101). As such, the priority Act and the bankruptcy laws

"were to be regarded as in pari materia, and both were
unqualified; . . . as neither contained any qualification, nonecould be interpolated." 224 U. S., at 158. The Bankruptcy

Act of 1898, however, subordinated the priority of the Fed-eral Government's claims (except for taxes due) to certain
other kinds of debts. This Court resolved the tension be-tween the new bankruptcy provisions and the priority statute by applying the former and thus treating the Govern-ment like any other general creditor.

532 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANI

Opinion of the Court
There are sound reasons for treating the Tax Lien Act of1966 as the governing statute when the Government is claiming a preference in the insolvent estate of a delinquent tax-payer. As was the case with the National Bank Act, the
Transportation Act of 1920, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,the Tax Lien Act is the later statute, the more specific statute, and its provisions are comprehensive, reflecting an obvi-ous attempt to accommodate the strong policy objections to
the enforcement of secret liens. It represents Congress' de-tailed judgment as to when the Government's claims for unpaid taxes should yield to many different sorts of interests(including, for instance, judgment liens, mechanic's liens, and
attorney's liens) in many different types of property (includ-ing, for example, real property, securities, and motor vehicles). See 26 U. S. C. $ 6323. Indeed, given our unambigu-ous determination that the federal interest in the collection
of taxes is paramount to its interest in enforcing otherclaims, see United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S.,
at 733-735, it would be anomalous to conclude that Congressintended the priority statute to impose greater burdens on
the citizen than those specifically crafted for tax collectionpurposes.

Even before the 1966 amendments to the Tax Lien Act,this Court assumed that the more recent and specific provisions of that Act would apply were they to conflict with theolder priority statute. In the

Gilbert Associates case, whichconcerned the relative priority of the Federal Government

and a New Hampshire town to funds of an insolvent tax-payer, the Court first considered whether the town could
qualify as a "judgment creditor" entitled to preference underthe Tax Lien Act. 345 U. S., at 363-364. Only after deciding that question in the negative did the Court conclude that
to throw into bankruptcy a debtor whose case might have been handled,
with less expense and less burden on the federal courts, in another form
of proceeding." Plumb, The Federal Priority in Insolvency: Proposals for
Reform, 70 Mich. L. Rev. 3, 8-9 (1971) (hereinafter Plumb).

Opinion of the Court
the United States obtained preference by operation of thepriority statute.

Id., at 365-366. The Government would
now portray Gilbert Associates as a deviation from twoother relatively recent opinions in which the Court held that

the priority statute was not trumped by provisions of other
statutes: United States v. Emory, 314 U. S., at 429-433 (theNational Housing Act), and

United States v. Key, 397 U. S.,
at 324-333 (Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act). In each ofthose cases, however, there was no "plain inconsistency" between the commands of the priority statute and the otherfederal Act, nor was there reason to believe that application
of the priority statute would frustrate Congress' intent.
Id., at 329. The same cannot be said in the present suit.

The Government emphasizes that when Congress
amended the Tax Lien Act in 1966, it declined to enact the
American Bar Association's proposal to modify the federal
priority statute, and Congress again failed to enact a similar
proposal in 1970. Both proposals would have expressly provided that the Government's priority in insolvency does not
displace valid liens and security interests, and therefore
would have harmonized the priority statute with the Tax
Lien Act. See Hearings on H. R. 11256 and 11290 before
the House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong., 2d
Sess., 197 (1966) (hereinafter Hearings); S. 2197, 92d Cong.,
1st Sess. (1971). But both proposals also would have significantly changed the priority statute in many other respects to follow the priority scheme created by the bankruptcy laws. See Hearings, at 85, 198; Plumb 10, n. 53,
33-37. The earlier proposal may have failed because its
wide-ranging subject matter was beyond the House Ways
and Means Committee's jurisdiction. Id., at 8. The failure
of the 1970 proposal in the Senate Judiciary Committee--
explained by no reports or hearings--might merely reflect
disagreement with the broad changes to the priority statute,
or an assumption that the proposal was not needed because,
as Justice Story had believed, the priority statute does not

Opinion of the Court
apply to prior perfected security interests, or any number ofother views. Thus, the Committees' failures to report the

proposals to the entire Congress do not necessarily indicatethat any legislator thought that the priority statute should
supersede the Tax Lien Act in the adjudication of federal tax
claims. They provide no support for the hypothesis thatboth Houses of Congress silently endorsed that position.

The actual measures taken by Congress provide a superiorinsight regarding its intent. As we have noted, the 1966
amendments to the Tax Lien Act bespeak a strong condem-nation of secret liens, which unfairly defeat the expectations
of innocent creditors and frustrate "the needs of our citizensfor certainty and convenience in the legal rules governing
their commercial dealings." 112 Cong. Rec. 22227 (1966)
(remarks of Rep. Byrnes); cf. United States v. Speers, 382U. S. 266, 275 (1965) (referring to the "general policy against

secret liens"). These policy concerns shed light on how Con-gress would want the conflicting statutory provisions to be
harmonized:

"Liens may be a dry-as-dust part of the law, but they are
not without significance in an industrial and commercialcommunity where construction and credit are thought to

have importance. One does not readily impute to Con-gress the intention that many common commercial liens
should be congenitally unstable." E. Brown, The Su-preme Court, 1957 Term--Foreword: Process of Law, 72
Harv. L. Rev. 77, 87 (1958) (footnote omitted).
In sum, nothing in the text or the long history of interpreting the federal priority statute justifies the conclusion that
it authorizes the equivalent of a secret lien as a substitute
for the expressly authorized tax lien that Congress has said
"shall not be valid" in a case of this kind.

The judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I join the opinion of the Court except that portion whichtakes seriously, and thus encourages in the future, an argument that should be laughed out of court. The Governmentcontended that 31 U. S. C. $ 3713(a) must have priority over
the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, because in 1966 and againin 1970 Congress "failed to enact" a proposal put forward by
the American Bar Association that would have subordinated$ 3713(a) to the Tax Lien Act, citing hearings before the
House Committee on Ways and Means, and a bill proposedin, but not passed by, the Senate. See Brief for United
States 25-27, and n. 10 (citing American Bar Association,Final Report of the Committee on Federal Liens 7, 122-124
(1959), contained in Hearings on H. R. 11256 and 11290 be-fore the House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong.,
2d Sess., 85, 199 (1966); S. 2197, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. (1971)).The Court responds that these rejected proposals "provide
no support for the hypothesis that both Houses of Congresssilently endorsed" the supremacy of $ 3713, ante, at 534, because those proposals contained other provisions as well, and
might have been rejected because of those other provisions,or because Congress thought the existing law already made

$ 3713 supreme. This implies that, if the proposals had notcontained those additional features, or if Members of Congress (or some part of them) had somehow made clear inthe course of rejecting them that they wanted the existing
supremacy of the Tax Lien Act to subsist, the rejection
would "provide support" for the Government's case.

That is not so, for several reasons. First and most obviously, Congress cannot express its will by a failure to legis-late. The act of refusing to enact a law (if that can be called

an act) has utterly no legal effect, and thus has utterly noplace in a serious discussion of the law. The Constitution
sets forth the only manner in which the Members of Con-gress have the power to impose their will upon the country:

by a bill that passes both Houses and is either signed by thePresident or repassed by a supermajority after his veto.

Art. I, $ 7. Everything else the Members of Congress do iseither prelude or internal organization. Congress can no
more express its will by not legislating than an individual
Member can express his will by not voting.Second, even if Congress

could express its will by not
legislating, the will of a later Congress that a law enactedby an earlier Congress should bear a particular meaning is

of no effect whatever. The Constitution puts Congress inthe business of writing new laws, not interpreting old ones.
"[L]ater enacted laws . . . do not declare the meaning of earlier law." Almendarez-Torres v. United States, ante, at 237;
ante, at 269-270 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("This later amendment can of course not cause [the statute] to have meant,
at the time of petitioner's conviction, something different
from what it then said"). If the enacted intent of a later
Congress cannot change the meaning of an earlier statute,
then it should go without saying that the later unenacted
intent cannot possibly do so. It should go without saying,
and it should go without arguing as well.

I have in the past been critical of the Court's using the
so-called legislative history of an enactment (hearings, committee reports, and floor debates) to determine its meaning. See, e. g., Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U. S. 511, 518-529
(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); United States
v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U. S. 505, 521 (1992)
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Blanchard v. Bergeron,
489 U. S. 87, 98-100 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). Today, however, the Court's
fascination with the files of Congress (we must consult them,
because they are there) is carried to a new silly extreme.
Today's opinion ever-so-carefully analyzes, not legislative
history, but the history of legislation-that-never-was. If we
take this sort of material seriously, we require conscientious
counsel to investigate (at clients' expense) not only the hear523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ings, committee reports, and floor debates pertaining to thehistory of the law at issue (which is bad enough), but to find,

and then investigate the hearings, committee reports, andfloor debates pertaining to, later bills on the same subject

CALDERON v. THOMPSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-215. Argued December 9, 1997--Decided April 29, 1998
In 1983, respondent Thompson was convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to death in a California state court. The special circumstance
of murder during the commission of rape made him eligible for the death
penalty. In ruling on his first federal habeas petition in 1995, the District Court, inter alia, granted relief on his rape conviction and the rape
special circumstance, thus invalidating his death sentence. A Ninth
Circuit panel reversed the grant in June 1996, and it denied Thompson's
petition for rehearing and suggestion for hearing en banc in March 1997.
In June, Thompson's certiorari petition was denied, and the Ninth Circuit issued a mandate denying all habeas relief. The State then set an
August execution date, and the State Supreme Court denied Thompson's
fourth state habeas petition. Two days before the execution, however,
the en banc Ninth Circuit recalled its mandate sua sponte, based on
claims and evidence presented in Thompson's first habeas petition. The
court had delayed action in the interests of comity until the conclusion
of his fourth state habeas proceeding. It asserted it had recalled the
mandate because procedural misunderstandings at the court prevented
it from calling for en banc review before the mandate issued, and because the original panel's decision would lead to a miscarriage of justice.
In granting habeas relief, the court found that Thompson was denied
effective assistance of counsel at trial by his attorney's failure to contest
the conclusions of the State's forensic expert and to impeach the credibility of two jailhouse informants.

Held:

1. The courts of appeals' inherent power to recall their mandates,
subject to review for an abuse of discretion, Hawaii Housing Authority
v. Midkiff, 463 U. S. 1323, 1324 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), is a power
of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave, unforeseen circumstances. The Ninth Circuit's recall decision rests on the most doubtful
of grounds. Even if its en banc process somehow malfunctioned, the
court compounded the error by delaying further action for more than
four months after the alleged misunderstandings occurred. The
promptness with which a court acts to correct its mistakes is evidence
of the adequacy of its grounds for reopening the case. Here, just two
days before the scheduled execution, the court recalled a judgment on

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

539Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Syllabus
which the State, not to mention this Court, had placed heavy reliance.
It is no answer for the court to assert it delayed action in the interests
of comity when it considered only the State Supreme Court's interest
in resolving Thompson's fourth habeas petition and not the more vital
interests of California's executive branch. Pp. 549-553.

2. The recall was consistent with the letter of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which sets limits on successive federal habeas applications. Since the court's specific recitation that it acted on the exclusive basis of Thompson's first federal petition is not disproved by consideration of matters presented in a later
filing, the court is deemed to have acted on the first, rather than a successive, application. Although AEDPA's terms do not govern this case,
a court of appeals must exercise its discretion in a manner consistent
with the objects of that statute and, in a habeas case, must be guided
by the general principles underlying this Court's habeas jurisprudence.
Pp. 553-554.

3. The recall was a grave abuse of discretion. Pp. 554-566.

(a) "[T]he profound societal costs that attend the exercise of habeas
jurisdiction," Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 539, make it necessary to
impose significant limits on the federal courts' discretion to grant habeas
relief. These limits reflect the Court's enduring respect for "the State's
interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct [statecourt] review." Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635. Finality is
essential to the criminal law's retributive and deterrent functions, and
it enhances the quality of judging. It also serves to preserve the federal balance, for "a [State's power] to pass laws means little if the
State cannot enforce them." McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491. A
State's finality interests are compelling when a federal court of appeals
issues a mandate denying federal habeas relief. Only with an assurance
of real finality can the State execute its moral judgment and can victims
of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out.
Unsettling these expectations inflicts a profound injury to the "powerful
and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty," Herrera v. Collins, 506
U. S. 390, 421 (O'Connor, J., concurring), an interest shared by the
State and crime victims alike. In these circumstances, the prisoner has
already had extensive review of his claims in federal and state courts.
In the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence, the State's interests in actual finality outweigh the prisoner's interest in obtaining yet
another opportunity for review. Pp. 554-557.

(b) Unless it acts to avoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by
this Court's habeas jurisprudence, a federal court of appeals abuses its
discretion when it sua sponte recalls its mandate to revisit the merits
of an earlier decision denying habeas relief to a state prisoner. This

Syllabus
standard is altogether consistent with AEDPA's central concern that
the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the
absence of a strong actual innocence showing. The rules applicable in
all cases where the court recalls its mandate further ensure the practice is limited to the most rare and extraordinary case. Moreover,
like other applicable habeas standards, this rule is objective in content,
well defined in the case law, and familiar to federal courts. McCleskey,
supra, at 496. Pp. 558-559.

(c) The miscarriage of justice standard was not met in this case.
The standard is concerned with actual, as compared to legal, innocence.
Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339. To be credible, the claim must
be based on reliable evidence not presented at trial. Schlup v. Delo,
513 U. S. 298, 324. A petitioner asserting his actual innocence of the
underlying crime must show "it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in light of the new evidence"
presented in his habeas petition. Id., at 327. A capital petitioner
challenging his death sentence in particular must show "by clear and
convincing evidence" that no reasonable juror would have found him
eligible for the death penalty in light of the new evidence. Sawyer,
supra, at 348. Thompson's claims fail under either standard. The record of his first federal habeas petition governs his actual innocence
claim. He presents little evidence to undermine the trial evidence.
The prosecution presented ample evidence showing that he committed
rape, and his own testimony--riddled with inconsistencies and falsehoods--was devastating. Neither the additional evidence he presented
to impeach the credibility of two jailhouse informants nor a pathologist's
testimony disputing opinions of prosecution trial witnesses meets the
"more likely than not" showing necessary to vacate his stand-alone rape
conviction, much less the "clear and convincing" showing necessary to
vacate his death sentence. There is no basis for a miscarriage of justice
finding. Pp. 559-566.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Thomas M. Thompson was convicted in California statecourt of the rape and murder of Ginger Fleischli. More than

15 years after the crime, 13 years after Thompson's convic-tion, and 7 years after Thompson filed his first petition for
federal habeas relief, the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit issued its mandate denying the writ of
habeas corpus. Two days before Thompson's scheduled ex-ecution, however, the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, recalled the mandate and granted habeas relief to Thompson.The case presents two issues: First, whether the Court of
Appeals' order recalling its mandate violated 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. 104-132, $ 104, 110 Stat. 1218; and second, whether the

order was an abuse of the court's discretion. The recall ofthe mandate was not controlled by the precise terms of

AEDPA, but this does not save the order, which, we hold,was a grave abuse of discretion.

I
A

Thompson met his 20-year-old victim, Ginger Fleischli, inthe summer of 1981. Fleischli shared a Laguna Beach studio apartment with David Leitch, with whom she had anintermittent sexual relationship. In August of that year,
Fleischli moved out and Thompson moved in. Fleischli tookup residence with Tracy Leitch, the former wife of David
Leitch.On September 11, 1981, at about 7:30 p.m., Fleischli and
Tracy Leitch encountered Thompson and David Leitch at apizza parlor. Fleischli told Tracy Leitch she was afraid
Thompson might kill her if she were left alone with him.The group later went to a bar together, but David and Tracy
Leitch soon departed. At 9:30 p.m., Afshin Kashani joinedThompson and Fleischli, drinking with both of them and
smoking hashish with Thompson. The trio went to a secondbar before walking to Thompson's apartment around 1 a.m.
At about 2 a.m., after Fleischli had gone to a nearby liquorstore to buy soda, Thompson told Kashani he wanted to have
sexual intercourse with Fleischli that night. He assuredKashani, however, that Kashani could "have" Fleischli after
Thompson and David Leitch left for Thailand to smuggle ref-ugees and drugs back to the United States. App. 7.

Before Fleischli returned to the apartment, Kashani beganwalking to his truck, which seems to have been left at a
local bar. On the way, Kashani realized he had forgotten hiscigarettes. He returned to the apartment, where Thompson
met him at the door. Thompson appeared nervous andmade Kashani wait outside while Thompson retrieved the
cigarettes. After returning to his truck, Kashani looked for

Opinion of the Court
Fleischli at a nearby liquor store and, not finding her, wenthome.

Tracy Leitch visited Thompson's apartment the morn-ing of September 12, asking where Fleischli was. Lying,
Thompson said she had left the Sandpiper Inn with Kashani
the night before. At a party that evening, Tracy Leitchagain asked Thompson where Fleischli was. In response,

Thompson described Fleischli in the past tense, saying hehad liked her. The next day, Tracy Leitch filed a missing
person's report with the local police department.On September 14, police found Fleischli's body buried in a
field 10 miles from the apartment shared by Thompson and
David Leitch. The body was wrapped in rope as well as a
sleeping bag and blanket, both taken from the apartment.
Fleischli's head was wrapped with duct tape, two towels, a
sheet, and her jacket. She had been stabbed five times in
the head near the right ear. The body was bruised on the
ankles, palms, and left wrist; the right wrist was crushed.
Fleischli's shirt and bra had been cut down the middle and
pulled to her elbows, restraining her arms and exposing her
breasts. She had on unbuttoned jeans, but no underwear,
shoes, or socks. A vaginal swab revealed semen consistent
with Thompson's blood type.

Police found two footprints near the body, one smooth and
one with a wavy pattern matching a shoe worn by David
Leitch. Fibers from the blanket around the body were identical to fibers found in the trunk of David Leitch's car. The
rope around the body was smeared with paint from the car's
trunk. Other fibers matched the carpet in the apartment,
which was stained with Fleischli's blood.

On or around the day police found the body, Thompson
and David Leitch went to Mexico. Leitch returned to the
United States, but Mexican authorities arrested Thompson
on September 26, 1981. He had handcuffs with him. When
questioned by police after his return to the United States,
Thompson claimed Fleischli had left his apartment with Ka523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

shani the night of the murder. He also said Fleischli hadbeen stabbed in the head, though this information had not

yet been made public. He further claimed not to have hadsex with Fleischli, but later asserted they had engaged in
consensual sex.We next recount the lengthy procedural history of the
case. B

On November 4, 1983, an Orange County Superior Courtjury convicted Thompson of the first-degree murder and
forcible rape of Fleischli. The jury made a special findingthat "the homicide of Ginger Lorraine Fleischli was an intentional killing personally committed by the defendant ThomasMartin Thompson." 45 Cal. 3d 86, 117, n. 23, 753 P. 2d 37,
56, n. 23 (1988). The jury further found the special circum-stance of murder during the commission of rape, making
Thompson eligible for the death penalty. After penaltyphase proceedings the jury was unanimous in recommending
a capital sentence, which the trial judge imposed. In a latertrial, a different jury found David Leitch guilty of seconddegree murder for his role in Fleischli's slaying.On April 28, 1988, the California Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Thompson's rape and murder convictionsand the jury's finding of the rape special circumstance. The
court also affirmed Thompson's death sentence, with two ofseven justices dissenting. The dissenters concurred in the
affirmance of the murder and rape convictions and the rapespecial circumstance, but asserted the jury's sentencing recommendation had been influenced in an improper manner byevidence that Thompson had solicited the murder of David
Leitch. Id., at 144-145, 753 P. 2d, at 74-75. Thompson pe-titioned for rehearing, which the court denied in June 1988.
Thompson also filed a petition for certiorari with this Court,which we denied. 488 U. S. 960 (1988).

Thompson filed his first state habeas petition, which theCalifornia Supreme Court denied in March 1989. Thompson

Opinion of the Court
filed a federal habeas petition in January 1990. The DistrictCourt held Thompson's petition in abeyance while Thompson

pursued unexhausted claims in state court. In January1991, the California Supreme Court denied Thompson's second state habeas petition. In February 1993, the California Supreme Court denied Thompson's third state habeaspetition.

In November 1993, the United States District Court forthe Central District of California held an evidentiary hearing
on the claims raised in Thompson's federal habeas petition.In an order dated March 28, 1995, the District Court granted
habeas relief as to the rape conviction and rape special circumstance and denied relief as to the murder conviction. In
the District Court's view, Thompson's trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel as to the rape charge.
The District Court cited two failings by the attorney. First,
the court held, counsel failed to contest certain of the conclusions offered by the State's forensic expert at trial. Second,
the court determined, counsel should have impeached the
credibility of two jailhouse informants to a greater extent
than he did. In the District Court's view, these failings
prejudiced Thompson under the rule of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Having granted relief as to the
rape special circumstance, the District Court ruled Thompson's death sentence was invalid. As to the murder conviction, the District Court rejected Thompson's claim he had
been prejudiced by what Thompson alleged were inconsistencies between the prosecution's theories at his trial and the
later trial of David Leitch. Having read the transcripts of
both trials, the court found "the trials differed mainly in emphasis." App. 71.

The timing of later federal proceedings is critical to the
issues we now resolve. On June 19, 1996, a unanimous
three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's grant of habeas relief as to the rape conviction
and rape special circumstance, affirmed the denial of habeas

546 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
relief as to the murder conviction, and reinstated Thompson'sdeath sentence. Noting that "[t]he State presented strong

evidence of rape" at Thompson's trial, 109 F. 3d 1358, 1365(CA9 1997), the court held that, irrespective of whether the
performance of Thompson's counsel was deficient in the manner Thompson alleged, Thompson could not demonstrateprejudice under

Strickland.
On August 5, 1996, Thompson filed a petition for rehearingand suggestion for rehearing en banc, which circulated to

"each active judge" of the court. See U. S. Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit General Orders 5.4(a)(1), p. 30 (Aug.
1997). In an order dated March 6, 1997, the original panel
denied the petition and rejected the suggestion, observing
that "[t]he full court has been advised of the suggestion for
rehearing en banc and no judge in active service has requested a vote to rehear the matter en banc." App. 137.
In the same order, the panel reissued its opinion in the case
with minor changes. Thompson filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, which we denied on June 2, 1997. 520
U. S. 1259. The Court of Appeals issued its mandate denying all habeas relief in Thompson's case on June 11, 1997.
In response, the State of California scheduled Thompson's
execution for August 5, 1997.

Thompson filed a fourth state habeas petition on July 3,
1997. In it, he alleged David Leitch had stated in a parole
hearing that he had witnessed Thompson and Fleischli engaged in what appeared to be consensual intercourse on the
night of Fleischli's murder. The California Supreme Court
denied the petition on July 16, 1997.

On July 22, 1997, Thompson filed a motion with the Court
of Appeals to recall its mandate denying habeas relief. The
following day, Thompson filed a motion in United States District Court for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). In support of both motions,
Thompson cited Leitch's alleged statement that he had seen
Thompson and Fleischli engaged in consensual sex.

Opinion of the Court
The District Court denied Thompson's Rule 60(b) motionon July 25, 1997. The court construed the motion to be a

successive petition under 28 U. S. C. $ 2244 as amended byAEDPA, ruling that Thompson "must not be permitted to
utilize a Rule 60(b) motion to make an end-run around the
requirements" of AEDPA. App. 170. The court observedthat the alleged new statement by Leitch conflicted with

Thompson's own account of the specifics of his encounterwith Fleischli, the physical evidence in the case, and the previous stories told by Leitch himself. Thus, the court held,Thompson "certainly cannot make the requisite showing that
he is actually innocent such that his execution would be a
miscarriage of justice." Id., at 188.

The Court of Appeals denied Thompson's motion to recall
the mandate on July 28, 1997. Two days later, however, the
full court voted to consider en banc whether to recall its
earlier mandate "to consider whether the panel decision of
our court would result in a fundamental miscarriage of
justice." 120 F. 3d 1042, 1043. The court scheduled oral
argument on this question for August 1, 1997, four days
before Thompson's scheduled execution.

Meanwhile, on July 29, 1997, the Governor of California
held a hearing on whether to grant clemency to Thompson.
In addition to the arguments presented by Thompson's attorneys during the hearing, the Governor reviewed "the materials submitted on [Thompson's] behalf, the petition and letters
signed by supporters of clemency, the submissions of the
Orange County District Attorney, the letters of the trial
judge concerning clemency," all the court opinions in Thompson's case, and "the materials and recommendation provided
to [him] by the Board of Prison Terms." App. to Brief for
Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae A-2
to A-3 (Decision of Governor Pete Wilson). In a comprehensive decision dated July 31, 1997, the Governor found
Thompson "ha[d] not remotely approached making any"
showing of innocence of rape or murder. Id., at A-16. The

Opinion of the Court
Governor agreed with the view of the judge who presidedover Thompson's trial, that "it would be an absolute tragedy and a travesty of justice to even seriously consider clem-ency in this case."

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Clemency was denied.

Two days before Thompson was to be executed, a divideden banc panel of the Court of Appeals recalled the court's

mandate of June 11, 1997. This action came 53 days afterthe mandate had issued and almost a full year after Thompson had filed his suggestion for rehearing en banc. TheCourt of Appeals asserted it did not recall the mandate on
the basis of Thompson's later motion for recall, but did so
sua sponte, on the basis of the claims and evidence presented
in Thompson's first federal habeas petition. Thus, the court
said, its "recall of the mandate is not predicated on any new
evidence or claims Thompson raises in his motion to recall
the mandate." 120 F. 3d 1045, 1049, n. 3. The court stated
it had considered whether to recall the mandate sooner, but
had chosen to wait until the conclusion of Thompson's statecourt proceedings before taking action.

The court presented two bases for recalling its earlier
mandate. First, the court asserted that, absent certain
"procedural misunderstandings within [the] court," it would
have called for en banc review of the underlying decision
before issuing the mandate denying relief. Id., at 1047.
These procedural misunderstandings included a mishandled
law clerk transition in one judge's chambers and the failure
of another judge to notice that the original panel had issued
its opinion in the case. Id., at 1067 (Kozinski, J., dissenting).
Second, the en banc court asserted the decision of the original panel "would lead to a miscarriage of justice." Id., at
1048.

Having recalled the mandate in Thompson's case, the en
banc court went on to address the merits of his first federal
habeas petition. The court held that Thompson's trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance as to the rape charge

Opinion of the Court
and rape special circumstance, to the defendant's prejudice.A plurality of the court would have granted habeas relief on

the additional ground of inconsistent theories by the prosecu-tion at his trial and the later trial of David Leitch. The
majority made no effort to determine whether Thompsonwas actually innocent of the rape and murder of Fleischli.
The court nonetheless affirmed the District Court's grant ofthe writ as to the rape conviction and rape special circumstance, vacated Thompson's death sentence, and further "re-mand[ed] the question of the murder conviction for [the
District Court's] initial consideration in light of our vacaturof the rape conviction."

Id., at 1060. Thus, almost 16 yearsafter Fleischli's murder, the Ninth Circuit directed the District Court to "enter the partial writ unless the State electsto retry Thompson within a reasonable time."

Ibid.Four judges dissented. Judge Hall argued the majority's

decision allowed Thompson to evade AEDPA's restrictionson successive petitions. Id., at 1064-1066. Judge Kozinski
detailed the circumstances which led the majority to find itsen banc process had malfunctioned. He asserted that, contrary to the majority's conclusion, the court's en banc process"operated just as it's supposed to."

Id., at 1067. In a thirddissenting opinion, Judge Kleinfeld recited in detail the evidence of Thompson's guilt of rape. Id., at 1073.Within hours of the Court of Appeals' order recalling its
mandate, the State of California filed with this Court a sec-ond petition for a writ of mandamus, which we construed as
a petition for certiorari. We granted the petition, 521 U. S.1136 (1997), and now reverse.

II
Although some Justices have expressed doubt on the point,see,

e. g., United States v. Ohio Power Co., 353 U. S. 98, 102-103 (1957) (Harlan, J., dissenting), the courts of appeals are

recognized to have an inherent power to recall their man-dates, subject to review for an abuse of discretion. Hawaii

Rehnquist, J., in chambers); see also Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 249-250 (1944).In light of "the profound interests in repose" attaching to

the mandate of a court of appeals, however, the power can
be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. 16 C.Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3938, p. 712 (2d ed. 1996). The sparing use of thepower demonstrates it is one of last resort, to be held in
reserve against grave, unforeseen contingencies.The en banc majority asserted extraordinary circumstances justified its order recalling the mandate in Thompson's case because, "[b]ut for procedural misunderstandings
by some judges of this court, an en banc call would have
been made and voted upon at the ordinary time." 120 F. 3d,
at 1048. As noted earlier, the original panel issued its decision denying habeas relief on June 19, 1996, and Thompson
filed a petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en
banc on August 5, 1996. On January 17, 1997, the panel notified the full court of its intention to reject the suggestion.
Id., at 1067 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). The panel reissued its
earlier opinion with minor revisions on March 6, 1997. In
the March 6 order, the panel also denied Thompson's petition
for rehearing and rejected his suggestion for rehearing en
banc. The panel observed that, although the full court had
been advised of Thompson's suggestion, no judge in active
service had requested a vote to rehear the case en banc
within the time specified in the General Orders of the Ninth
Circuit. App. 137.

It appears from Judge Kozinski's opinion that the following events also transpired. On March 12, 1997, an off-panel
judge wrote to the panel, requesting an opportunity to make
a belated call for a vote to rehear the case en banc. The
judge stated that the panel's decision had been "circulated
shortly before a law clerk transition" in the judge's chambers, and that "the old and new law clerks assigned to the

Opinion of the Court
case failed to communicate." 120 F. 3d, at 1067 (dissenting
opinion). Another judge seconded the request and asked:
"Was [the panel's January 17, 1997, notice of intention to reject the suggestion for rehearing en banc] circulated? Did
I miss it?" Ibid. The author of the panel opinion denied
the request for a belated en banc call, explaining that the
requesting judges had been notified two months earlier of
the panel's intention to reject Thompson's suggestion, id., at
1067-1068, which itself had circulated to every active judge
of the court on August 5, 1996.

The panel stayed the issuance of its mandate pending
Thompson's petition to this Court for certiorari review. We
denied Thompson's petition on June 2, 1997. 520 U. S. 1259.
The Court of Appeals issued its mandate on June 11, 1997.
According to the en banc majority, "[a] sua sponte request to
consider en banc whether to recall the mandate was made
shortly thereafter, even before the mandate was spread in
the district court." 120 F. 3d, at 1049. "[I]n the interests
of comity," however, the court delayed further action until
the California Supreme Court had denied Thompson's fourth
state petition for habeas relief. Ibid. It was not until
August 3, 1997--two days before Thompson was scheduled
to be executed--that the Ninth Circuit voted to recall its
mandate.

Measured even by standards of general application, the
Court of Appeals' decision to recall the mandate rests on the
most doubtful of grounds. A mishandled law clerk transition in one judge's chambers, and the failure of another judge
to notice the action proposed by the original panel, constitute
the slightest of bases for setting aside the "deep rooted policy in favor of the repose of judgments." Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co., supra, at 244. This is especially true where the only
consequence of the oversights was the failure of two judges
to contribute their views to a determination that had been
given full consideration on the merits by a panel of the court.

552 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
Even if the Ninth Circuit's en banc process did somehowmalfunction--which is itself open to question, see 120 F. 3d,

at 1067 (Kozinski, J., dissenting) ("[T]he process operatedjust as it's supposed to")--the court only compounded its
error when it delayed further action for more than four
months after the alleged misunderstandings took place.The promptness with which a court acts to correct its mistakes is evidence of the adequacy of its grounds for reopen-ing the case. In this case, the two judges first revealed their
oversights to the full court in March 1997. At that point thetwo judges remained free to "request that the [full] court
vote to suspend" its time limits for voting to rehear the case
en banc. See Ninth Circuit General Orders 11.11, at 83.
They chose not to do so, instead waiting another four months
to make what was, in effect, an identical request. The Court
of Appeals for all practical purposes lay in wait while this
Court acted on the petition for certiorari, the State scheduled a firm execution date for Thompson, and the Governor
conducted an exhaustive clemency review. Then, only two
days before Thompson was scheduled to be executed, the
court came forward to recall the judgment on which the
State, not to mention this Court, had placed heavy reliance.

It is no answer for the Court of Appeals to assert it delayed action in the interests of comity. Comity is not limited
to the judicial branch of a state government. In this case,
the executive branch of California's government took extensive action in reliance on the mandate denying relief to
Thompson. Rather than focus only on the California Supreme Court's interest in considering Thompson's fourth
(and, as could be predicted, meritless) state habeas petition,
the Court of Appeals should have considered as well the
more vital interests of California's executive branch.

It would be the rarest of cases where the negligence of
two judges in expressing their views is sufficient grounds to
frustrate the interests of a State of some 32 million persons
in enforcing a final judgment in its favor. Even if this were

553Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
a case implicating no more than ordinary concerns of finality,
we would have grave doubts about the actions taken by the
Court of Appeals.

III

Thompson's is not an ordinary case, however, because he
seeks relief from a criminal judgment entered in state court.
To decide whether the Court of Appeals' order recalling the
mandate was proper in these circumstances, we measure it
not only against standards of general application, but also
against the statutory and jurisprudential limits applicable in
habeas corpus cases.

A

California argues the Court of Appeals' recall of its mandate was barred by 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II)
as amended by AEDPA. Section 2244(b)(1) provides: "A
claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed." Subsection 2244(b)(2) provides: "A claim presented in a second or successive application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed" unless a narrow exception
applies. The immediate question is whether the Court of
Appeals recalled its mandate on the basis of a "second or
successive application" for habeas relief.

In a $ 2254 case, a prisoner's motion to recall the mandate
on the basis of the merits of the underlying decision can be
regarded as a second or successive application for purposes
of $ 2244(b). Otherwise, petitioners could evade the bar
against relitigation of claims presented in a prior application,

$ 2244(b)(1), or the bar against litigation of claims not presented in a prior application, $ 2244(b)(2). If the court
grants such a motion, its action is subject to AEDPA irrespective of whether the motion is based on old claims (in
which case $ 2244(b)(1) would apply) or new ones (in which
case $ 2244(b)(2) would apply).

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
554 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
As a textual matter, $ 2244(b) applies only where the courtacts pursuant to a prisoner's "application." This carries implications for cases where a motion to recall the mandate ispending, but the court instead recalls the mandate on its own
initiative. Whether these cases are subject to $ 2244(b) de-pends on the underlying basis of the court's action

. If, inrecalling the mandate, the court considers new claims or evidence presented in a successive application for habeas relief,it is proper to regard the court's action as based on that
application. In these cases, $ 2244(b)(2) applies irrespectiveof whether the court characterizes the action as sua sponte.

In Thompson's case, however, the Court of Appeals wasspecific in reciting that it acted on the exclusive basis of
Thompson's first federal habeas petition. The court's char-acterization of its action as

sua sponte does not, of course,prove this point; had the court considered claims or evidence

presented in Thompson's later filings, its action would havebeen based on a successive application, and so would be subject to $ 2244(b). But in Thompson's case the court's recita-tion that it acted on the exclusive basis of his first federal
petition is not disproved by consideration of matters pre-sented in a later filing. Thus we deem the court to have
acted on his first application rather than a successive one.As a result, the court's order recalling its mandate did not
contravene the letter of AEDPA.Although the terms of AEDPA do not govern this case,
a court of appeals must exercise its discretion in a mannerconsistent with the objects of the statute. In a habeas case,
moreover, the court must be guided by the general principlesunderlying our habeas corpus jurisprudence. We now consider those principles as applied to this case.

B
In light of "the profound societal costs that attend the ex-ercise of habeas jurisdiction,"

Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S.527, 539 (1986), we have found it necessary to impose signifi523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

555Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
cant limits on the discretion of federal courts to grant habeasrelief. See,

e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 487 (1991)
(limiting "a district court's discretion to entertain abusivepetitions");

Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90-91 (1977)
(limiting courts' discretion to entertain procedurally defaulted claims); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 308-310 (1989)(plurality opinion of

O'Connor, J.) (limiting courts' discretion to give retroactive application to "new rules" in habeascases);

Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637-638 (1993)
(limiting courts' discretion to grant habeas relief on the basisof "trial error").

These limits reflect our enduring respect for "the State's
interest in the finality of convictions that have survived
direct review within the state court system." Id., at 635;
accord, Wood v. Bartholomew, 516 U. S. 1, 8 (1995) (per curiam); Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 338 (1992); Keeney

v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7 (1992); McCleskey, supra, at
491-492; Teague, supra, at 309; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.
478, 487 (1986); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 127 (1982). Finality is essential to both the retributive and the deterrent
functions of criminal law. "Neither innocence nor just punishment can be vindicated until the final judgment is known."
McCleskey, supra, at 491. "Without finality, the criminal
law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect." Teague,
supra, at 309.

Finality also enhances the quality of judging. There is
perhaps "nothing more subversive of a judge's sense of responsibility, of the inner subjective conscientiousness which
is so essential a part of the difficult and subtle art of judging
well, than an indiscriminate acceptance of the notion that all
the shots will always be called by someone else." Bator,
Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for
State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 451 (1963).

Finality serves as well to preserve the federal balance.
Federal habeas review of state convictions frustrates " `both
the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their

556 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.' " Murray v. Carrier, supra, at 487 (quoting Engle, supra, at 128).
"Our federal system recognizes the independent power of aState to articulate societal norms through criminal law; but

the power of a State to pass laws means little if the State
cannot enforce them." McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 491.A State's interests in finality are compelling when a federal court of appeals issues a mandate denying federal ha-beas relief. At that point, having in all likelihood borne for
years "the significant costs of federal habeas review," id., at490-491, the State is entitled to the assurance of finality.
When lengthy federal proceedings have run their course and
a mandate denying relief has issued, finality acquires an
added moral dimension. Only with an assurance of real finality can the State execute its moral judgment in a case.
Only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward
knowing the moral judgment will be carried out. See generally Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). To unsettle
these expectations is to inflict a profound injury to the "powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty," Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 421 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring), an interest shared by the State and the victims of
crime alike.

This case well illustrates the extraordinary costs associated with a federal court of appeals' recall of its mandate
denying federal habeas relief. By July 31, 1997, to vindicate
the laws enacted by the legislature of the State of California,
a jury had convicted Thompson of rape and murder and recommended that he be executed; the trial judge had imposed
a sentence of death; the California Supreme Court had affirmed Thompson's sentence and on four occasions refused to
disturb it on collateral attack; and, in a comprehensive and
public decision, the Governor had determined the sentence
was just. Relying upon the mandate denying habeas relief
to Thompson, the State of California had invoked its entire
legal and moral authority in support of executing its judg523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

557Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ment. Yet, after almost 13 years of state and federal review
of Thompson's conviction and sentence, almost one year after
Thompson filed his petition for rehearing and suggestion for
rehearing en banc, a full 53 days after issuance of the mandate denying relief, and a mere two days before Thompson
was scheduled to be executed, the Ninth Circuit recalled its
mandate and granted the writ of habeas corpus. The costs
imposed by these actions are as severe as any that can be
imposed in federal habeas review.

We should be clear about the circumstances we address in
this case. We deal not with the recall of a mandate to correct mere clerical errors in the judgment itself, similar to
those described in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 or
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a). The State can have
little interest, based on reliance or other grounds, in preserving a mandate not in accordance with the actual decision rendered by the court. This also is not a case of fraud upon
the court, calling into question the very legitimacy of the
judgment. See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire
Co., 322 U. S. 238 (1944). Nor is this a case where the mandate is stayed under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41
pending the court's disposition of a suggestion for rehearing
en banc.

Rather, we are concerned with cases where, as here, a
court of appeals recalls its mandate to revisit the merits of
its earlier decision denying habeas relief. In these cases,
the State's interests in finality are all but paramount, without regard to whether the court of appeals predicates the
recall on a procedural misunderstanding or some other irregularity occurring prior to its decision. The prisoner has
already had extensive review of his claims in federal and
state courts. In the absence of a strong showing of "actua[l]
innocen[ce]," Murray v. Carrier, supra, at 496, the State's
interests in actual finality outweigh the prisoner's interest
in obtaining yet another opportunity for review.

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
558 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
Based on these considerations, we hold the general rule tobe that, where a federal court of appeals

sua sponte recalls
its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision deny-ing habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner, the court abuses

its discretion unless it acts to avoid a miscarriage of justice
as defined by our habeas corpus jurisprudence. The ruleaccommodates the need to allow courts to remedy actual injustice while recognizing that, at some point, the State mustbe allowed to exercise its " `sovereign power to punish offenders.' " McCleskey, supra, at 491 (quoting Murray v.
Carrier, 477 U. S., at 487).

This standard comports with the values and purposes underlying AEDPA. Although AEDPA does not govern this
case, see supra, at 554, its provisions "certainly inform
our consideration" of whether the Court of Appeals abused
its discretion. Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 663 (1996).

Section 2244(b) of the statute is grounded in respect for the
finality of criminal judgments. With the exception of claims
based on new rules of constitutional law made retroactive by
this Court, see $ 2244(b)(2)(A), a federal court can consider a
claim presented in a second or successive application only if
the prisoner shows, among other things, that the facts underlying the claim establish his innocence by clear and convincing evidence. See $ 2244(b)(2)(B). It is true that the miscarriage of justice standard we adopt today is somewhat
more lenient than the standard in $ 2244(b)(2)(B). See, e. g.,

$ 2244(b)(2)(B)(i) (factual predicate for claim must "not have
been discover[able] previously through the exercise of due
diligence"). The miscarriage of justice standard is altogether consistent, however, with AEDPA's central concern
that the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence. And, of course, the rules applicable in all cases
where the court recalls its mandate, see supra, at 549-553,
further ensure the practice is limited to the most rare and
extraordinary case.

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

559Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Like other standards applicable in habeas cases, moreover,the miscarriage of justice standard is objective in content,

"[w]ell defined in the case law," and "familiar to federalcourts." McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 496. It is indeed the
standard the Ninth Circuit determined to apply in voting toconsider en banc whether to recall the mandate in Thompson's case. See App. 194 (Order of July 30, 1997) ("The fullcourt has voted to consider whether to recall the mandate to
consider whether the panel decision of our court would resultin a fundamental miscarriage of justice"). Hence the standard is not only a just but also " `a sound and workable meansof channeling the discretion of federal habeas courts.' "

McCleskey, supra, at 496 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, supra,at 497).

We now determine whether this standard was met inThompson's case.

C
"[T]he miscarriage of justice exception is concerned withactual as compared to legal innocence."

Sawyer, 505 U. S.,at 339. We have often emphasized "the narrow scope" of

the exception. Id., at 340; accord, Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S.255, 271 (1989) (

O'Connor, J., concurring) ("narrow excep-tion" for the " `extraordinary case' "). "To be credible," a

claim of actual innocence must be based on reliable evidencenot presented at trial. Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 324
(1995). Given the rarity of such evidence, "in virtuallyevery case, the allegation of actual innocence has been summarily rejected." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).Although demanding in all cases, the precise scope of the
miscarriage of justice exception depends on the nature of thechallenge brought by the habeas petitioner. If the petitioner asserts his actual innocence of the underlying crime,he must show "it is more likely than not that no reasonable
juror would have convicted him in light of the new evidence"presented in his habeas petition.

Id., at 327. If, on theother hand, a capital petitioner challenges his death sentence

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
560 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
in particular, he must show "by clear and convincing evi-dence" that no reasonable juror would have found him eligible for the death penalty in light of the new evidence. Sawyer, supra, at 348.

The Sawyer standard has a broader application than is at
first apparent. As the Court explained in Schlup, when acapital petitioner challenges his underlying capital murder

conviction on the basis of an element that "function[s] essen-tially as a sentence enhancer," the

Sawyer "clear and convincing" standard applies to the claim. Schlup, supra, at326. Thus, to the extent a capital petitioner claims he did

not kill the victim, the Schlup "more likely than not" standard applies. To the extent a capital petitioner contests the
special circumstances rendering him eligible for the death
penalty, the Sawyer "clear and convincing" standard applies,
irrespective of whether the special circumstances are elements of the offense of capital murder or, as here, mere sentencing enhancers.

A claim like Thompson's could present some difficulty concerning whether to apply Schlup or Sawyer. Thompson
makes no appreciable effort to assert his innocence of
Fleischli's murder. Instead, he challenges, first, his rape
conviction, and second, the jury's finding of the special circumstance of rape. The former challenge is subject to the
Schlup "more likely than not" standard; the latter challenge
is subject to the Sawyer "clear and convincing" standard.
In theory, then, it would be possible to vacate Thompson's
stand-alone conviction of rape but to let stand his conviction
of murder and sentence of death. This anomaly perhaps reflects some tension between Sawyer and the later decided
Schlup. The anomaly need not detain us, however, for
Thompson's claims fail under either standard.

At trial, the prosecution presented ample evidence to show
Thompson committed the rape. A vaginal swab of Fleischli's body revealed semen consistent with Thompson's blood
type. App. 109. In addition, there was extensive evidence

of restraint consistent with rape. Dr. Robert Richards, apathologist who performed the autopsy on Fleischli and testified for the prosecution at trial, stated that, at or near thetime of death, Fleischli suffered a crushing injury to her
right wrist with surrounding bruising. Id., at 9. Deputy
Darryl Coder, who in his 23 years as a law enforcement offi-cer had seen "hundreds" of handcuff injuries, testified the

injury to Fleischli's right wrist was consistent with injuriescaused by handcuffs, a pair of which were in Thompson's possession when he was arrested in Mexico. Id., at 13, n. 9.Dr. Richards further testified that Fleischli had other bruises
on her ankles, palms, left elbow, and left wrist, all of which
were caused at or near the time of death. Id., at 9, 10 Record 1619. Fleischli's shirt and bra had been cut down the
middle and pulled down to her elbows, exposing her breasts
and restraining her arms. App. 7, 109. Fleischli's mouth
had been gagged with duct tape. 9 Record 1505, 11 id., at
1772.

There was further evidence of rape. As Judge Kleinfeld
noted in dissent, "Fleischli was murdered by Thompson, a
fate more frequent among rape victims than friendly sex
partners." 120 F. 3d, at 1073. Two jailhouse informants,
though discredited to a substantial extent at trial, testified
that Thompson had confessed the rape (as well as the murder) to them.

As the District Court observed, moreover, Thompson's
own testimony "was devastating to his defense." App. 51.
Contrary to the emphatic advice of trial counsel, Thompson
chose to testify. The result was by all accounts a disaster
for his claim that he did not rape or murder Fleischli. The
prosecution got Thompson to admit he lied to police after his
arrest, when he denied having sex with Fleischli. He also
admitted having lied to police about Fleischli's whereabouts
the night of the murder, telling them she had left his apartment with Kashani. When asked about this lie, Thompson
replied, "Mr. Kashani seemed as likely a candidate [as] any523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
body at that time." 18 Record 2378. He then presented hismost recent, and perhaps most fantastic, account of the

events of the night of the murder. Thompson testified that,after having consensual sex with Fleischli, he fell asleep and
remained asleep while, not more than six feet away, someone
else stabbed Fleischli five times in the head, wrapped herhead and body with duct tape, two towels, a sheet, her

jacket, a sleeping bag, and a rope, moved her body from theapartment, and scrubbed the carpet to remove her blood.
The District Court found Thompson's testimony "was riddledwith inconsistencies and outright falsehoods." App. 51.
The District Court further stated: "Thompson's testimony no
doubt affected the jury's verdict." Id., at 51. The point is
beyond dispute; since Thompson lied about almost every
other material aspect of the case, the jury had good reason
to believe he lied about whether the sex was consensual.

Thompson presents little evidence to undermine the evidence presented at trial. The en banc court based its decision only on the claims and evidence presented in Thompson's first petition for federal habeas relief. Had it
considered the additional evidence or claims presented in
Thompson's motion to recall the mandate, of course, its decision would have been subject to $ 2244(b). See supra, at
554. Hence the record of Thompson's first federal habeas
petition will govern whether he has demonstrated actual
innocence of rape.

The evidence in Thompson's petition falls into two categories. First, Thompson presented additional evidence to impeach the credibility of Fink and Del Frate, the jailhouse
informants who testified Thompson confessed the rape and
murder to them. In the case of Fink, Thompson presented
additional evidence of Fink's history as an informant and of
law enforcement favors for Fink. Thompson also presented
statements by law enforcement officials to the effect that
Fink was an unreliable witness. In the case of Del Frate,
Thompson presented evidence that law enforcement officials

Opinion of the Court
and certain members of Del Frate's family regarded DelFrate as dishonest, that Del Frate shared a jail cell with

David Leitch prior to meeting Thompson, that Del Frate'sstatements to police tracked newspaper accounts of the
crime, and that Del Frate neglected to mention at trial his
prior convictions for grand theft and distribution of halluci-nogens without a license.

This impeachment evidence provides no basis for finding amiscarriage of justice. As in

Sawyer, the evidence is a step
removed from evidence pertaining to the crime itself. 505U. S., at 348. It tends only to impeach the credibility of

Fink and Del Frate. To find that these matters in all probability would have altered the outcome of Thompson's trial,
we should have to assume, first, that there was little evidence of rape apart from the informant's testimony; and
second, that the jury accepted the informants' testimony
without reservation. The former assumption is belied by
the evidence recited above. The latter one is belied by the
substantial impeachment evidence Thompson's attorney did
introduce.

With regard to Fink, Thompson's trial counsel presented
the following evidence: Fink had four prior felony convictions and had spent a total of 14 years in prison at the time
of trial. He used heroin on a frequent basis during the 15
years preceding trial, including the period in which he gave
his statement to police. He lied about his identity as a matter of routine. He acted as an informant on numerous other
occasions, including one occasion where he informed on another inmate to gain protective custody in prison. He requested and received a transfer to another penal facility in
exchange for his statement against Thompson. And he admitted being unable to explain why criminals confessed to
him with such frequency.

With regard to Del Frate, Thompson's trial counsel presented the following evidence: Del Frate had served time for
second-degree murder and credit card forgery. At the time

523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
564 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Opinion of the Court
of trial, Del Frate faced felony charges in Ohio and California. Del Frate admitted claiming another murderer confessed to him during the period in which Thompson confessed to him. He also admitted changing his account of
Thompson's confession to him numerous times. Given the
trial evidence impeaching each informant, we would disrespect the jury in Thompson's case if we were to find that,
had it been presented with still more impeachment evidence,
it would have reached a different verdict.

In support of his first federal habeas petition, Thompson
also presented the opinions of Dr. Irving Root, a pathologist
who testified on Thompson's behalf during the evidentiary
hearing in Federal District Court. Dr. Root disputed certain of the opinions offered by Dr. Richards and Deputy
Coder at trial. First, Dr. Root disagreed with Deputy Coder's conclusion that the crushing injury to Fleischli's left
wrist was caused by handcuffs. Dr. Root stated the injury
was unlike handcuff injuries he had seen on other corpses.
1 Tr. 52-54, 62-63 (Aug. 5, 1997). He did not, however, offer
any alternative explanation as to how the injury might have
been caused. Second, Dr. Root disputed Dr. Richards' conclusions regarding the bruises on Fleischli's body. Dr. Root
opined the bruises to Fleischli's ankles and left wrist were
caused at least 11 hours before death. Id., at 47-50. He
further stated the bruises to Fleischli's palms were the result of lividity, i. e., the settling of blood by gravity after
death. Id., at 48. Third, Dr. Root noted there had been
"infrequent" sperm on the vaginal swab of Fleischli's body.
Id., at 63. Dr. Root suggested this finding could be the result of low sperm count for the male, or douching or drainage
after intercourse. Ibid. He further suggested the other
evidence in the case ruled out the possibility of drainage.
Id., at 63-64. He did not, however, opine as to whether low
sperm count or douching was the more probable of the remaining possibilities. Finally, Dr. Root summarized his tes523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

565Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
timony by agreeing "there was remarkably little in the way
of trauma to the decedent's body." Id., at 52.

Dr. Root's testimony provides no occasion for disturbing
the findings of the jury in Thompson's case. His testimony
that the crushing injury to Fleischli's wrist was not caused
by handcuffs is far from compelling, given Deputy Coder's
extensive experience with handcuff injuries (albeit with living persons) and Dr. Root's failure to offer any alternative
explanation as to how the crushing injury might have occurred. His testimony that the other bruises to Fleischli's
body were caused well before death is more plausible. Unlike Dr. Richards, however, Dr. Root based his conclusions
not on his own examination of the body, but on his review of
the record of Dr. Richards' examination. See id., at 70. It
is improbable, moreover, that Fleischli had been walking
about with bruises all over her body, without any witness
having noticed her condition in the days and hours before
Thompson murdered her. As for the infrequent sperm on
the vaginal swab, Dr. Root himself suggested the cause
might have been low sperm count for the male, a possibility
consistent with rape. Id., at 63. Finally, Dr. Root's assessment of the overall trauma to the body was to a large extent
consistent with Dr. Richards' testimony at trial. For instance, Dr. Richards testified there was no evidence of vaginal tearing or bruising in Fleischli's case, though he indicated
(and Dr. Root did not dispute) there was no such evidence in
the majority of rape cases. 10 Record 1629. As Dr. Root
himself acknowledged, his conclusion that there was "remarkably little" trauma to Fleischli's body was lifted verbatim from Dr. Richards' own autopsy report in Fleischli's case.
1 Tr. 52 (Aug. 5, 1997).

To say that no reasonable juror would have convicted
Thompson of rape if presented with Dr. Root's testimony,
then, we would have to ignore the totality of evidence of
Thompson's guilt. This we cannot do.

566 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Souter, J., dissenting
In conclusion, Thompson's evidence does not meet the"more likely than not" showing necessary to vacate his

stand-alone conviction of rape, much less the "clear and con-vincing" showing necessary to vacate his sentence of death.
The judgment of the State of California will not result ina miscarriage of justice. The Court of Appeals abused its
discretion in holding the contrary.

IV
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and thecase is remanded with instructions to reinstate the June 11,

1997, mandate denying habeas relief to Thompson.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Like the majority, I accept the representation of the Courtof Appeals that it was acting

sua sponte in its decision torecall its previous mandate on August 3, 1997, a position supported by the record. On July 28, 1997, the panel deniedrespondent's motion to recall the mandate, which was an
effort to seek whatever advantage he might obtain fromnewly discovered evidence, and during the en banc rehearing ultimately granted the court considered nothing beyondthe record presented in respondent's first

habeas corpusproceeding.

Even on my assumption that the Court of Appeals actedon its own and in the interest of the integrity of its appellate
process, however, the timing of its actions is a matter forregret. The court has indicated that it chose to initiate consideration of a recall sua sponte shortly after this Court de-nied certiorari to review the appeals court's first judgment
on June 2, 1997, 109 F. 3d 1358 (CA9), cert. denied, 520 U. S.1259 (1997), but chose to take no immediate action in the
interest of comity as between the state and federal systems.

Souter, J., dissenting
The Court of Appeals accordingly refrained from acting onthe merits until after the state courts had adjudicated a

fourth state postconviction claim, the Governor of Californiahad undertaken a comprehensive review of the case and had
denied clemency, and the State had scheduled respondent's
execution. As a consequence, the concern for comity thatmotivated the court came to look like hope that a state decisionmaker would somehow obviate the federal court's needto advertise its own mistakes and take corrective action.

But as unfortunate as the Court of Appeals's timing mayhave been, that is not the ground on which the majority reverses the judgment entered on the en banc rehearing. In
rejecting the conclusion of the en banc court, the Court applies a new and erroneous standard to review the recall of
the mandate, and I respectfully dissent from its mistaken
conclusion.

Like the majority, I begin with the longstanding view that
a court's authority to recall a mandate in order to correct
error is inherent in the judicial power, ante, at 549-550
(citing Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 463 U. S. 1323,
1324 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers); Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 249-250 (1944)),
and subject to review only for abuse of discretion, ante, at
549. Although we have had no occasion to discuss the abuse
standard as applied to actions of a court of appeals as distinct
from those of a trial court, there is no reason to suppose the
criterion should be affected merely because it is an appellate
court that has exercised the discretionary power to act in
the first instance. It is true, of course, that the variety of
subjects left to discretionary decision requires caution in
synthesizing abuse of discretion cases. See Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J. 747, 762-764 (1982);
Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed
From Above, 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 650-653 (1971). At
the least, however, one can say that a high degree of deference to the court exercising discretionary authority is the

hallmark of such review. General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522
U. S. 136, 143-147 (1997); National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam). Thus, in such a case as this one, deference may be
accorded to any reasonable selection of factors as relevant to
the exercise of a court's discretion (since the determination
to recall is one for which criteria of decision have not become
standardized), see United States v. Criden, 648 F. 2d 814,
818 (CA3 1981), and to the weighing of these factors in light
of the particular facts, see Lawson Prods., Inc. v. Avnet, Inc.,
782 F. 2d 1429, 1437 (CA7 1986); 1 S. Childress & M. Davis,
Federal Standards of Review $ 4.21, p. 4-163 (2d ed. 1992)
("It could be said, then, that in run-of-the-mill discretionary calls, review applies differently by the context, facts, and
factors, but that many times the actual level of deference
boils down to one similar to that used for the clearly erroneous rule. As a general proposition, then, abuse of discretion
deference is closer to a clear error test than to the jury review test of irrationality"); cf. Citizens to Preserve Overton
Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 416 (1971) (explaining the
standard of review under 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A), which requires agencies to make choices that are not "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law"); ibid. ("To make th[e] finding [required
under $ 706(2)(A)] the court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors
and whether there has been a clear error of judgment").
The obligation of deference is only underscored here by the
fact that the reason for the recall was to consider an en banc
rehearing, a matter of administration for the Courts of Appeals on which this Court has been careful to avoid intrusion,
see Western Pacific Railroad Case, 345 U. S. 247, 259, and
n. 19 (1953).

The factors underlying the action of the Court of Appeals
in this case were wholly appropriate, the court's stated justi523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fication having been to exercise extreme care to counter themalfunction of its own procedural mechanisms where the result otherwise might well be a constitutionally erroneous im-position of the death penalty. Indeed, the only serious question raised about the validity of such considerations goes tothe legitimacy of employing en banc rehearings to correct a
panel's error in the application of settled law. See 120 F. 3d1045, 1069-1070 (CA9 1997) (Kozinski, J., dissenting). But
however true it is that the en banc rehearing process cannoteffectively function to review every three-judge panel that
arguably goes astray in a particular case, surely it is none-theless reasonable to resort to en banc correction that may
be necessary to avoid a constitutional error standing be-tween a life sentence and an execution. It is, after all, axiomatic that this Court cannot devote itself to error correction,and yet in death cases the exercise of our discretionary review for just this purpose may be warranted. See Kylesv. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 422 (1995); id., at 455 (

Stevens,
J., concurring).To be sure, there lurks in the background the faint specters of overuse and misuse of the recall power. All wouldagree that the power to recall a mandate must be reserved
for "exceptional circumstances," 120 F. 3d, at 1048; 16 C.Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3938, pp. 716-717, n. 14 (1996) (citing cases from thevarious Courts of Appeals recognizing that the power must
be used sparingly), in the interests of stable adjudication andjudicial administrative efficiency, on which growing caseloads
place a growing premium. All would agree, too, that thesua sponte recall of mandates could not be condoned as a
mechanism to frustrate the limitations on second and succes-sive habeas petitions, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b).

1 If

1 The Ninth Circuit itself seems to recognize that a motion to recall the
mandate filed by a petitioner subsequent to a previous request for federal
habeas relief is analogous to a second or successive petition that is sub523US2 Unit: $U57 [04-29-00 18:35:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
there were reason to suppose that the sua sponte recallwould be overused or abused in either respect, we might

well see its use as unreasonable in a given case simply todeter resort to it in too many cases. But as matters stand,
we have no reason for such fears and no reason to circum-scribe the Court of Appeals's response to its otherwise legitimate concerns. If history should show us up as too optimis-tic, we will have every occasion to revisit the issue.

Going from the legitimacy of the Court of Appeals's con-cerns to the reasonableness of invoking them on the facts
here, I need mention only two points. The first arises on thequestion whether administrative mistakes in the chambers of
only two judges could be seen as causing what the court sawas the threatened miscarriage of justice in permitting the
execution of someone who was ineligible for death; two fail-ures to vote for en banc review are not the cause of a miscarriage when the vote against such review is otherwise unani-mous. Such at least is the math. But anyone who has ever
sat on a bench with other judges knows that judges are sup-posed to influence each other, and they do. One may see
something the others did not see, and then they all take an-other look. So it was reasonable here for the en banc court
to believe that when only two judges mistakenly failed tovote for en banc rehearing, their misunderstandings could
well have affected the result.The only remaining bar to the application of the appeals
court's policies to the facts of this case is said to be thatthe en banc court was mistaken in thinking the panel had
committed error when it reversed the trial court's conclusionthat ineffective assistance of counsel in the rape case had
been prejudicial within the meaning of Strickland v. Wash-ington, 466 U. S. 668, 693-694 (1984). But whether the en
banc majority was correct on this question of law and fact is
ject to the constraints of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See, e. g., Nevius v. Sumner, 105 F. 3d 453, 461
(CA9 1996).

571Cite as: 523 U. S. 538 (1998)
Souter, J., dissenting
not the issue here. The issue on abuse-of-discretion review
is simply whether those voting to recall the mandate to allow
en banc review could reasonably have thought the earlier
panel had been mistaken, and the conclusions of the District
Court suffice to answer yes to that question. See Thompson v. Calderon, Civ. No. 89-3630-RG (CD Cal., Mar. 29,
1995), reprinted at App. 14-16. The ultimate merit of either
court's answer to the underlying question is not the touchstone of abuse-of-discretion review, see National Hockey
League, 427 U. S., at 642 (under abuse-of-discretion review,
the relevant question is not whether the reviewing court
would have reached the same result), and here we review
only for abuse, not the merits of the underlying case (the
question whether prejudice should be found on the record of
this case not warranting review).2

The majority, of course, adhere to the terminology of abuse
of discretion in reversing the Ninth Circuit. But it is abuse
of discretion "informed by" the 1996 amendments to the
habeas corpus statute enacted by certain provisions of
AEDPA, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, ante, at 558; see
Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996), and as so informed the
abuse-of-discretion standard is beyond recognition. That
aside, the Court's reformulation is as unwarranted on the
Court's own terms as it is by the terms of AEDPA.

2 Abuse-of-discretion review of the likelihood of a miscarriage of justice
is analogous to the abuse-of-discretion review of Rule 11 sanctions for
frivolous filings. In that context, we held that reviewing courts should
defer to district courts' conclusions about substantial legal justification.
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 401-405 (1990). In the
present circumstances, where the subject of our review for an abuse of
discretion is an appellate court's conclusion that a threatened miscarriage
of justice is sufficient to justify recalling the mandate, I believe that we
similarly must give some deference to the Court of Appeals's preliminary
analysis that there may have been a misapplication of a legal standard,
even though we would not defer to it if we were addressing the ultimate
question on the merits, whether a trial court had committed legal error.

572 CALDERON v. THOMPSON

Souter, J., dissenting
Why AEDPA is thought to counsel review of recalls ofmandates under anything but the traditional abuse-ofdiscretion standard is unexplained by anything in the major-ity opinion. The majority, like me, accepts the Court of Appeals's position that it was not covertly allowing respondent
to litigate a second habeas petition; the majority assumesthat the Ninth Circuit was acting on its own motion to recall

the mandate, in order to allow reconsideration of the firsthabeas petition.

Ante, at 554. On these assumptions,
AEDPA has no application to the issue before us. Nothingin AEDPA speaks to the courts of appeals' inherent power

to recall a mandate, as such, and so long as the power over
mandates is not abused to enable prisoners to litigate otherwise forbidden "second or successive" habeas petitions, see
28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b), AEDPA is not violated.

Nor are the policies embodied in AEDPA served by today's novelty. Section 2244(b) provides that if a claim raised
in a second or successive petition was presented in a prior
application, it shall be dismissed. I suppose that if the claim
under en banc review were to bear analogy to anything covered by AEDPA, it would be to the previously raised claim
covered by subsection (b)(1), since the claim reviewed en
banc was the actual claim previously reviewed by the panel.
And yet the majority does not draw any such analogy and
does not dismiss on this basis. Subsection (b)(2) provides
that when a second or successive petition raises a claim
not previously presented, it too shall be dismissed unless
based on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law,

$ 2244(b)(2)(A), or based on previously undiscoverable evidence that would show to a clear and convincing degree that
no reasonable factfinder would have convicted, considering
all the evidence, had it not been for constitutional error,

$ 2244(b)(2)(B). Here, again, the majority fails to draw any
analogy, for if reconsideration of a claim after sua sponte
recall were thought to resemble a claim mentioned in subsection (b)(2), the majority would presumably require more than

Souter, J., dissenting
it does today. In fact, the majority goes no further than tocall for a showing of actual innocence sufficient for relief

under our earlier cases, ante, at 557; yet as the Court real-izes, our standard dealing with innocence of an underlying
offense requires no clear and convincing proof, ante, at 560,see

Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327 (1995), and the Courtwould be satisfied with a demonstration of innocence by evidence "not presented at trial," ante, at 559, even if it hadbeen discovered, let alone discoverable but unknown, that
far back.Whatever policy the Court is pursuing, it is not the policy
of AEDPA. Nor is any other justification apparent. In thisparticular case, when all else is said, we simply face a recall
occasioned by some administrative inadvertence awkwardlycorrected; while that appellate process may have left some
unfortunate impressions, neither its want of finesse norAEDPA warrant the majority's decision to jettison the flexible abuse-of-discretion standard for the sake of solving asystemic problem that does not exist.

CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 96-827. Argued December 1, 1997--Decided May 4, 1998
Petitioner is a litigious and outspoken prisoner in the District of Columbia's correctional system. Because of overcrowding at the District's
prison, he was transferred, first to Washington State, then to facilities
in several other locations, and ultimately to Florida. His belongings
were transferred separately. When the District's Department of Corrections received his belongings from Washington State, respondent, a
District correctional officer, had petitioner's brother-in-law pick them
up, rather than shipping them directly to petitioner's next destination.
Petitioner did not recover the belongings until several months after he
reached Florida. He filed suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging, inter
alia, that respondent's diversion of his property was motivated by an
intent to retaliate against him for exercising his First Amendment
rights. The District Court dismissed the complaint. In remanding,
the en banc Court of Appeals concluded, among other things, that in an
unconstitutional-motive case, a plaintiff must establish motive by clear
and convincing evidence, and that the reasoning in Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, requires special procedures to protect defendants from
the costs of litigation.

Held: The Court of Appeals erred in fashioning a heightened burden

of proof for unconstitutional-motive cases against public officials.
Pp. 584-601.

(a) That court adopted a clear and convincing evidence requirement
to deal with a potentially serious problem: because an official's state
of mind is easy to allege and hard to disprove, insubstantial claims turning on improper intent may be less amenable to summary disposition
than other types of claims against government officials. The standard
was intended to protect public servants from the burdens of trial and
discovery that may impair the performance of their official duties.
Pp. 584-586.

(b) Harlow's holding does not support the imposition of a heightened
proof standard for a plaintiff's affirmative case. In Harlow, the Court
found that the President's senior aides and advisers were protected by
a qualified immunity standard that would permit the defeat of insubstantial claims without resort to trial. The Court announced a single
objective standard for judging that defense, shielding officials from "lia523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

bility for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known," 457 U. S., at 818, and eliminated the subjective
standard, put forth in Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, that "bare
allegations of malice" could rebut the defense, 457 U. S., at 817-818.
However, evidence concerning the defendant's subjective intent, although irrelevant to the qualified immunity defense, may be an essential
component of the plaintiff's affirmative case. Since Harlow's holding
related only to the scope of the affirmative defense, it provides no support for making any change in the nature of the plaintiff's burden of
proving a constitutional violation. Pp. 586-589.

(c) One reason implicit in Harlow's holding--fairness to the public
official--provides no justification for special burdens on plaintiffs who
allege unlawful motive. Two other reasons underlying Harlow's holding--that the strong public interest in protecting officials from the costs
of damages actions is best served by a defense permitting insubstantial
lawsuits to be quickly terminated, and that allegations of subjective motivation might have been used to shield baseless suits from summary
judgment--would provide support for the type of procedural rule
adopted by the Court of Appeals here. However, countervailing concerns indicate that the balance struck in the context of defining an affirmative defense is not appropriate when evaluating the elements of the
plaintiff's cause of action. Initially, there is an important distinction
between the bare allegations of malice that would have provided the
basis for rebutting a qualified immunity defense in Wood and the more
specific allegations of intent that are essential elements of certain constitutional claims. In the latter instance, for example, the primary emphasis is on an intent to disadvantage all members of a class that includes the plaintiff or to deter public comment on a specific issue of
public importance, not on any possible animus directed at the plaintiff.
Moreover, existing law already prevents this more narrow element of
unconstitutional motive from automatically carrying a plaintiff to trial.
Summary judgment may be available if there is doubt as to the illegality
of the defendant's particular conduct; and, at least with certain claims,
there must be evidence of causation as well as proof of an improper
motive. Unlike the subjective component of the immunity defense
eliminated by Harlow, the improper intent element of various causes of
action should not ordinarily preclude summary disposition of insubstantial claims. Pp. 590-594.

(d) Without precedential grounding, changing the burden of proof for
an entire category of claims would stray far from the traditional limits
on judicial authority. Neither the text of $ 1983 or any other federal
statute nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide any support

Syllabus
for imposing a clear and convincing burden of proof. The Court of Appeals' unprecedented change lacks any common-law pedigree and alters
the cause of action in a way that undermines $ 1983's very purpose--to
provide a remedy for the violation of federal rights. This Court has
consistently declined similar invitations to revise established rules that
are separate from the qualified immunity defense. See, e. g., Gomez v.
Toledo, 446 U. S. 635, 639-640. To the extent that the Court of Appeals
was concerned with preventing discovery, such questions are most frequently and effectively resolved by the rulemaking or legislative process. Moreover, the court's indirect effort to regulate discovery employs
a blunt instrument with a high cost that also imposes a heightened
standard of proof at trial upon plaintiffs with bona fide constitutional
claims. Congress has already fashioned special rules to discourage inmates' insubstantial suits in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which
draws no distinction between constitutional claims that require proof of
an improper motive and those that do not. If there is a compelling
need to frame new rules based on such a distinction, presumably Congress would have done so or will respond to it in future legislation.

handling claims that involve examination of an official's state of mind.

Opinion of the Court
plaintiff must adduce clear and convincing evidence of improper motive in order to defeat a motion for summary
judgment.

I

Petitioner is serving a life sentence in the District of Columbia's correctional system. During his confinement he
has filed several lawsuits and has assisted other prisoners
with their cases. He has also provided interviews to reporters who have written news stories about prison conditions.
He is a litigious and outspoken prisoner.

The events that gave rise to this case occurred in 1988 and
1989. Because of overcrowding in the District of Columbia
prison in Lorton, Virginia, petitioner and other inmates were
transferred to the county jail in Spokane, Washington.
Thereafter, he was moved, first to a Washington State
prison, later to a facility in Cameron, Missouri, next back to
Lorton, then to Petersburg, Virginia, and ultimately to the
federal prison in Marianna, Florida. Three boxes containing
his personal belongings, including legal materials, were
transferred separately. When the District of Columbia Department of Corrections received the boxes from the Washington State facility, respondent, a District correctional officer, asked petitioner's brother-in-law to pick them up rather
than sending them directly to petitioner's next destination.
The boxes were ultimately shipped to Marianna by petitioner's mother, at petitioner's expense, but he was initially denied permission to receive them because they had been sent
outside official prison channels. He finally recovered the
property several months after his arrival in Florida.

Petitioner contends that respondent deliberately misdirected the boxes to punish him for exercising his First
Amendment rights and to deter similar conduct in the future.
Beyond generalized allegations of respondent's hostility, he
alleges specific incidents in which his protected speech had

Opinion of the Court
provoked her.1 His claimed injury caused by the delay inreceiving his boxes includes the costs of having the boxes

shipped and purchasing new clothes and other items in theinterim, as well as mental and emotional distress. Respondent denies any retaliatory motive and asserts that she en-trusted the property to petitioner's brother-in-law, who was
also a District of Columbia corrections employee, in order toensure its prompt and safe delivery.

Although the factual dispute is relatively simple, it engen-dered litigation that has been both protracted and complex.
We shall briefly describe the proceedings that led to the enbanc Court of Appeals decision that we are reviewing, and
then summarize that decision.
The Early Proceedings

Petitioner filed suit against respondent and the Districtof Columbia seeking damages under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42

U. S. C. $ 1983.2 The principal theory advanced in his origi1 In 1986, petitioner had invited a Washington Post reporter to visit the
Lorton prison and obtained a visitor application for the reporter, which
resulted in a front-page article on the prison's overcrowding "crisis." Respondent had approved the visitor application, which did not disclose the
visitor's affiliation with the newspaper; she allegedly accused petitioner of
tricking her and threatened to make life "as hard for him as possible."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a. Petitioner also alleges that when he had
complained in 1988 about invasions of privacy, respondent told him,
"You're a prisoner, you don't have any rights." Id., at 179a. Later in
1988, after another front-page Washington Post article quoted petitioner
as saying that litigious prisoners had been "handpicked" for transfer to
Spokane "so our lawsuits will be dismissed on procedural grounds," respondent allegedly referred to him as a "legal troublemaker." Id., at
180a-181a.

2 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides:

"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,
custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,
subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or
other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,

Opinion of the Court
nal complaint was that respondent had diverted the boxescontaining his legal materials in order to interfere with his

constitutional right of access to the courts.Prior to discovery, respondent, relying in part on a qualified immunity defense, moved for dismissal of the complaintor summary judgment. The motion was denied and respondent appealed, arguing, first, that the complaint did notallege a violation of any constitutional right that was clearly
established at the time of her acts; and, second, that the com-plaint "failed to satisfy the `heightened pleading standard'
that this circuit applies to damage actions against govern-ment officials." 951 F. 2d 1314, 1316 (CADC 1991).

The Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that his con-stitutional right of access to the courts was well established
in 1989, and that his allegations of wrongful intent were suf-ficiently detailed and specific to withstand a motion to dismiss even under the Circuit's "heightened pleading stand-ard." Id., at 1318, 1321. The court concluded, however,
that the allegations of actual injury to his ability to litigatewere insufficient under that standard; accordingly, the complaint should have been dismissed. Id., at 1321-1322. Because the contours of the pleading standard had been clari-fied in a decision announced while the case was on appeal,

see Hunter v. District of Columbia, 943 F. 2d 69 (CADC1991), the court concluded that petitioner should be allowed
to replead.On remand, petitioner filed an amended complaint adding
more detail to support his access claim and also adding two
new claims: a due process claim and the claim that respond-ent's alleged diversion of his property was motivated by an

other proper proceeding for redress . . . ."

Only the claim against respondent is before us. The Court of Appeals
did not consider whether petitioner's amended complaint stated a cause of
action against the District.

Opinion of the Court
intent to retaliate against him for exercising his FirstAmendment rights. The District Court dismissed the

amended complaint because the court access claim and thedue process claim were legally insufficient, and because the
First Amendment retaliation claim did not allege "direct evi-dence of unconstitutional motive." 844 F. Supp. 795, 802
(DC 1994). The dismissal was, in effect, mandated by priordecisions of the Court of Appeals holding that allegations of
circumstantial evidence of such a motivation were insuffi-cient to withstand a motion to dismiss. See

Martin v. D. C.Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435 (1987);

Siegert v. Gilley, 895 F. 2d 797, 800-802 (1990), aff 'd on othergrounds, 500 U. S. 226 (1991).

The En Banc Proceeding

A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal ofthe first two claims but suggested that the entire court

should review the dismissal of the First Amendment retalia-tion claim. Accordingly, the en banc court ordered the parties to file briefs addressing five specific questions, two ofwhich concerned the power of the Circuit to supplement the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with special pleading re-quirements for plaintiffs bringing civil rights claims against
government officials,3 and two of which concerned possiblespecial grounds for granting defense motions for summary
judgment in cases "where the unlawfulness depends on the

3 The first two questions asked:
"1. In cases where plaintiffs bring civil rights claims against Government officials who assert qualified immunity, may this circuit supplement
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by requiring plaintiffs to satisfy a
heightened pleading requirement in their complaint or face dismissal prior
to discovery? If so, should it be done?

"2. May this circuit require that plaintiffs who allege that Government
officials acted with unconstitutional intent plead direct, as opposed to circumstantial evidence of that intent? If so, should it be done?" App. to
Pet. for Cert. 108a.

Opinion of the Court
actor's unconstitutional motive." 4 The fifth was a catchallquestion that asked the parties whether there are "any alternative devices which protect defendants with qualified im-munity, in cases of constitutional tort depending on the
defendant's motive or intent, from the costs of litigation?"App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.

The en banc court responded to these questions in fiveseparate opinions. A majority of the judges appear to have
agreed on these four propositions: (1) the case should be re-manded to the District Court for further proceedings; (2) the
plaintiff does not have to satisfy any heightened pleadingrequirement, and may rely on circumstantial as well as direct
evidence; 5 (3) in order to prevail in an unconstitutional-motive case, the plaintiff must establish that motive by
clear and convincing evidence; and (4) special proceduresto protect defendants from the costs of litigation in

4 The questions regarding summary judgment asked:
"3. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends on
the actor's unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, should the court grant a defense motion for summary judgment,
made before plaintiff has conducted discovery, if the plaintiff has failed to
adduce evidence from which the fact finder could reasonably infer the
illicit motive? See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815-18 (1982);
Elliott v. Thomas, 937 F. 2d 338, 345-46 (7th Cir. 1991)?

"4. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends on
the actor's unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, are there any circumstances, apart from national security issues
of the sort at stake in Halperin v. Kissinger, 807 F. 2d 180, 184-85 (D. C.
Cir. 1986), where the court should grant a defense motion for summary
judgment on a showing by the defendant such that a reasonable jury
would necessarily conclude that the defendant's stated motivation `would
have been reasonable'? Id. at 188; see also id. at 189 (summary judgment
warranted where no reasonable jury could find that `it was objectively
unreasonable for the defendants' to be acting for stated, innocent motives)." Id., at 108a-109a.

5 On this point, the court disavowed its prior direct-evidence rule of

Martin v. D. C. Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435
(CADC 1987), and Siegert v. Gilley, 895 F. 2d 797, 800-802 (CADC 1990),

583Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
unconstitutional-motive cases are required by the reasoningin this Court's opinion in

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.
800 (1982).The primary opinion, written by Judge Williams, announced two principal conclusions: "First, we think Harlow
allows an official to get summary judgment resolution of thequalified immunity issue, including the question of the official's state of mind, before the plaintiff has engaged in discov-ery on that issue. Second, we believe that unless the plaintiff offers clear and convincing evidence on the state-of-mindissue at summary judgment and trial, judgment or directed
verdict (as appropriate) should be granted for the individual
defendant." 93 F. 3d 813, 815 (CADC 1996).

Judge Silberman criticized Judge Williams' approach as
confusing, id., at 833, and suggested that Harlow's reasoning
pointed to a "more straightforward solution," 93 F. 3d, at
834. In his opinion, whenever a defendant asserts a legitimate motive for his or her action, only an objective inquiry
into pretextuality should be allowed. "If the facts establish
that the purported motivation would have been reasonable,
the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity." Ibid.

Judge Ginsburg agreed with the decision to impose a clear
and convincing standard of proof on the unconstitutional motive issue, but he could not accept Judge Williams' new requirement that the District Court must "grant summary
judgment prior to discovery unless the plaintiff already has
in hand" sufficient evidence to satisfy that standard. Id., at
839. He described that innovation as "a rather bold intrusion into the district court's management of the fact-finding
process" that would result in the defeat of meritorious claims
and "invite an increase in the number of constitutional torts
that are committed." Ibid. He would allow limited discovery on a proper showing before ruling on a summary judgment motion, but noted that in cases involving qualified immunity it would be an abuse of discretion for the trial judge
to fail to consider, not only the interests of the parties, "but

Opinion of the Court
also the social costs associated with discovery had against agovernment official." Id., at 840. With reference to the

case at hand, he expressed the view that if petitioner couldnot show that discovery might reveal more than already appeared in the record, summary judgment would be appro-priate without any discovery.

Id., at 841-844.Judge Henderson "fully" endorsed the plurality's new clear

and convincing evidence standard, but thought that it was amistake for her colleagues to hear this case en banc because
the record already made it abundantly clear that petitioner'sclaim had no merit. Id., at 844-845.

Chief Judge Edwards, joined by four other judges, criti-cized the majority for " `crossing the line between adjudication and legislation.' " Id., at 847 (quoting Frankfurter,Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum.
L. Rev. 527, 535 (1947)). He expressed the view that thenew evidentiary standards were unauthorized by statute or
precedent and "would make it all but certain that an entirecategory of constitutional tort claims against government officials--whether or not meritorious--would never be able tosurvive a defendant's assertion of qualified immunity." 93
F. 3d, at 847.The different views expressed in those five opinions attest
to the importance of both the underlying issue and a correctunderstanding of the relationship between our holding in
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), and the plaintiff 'sburden when his or her entitlement to relief depends on
proof of an improper motive. Despite the relative unimpor-tance of the facts of this particular case, we therefore decided to grant certiorari. 520 U. S. 1273 (1997).

II
The Court of Appeals' requirement of clear and convincingevidence of improper motive is that court's latest effort to

address a potentially serious problem: Because an official's

523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

585Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
state of mind is "easy to allege and hard to disprove," insub-stantial claims that turn on improper intent may be less amenable to summary disposition than other types of claimsagainst government officials. 93 F. 3d, at 816, 821. This
category of claims therefore implicates obvious concerns
with the social costs of subjecting public officials to discoveryand trial, as well as liability for damages. The other Courts

of Appeals have also grappled with this problem, but nonehas adopted a heightened burden of proof. See

id., at 851-
852, n. 7 (Edwards, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citingcases).

The new rule established in this case is not limited to suitsby prisoners against local officials, but applies to all classes of
plaintiffs bringing damages actions against any government
official, whether federal, state, or local. See Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 500-504 (1978). The heightened burden
of proof applies, moreover, to the wide array of different fed-eral law claims for which an official's motive is a necessary

element, such as claims of race and gender discrimination inviolation of the Equal Protection Clause,

6 cruel and unusual

punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,7 and ter-mination of employment based on political affiliation in violation of the First Amendment,8 as well as retaliation for theexercise of free speech or other constitutional rights.

9 A

bare majority of the Court of Appeals regarded this sweep-ing rule as a necessary corollary to our opinion in

Harlow.
There is, of course, an important difference between the
holding in a case and the reasoning that supports that holding. We shall, therefore, begin by explaining why our hold6 Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-248 (1976) (race); Personnel

586 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Opinion of the Court
ing in Harlow does not resolve the issue presented in thiscase--indeed, it does not even address any question concerning the plaintiff 's affirmative case. We shall then considerwhether the reasoning in that opinion nevertheless supports
the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.
Harlow's Specific Holding

In 1968, A. Ernest Fitzgerald testified before a congres-sional subcommittee about technical difficulties and excessive costs incurred in the development of a new transportplane. His testimony was widely reported and evidently
embarrassed his superiors in the Department of Defense.In 1970, his job as a management analyst with the Department of the Air Force was eliminated in a "departmentalreorganization and reduction in force."

Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 733 (1982). After the conclusion of extended proceedings before the Civil Service Commission in
1973, Fitzgerald filed suit against the President of the United
States and some of his aides alleging that they had eliminated his job in retaliation for his testimony. He sought
damages on both statutory grounds and "in a direct action
under the Constitution." Id., at 748. When his charges
were reviewed in this Court, we considered the defendants'
claims to immunity in two separate opinions. In Nixon v.
Fitzgerald, we held that a former President is entitled to
absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on conduct within the scope of his official duties. Id., at 749. In
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), we held that the
senior aides and advisers of the President were not entitled
to absolute immunity, id., at 808-813, but instead were protected by a "qualified immunity standard that would permit
the defeat of insubstantial claims without resort to trial."
Id., at 813.

Our definition of that qualified immunity standard was informed by three propositions that had been established by
earlier cases. First, in Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U. S. 635, 639-

523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

587Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
641 (1980), we held that qualified immunity is an affirmative
defense and that "the burden of pleading it rests with the
defendant." Second, in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 503-
504, we determined that the scope of that defense was the
same in actions against state officials under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983
and in actions against federal officials under the Federal
Constitution, and that in both types of actions the courts are
"competent to determine the appropriate level of immunity."
Third, in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), we presumed that the defense protects all officers in the executive
branch of government performing discretionary functions,
id., at 245-248, but held that the presumption was rebuttable, id., at 249-250.

The actual scope of the defense had been the subject of
debate within the Court in Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S.
308 (1975), a case involving a constitutional claim against the
members of a school board. A bare majority in that case
concluded that the plaintiff could overcome the defense of
qualified immunity in two different ways, either if (1) the
defendant "knew or reasonably should have known that the
action he took within his sphere of official responsibility
would violate the constitutional rights of the student affected," or (2) "he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other
injury to the student." Id., at 322. In dissent, Justice Powell argued that the majority's standard was too demanding of
public officials, but his proposed standard, like the majority's,
included both an objective and a subjective component. In
his view, our opinion in Scheuer had established this standard: "whether in light of the discretion and responsibilities
of his office, and under all of the circumstances as they appeared at the time, the officer acted reasonably and in good
faith." 420 U. S., at 330 (emphasis added).

In Harlow, the Court reached a consensus on the proper
formulation of the standard for judging the defense of quali523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
588 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Opinion of the Court
fied immunity. Speaking for the Court, Justice Powell announced a single objective standard:

"Consistently with the balance at which we aimed in
Butz, we conclude today that bare allegations of malice
should not suffice to subject government officials either
to the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching
discovery. We therefore hold that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are
shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their
conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would
have known." 457 U. S., at 817-818.

Under that standard, a defense of qualified immunity may
not be rebutted by evidence that the defendant's conduct was
malicious or otherwise improperly motivated. Evidence
concerning the defendant's subjective intent is simply irrelevant to that defense.

Our holding that "bare allegations of malice" cannot overcome the qualified immunity defense did not implicate the
elements of the plaintiff 's initial burden of proving a constitutional violation. It is obvious, of course, that bare allegations of malice would not suffice to establish a constitutional
claim. It is equally clear that an essential element of some
constitutional claims is a charge that the defendant's conduct
was improperly motivated. For example, A. Ernest Fitzgerald's constitutional claims against President Nixon and
his aides were based on the theory that they had retaliated
against him for speaking out on a matter of public concern.10
Our consideration of the immunity issues in both the Nixon

10 The reason why such retaliation offends the Constitution is that it

Opinion of the Court
case and in Harlow itself assumed that Fitzgerald would be
entitled to prevail but for the immunity defenses.11 Thus,
although evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on the
issue of qualified immunity, it may be an essential component
of the plaintiff 's affirmative case. Our holding in Harlow,
which related only to the scope of an affirmative defense,
provides no support for making any change in the nature of
the plaintiff 's burden of proving a constitutional violation.

Nevertheless, the en banc court's ruling makes just such a
change in the plaintiff 's cause of action. The court's clear
and convincing evidence requirement applies to the plaintiff 's showing of improper intent (a pure issue of fact), not to
the separate qualified immunity question whether the official's alleged conduct violated clearly established law, which
is an "essentially legal question." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
U. S. 511, 526-529 (1985); see Gomez, 446 U. S., at 640
("[T]his Court has never indicated that qualified immunity is
relevant to the existence of the plaintiff 's cause of action").
Indeed, the court's heightened proof standard logically
should govern even if the official never asserts an immunity
defense. See 93 F. 3d, at 815, 838. Such a rule is not required by the holding in Harlow.

11 See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232 (1991) (observing that "the
determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all" is a "necessary concomitant" to the threshold immunity question). Indeed, when Justice Ginsburg was a judge on the
District of Columbia Circuit, she commented:

"Had the Court [in Harlow] intended its formulation of the qualified immunity defense to foreclose all inquiry into the defendants' state of mind, the
Court might have instructed the entry of judgment for defendants Harlow
and Butterfield on the constitutional claim without further ado. In fact,
the Court returned the case to the district court in an open-ended remand,
a disposition hardly consistent with a firm intent to delete the state of
mind inquiry from every constitutional tort calculus." Martin, 812 F. 2d,
at 1432.

This correct understanding explains why Harlow does not support the
change in the law advocated by The Chief Justice, post, at 602.

590 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Opinion of the Court
The Reasoning in Harlow

Two reasons that are explicit in our opinion in Harlow,together with a third that is implicit in the holding, amply

justified Harlow's reformulation of the qualified immunitydefense. First, there is a strong public interest in protecting public officials from the costs associated with the defenseof damages actions.

12 That interest is best served by a defense that permits insubstantial lawsuits to be quickly termi-nated. Second, allegations of subjective motivation might

have been used to shield baseless lawsuits from summaryjudgment. 457 U. S., at 817-818. The objective standard,
in contrast, raises questions concerning the state of the lawat the time of the challenged conduct--questions that normally can be resolved on summary judgment. Third, focus-ing on "the objective legal reasonableness of an official's
acts," id., at 819, avoids the unfairness of imposing liabilityon a defendant who "could not reasonably be expected to
anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor . . . fairly besaid to `know' that the law forbade conduct not previously
identified as unlawful," id., at 818.13 That unfairness may

12 "These social costs include the expenses of litigation, the diversion of
official energy from pressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office. Finally, there is the danger that
fear of being sued will `dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or
the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching discharge of
their duties.' Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949), cert.
denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950)." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 814.

13 Our opinion in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), explicitly identified fairness as an important concern: "This official immunity apparently
rested, in its genesis, on two mutually dependent rationales: (1) the injustice, particularly in the absence of bad faith, of subjecting to liability an
officer who is required, by the legal obligations of his position, to exercise
discretion; (2) the danger that the threat of such liability would deter his
willingness to execute his office with the decisiveness and the judgment
required by the public good." Id., at 239-240 (footnote omitted). Fairness alone is not, however, a sufficient reason for the immunity defense,
and thus does not justify its extension to private parties. Wyatt v. Cole,
504 U. S. 158, 168 (1992).

591Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
be present even when the official conduct is motivated, inpart, by hostility to the plaintiff.

This last rationale of fairness does not provide any justifi-cation for the imposition of special burdens on plaintiffs who
allege misconduct that was plainly unlawful when it occurred. While there is obvious unfairness in imposing lia-bility--indeed, even in compelling the defendant to bear the

burdens of discovery and trial--for engaging in conduct thatwas objectively reasonable when it occurred, no such unfairness can be attributed to holding one accountable for actionsthat he or she knew, or should have known, violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff. Harlow itself said as
much: "If the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent
public official should know the law governing his conduct."
Id., at 818-819; see also Butz, 438 U. S., at 506 ("[I]t is not
unfair to hold liable the official who knows or should know
he is acting outside the law . . .").

The first two reasons underlying our holding in Harlow,
however, would provide support for a procedural rule that
makes it harder for any plaintiff, especially one whose constitutional claim requires proof of an improper motive, to
survive a motion for summary judgment. But there are
countervailing concerns that must be considered before concluding that the balance struck in the context of defining an
affirmative defense is also appropriate when evaluating the
elements of the plaintiff 's cause of action. In Harlow, we
expressly noted the need for such a balance "between the
evils inevitable in any available alternative." 457 U. S., at
813-814. We further emphasized: "In situations of abuse of
office, an action for damages may offer the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees." Id., at
814. Social costs that adequately justified the elimination of
the subjective component of an affirmative defense do not
necessarily justify serious limitations upon "the only realistic" remedy for the violation of constitutional guarantees.

592 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Opinion of the Court
There are several reasons why we believe that here, unlike
Harlow, the proper balance does not justify a judicial revision of the law to bar claims that depend on proof of an official's motive. Initially, there is an important distinction
between the "bare allegations of malice" that would have
provided the basis for rebutting a qualified immunity defense
under Wood v. Strickland and the allegations of intent
that are essential elements of certain constitutional claims.
Under Wood, the mere allegation of intent to cause any
"other injury," not just a deprivation of constitutional rights,
would have permitted an open-ended inquiry into subjective
motivation. 420 U. S., at 322. When intent is an element
of a constitutional violation, however, the primary focus is
not on any possible animus directed at the plaintiff; rather,
it is more specific, such as an intent to disadvantage all members of a class that includes the plaintiff, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-248 (1976), or to deter public
comment on a specific issue of public importance. Thus, in
Harlow, hostility to the content of Fitzgerald's testimony,
rather than an intent to cause him harm, was the relevant
component of the constitutional claim. In this case, proof
that respondent diverted the plaintiff 's boxes because she
hated him would not necessarily demonstrate that she was
responding to his public comments about prison conditions,
although under Wood such evidence might have rebutted the
qualified immunity defense.

Moreover, existing law already prevents this more narrow
element of unconstitutional motive from automatically carrying a plaintiff to trial. The immunity standard in Harlow
itself eliminates all motive-based claims in which the official's
conduct did not violate clearly established law. Even when
the general rule has long been clearly established (for instance, the First Amendment bars retaliation for protected
speech), the substantive legal doctrine on which the plaintiff
relies may facilitate summary judgment in two different

Opinion of the Court
ways. First, there may be doubt as to the illegality of thedefendant's particular conduct (for instance, whether a plaintiff 's speech was on a matter of public concern). See gener-ally Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640-641 (1987).
Second, at least with certain types of claims, proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutionalviolation--there must also be evidence of causation. Accordingly, when a public employee shows that protectedspeech was a "motivating factor" in an adverse employment
decision, the employer still prevails by showing that it wouldhave reached the same decision in the absence of the protected conduct. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429U. S. 274, 287 (1977). Furthermore, various procedural
mechanisms already enable trial judges to weed out baseless
claims that feature a subjective element, as we explain inmore detail in Part IV,

infra.14Thus, unlike the subjective component of the immunity defense eliminated by Harlow, the improper intent element of
various causes of action should not ordinarily preclude sum-mary disposition of insubstantial claims. The reasoning in

Harlow, like its specific holding, does not justify a rule thatplaces a thumb on the defendant's side of the scales when
the merits of a claim that the defendant knowingly violatedthe law are being resolved. And,

a fortiori, the policy con14 These various protections may not entirely foreclose discovery on the
issue of motive, and the Court of Appeals adopted its heightened proof
standard in large part to facilitate the resolution of summary judgment
motions before any discovery at all. Discovery involving public officials
is indeed one of the evils that Harlow aimed to address, but neither that
opinion nor subsequent decisions create an immunity from all discovery.
Harlow sought to protect officials from the costs of "broad-reaching" discovery, 457 U. S., at 818, and we have since recognized that limited discovery may sometimes be necessary before the district court can resolve
a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Anderson
v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646, n. 6 (1987); see also Mitchell v. Forsyth,
472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
cerns underlying Harlow do not support Justice Scalia'sunprecedented proposal to immunize all officials whose conduct is "objectively valid," regardless of improper intent, seepost, at 612 (dissenting opinion).

III
In fashioning a special rule for constitutional claims thatrequire proof of improper intent, the judges of the Court

of Appeals relied almost entirely on our opinion in Harlow,and on the specific policy concerns that we identified in that
opinion. As we have explained, neither that case nor thoseconcerns warrant the wholesale change in the law that they
have espoused. Without such precedential grounding, forthe courts of appeals or this Court to change the burden of
proof for an entire category of claims would stray far fromthe traditional limits on judicial authority.

Neither the text of $ 1983 or any other federal statute, northe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provide any support
for imposing the clear and convincing burden of proof onplaintiffs either at the summary judgment stage or in the
trial itself. The same might be said of the qualified immu-nity defense; but in

Harlow, as in the series of earlier casesconcerning both the absolute and the qualified immunity defenses, we were engaged in a process of adjudication that wehad consistently and repeatedly viewed as appropriate for
judicial decision--a process "predicated upon a consideredinquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant
official at common law and the interests behind it." Imblerv.

15 Though our opinion in Harlow was forthright in revising the immunity
defense for policy reasons, see Anderson, 483 U. S., at 645, that decision
nonetheless followed recent Court precedent and simply eliminated one
aspect of the established doctrine; it did not create a new immunity standard out of whole cloth.

Opinion of the Court
made by the Court of Appeals in this case, however, lacksany common-law pedigree and alters the cause of action itself

in a way that undermines the very purpose of $ 1983--to pro-vide a remedy for the violation of federal rights.

16

In the past, we have consistently declined similar invita-tions to revise established rules that are separate from the

qualified immunity defense. We refused to change the Fed-eral Rules governing pleading by requiring the plaintiff to
anticipate the immunity defense, Gomez, 446 U. S., at 639-640, or requiring pleadings of heightened specificity in cases
alleging municipal liability, Leatherman v. Tarrant County
Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163,164-169 (1993). We also declined to craft an exception to

settled rules of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction and re-jected the argument that the policies behind the immunity
defense justify interlocutory appeals on questions of eviden-tiary sufficiency.

Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 317-318(1995). Our reasons for those unanimous rulings apply with

equal force to the imposition of a clear and convincing burdenof proof in cases alleging unconstitutional motive.

As we have noted, the Court of Appeals adopted a height-ened proof standard in large part to reduce the availability
of discovery in actions that require proof of motive. To theextent that the court was concerned with this procedural
issue, our cases demonstrate that questions regarding plead-ing, discovery, and summary judgment are most frequently
and most effectively resolved either by the rulemaking proc-ess or the legislative process. See,

e. g., Leatherman, 507U. S., at 168-169. Moreover, the Court of Appeals' indirect

effort to regulate discovery employs a blunt instrument thatcarries a high cost, for its rule also imposes a heightened
standard of proof at trial upon plaintiffs with bona fide con16 Ironically, the heightened standard of proof directly limits the availability of the remedy in cases involving the specific evil at which the Civil
Rights Act of 1871 (the predecessor of $ 1983) was originally aimed--race

stitutional claims. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477U. S. 242, 252-255 (1986).

One particular recent action by Congress highlights ourconcern with judicial rulemaking to protect officials from
damages actions. Both Judge Silberman's opinion belowand a brief filed in this Court by 34 States, Guam, and the
Virgin Islands suggest that new substantive or proceduralrules are warranted because of the very large number of civil
rights actions filed by prison inmates. See 93 F. 3d, at 830,838; Brief for State of Missouri et al. as

Amici Curiae 12.Arguably, such cases deserve special attention because many

of them are plainly frivolous and some may be motivatedmore by a desire to obtain a "holiday in court,"

17 than by a

realistic expectation of tangible relief.Even assuming that a perceived problem with suits by

inmates could justify the creation of new rules by federaljudges, Congress has already fashioned special rules to cover
these cases. The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub. L.104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, enacted in April 1996, contains provisions that should discourage prisoners from filing claimsthat are unlikely to succeed. Among the many new changes
relating to civil suits, the statute requires all inmates to payfiling fees; denies

in forma pauperis status to prisoners withthree or more prior "strikes" (dismissals because a filing is

frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which reliefmay be granted) unless the prisoner is "under imminent danger of serious physical injury," $ 804(d); bars suits for mentalor emotional injury unless there is a prior showing of physical injury; limits attorney's fees; directs district courts toscreen prisoners' complaints before docketing and authorizes
the court on its own motion to dismiss "frivolous," "mali-cious," or meritless actions; permits the revocation of good

would enjoy a holiday in court." Id., at 320.

Recent statistics suggest that the Act is already having its intended effect.18Most significantly, the statute draws no distinction between constitutional claims that require proof of an impropermotive and those that do not. If there is a compelling need
to frame new rules of law based on such a distinction, pre-sumably Congress either would have dealt with the problem
in the Reform Act, or will respond to it in future legislation.

IV
In Harlow, we noted that a " `firm application of the Fed-eral Rules of Civil Procedure' is fully warranted" and may

lead to the prompt disposition of insubstantial claims. 457U. S., at 819-820, n. 35 (quoting

Butz, 438 U. S., at 508).Though we have rejected the Court of Appeals' solution, we

are aware of the potential problem that troubled the court.It is therefore appropriate to add a few words on some of
the existing procedures available to federal trial judges inhandling claims that involve examination of an official's state
of mind.When a plaintiff files a complaint against a public official
alleging a claim that requires proof of wrongful motive, thetrial court must exercise its discretion in a way that protects
the substance of the qualified immunity defense. It must

exercise its discretion so that officials are not subjected tounnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.

The district judge has two primary options prior to permit-ting any discovery at all. First, the court may order a reply
to the defendant's or a third party's answer under FederalRule of Civil Procedure 7(a), or grant the defendant's motion
for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). Thus, thecourt may insist that the plaintiff "put forward specific, nonconclusory factual allegations" that establish improper mo-tive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment. Siegertv.

Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurringin judgment). This option exists even if the official chooses

not to plead the affirmative defense of qualified immunity.Second, if the defendant does plead the immunity defense,
the district court should resolve that threshold question be-fore permitting discovery.

Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818. To doso, the court must determine whether, assuming the truth

of the plaintiff 's allegations, the official's conduct violatedclearly established law.

19 Because the former option of demanding more specific allegations of intent places no burdenon the defendant-official, the district judge may choose that

alternative before resolving the immunity question, whichsometimes requires complicated analysis of legal issues.

If the plaintiff 's action survives these initial hurdles andis otherwise viable, the plaintiff ordinarily will be entitled to
some discovery. Rule 26 vests the trial judge with broaddiscretion to tailor discovery narrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery. On its own motion, the trial court

"may alter the limits in [the Federal Rules] on the num-ber of depositions and interrogatories and may also limit

the length of depositions under Rule 30 and the number

for dismissal or summary judgment, the official is entitled to bring an

of requests under Rule 36. The frequency or extent ofuse of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under

these rules . . . shall be limited by the court if it deter-mines that . . . (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking intoaccount the needs of the case, the amount in controversy,
the parties' resources, the importance of the issues atstake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues." Rule 26(b)(2).
Additionally, upon motion the court may limit the time, place,and manner of discovery, or even bar discovery altogether

on certain subjects, as required "to protect a party or personfrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense." Rule 26(c). And the court may also setthe timing and sequence of discovery. Rule 26(d).

These provisions create many options for the districtjudge. For instance, the court may at first permit the plaintiff to take only a focused deposition of the defendant beforeallowing any additional discovery. See,

e. g., Martin, 812F. 2d, at 1437 (opinion of R. B. Ginsburg, J.). Alternatively,

the court may postpone all inquiry regarding the official'ssubjective motive until discovery has been had on objective
factual questions such as whether the plaintiff suffered anyinjury or whether the plaintiff actually engaged in protected
conduct that could be the object of unlawful retaliation.The trial judge can therefore manage the discovery process
to facilitate prompt and efficient resolution of the lawsuit; asthe evidence is gathered, the defendant-official may move for
partial summary judgment on objective issues that arepotentially dispositive and are more amenable to summary
disposition than disputes about the official's intent, whichfrequently turn on credibility assessments.

judge should give priority to discovery concerning issuesthat bear upon the qualified immunity defense, such as the

actions that the official actually took, since that defenseshould be resolved as early as possible. See Anderson, 483
U. S., at 646, n. 6.21Beyond these procedures and others that we have not
mentioned, summary judgment serves as the ultimate screento weed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior to trial. At
that stage, if the defendant-official has made a properly sup-ported motion,

22 the plaintiff may not respond simply with

general attacks upon the defendant's credibility, but rathermust identify affirmative evidence from which a jury could

find that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden of provingthe pertinent motive.

Liberty Lobby, 477 U. S., at 256-257.Finally, federal trial judges are undoubtedly familiar with

two additional tools that are available in extreme cases toprotect public officials from undue harassment: Rule 11,
which authorizes sanctions for the filing of papers that arefrivolous, lacking in factual support, or "presented for
any improper purpose, such as to harass"; and 28 U. S. C.$ 1915(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which authorizes dismissal
"at any time" of in forma pauperis suits that are "frivolousor malicious."

It is the district judges rather than appellate judges likeourselves who have had the most experience in managing
cases in which an official's intent is an element. Given the

court denies the motion, the official can take an immediate interlocutory
appeal, even if she has already so appealed a prior order. Behrens v.
Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311 (1996).

and identifying those portions of `the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,'

Prisoner suits under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 can illustrate ourlegal order at its best and its worst. The best is that even

as to prisoners the government must obey always the Consti-tution. The worst is that many of these suits invoke our
basic charter in support of claims which fall somewhere be-tween the frivolous and the farcical and so foster disrespect
for our laws.We must guard against disdain for the judicial system.

tional intent by `clear and convincing' evidence?" Pet.
for Cert. i.

The Court's opinion gives this question an extensive treatment, concluding that our cases applying the affirmative defense of qualified immunity provide no basis for placing "a
thumb on the defendant's side of the scales when the merits
of a claim that the defendant knowingly violated the law are
being resolved." Ante, at 593.

The second question presented asks:

"In a First Amendment retaliation case against a government official, is the official entitled to qualified immunity if she asserts a legitimate justification for her allegedly retaliatory act and that justification would have
been a reasonable basis for the act, even if evidence--
no matter how strong--shows the official's actual reason
for the act was unconstitutional?" Pet. for Cert. i.

The Court does not explicitly discuss this question at all.
Its failure to do so is both puzzling and unfortunate. Puzzling, because immunity is a "threshold" question that must
be addressed prior to consideration of the merits of a plaintiff 's claim. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).
Unfortunate, because in assuming that the answer to the
question is "no," the Court establishes a precedent that is
in considerable tension with, and significantly undermines,
Harlow.

I would address the question directly, and conclude, along
the lines suggested by Judge Silberman below, that a government official who is a defendant in a motive-based tort
suit is entitled to immunity from suit so long as he can offer
a legitimate reason for the action that is being challenged,
and the plaintiff is unable to establish, by reliance on objective evidence, that the offered reason is actually a pretext.
This is the only result that is consistent with Harlow and
the purposes of the qualified immunity doctrine.

In Harlow, respondent A. Ernest Fitzgerald brought a suitclaiming that White House aides Bryce Harlow and Alexander Butterfield, acting in concert with President RichardNixon and others, had conspired to deprive him of his job,
deny him reemployment, and besmirch his reputation.
Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 738-739, n. 18 (1982).Harlow and Butterfield claimed that they were immune from

this suit, and we granted certiorari to determine "the immu-nity available to the senior aides and advisers of the President." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 806. We first concluded thatunlike the President, senior White House aides were not necessarily entitled to absolute immunity. We next concluded,
however, that petitioners were entitled to "application of the
qualified immunity standard that would permit the defeat of
insubstantial claims without resort to trial." Id., at 813.

In applying that standard in Harlow we did not write on
a blank slate. The notion that government officials are
sometimes immune from suit has been present in our jurisprudence since at least Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9
Wheat. 738, 865-866 (1824). By the time we took up the
question in Harlow, we had come to understand qualified immunity as an affirmative defense that had both an "objective"
and a "subjective" aspect. See, e. g., Wood v. Strickland,
420 U. S. 308, 322 (1975).

In Harlow, however, we noted that application of the subjective element of the test had often produced results at odds
with the doctrine's purpose. First, some courts had considered an official's subjective good faith to be a question of
fact "inherently requiring resolution by a jury," making it
impossible to accomplish the goal that "insubstantial claims"
not proceed to trial. 457 U. S., at 816. Second, we noted
that there were "special costs" to inquiries into a government official's subjective good faith. Such inquiries were
"broad-ranging," intrusive, and personal, and were thought
to be "peculiarly disruptive of effective government." Id.,
at 817.

604 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Recognizing these problems, we "purged" qualified immunity doctrine of its subjective component and remolded it so
that it turned entirely on "objective legal reasonableness,"
measured by the state of the law at the time of the challenged act. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 517 (1985);
Harlow, supra, at 819. This new rule eliminated the need
for the disruptive inquiry into subjective intent, ensured that
insubstantial suits would still be subject to dismissal prior
to trial, and had the additional benefit of allowing officials to
predict when and under what circumstances they would be
required to stand trial for actions undertaken in the course
of their work. See, e. g., Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195
(1984) ("The qualified immunity doctrine recognizes that officials can act without fear of harassing litigation only if they
reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise
to liability for damages and only if unjustified lawsuits are
quickly terminated"). Since then we have held that qualified immunity was to apply "across the board" without regard to the "precise nature of various officials' duties or the
precise character of the particular rights alleged to have
been violated." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 642-
643 (1987).

Applying these principles to the type of motive-based tort
suit at issue here, it is obvious that some form of qualified
immunity is necessary, and that whether it applies in a given
case must turn entirely on objective factors. It is not
enough to say that because (1) the law in this area is "clearly
established," and (2) this type of claim always turns on a
defendant official's subjective intent, that (3) qualified immunity is therefore never available. Such logic apparently approves the "protracted and complex," ante, at 579, course of
litigation in this case, runs afoul of Harlow's concern that
insubstantial claims be prevented from going to trial, and
ensures that officials will be subject to the "peculiarly disruptive" inquiry into their subjective intent that the Harlow

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
rule was designed to prevent.1 Such a rule would also allowplaintiffs to strip defendants of Harlow's protections by a

simple act of pleading--any minimally competent attorney(or pro se litigant) can convert any adverse decision into a
motive-based tort, and thereby subject government officialsto some measure of intrusion into their subjective worlds.

Such a result is quite inconsistent with the logic and un-derlying principles of

Harlow.2 In order to preserve theprotections that Harlow conferred, it is necessary to construct a qualified immunity test in this context that is alsobased exclusively on objective factors, and prevents plaintiffs
from engaging in "peculiarly disruptive" subjective investi-gations until after the immunity inquiry has been resolved
in their favor. The test I propose accomplishes this goal.Under this test, when a plaintiff alleges that an official's action was taken with an unconstitutional or otherwise unlaw-ful motive, the defendant will be entitled to immunity and
immediate dismissal of the suit if he can offer a lawful reasonfor his action and the plaintiff cannot establish, through objective evidence, that the offered reason is actually a pretext.

1 The Court suggests that the Wood v. Strickland subjective inquiry
that we stripped from the qualified immunity analysis in Harlow is somehow different from the inquiry into subjective intent involved in resolution
of a motive-based tort claim. Ante, at 592. While the inquiries may differ somewhat in terms of what precisely is being asked, this difference is
without relevance for the purposes of qualified immunity doctrine. Both
inquiries allow a plaintiff to probe the official's state of mind, and therefore
both types of inquiry have the potential to be "peculiarly disruptive" to
effective government.

2 This result also threatens to "Balkanize" the rule of qualified immunity.

Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646, 643 (1987) ("[W]e have been
unwilling to complicate qualified immunity analysis by making the scope
or extent of immunity turn on the precise nature of various officials' duties
or the precise character of the particular rights alleged to have been violated. An immunity that has as many variants as there are modes of
official action and types of rights would not give conscientious officials that
assurance of protection that it is the object of the doctrine to provide").

606 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTON

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The Court's interpretation of Harlow does not differ frommine. See

ante, at 588 ("Under [the Harlow] standard, a defense of qualified immunity may not be rebutted by evidencethat the defendant's conduct was malicious or otherwise improperly motivated. Evidence concerning the defendant's
subjective intent is simply irrelevant to that defense"). TheCourt does not, however, carry the

Harlow principles to
their logical extension. Its failure to discuss the issue ex-plicitly makes it difficult to understand exactly why it rejects

my position, but there appear to be two possibilities.First, the Court appears concerned that an extension of
Harlow qualified immunity to motive-based torts will mean
that some meritorious claims will go unredressed. Ante, at
591 ("Social costs that adequately justified the elimination of
the subjective component of an affirmative defense do not
necessarily justify serious limitations upon `the only realistic' remedy for the violation of constitutional guarantees").
This is perhaps true, but it is not a sufficient reason to refuse
to apply the doctrine. Every time a privilege is created or
an immunity extended, it is understood that some meritorious claims will be dismissed that otherwise would have been
heard. Courts and legislatures craft these immunities because it is thought that the societal benefit they confer outweighs whatever cost they create in terms of unremedied
meritorious claims. In crafting our qualified immunity doctrine, we have always considered the public policy implications of our decisions. See, e. g., Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S.
158, 167 (1992).

In considering those implications here, it is desirable to
reflect on the subspecies of First Amendment claims which
we address in this case. Respondent Britton is a District
of Columbia corrections officer; petitioner Crawford-El is a
District of Columbia prisoner who was transferred from Spokane, Washington, to Marianna, Florida, with intermediate
stops along the way. The action of Britton's that gave rise
to this lawsuit was asking Crawford-El's brother-in-law to

523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
pick up boxes of the former's belongings for delivery to him,rather than shipping them directly to him in Florida. This

act, considered by itself, would seem to be about as far from aviolation of the First Amendment as can be conceived. But
Crawford-El has alleged that Britton's decision to deliver his
belongings to a relative was motivated by a desire to punishhim for previous interviews with reporters that he had

given, and lawsuits that he had filed. This claim of illicitmotive, Crawford-El asserts, transforms a routine act in the
course of prison administration into a constitutional tort.The Court cites

Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township
High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968), as an
example of this sort of tort. Ante, at 585, n. 9. But Pickering is but a distant cousin to the present case; there the
school board plainly stated that its reason for discharging the
plaintiff teacher was his writing of a letter to a newspaper
criticizing the board. It was not motivation that was disputed, but whether the First Amendment protected the
writing of the letter. Closer in point is Branti v. Finkel,
445 U. S. 507 (1980), also cited by the Court, but there the
act complained of was the dismissal of Republican assistants
by the newly appointed Democratic public defender. Objective evidence--the discharging of members of one party by
the newly appointed supervisor of another party, and their
replacement by members of the supervisor's party--would
likely have served to defeat a claim of qualified immunity
had the defendant official attempted to offer a legitimate reason for firing the Republican assistants. Thus, the defendants in neither Pickering nor Branti would have been entitled to qualified immunity under the approach that I propose.

Still more distantly related to the facts of the present case
are what I would call primary First Amendment cases,
where the constitutional claim does not depend on motive at
all. Examples of these are Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844 (1997) (finding portions of the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional under the First

Amendment); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560(1991) (concluding that Indiana statute regulating nude dancing did not violate First Amendment); Brown v. Hartlage,456 U. S. 45 (1982) (invalidating Kentucky statute that limited the speech of candidates for office); Nebraska Press
Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539 (1976) (invalidating judge'sorder prohibiting reporting or commentary on murder trial);

Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546(1975) (finding denial of permission to use municipal theater
for showing of Hair to be unconstitutional prior restraint);
New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971)
(per curiam) (refusing to enjoin publication of contents of
classified study).

The great body of our cases involving freedom of speech
would, therefore, be unaffected by this approach to qualified
immunity. It would apply prototypically to a case such as
the present one: A public official is charged with doing a
routine act in the normal course of her duties--an act that
by itself has absolutely no connection with freedom of
speech--but she is charged with having performed that act
out of a desire to retaliate against the plaintiff because of his
previous exercise of his right to speak freely. In this case,
there was surely a legitimate reason for respondent's action,
and there is no evidence in the record before us that shows it
to be pretextual. Under the Court's view, only a factfinder's
ultimate determination of the motive with which she acted
will resolve this case. I think the modest extension of Harlow which I propose should result in a judgment of qualified
immunity for respondent.

Also relevant to a consideration of the costs my proposed
rule would incur is that this suit is a request for damages
brought under $ 1983. If the purpose of $ 1983 is to "deter
state actors from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteed rights and to
provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails," it is hard
to see how that purpose is substantially advanced if petition523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
er's suit is allowed to proceed. Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S., at161. Petitioner has already fully exercised his "federally

guaranteed rights." Providing compensation to him, even ifhis claim is meritorious, will foster increased constitutional
freedoms only for the hypothetical subsequent individualwho, given the imposition of liability in this case, will not be
deterred from exercising his First Amendment rights out offear that respondent would retaliate by misdirecting his
belongings.The costs of the extension of

Harlow that I propose wouldtherefore be minor. The benefits would be significant, and

we have recognized them before. As noted above, inquiriesinto the subjective state of mind of government officials are
"peculiarly disruptive of effective government" and thethreat of such inquiries will in some instances cause conscientious officials to shrink from making difficult choices.3The policy arguments thus point strongly in favor of extending immunity in the manner I suggest. The Court'sopinion, however, suggests a second reason why this rule
might be unnecessary. The Court assumes that districtcourt judges alert to the dangers of allowing these claims

3 This point has perhaps been made most elegantly by Judge Learned
Hand, who, in an oft-cited passage, wrote:

"It does indeed go without saying that an official, who is in fact guilty
of using his powers to vent his spleen upon others . . . should not escape
liability for the injuries he may so cause; and, if it were possible in practice
to confine such complaints to the guilty, it would be monstrous to deny
recovery. The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know
whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that
to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of
a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor
of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching
discharge of their duties. . . . As is so often the case, the answer must be
found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative. In
this instance it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed
the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do
their duty to the constant dread of retaliation." Gregoire v. Biddle, 177
F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949), cert. denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950).

to proceed can protect defendants by judicious and skillful
manipulation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Ante,
at 597-601. I have no doubt that, as a general matter, district court judges are entirely capable in this regard. But
whether a defendant is entitled to protection against the "peculiarly disruptive" inquiry into subjective intent should not
depend on the willingness or ability of a particular district
court judge to limit inquiry through creative application of
the Federal Rules. The scope of protection should not vary
depending on the district in which the plaintiff brings his
suit. Cf. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S., at 643 ("An immunity that has as many variants as there are modes of official action and types of rights would not give conscientious
officials that assurance of protection that it is the object of
the doctrine to provide"). Indeed, the inconsistency with
which some District Courts had applied the Wood v. Strickland subjective good-faith inquiry was one of the reasons
why the Harlow Court stripped qualified immunity of its
subjective component. Harlow, 457 U. S., at 816 ("And an
official's subjective good faith has been considered to be a
question of fact that some courts have regarded as inherently
requiring resolution by a jury").

My proposed rule would supply officials with the consistency and predictability that Harlow and its progeny have
identified as an underlying purpose of qualified immunity
doctrine, without eliminating motive-based torts altogether.
The Court's solution, which is dependent on the varying
approaches of 700-odd district court judges, simply will not;
at the end of the day, many cases will still depend on a factfinder's decision as to motivation. No future defendant in
respondent's position can know with any certainty that the
simple act of delivering a prisoner's belongings in one way
rather than another will not result in an extensive investigation of her state of mind at the time she did so. This result
is simply not faithful to Harlow's underlying concerns.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

As I have observed earlier, our treatment of qualified im-munity under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 has not purported to be faithful to the common-law immunities that existed when $ 1983was enacted, and that the statute presumably intended to
subsume. See Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 498, n. 1 (1991)(

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting inpart). That is perhaps just as well. The $ 1983 that the

Court created in 1961 bears scant resemblance to what Con-gress enacted almost a century earlier. I refer, of course,
to the holding of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), whichconverted an 1871 statute covering constitutional violations
committed "under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State," Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983 (emphasis added), into a statute covering constitutional violations committed without the authority of anystatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State,
and indeed even constitutional violations committed in starkviolation of state civil or criminal law. See

Monroe, 365
U. S., at 183; id., at 224-225 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Asdescribed in detail by the concurring opinion of Judge Silberman in this case, see 93 F. 3d 813, 829 (CADC 1996), Monroe
changed a statute that had generated only 21 cases in thefirst 50 years of its existence into one that pours into the

federal courts tens of thousands of suits each year, andengages this Court in a losing struggle to prevent the Constitution from degenerating into a general tort law. (Thepresent suit, involving the constitutional violation of misdirecting a package, is a good enough example.) Applyingnormal common-law rules to the statute that

Monroe created
would carry us further and further from what any sane Congress could have enacted.We find ourselves engaged, therefore, in the essentially

legislative activity of crafting a sensible scheme of qualified

Scalia, J., dissenting
immunities for the statute we have invented--rather thanapplying the common law embodied in the statute that Congress wrote. My preference is, in undiluted form, the ap-proach suggested by Judge Silberman's concurring opinion
in the Court of Appeals: extending the "objective reasonable-ness" test of

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), toqualified immunity insofar as it relates to intent-based constitutional torts.

The Chief Justice's opinion sets forth a test that is"along the lines suggested by Judge Silberman,"

ante, at 602,but that differs in a significant respect: It would allow the

introduction of "objective evidence" that the constitutionallyvalid reason offered for the complained-of action "is actually
a pretext." Ibid. This would consist, presumably, of ob-jective evidence regarding the state official's subjective intent--for example, remarks showing that he had a partisan-political animus against the plaintiff. The admission of such
evidence produces a less subjective-free immunity than theone established by

Harlow. Under that case, once the trialcourt finds that the constitutional right was not well established, it will not admit any "objective evidence" that thedefendant

knew he was violating the Constitution. The testI favor would apply a similar rule here: once the trial court

finds that the asserted grounds for the official action wereobjectively valid (e. g., the person fired for alleged incompetence was indeed incompetent), it would not admit any proofthat something other than those reasonable grounds was the
genuine motive (e. g., the incompetent person fired was a Re-publican). This is of course a more severe restriction upon
"intent-based" constitutional torts; I am less put off by thatconsequence than some may be, since I believe that

no"intent-based" constitutional tort would have been actionable under the $ 1983 that Congress enacted.

Syllabus

BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-8516. Argued March 3, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998
Petitioner pleaded guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute, 21

U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1), and to "using" a firearm "during and in relation to a
drug trafficking crime," 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), but reserved the right to
challenge the quantity of drugs used in calculating his sentence. He
appealed his sentence, but did not challenge the plea's validity. The
Eighth Circuit affirmed. Subsequently, he sought habeas relief, claiming his guilty plea lacked a factual basis because neither the "evidence"
nor the "plea allocation" showed a connection between the firearms in
the bedroom of the house and the garage where the drug trafficking
occurred. The District Court dismissed the petition on the ground that
a factual basis for the plea existed because the guns in the bedroom
were in close proximity to the drugs and were readily accessible.
While petitioner's appeal was pending, this Court held that a conviction
for using a firearm under $ 924(c)(1) requires the Government to show
"active employment of the firearm," Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S.
137, 144, not its mere possession, id., at 143. In affirming the dismissal
in this case, the Eighth Circuit rejected petitioner's argument that Bailey should be applied retroactively, that his guilty plea was not knowing
and intelligent because he was misinformed about the elements of a

$ 924(c)(1) offense, that this claim was not waived by his guilty plea, and
that his conviction should therefore be vacated.

Held: Although petitioner's claim was procedurally defaulted, he may be

entitled to a hearing on its merits if he makes the necessary showing to
relieve the default. Pp. 618-624.

(a) Only a voluntary and intelligent guilty plea is constitutionally
valid. Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748. A plea is not intelligent unless a defendant first receives real notice of the nature of the
charge against him. Smith v. O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329, 334. Petitioner's
plea would be, contrary to the Eighth Circuit's view, constitutionally
invalid if he proved that the District Court misinformed him as to the
elements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense. Brady v. United States, supra, McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, and Parker v. North Carolina, 397
U. S. 790, distinguished. Pp. 618-619.

(b) The rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288--that new constitutional
rules of criminal procedure are generally not applicable to cases that

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
became final before the new rules were announced--does not bar petitioner's claim. There is nothing new about the principle that a plea
must be knowing and intelligent; and because Teague by its terms applies only to procedural rules, it is inapplicable to situations where this
Court decides the meaning of a criminal statute enacted by Congress.
Pp. 619-621.

(c) Nonetheless, there are significant procedural hurdles to consideration of the merits of petitioner's claim, which can be attacked on collateral review only if it was first challenged on direct review. Since petitioner appealed his sentence, but not his plea, he has procedurally
defaulted the claim he presses here. To pursue the defaulted claim in
habeas, he must first demonstrate either "cause and actual prejudice,"
e. g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 489, or that he is "actually innocent," id., at 496. His arguments that the legal basis for his claim was
not reasonably available to counsel at the time of his plea and that it
would have been futile to attack the plea before Bailey do not establish
cause for the default. However, the District Court did not address
whether petitioner was actually innocent of the charge, and the Government does not contend that he waived this claim by failing to raise it
below. Thus, on remand, he may attempt to make an actual innocence
showing. Actual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency. Accordingly, the Government is not limited to the existing
record but may present any admissible evidence of petitioner's guilt.
Petitioner's actual innocence showing must also extend to charges that
the Government has forgone in the course of plea bargaining. However, the Government errs in maintaining that petitioner must prove
actual innocence of both "using" and "carrying" a firearm in violation
of $ 924(c)(1). The indictment charged him only with "using" firearms,
and there is no record evidence that the Government elected not to
charge him with "carrying" a firearm in exchange for his guilty plea.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner pleaded guilty to "using" a firearm in violationof 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) in 1990. Five years later we held
in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144 (1995), that$ 924(c)(1)'s "use" prong requires the Government to show
"active employment of the firearm." Petitioner meanwhilehad sought collateral relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, claiming

them." Id., at 29-30. Following a sentencing hearing, theDistrict Court sentenced petitioner to 78 months' imprisonment on the drug count, a consecutive term of 60 months'imprisonment on the $ 924(c) count, and four years of supervised release. Id., at 83-84. Petitioner appealed his sentence, but did not challenge the validity of his plea. TheCourt of Appeals affirmed. 950 F. 2d 727 (CA8 1991).

In June 1994, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, challenging the factual basis for his
guilty plea on the ground that neither the "evidence" nor the"plea allocution" showed a "connection between the firearms
in the bedroom of the house, and the garage, where the drug
trafficking occurred." App. 109. A Magistrate Judge recommended that the petition be treated as a motion under 28
U. S. C. $ 2255 and recommended dismissal, concluding that
there was a factual basis for petitioner's guilty plea because
the guns in petitioner's bedroom were in close proximity to
drugs and were readily accessible. App. 148-153. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and ordered that the petition be dismissed.
Id., at 154-155.

Petitioner appealed. While his appeal was pending, we
held in Bailey that a conviction for use of a firearm under

$ 924(c)(1) requires the Government to show "active employment of the firearm." 516 U. S., at 144. As we explained,
active employment includes uses such as "brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firing
or attempting to fire" the weapon, id., at 148, but does not
include mere possession of a firearm, id., at 143. Thus, a
"defendant cannot be charged under $ 924(c)(1) merely for
storing a weapon near drugs or drug proceeds," or for
"placement of a firearm to provide a sense of security or to
embolden." Id., at 149.

Following our decision in Bailey, the Court of Appeals
appointed counsel to represent petitioner. Counsel argued
that Bailey should be applied "retroactively," that petition523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
er's guilty plea was involuntary because he was misinformedabout the elements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense, that this claim

was not waived by his guilty plea, and that his convictionshould therefore be vacated. Nevertheless, the Court of
Appeals affirmed the District Court's order of dismissal.
Bousley v. Brooks, 97 F. 3d 284 (CA8 1996).We then granted certiorari, 521 U. S. 1152 (1997), to resolve a split among the Circuits over the permissibility ofpost-Bailey collateral attacks on $ 924(c)(1) convictions obtained pursuant to guilty pleas.1 Because the Governmentdisagreed with the Court of Appeals' analysis, we appointed
amicus curiae to brief and argue the case in support of thejudgment below. 522 U. S. 990 (1997).

A plea of guilty is constitutionally valid only to the extentit is "voluntary" and "intelligent." Brady v. United States,
397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). We have long held that a plea doesnot qualify as intelligent unless a criminal defendant first
receives "real notice of the true nature of the charge againsthim, the first and most universally recognized requirement
of due process." Smith v. O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329, 334 (1941).
Amicus contends that petitioner's plea was intelligentlymade because, prior to pleading guilty, he was provided with

a copy of his indictment, which charged him with "using" afirearm. Such circumstances, standing alone, give rise to a
presumption that the defendant was informed of the natureof the charge against him.

Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S.637, 647 (1976); id., at 650 (White, J., concurring). Petitioner

nonetheless maintains that his guilty plea was unintelligentbecause the District Court subsequently misinformed him
as to the elements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense. In other words,petitioner contends that the record reveals that neither he,
nor his counsel, nor the court correctly understood the essen-tial elements of the crime with which he was charged. Were

this contention proved, petitioner's plea would be, contraryto the view expressed by the Court of Appeals, constitutionally invalid.Our decisions in

Brady v. United States, supra, McMann
v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759 (1970), and Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U. S. 790 (1970), relied upon by amicus, are not tothe contrary. Each of those cases involved a criminal defendant who pleaded guilty after being correctly informedas to the essential nature of the charge against him. See
Brady, supra, at 756; McMann, supra, at 767; Parker, supra,at 792. Those defendants later attempted to challenge their
guilty pleas when it became evident that they had misjudged
the strength of the Government's case or the penalties to
which they were subject. For example, Brady, who pleaded
guilty to kidnaping, maintained that his plea was neither voluntary nor intelligent because it was induced by a death penalty provision later held unconstitutional. 397 U. S., at 744.
We rejected Brady's voluntariness argument, explaining that
a "plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct
consequences" of the plea is voluntary in a constitutional
sense "unless induced by threats . . . , misrepresentation . . . ,
or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as
having no proper relationship to the prosecutor's business."
Id., at 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). We further
held that Brady's plea was intelligent because, although later
judicial decisions indicated that at the time of his plea he
"did not correctly assess every relevant factor entering into
his decision," id., at 757, he was advised by competent counsel, was in control of his mental faculties, and "was made
aware of the nature of the charge against him," id., at 756.
In this case, by contrast, petitioner asserts that he was misinformed as to the true nature of the charge against him.

Amicus urges us to apply the rule of Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288 (1989), to petitioner's claim that his plea was not
knowing and intelligent. In Teague, we held that "new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
620 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
to those cases which have become final before the new rules
are announced," id., at 310, unless the new rule "places `certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the
power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,' "
id., at 311 (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,
692 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part)), or could be considered a "watershed rul[e] of criminal
procedure," 489 U. S., at 311. But we do not believe that
Teague governs this case. The only constitutional claim
made here is that petitioner's guilty plea was not knowing
and intelligent. There is surely nothing new about this
principle, enumerated as long ago as Smith v. O'Grady,
supra. And because Teague by its terms applies only to
procedural rules, we think it is inapplicable to the situation
in which this Court decides the meaning of a criminal statute
enacted by Congress.

This distinction between substance and procedure is an
important one in the habeas context. The Teague doctrine
is founded on the notion that one of the "principal functions
of habeas corpus [is] `to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissibly
large risk that the innocent will be convicted.' " 489 U. S.,
at 312 (quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 262
(1969)). Consequently, unless a new rule of criminal procedure is of such a nature that "without [it] the likelihood of an
accurate conviction is seriously diminished," 489 U. S., at 313,
there is no reason to apply the rule retroactively on habeas
review. By contrast, decisions of this Court holding that a
substantive federal criminal statute does not reach certain
conduct, like decisions placing conduct " `beyond the power
of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,' " id., at
311 (quoting Mackey, supra, at 692), necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of "an act that
the law does not make criminal." Davis v. United States,
417 U. S. 333, 346 (1974). For under our federal system it is

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

621Cite as: 523 U. S. 614 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
only Congress, and not the courts, which can make conduct
criminal. United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 267-268,
n. 6 (1997); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32 (1812).
Accordingly, it would be inconsistent with the doctrinal underpinnings of habeas review to preclude petitioner from relying on our decision in Bailey in support of his claim that
his guilty plea was constitutionally invalid.

Though petitioner's claim is not Teague-barred, there are
nonetheless significant procedural hurdles to its consideration on the merits. We have strictly limited the circumstances under which a guilty plea may be attacked on
collateral review. "It is well settled that a voluntary and
intelligent plea of guilty made by an accused person, who has
been advised by competent counsel, may not be collaterally
attacked." Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984)
(footnote omitted). And even the voluntariness and intelligence of a guilty plea can be attacked on collateral review
only if first challenged on direct review. Habeas review is
an extraordinary remedy and " `will not be allowed to do
service for an appeal.' " Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339, 354
(1994) (quoting Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947)).
Indeed, "the concern with finality served by the limitation on
collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions
based on guilty pleas." United States v. Timmreck, 441
U. S. 780, 784 (1979). In this case, petitioner contested his
sentence on appeal, but did not challenge the validity of his
plea. In failing to do so, petitioner procedurally defaulted
the claim he now presses on us.

In an effort to avoid this conclusion, petitioner contends
that his claim falls within an exception to the procedural
default rule for claims that could not be presented without
further factual development. Brief for Petitioner 28-34.
In Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942) (per curiam), we
held that there was such an exception for a claim that a plea
of guilty had been coerced by threats made by a Government

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
622 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
agent, when the facts were "dehors the record and their effect on the judgment was not open to consideration and review on appeal." Id., at 104. Petitioner's claim, however,
differs significantly from that advanced in Waley. He is not
arguing that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was
coerced, but rather that it was not intelligent because the
information provided him by the District Court at his plea
colloquy was erroneous. This type of claim can be fully and
completely addressed on direct review based on the record
created at the plea colloquy.

Where a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by
failing to raise it on direct review, the claim may be raised
in habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate either
"cause" and actual "prejudice," Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.
478, 485 (1986); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977),
or that he is "actually innocent," Murray, supra, at 496;
Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986).

Petitioner offers two explanations for his default in an
attempt to demonstrate cause. First, he argues that "the
legal basis for his claim was not reasonably available to counsel" at the time his plea was entered. Brief for Petitioner
35. This argument is without merit. While we have held
that a claim that "is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel" may constitute cause for a procedural default, Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 16 (1984), petitioner's
claim does not qualify as such. The argument that it was
error for the District Court to misinform petitioner as to the
statutory elements of $ 924(c)(1) was most surely not a novel
one. See Henderson, 426 U. S., at 645-646. Indeed, at the
time of petitioner's plea, the Federal Reporters were replete
with cases involving challenges to the notion that "use" is
synonymous with mere "possession." See, e. g., United
States v. Cooper, 942 F. 2d 1200, 1206 (CA7 1991) (appeal
from plea of guilty to "use" of a firearm in violation of

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

$ 924(c)(1)), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 923 (1992).2 Petitioneralso contends that his default should be excused because,

"before Bailey, any attempt to attack [his] guilty plea wouldhave been futile." Brief for Petitioner 35. This argument,
too, is unavailing. As we clearly stated in Engle v. Isaac,
456 U. S. 107 (1982), "futility cannot constitute cause if itmeans simply that a claim was `unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.' " Id., at 130, n. 35.Therefore, petitioner is unable to establish cause for his
default.Petitioner's claim may still be reviewed in this collateral
proceeding if he can establish that the constitutional error inhis plea colloquy "has probably resulted in the conviction of
one who is actually innocent." Murray v. Carrier, supra,

at 496. To establish actual innocence, petitioner must dem-onstrate that, " `in light of all the evidence,' " "it is more

likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convictedhim."

Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327-328 (1995) (quoting
Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack onCriminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)).

The District Court failed to address petitioner's actual inno-cence, perhaps because petitioner failed to raise it initially
in his $ 2255 motion. However, the Government does not
contend that petitioner waived this claim by failing to raiseit below. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand

this case to permit petitioner to attempt to make a showingof actual innocence.

It is important to note in this regard that "actual innocence" means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.

2 Even were we to conclude that petitioner's counsel was unaware at the
time that petitioner's plea colloquy was constitutionally deficient, "[w]here
the basis of a . . . claim is available, and other defense counsel have perceived and litigated that claim, the demands of comity and finality counsel
against labeling alleged unawareness of the objection as cause for a procedural default." Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 134 (1982).

624 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
See Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339 (1992). In otherwords, the Government is not limited to the existing record

to rebut any showing that petitioner might make. Rather,on remand, the Government should be permitted to present
any admissible evidence of petitioner's guilt even if that evidence was not presented during petitioner's plea colloquyand would not normally have been offered before our decision in Bailey.3 In cases where the Government has forgone
more serious charges in the course of plea bargaining, petitioner's showing of actual innocence must also extend to
those charges.

In this case, the Government maintains that petitioner
must demonstrate that he is actually innocent of both
"using" and "carrying" a firearm in violation of $ 924(c)(1).
But petitioner's indictment charged him only with "using"
firearms in violation of $ 924(c)(1). App. 5-6. And there is
no record evidence that the Government elected not to
charge petitioner with "carrying" a firearm in exchange for
his plea of guilty. Accordingly, petitioner need demonstrate
no more than that he did not "use" a firearm as that term is
defined in Bailey.

If, on remand, petitioner can make that showing, he will
then be entitled to have his defaulted claim of an unintelligent plea considered on its merits. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
3 Justice Scalia contends that this factual innocence inquiry will
be unduly complicated by the absence of a trial transcript in the guilty
plea context. Post, at 631 (dissenting opinion). We think his concerns
are overstated. In the federal system, where this case arose, guilty

pleas must be accompanied by proffers, recorded verbatim on the record,
demonstrating a factual basis for the plea. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.
11(f), (g).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

While I agree with the Court's central holding and withits conclusion that none of its judge-made rules foreclose
petitioner's collateral attack on his conviction under 18U. S. C. $ 924(c), I believe there is a flaw in its analysis that
will affect the proceedings on remand. Given the fact thatthe record now establishes that the plea of guilty to the

$ 924(c) charge was constitutionally invalid, petitioner re-mains presumptively innocent of that offense. Accordingly,
unless he again pleads guilty, the burden is on the Govern-ment to prove his unlawful use of a firearm.

I
This case does not raise any question concerning the possi-ble retroactive application of a new rule of law, cf. Teague v.

Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), because our decision in Bailey v.United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), did not change the law.
It merely explained what $ 924(c) had meant ever since thestatute was enacted. The fact that a number of Courts of
Appeals had construed the statute differently is of no greaterlegal significance than the fact that 42 U. S. C. $ 1981 had
been consistently misconstrued prior to our decision in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989). Ourcomment on the significance of the pre-Patterson jurisprudence applies equally to the pre-Bailey cases construing$ 924(c):

"Patterson did not overrule any prior decision of thisCourt; rather, it held and therefore established that the
prior decisions of the Courts of Appeals which read$ 1981 to cover discriminatory contract termination were
incorrect. They were not wrong according to some ab-stract standard of interpretive validity, but by the rules
that necessarily govern our hierarchical federal courtsystem. Cf.

Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 540 (1953)

626 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Stevens, J.
(Jackson, J., concurring in result). It is this Court's re-sponsibility to say what a statute means, and once the

Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to re-spect that understanding of the governing rule of law.
A judicial construction of a statute is an authoritativestatement of what the statute meant before as well as
after the decision of the case giving rise to that con-struction."

Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S.298, 312-313 (1994).

Thus in 1990 when petitioner was advised by the trialjudge, by his own lawyer, and by the prosecutor that mere
possession of a firearm would support a conviction under$ 924(c), he received critically incorrect legal advice. The
fact that all of his advisers acted in good-faith reliance onexisting precedent does not mitigate the impact of that erroneous advice. Its consequences for petitioner were just assevere, and just as unfair, as if the court and counsel had
knowingly conspired to deceive him in order to induce himto plead guilty to a crime that he did not commit. Our cases
make it perfectly clear that a guilty plea based on such misin-formation is constitutionally invalid.

Smith v. O'Grady, 312U. S. 329, 334 (1941);
Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637,644-645 (1976). Petitioner's conviction and punishment on

the $ 924(c) charge "are for an act that the law does not makecriminal. There can be no room for doubt that such a circumstance `inherently results in a complete miscarriage ofjustice' and `present[s] exceptional circumstances' that justify
collateral relief under [28 U. S. C.] $ 2255." Davis v. United
States, 417 U. S. 333, 346-347 (1974).

II
The Government charges petitioner with "procedural de-fault" because he did not challenge his guilty plea on direct

appeal. The Court accepts this argument and thereforeplaces the burden on petitioner to demonstrate either "cause

Opinion of Stevens, J.
and prejudice" or "actual innocence." See ante, at 622. Yet
the Court cites no authority for its conclusion that "even the
voluntariness and intelligence of a guilty plea can be attacked on collateral review only if first challenged on direct
review." Ante, at 621.1 Moreover, the primary case upon
which the Government relies, United States v. Timmreck,
441 U. S. 780 (1979), actually supports the contrary proposition: that a constitutionally invalid guilty plea may be set
aside on collateral attack whether or not it was challenged
on appeal.

Several years before we decided Timmreck, the Court had
held that it is reversible error for a trial judge to accept a
guilty plea without following the procedures dictated by
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459 (1969). The question
in Timmreck was whether such an error was sufficiently serious to support a collateral attack under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255.
Because the error was neither jurisdictional nor constitutional, we held that collateral relief was unavailable. If we
had thought that the failure to challenge the constitutionality
of a guilty plea on direct appeal amounted to procedural default, there would have been no need in Timmreck to rely
on the critical difference between reversible error and the
more fundamental kind of error that can be corrected on collateral review. The opinion makes it clear that an ordinary
Rule 11 violation must be challenged on appeal; the only cri1 The Court does cite Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339, 354 (1994), for the
general proposition that habeas review " `will not be allowed to do service
for an appeal.' " Reed is inapposite, however, as it involved neither a constitutional violation nor a guilty plea. In Reed, the Court rejected a state
prisoner's statutory claim brought under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 on the grounds
that the prisoner had neither made a timely objection nor suffered prejudice. See 512 U. S., at 349 ("An unwitting judicial slip of the kind involved
here ranks with the nonconstitutional lapses we have held not cognizable
in a postconviction proceeding").

terion for collateral review that it mentions is that the error
must be jurisdictional or constitutional.2

Decisions of this Court that do not involve guilty pleas are
not controlling. For example, in United States v. Frady, 456
U. S. 152 (1982), two of the Court's reasons for dismissing the

$ 2255 claim alleging that the jury instructions were erroneous are not present in this case. First, the defendant failed
to object to the jury instructions--as required by Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 30--before the jury retired to
consider its verdict; no comparable Rule applies to petitioner's claim. Second, as the Court emphasized by quoting
from both United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178, 184-185
(1979), and Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U. S. 145, 154 (1977), the
prejudice to the defendant was not sufficient to warrant relief under $ 2255; that is plainly not the case with respect to
this petitioner. Similarly, in Davis v. United States, 411
U. S. 233, 242 (1973), there was a failure to comply with Fed2 As we explained: "In Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, the Court
was presented with the question whether a collateral attack under $ 2255
could be predicated on a violation of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(a), which
gives the defendant the right to make a statement on his own behalf before he is sentenced. The Court rejected the claim, stating: `The failure
of a trial court to ask a defendant represented by an attorney whether he
has anything to say before sentence is imposed is not of itself an error of
the character or magnitude cognizable under a writ of habeas corpus. It
is an error which is neither jurisdictional nor constitutional. It is not a
fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of
justice, nor an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair
procedure. . . .' 368 U. S., at 428." United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S.
780, 783 (1979). The Timmreck Court went on to hold that "[t]he reasoning in Hill is equally applicable to a formal violation of Rule 11" because
"[s]uch a violation is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional," and the
error did not "resul[t] in a `complete miscarriage of justice' or in a proceeding `inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.' Respondent does not argue that he was actually unaware of the special parole
term or that, if he had been properly advised by the trial judge, he would
not have pleaded guilty. His only claim is of a technical violation of the
Rule." Id., at 783-784.

eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2), which requiredchallenges to the composition of the grand jury to be made

by pretrial motion--a Rule that has no counterpart in theguilty plea context--coupled with the absence of the kind of
prejudice that is present here.

The Court has never held that the constitutionality of aguilty plea cannot be attacked collaterally unless it is first

challenged on direct review. Moreover, as the facts of thiscase demonstrate, such a holding would be unwise and would
defeat the very purpose of collateral review. A layman whojustifiably relied on incorrect advice from the court and counsel in deciding to plead guilty to a crime that he did notcommit will ordinarily continue to assume that such advice
was accurate during the time for taking an appeal. The injustice of his conviction is not mitigated by the passage of
time. His plea should be treated as a nullity and the conviction based on such a plea should be voided.

Because the record in this case already unambiguously
demonstrates that petitioner's plea to the $ 924(c) charge is
invalid as a matter of constitutional law, I would remand
with directions to vacate his $ 924(c) conviction and allow him
to plead anew.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

I agree with the Court that petitioner has not demonstrated "cause" for failing to challenge the validity of his
guilty plea on direct review. I disagree, however, that a defendant who has pleaded guilty can be given the opportunity
to avoid the consequences of his inexcusable procedural default by having the courts inquire into whether " `it is more
likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted
him' " of the offense to which he pleaded guilty. Ante, at
623, quoting Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327-328 (1995).

No criminal-law system can function without rules of procedure conjoined with a rule of finality. Evidence not intro523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

duced, or objections not made, at the appropriate time cannot
be brought forward to reopen the conviction after judgment
has been rendered. In the United States, we have developed generous exceptions to the rule of finality, one of which
permits reopening, via habeas corpus, when the petitioner
shows "cause" excusing the procedural default, and "actual
prejudice" resulting from the alleged error. United States
v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 167-168 (1982). We have gone even
beyond that generous exception in a certain class of cases:
cases that have actually gone to trial. There we have held
that, "even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default," habeas corpus will be granted "where a
constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent." Schlup v. Delo, supra,
at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted). In every one of
our cases that has considered the possibility of applying this
so-called actual-innocence exception, a defendant had asked
a habeas court to adjudicate a successive or procedurally defaulted constitutional claim after his conviction by a jury.
See Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 441, 452 (1986) (opinion of Powell, J.); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482, 495-
496 (1986); Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 529, 537-538
(1986); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 471, 502 (1991);
Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 336-337, 339-340 (1992);
Schlup, supra, at 305, 317-332.

There are good reasons for this limitation: First and foremost, it is feasible to make an accurate assessment of "actual
innocence" when a trial has been had. In Schlup, for example, we said that to sustain an "actual innocence" claim the
petitioner must "show that it is more likely than not that no
reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the
new evidence." 513 U. S., at 327 (emphasis added). That
"new evidence" was to be evaluated, of course, along with
the "old evidence," consisting of the transcript of the trial.
The habeas court was to "make its determination concerning

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
the petitioner's innocence in light of all the evidence, includ-ing that alleged to have been illegally admitted (but with

due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidence tenablyclaimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become
available only after the trial." Id., at 328 (internal quota-tion marks omitted). As the Court's opinion today makes
clear, ante, at 624, the Government is permitted to supple-ment the trial record with any additional evidence of guilt,
but the court begins with (and ordinarily ends with) a complete trial transcript to rely upon. But how is the court todetermine "actual innocence" upon our remand in the present case, where conviction was based upon an admission of
guilt? Presumably the defendant will introduce evidence(perhaps nothing more than his own testimony) showing that

he did not "use" a firearm in committing the crime to whichhe pleaded guilty, and the Government, eight years after the
fact, will have to find and produce witnesses saying that hedid. This seems to me not to remedy a miscarriage of justice, but to produce one.*

*The Court believes these concerns are overstated because, in the federal system, the court must be satisfied that there is a factual basis for
the plea. See ante, at 624, n. 3. This displays a sad lack of solicitude for
state courts, which handle the overwhelming majority of criminal cases.
But even in the federal system, the "factual basis" requirement will typically be of no use. Consider the factual basis for the guilty plea in the
present case, as set forth in the plea agreement:

"The parties . . . agree that, on or about March 19, 1990, . . . the defendant knowingly used firearms during and in relation to a drug-trafficking
offense . . . . The following firearms were found in the defendant's bedroom near the 6.9 grams of methamphetamine: a loaded Walther PBK .380
caliber handgun, serial number A016494; and a loaded .22 caliber Advantage Arms 4-shot revolver. The defendant admits ownership and possession of these two guns. This conduct constituted a violation of Title 18,
United States Code, Section 924(c). Three other firearms were found in
the two briefcases containing the bulk of the methamphetamine: a loaded
.22 caliber North American Arms handgun, serial number C7854; a loaded
.45 caliber Colt Model 1911 semiautomatic handgun, serial number 244682;

632 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
Second, the Court has given as one of its justifications
for the super-generous miscarriage-of-justice exception to
inexcusable default, "the fact that habeas corpus petitions
that advance a substantial claim of actual innocence are
extremely rare." Schlup, supra, at 321. That may be true
enough of petitions challenging jury convictions; it assuredly
will not be true of petitions challenging the "voluntariness"
of guilty pleas. I put "voluntariness" in quotation marks,
because we are not dealing here with only coerced confessions, which may indeed be rare enough. The present case
is here because, in Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637, 644-
646 (1976), this Court held that where neither the indictment, defense counsel, nor the trial court explained to the
defendant that intent to kill was an element of second-degree
murder, his plea to that offense was "involuntary." A plea,
the Court explained, can "not be voluntary in the sense that
it constitute[s] an intelligent admission that he committed the
offense unless the defendant receive[s] `real notice of the true
nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.' " Id., at 645,
quoting Smith v. O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329, 334 (1941). Of
course the word "voluntary" had never been used (by precise
speakers, at least) in that sense--in the sense of "intelligent"--and what the Henderson line of cases did was, by
sleight-of-tongue, to obliterate the distinction between involuntary confessions and misinformed or even uninformed
confessions. Once all those categories have been lumped toan unloaded Ruger .357 caliber revolver, serial number 151-36099. The
defendant denies knowledge of these guns." App. 8.

Of course "knowingly used" in this statement presumably means "knowingly used" in the erroneous sense that prompts this litigation. And that
will almost always be the situation where the "involuntariness" of the plea
is a consequence of subsequently clarified uncertainty in the law: The factual basis will not include a fact which, by hypothesis, the court and the
parties think irrelevant.

gether, the cases within them are not at all rare, but indeedexceedingly numerous.

It is well established that "when this Court construes astatute, it is explaining its understanding of what the statute
has meant continuously since the date when it became law."
Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n. 12(1994). Thus, every time this Court resolves a Circuit split

regarding the elements of a crime defined in a federal stat-ute, most, if not all, defendants who pleaded guilty in those
Circuits on the losing end of the split will have confessed"involuntarily," having been advised by the court, or by
their counsel, that the law was what (as it turns out) it was
not--or even (since this would suffice for application of Henderson) merely not having been advised that the law was
what (as it turns out) it was. Indeed the latter basis for
"involuntariness" (mere lack of " `real notice of the true nature of the charge against him,' " Henderson, supra, at 645)
might be available even to those defendants pleading guilty
in the Circuits on the winning side of the split. Thus, our
decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), has
generated a flood of 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 habeas petitions, each
asserting actual innocence of "using" a firearm in violation
of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c). This Term, we will resolve a Circuit
split over the meaning of another element ("carry" a firearm)
in the same statute. See Muscarello v. United States, No.
96-1654; Cleveland v. United States, No. 96-8837. And we
will also resolve Circuit splits over the requisite elements of
five other federal criminal statutes. See Salinas v. United
States, 522 U. S. 52 (1997) (18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(1)(B)); Brogan
v. United States, 522 U. S. 398 (1998) (18 U. S. C. $ 1001);
Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23 (1997) (20 U. S. C.

$ 1097(a)); Bryan v. United States, No. 96-8422 (18 U. S. C.

$ 922(a)(1)(A)); Caron v. United States, No. 97-6270 (18

U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20)).

To the undeniable fact that the claim of "actual innocence"
is much more likely to be available in guilty-plea cases than

523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
634 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
in jury-trial cases, there must be added the further undeni-able fact that guilty-plea cases are very much more numerous than jury-trial cases. Last year, 51,647 of the 55,648defendants convicted and sentenced in federal court (or
nearly 93 percent) pleaded guilty. Administrative Office of
the United States Courts, L. Mecham, Judicial Business ofthe United States Courts: 1997 Report of the Director 214.

When all these factors are taken into account, it could notbe clearer that the premise for our adoption in

Schlup of the
super-generous "miscarriage of justice" exception to normalfinality rules--viz., that the cases in which defendants seek

to invoke the exception would be "extremely rare"--is simply not true when the exception is extended to guilty pleas.
To the contrary, the cases will be extremely frequent, placing
upon the criminal-justice system a burden it will be unable
to bear--especially in light of the fact, discussed earlier, that
on remand the habeas trial court will not have any trial record on the basis of which to make the "actual innocence"
determination.

Not only does the disposition agreed upon today overload
the criminal-justice system; it makes relief available where
equity demands that relief be denied. When a defendant
pleads guilty, he waives his right to have a jury make the
requisite findings of guilt--typically in exchange for a lighter
sentence or reduced charges. Thus, defendants plead guilty
to charges that have not been proved--that perhaps could
not be proved--in order to avoid conviction on charges of
which they are "actually guilty," which carry a harsher penalty. Under today's holding, a defendant who is the "wheelman" in a bank robbery in which a person is shot and killed,
and who pleads guilty in state court to the offense of voluntary manslaughter in order to avoid trial on felony-murder
charges, is entitled to federal habeas review of his contention
that his guilty plea was "involuntary" because he was not
advised that intent to kill was an element of the manslaughter offense, and that he was "actually innocent" of man523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
slaughter because he had no intent to kill. In such a case,it is excusing the petitioner from his procedural default, not

holding him to it, that would be the miscarriage of justice.The Court evidently seeks to avoid this absurd consequence by prescribing that the defendant's "showing ofactual innocence must also extend" to any charge the Government has "forgone," ante, at 624. This is not even a fullysatisfactory solution in theory, since it assumes that the "forgone" charge is identifiable. If, as is often the case, the bar-gaining occurred before the charge was filed ("chargebargaining" instead of "plea-bargaining"), it will almostsurely not be identifiable. And of course in practical terms,
the solution is no solution at all. To avoid the patent ineq-uity, the Government will be called upon to refute, without
any factual record to rely upon, not only the defendant's tes-timony of his innocence on the charge of conviction, but his
testimony of innocence on the "forgone" charge as well--andas to the second, even the finding of "factual basis" required
in federal courts, see n., supra, will not exist. But even ifrebuttal evidence existed, it is a bizarre waste of judicial
resources to require minitrials on charges made in dusty in-dictments (or indeed, if they could be identified, on charges
never made), just to determine whether the defendant canlitigate a procedurally defaulted challenge to a guilty plea on
a different offense. Rube Goldberg would envy the schemethe Court has created.

* * *
It would be marvellously inspiring to be able to boast thatwe have a criminal-justice system in which a claim of "actual

innocence" will always be heard, no matter how late it isbrought forward, and no matter how much the failure to
bring it forward at the proper time is the defendant's ownfault. But of course we do not have such a system, and no
society unwilling to devote unlimited resources to repetitivecriminal litigation ever could. The "actual innocence" ex523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ception this Court has invoked to overcome inexcusable pro-cedural default in cases decided by a jury "seeks to balance

the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation ofscarce judicial resources with the individual interest in
justice that arises in the extraordinary case." Schlup, 513U. S., at 324. Since the balance struck there simply does not
obtain in the guilty-plea context, today's decision is not alogical extension of

Schlup, and it is a grave mistake. Forthese reasons, I respectfully dissent.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-300. Argued February 25, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998
Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

His direct appeals and habeas petitions in the Arizona state courts were
unsuccessful, and his first three federal habeas petitions were denied on
the ground that he had not exhausted his state remedies. In his fourth
federal habeas petition, he claimed, inter alia, that he was incompetent
to be executed under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399. The District
Court dismissed that claim as premature, but granted the writ on other
grounds. In reversing the granting of the writ, the Ninth Circuit explained that its ruling was not intended to affect later litigation of the
Ford claim. On remand, respondent moved to reopen his petition, fearing that review of his Ford claim might be foreclosed by the newly
enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA),
which establishes a "gatekeeping" mechanism for the consideration of
"second or successive [federal] habeas corpus applications," Felker v.
Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 657; 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b). Under AEDPA, a prisoner must ask the appropriate court of appeals to direct the district
court to consider such an application, $ 2244(b)(3)(A), and a court of appeals' decision whether to authorize an application's filing is not appealable and cannot be the subject of a petition for rehearing or a writ
of certiorari, $ 2244(b)(3)(E). The District Court denied the motion.
Subsequently, Arizona obtained a warrant for respondent's execution,
and the state courts found him fit to be executed. The District Court
denied another motion to reopen his Ford claim, holding that it lacked
jurisdiction under AEDPA. He then asked the Ninth Circuit for permission to file a successive habeas application. That court held that

$ 2244(b) did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be
executed claim and that respondent did not, therefore, need authorization to file his petition in the District Court.

Held:

1. Because respondent's claim was not a "second or successive" petition under $ 2244(b), this Court has jurisdiction to review the Ninth
Circuit's judgment on petitioners' certiorari petition. The fact that this
was the second time that respondent asked the federal courts to provide

Syllabus
relief on his Ford claim does not mean that there were two separate
applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to $ 2244(b).
There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court
ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim when it became ripe. Since
respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented
in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application, the Ninth Circuit
correctly held that he was not required to get authorization to file a
"second or successive" application before his Ford claim could be heard.
Accepting petitioners' interpretation--that once an individual has one
fully litigated habeas petition, his new petition must be treated as successive--would have far-reaching and seemingly perverse implications
for habeas practice. This Court's cases have never suggested that a
prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust
state remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and returned
to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition. A court
would adjudicate those claims under the same standard as would govern
those made in any other first petition. Respondent's Ford claim--previously dismissed as premature--should be treated in the same manner,
for, in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive an adjudication of his claim. To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of
a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons, having nothing
to do with the claim's merits, would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining
federal habeas review. Petitioners' reliance on Felker v. Turpin, supra,
for a contrary interpretation is misplaced. Pp. 641-645.

2. For the same reasons that this Court finds it has jurisdiction, it
finds that the Ninth Circuit correctly decided that respondent was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his Ford claim in the District Court.
Pp. 645-646.

Opinion of the Court
Arizona state courts. Arizona v. Martinez-Villareal, 145Ariz. 441, 702 P. 2d 670, cert. denied, 474 U. S. 975 (1985).

He then filed a series of petitions for habeas relief in statecourt, all of which were denied. He also filed three petitions
for habeas relief in federal court, all of which were dismissed
on the ground that they contained claims on which the stateremedies had not yet been exhausted.

In March 1993, respondent filed a fourth habeas petition infederal court. In addition to raising other claims, respondent asserted that he was incompetent to be executed.Counsel for the State urged the District Court to dismiss
respondent's Ford claim as premature. The court did so but
granted the writ on other grounds. The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's granting
of the writ but explained that its instruction to enter judgment denying the petition was not intended to affect any
later litigation of the Ford claim. Martinez-Villareal v.
Lewis, 80 F. 3d 1301, 1309, n. 1 (1996).

On remand to the District Court, respondent, fearing that
the newly enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) might foreclose review of his Ford claim,
moved the court to reopen his earlier petition. In March
1997, the District Court denied the motion and reassured
respondent that it had " `no intention of treating the [Ford]
claim as a successive petition.' " 118 F. 3d 628, 630 (CA9
1997). Shortly thereafter, the State obtained a warrant for
respondent's execution. Proceedings were then held in the
Arizona Superior Court on respondent's mental condition.
That court concluded that respondent was fit to be executed.
The Arizona Supreme Court rejected his appeal of that
decision.

Respondent then moved in the Federal District Court to
reopen his Ford claim. He challenged both the conclusions
reached and the procedures employed by the Arizona state
courts. Petitioners responded that under AEDPA, the
court lacked jurisdiction. The District Court agreed with

523US2 Unit: $U61 [04-29-00 19:02:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
petitioners, ruling on May 16, 1997, that it did not have juris-diction over the claim. Respondent then moved in the

Court of Appeals for permission to file a successive habeascorpus application. $ 2244(b)(3).

The Court of Appeals stayed respondent's execution
so that it could consider his request. It later held that$ 2244(b) did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be executed claim and that respondent did not,therefore, need authorization to file the petition in the District Court. It accordingly transferred the petition that hadbeen presented to a member of that court back to the District Court. 118 F. 3d, at 634-635.

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 912 (1997), to resolve an
apparent conflict between the Ninth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit on this important question of federal law. See,
e. g., In re Medina, 109 F. 3d 1556 (CA11 1996).

Before reaching the question presented, however, we must
first decide whether we have jurisdiction over this case. In
AEDPA, Congress established a "gatekeeping" mechanism
for the consideration of "second or successive habeas corpus
applications" in the federal courts. Felker v. Turpin, 518
U. S. 651, 657 (1996); $ 2244(b). An individual seeking to file
a "second or successive" application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application. $ 2244(b)(3)(A). The
court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant
the authorization to file. $ 2244(b)(3)(D). A court of appeals' decision whether to grant authorization "to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and
shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a
writ of certiorari." $ 2244(b)(3)(E).

If the Court of Appeals in this case had granted respondent leave to file a second or successive application, then we
would be without jurisdiction to consider petitioners' petition and would have to dismiss the writ. This is not, however, what the Court of Appeals did. The Court of Appeals

523US2 Unit: $U61 [04-29-00 19:02:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN
642 STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL

Opinion of the Court
held that the $ 2244(b) restrictions simply do not apply torespondent's

Ford claim, and that there was accordingly no
need for him to apply for authorization to file a second orsuccessive petition. We conclude today that the Court of

Appeals reached the correct result in this case, and that we
therefore have jurisdiction to consider petitioners' petition.Section 2244(b) provides:

"(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was pre-sented in a prior application shall be dismissed.

"(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was notpresented in a prior application shall be dismissed

unless--"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a
new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to caseson collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was
previously unavailable; or

"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could nothave been discovered previously through the exercise of

due diligence; and"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and
viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would besufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense."
If respondent's current request for relief is a "second or
successive" application, then it plainly should have been dismissed. The Ford claim had previously been presented in
the 1993 petition, and would therefore be subject to dismissal
under subsection (b)(1). Even if we were to consider the
Ford claim to be newly presented in the 1997 petition, it does
not fit within either of subsection (b)(2)'s exceptions, and dismissal would still be required.

Petitioners contend that because respondent has alreadyhad one "fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of

$ 2244(b) as amended requires his new petition to be treatedas successive." Brief for Petitioners 12. Under that reading of the statute, respondent is entitled to only one merits
judgment on his federal habeas claims. Because respondenthas already presented a petition to the District Court, and

the District Court and the Court of Appeals have acted onthat petition, $ 2244(b) must apply to any subsequent request
for federal habeas relief.But the only claim on which respondent now seeks relief
is the Ford claim that he presented to the District Court,
along with a series of other claims, in 1993. The District
Court, acting for the first time on the merits of any of respondent's claims for federal habeas relief, dismissed the
Ford claim as premature, but resolved all of respondent's
other claims, granting relief on one. The Court of Appeals
subsequently reversed the District Court's grant of relief.
At that point it became clear that respondent would have no
federal habeas relief for his conviction or his death sentence,
and the Arizona Supreme Court issued a warrant for his execution. His claim then unquestionably ripe, respondent
moved in the state courts for a determination of his competency to be executed. Those courts concluded that he was
competent, and respondent moved in the Federal District
Court for review of the state court's determination.

This may have been the second time that respondent had
asked the federal courts to provide relief on his Ford claim,
but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to

$ 2244(b). There was only one application for habeas relief,
and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each
claim at the time it became ripe. Respondent was entitled
to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier,
undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.
The Court of Appeals was therefore correct in holding that

Opinion of the Court
respondent was not required to get authorization to file a"second or successive" application before his

Ford claim
could be heard.If petitioners' interpretation of "second or successive"

were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be
far reaching and seemingly perverse. In Picard v. Connor,404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971), we said:

"It has been settled since Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S.
241 (1886), that a state prisoner must normally exhaustavailable state judicial remedies before a federal court

will entertain his petition for habeas corpus. . . . The
exhaustion-of-state-remedies doctrine, now codified inthe federal habeas statute, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2254(b) and (c),

reflects a policy of federal-state comity. . . . It follows, ofcourse, that once the federal claim has been fairly presented to the state courts, the exhaustion requirementis satisfied."

Later, in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 522 (1982), we wentfurther and held that "a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhaustedclaims." But none of our cases expounding this doctrine
have ever suggested that a prisoner whose habeas petitionwas dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, and who
then did exhaust those remedies and returned to federal
court, was by such action filing a successive petition. Acourt where such a petition was filed could adjudicate these

claims under the same standard as would govern those madein any other first petition.

We believe that respondent's Ford claim here--previously
dismissed as premature--should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies. True, the cases
are not identical; respondent's Ford claim was dismissed as
premature, not because he had not exhausted state remedies,
but because his execution was not imminent and therefore

Opinion of the Court
his competency to be executed could not be determined atthat time. But in both situations, the habeas petitioner does

not receive an adjudication of his claim. To hold otherwisewould mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for
technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner fromever obtaining federal habeas review. See,

e. g., UnitedStates ex rel. Barnes v. Gilmore, 968 F. Supp. 384, 385 (ND

Ill. 1997) ("If Barnes continues in his nonpayment of the re-quired $5 filing fee . . . this Court will be constrained to
dismiss his petition"); Marsh v. United States District Courtfor the Northern District of California, 1995 WL 23942 (ND
Cal., Jan. 9, 1995) ("Because petitioner has since not paidthe filing fee nor submitted a signed affidavit of poverty, the
petition for writ of habeas corpus is dismissed without preju-dice");

Taylor v. Mendoza, 1994 WL 698493 (ND Ill., Dec.12, 1994).*

Petitioners place great reliance on our decision in Felkerv. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996), but we think that reliance is
misplaced. In Felker we stated that the "new restrictionson successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata
rule, a restraint on what used to be called in habeas corpuspractice `abuse of the writ.' "

Id., at 664. It is certain thatrespondent's Ford claim would not be barred under any form

of res judicata. Respondent brought his claim in a timelyfashion, and it has not been ripe for resolution until now.

Thus, respondent's Ford claim was not a "second or succes-sive" petition under $ 2244(b) and we have jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals on petitioners'petition for certiorari. But for the same reasons that we
find we have jurisdiction, we hold that the Court of Appealswas correct in deciding that respondent was entitled to a

*This case does not present the situation where a prisoner raises a Ford
claim for the first time in a petition filed after the federal courts have
already rejected the prisoner's initial habeas application. Therefore, we
have no occasion to decide whether such a filing would be a "second or
successive habeas corpus application" within the meaning of AEDPA.

Affirmed.

It is axiomatic that "the power to award the writ [of ha-beas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must
be given by written law." Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75,94 (1807) (opinion of Marshall, C. J.). And it is impossible to
conceive of language that more clearly precludes respond-ent's renewed competency-to-be-executed claim than the
written law before us here: a "claim presented in a second orsuccessive habeas corpus application . . . that was

presentedin a pri or application shall be dismissed. " 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). TheCourt today flouts the unmistakable language of the statute
to avoid what it calls a "perverse" result. Ante, at 644.There is nothing "perverse" about the result that the statute
commands, except that it contradicts pre-existing judge-made law, which it was precisely the purpose of the statute
to change.Respondent received a full hearing on his competency-tobe-executed claim in state court. The state court appointedexperts and held a 4-day evidentiary hearing, after which it
found respondent "aware that he is to be punished for thecrime of murder and . . . aware that the impending punishment for that crime is death . . . ." App. 172. Respondentappealed this determination to the Supreme Court of Arizona, which accepted jurisdiction and denied relief. Hesought certiorari of that denial in this Court, which also denied relief. To say that it is "perverse" to deny respondenta second round of time-consuming lower-federal-court review
of his conviction and sentence--because that means forgoinglower-federal-court review of a competency-to-be-executed
claim that arises only after he has already sought federal

habeas on other issues--is to say that state-court determina-tions must always be reviewable, not merely by this Court,

but by federal district courts. That is indeed the principlethat this Court's imaginative habeas-corpus jurisprudence
had established, but it is not a principle of natural law. Lest
we forget, Congress did not even have to create inferior fed-eral courts, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 9; Art. III, $ 1, let

alone invest them with plenary habeas jurisdiction over stateconvictions. And for much of our history, as

Justice
Thomas points out, post, at 652, prisoners convicted by val-idly constituted courts of general criminal jurisdiction had

no recourse to habeas corpus relief at all. See Wright v.
West, 505 U. S. 277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.).

It seems to me much further removed from the "perverse"
to deny second-time collateral federal review than it is
to treat state-court proceedings as nothing more than a
procedural prelude to lower-federal-court review of state
supreme-court determinations. The latter was the regime
that our habeas jurisprudence established and that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) intentionally revised--to require extraordinary showings before
a state prisoner can take a second trip around the extended
district-court-to-Supreme-Court federal track. It is wrong
for us to reshape that revision on the very lathe of judgemade habeas jurisprudence it was designed to repair.

Today's opinion resembles nothing so much as the cases
of the 1920's that effectively decided that the Clayton Act,
designed to eliminate federal-court injunctions against union
strikes and picketing, "restrained the federal courts from
nothing that was previously proper." T. Powell, The Supreme Court's Control Over the Issue of Injunctions in
Labor Disputes, 13 Acad. Pol. Sci. Proc. 37, 74 (1928). In
criticizing those cases as examples of Gefu" hlsjurisprudenz
(and in insisting upon "the necessity of preferring . . . the
Gefu" hl of the legislator to the Gefu" hl of the judge"), Dean
Landis recalled Dicey's trenchant observation that " `judge523US2 Unit: $U61 [04-29-00 19:02:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

this Court to swallow, in yesterday's enactment of AEDPA
Congress curbed our prodigality with the Great Writ. Thewords that Landis applied to the Clayton Act fit very nicely

the statute that emerges from the Court's decision in thepresent case: "The mutilated [AEDPA] bears ample testimony to the `day before yesterday' that judges insist istoday." 43 Harv. L. Rev., at 892. I dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.
From 1986 to 1991, respondent filed three petitions for federal habeas relief; each was dismissed on the ground that
respondent had not yet exhausted his state remedies. In
March 1993, respondent filed his fourth federal habeas petition presenting, inter alia, his claim under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), that he was not competent to be
executed. Finding that some of respondent's claims were
procedurally defaulted, that others were without merit, and
that respondent's Ford claim was not ripe for decision, the
Court of Appeals held that the fourth petition should be denied. In May 1997, after the Arizona state courts rejected
his Ford claim, respondent returned for a fifth time to federal court, again arguing that he was incompetent to be executed. Because this filing was a "second or successive habeas corpus application," respondent's Ford claim should
have been dismissed. I therefore respectfully dissent.

Unlike the Court, I begin with the plain language of the
statute. Section 2244(b)(1) provides that a "claim presented
in a second or successive habeas corpus application . . . that
was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed." 28
U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II). An "application" is
a "putting to, placing before, preferring a request or petition

523US2 Unit: $U61 [04-29-00 19:02:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

to or before a person. The act of making a request for some-thing." Black's Law Dictionary 98-99 (6th ed. 1990); see

also Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 97 (1991)(application is a "request, petition . . . a form used in making
a request"). Respondent's March 1993 federal habeas petition was clearly a habeas "application" (the Court concedesas much), because it placed before the District Court respondent's request for a writ of habeas corpus. Once thisapplication was denied, however, none of respondent's claims
for relief--including his claim that he was incompetent to beexecuted--remained before the Court. It was thus necessary for respondent to file a new request for habeas relief so
that his Ford claim would again be "pu[t] to" or "plac[ed]
before" the District Court. (The Court certainly did not
raise respondent's Ford claim sua sponte.) Respondent's
May 1997 request for relief was therefore a habeas application distinct from his earlier requests for relief, and it was
thus undoubtedly "second or successive."

Respondent's Ford claim was also "presented" in both his
March 1993 and his May 1997 habeas applications. To "present" is "to bring or introduce into the presence of someone"
or "to lay (as a charge) before a court as an object of inquiry."
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 930 (1991). Respondent clearly "presented" his Ford claim in both his 1993
and his 1997 habeas applications, for in each he introduced
to the District Court his argument that he is not competent
to be executed. Under the plain meaning of the statute,
therefore, respondent's Ford claim was a "claim presented in
a second or successive habeas corpus application . . . that was
presented in a prior application." $ 2244(b)(1).

The reasons offered by the Court for disregarding the
plain language of the statute are unpersuasive. Conceding
that "[t]his may have been the second time that respondent
had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his Ford
claim," ante, at 643, the Court nevertheless concludes that
respondent has really filed only "one application for habeas

relief," ibid. (emphasis added). The District Court, how-ever, did not hold respondent's

Ford claim in abeyance when
it denied his March 1993 habeas petition, so that claim wasno longer before the District Court in May 1997. At best,

then, respondent's May 1997 filing was an effort to reopen
his Ford claim. But that filing (which is most definitely an"application") is subject to the statutory requirements for

second or successive habeas applications. As we have re-cently stated in a closely related context:

"[A] prisoner's motion to recall the mandate on the basis
of the merits of the underlying decision can be regarded
as a second or successive application for purposes of$ 2244(b). Otherwise, petitioners could evade the bar

against relitigation of claims presented in a prior appli-cation, $ 2244(b)(1), or the bar against litigation of claims
not presented in a prior application, $ 2244(b)(2)." Calderon v. Thompson, ante, at 553.

In just the same way, habeas petitioners cannot be permittedto evade $ 2244(b)'s prohibitions simply by moving to reopen

claims already presented in a prior habeas application.The Court also reasons that respondent's "

Ford claim
here--previously dismissed as premature--should be treatedin the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns

to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies,"
for "in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receivean adjudication of his claim."

Ante, at 644, 645. Implicit in
the Court's reasoning is its assumption that a prisoner whosehabeas petition has been dismissed for failure to exhaust

state remedies, and who then exhausts those remedies and
returns to federal court, has not then filed a "second or successive habeas corpus application." $ 2244(b)(1). To be
sure, "none of our cases . . . ha[s] ever suggested" that a
prisoner in such a situation was filing a successive petition.
See ante, at 644. But that is because, before enactment of
the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996

Thomas, J., dissenting
(AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1218, a federal court could grant reliefon a claim in a second or successive application so long

as the ground for relief had not already been "presentedand determined," 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(a) (emphasis added), or
"adjudicated," $ 2244(b), in a previous application. Claimspresented in a petition dismissed for failure to exhaust are
neither "determined" nor "adjudicated." Thus, the pre-AEDPA practice of permitting petitioners to raise claims already presented in applications dismissed for failure to ex-haust says nothing about whether those later applications
were considered second or successive.Even if the Court were correct that such an application
would not have been considered second or successive, such acase is altogether different from this case, in which only one
of many claims was not adjudicated. In the former situa-tion, the federal court dismisses the unexhausted petition
without prejudice, see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 520-522(1982), so it could be argued that the petition should be
treated as if it had never been filed. In contrast, when acourt addresses a petition and adjudicates some of the claims
presented in it, that petition is certainly an "application,"and any future application must be "second or successive."

1

Otherwise, the court would have adjudicated the merits ofclaims that had not been presented in an "application."

2

Ultimately, the Court's holding is driven by what it seesas the "far reaching and seemingly perverse" implications

for federal habeas practice of a literal reading of the statute.

1 If the Court's position is that respondent's May 1997 filing was an "application," but not a "second or successive" one, presumably 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II) would not have precluded respondent from
presenting, along with his claim under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399
(1986), a claim previously adjudicated on the merits, for $ 2244(b) operates
to bar only those claims presented in "second or successive" applications.

2 Even if a claim dismissed without prejudice could be treated as having

never been presented, dismissal, as the Court concedes, would still be
required because a Ford claim does not fit within $ 2244(b)(2)(B)'s exceptions for claims not presented in prior applications. See ante, at 642.

Thomas, J., dissenting
Ante, at 644. Such concerns are not, in my view, sufficientto override the statute's plain meaning. And to the extent

concerns about habeas practice motivate the Court's deci-sion, it bears repeating that federal habeas corpus is a statutory right and that this Court, not Congress, has expandedthe availability of the writ. Before this judicial expansion,
a prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus was permitted tochallenge only the jurisdiction of the court that had rendered
the judgment under which he was in custody. See Wrightv.

West, 505 U. S. 277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.).A Ford claim obviously does not present such a challenge.

3

A statute that has the effect of precluding adjudication of aclaim that for most of our Nation's history would have been

considered noncognizable on habeas can hardly be describedas "perverse."

Accordingly, whether one considers respondent's March1993 federal habeas petition to have been his

first habeasapplication--because his three previous applications had

been dismissed for failure to exhaust--or his fourth--be-cause respondent had already filed three previous habeas applications by that time--his May 1997 request for relief wasundoubtedly either a "second" (following his first) or "successive" (following his fourth) habeas application. Respond-ent's

Ford claim, presented in this second or successive appli-cation, should have been dismissed as a "claim . . . presented

in a prior application." $ 2244(b)(1).

3 There is an additional reason why a state prisoner's Ford claim may
not be cognizable on federal habeas. A state prisoner may bring a federal
habeas petition "only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of
the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254. A Ford claim does not challenge either the prisoner's underlying
conviction or the legality of the sentence; it challenges when (or whether)
the sentence can be carried out.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-463. Argued February 23, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998
Petitioner Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division (Textron)

and respondents--an international union and one of its locals (hereinafter Union), which represented approximately 500 Textron employees--were parties to a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited
the Union from striking for any reason and required Textron to notify
the Union before entering into any agreement to "subcontract out" work
that would otherwise be performed by Union members. After Textron
announced plans to subcontract out enough work to cause roughly onehalf of the Union members to lose their jobs, the Union filed the present
complaint, which, inter alia, alleged that Textron had fraudulently induced the Union to sign the collective-bargaining agreement, and sought
damages and a declaratory judgment that the agreement was voidable
at the Union's option. The complaint invoked $ 301(a) of the Labor
Management Relations Act as the basis of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, but did not allege that either party had ever violated the terms
of the collective-bargaining agreement. The District Court dismissed
the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the
cause of action alleged did not come within $ 301(a). The Third Circuit reversed.

Held: Because the Union's complaint alleges no violation of the collectivebargaining agreement, neither this Court nor the federal courts below
have subject-matter jurisdiction under $ 301(a), which confers jurisdiction only over "[s]uits for violation of contracts." While a federal court
may, in the course of resolving a dispute concerning alleged violation of
a collective-bargaining agreement, adjudicate the affirmative defense
that the contract was invalid, see Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455
U. S. 72, 85-86, it has no jurisdiction to resolve such a contention independently of, rather than ancillary to, its power to adjudicate "[s]uits
for violation of contracts." Here, since the Union neither alleges that
Textron has violated the contract, nor seeks declaratory relief from its
own alleged violation, $ 301(a) jurisdiction does not lie. The Union's

Opinion of the Court
hibited the Union from striking against Textron for any rea-son and, through the adoption of a separate memorandum

agreement, required Textron to give the Union seven days'notice before entering into any agreement to "subcontract
out" work that would otherwise be performed by Unionmembers. In June 1994, Textron announced that it planned
to subcontract out a volume of work that would causeroughly one-half of the Union members to lose their jobs.

Thereafter, in November 1995, the Union filed the pres-ent complaint in Federal District Court, alleging that Textron fraudulently induced the Union to sign the collective-bargaining agreement. Specifically, the Union claims that
both before and during negotiations it repeatedly asked Tex-tron to provide any information it might have regarding
plans to subcontract out work that would otherwise be per-formed by Union members; and that during negotiations,
Textron had in fact completed such a plan, but despite theUnion's repeated requests said nothing about its existence.
As redress, the Union seeks "a declaratory judgment thatthe existing collective bargaining agreement between the
parties is voidable at the option of [the] UAW," and "compen-satory and punitive damages . . . to compensate [the Union
and its members] for the harm caused by [Textron's] misrep-resentations and concealments and to deter other Employers
from similar conduct." App. 19. The Union does not allegethat either it or Textron ever violated the terms of the
collective-bargaining agreement. As the basis of federalsubject-matter jurisdiction, the complaint invokes $ 301(a) of
the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a).1

Opinion of the Court

The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack ofsubject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the cause of action it set forth did not come within $ 301(a). The Court ofAppeals for the Third Circuit reversed, 117 F. 3d 119 (1997);
we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 979 (1997).

II
Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,1947, provides:

"Suits for violation of contracts between an employerand a labor organization representing employees in an
industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, orbetween any such labor organizations, may be brought
in any district court of the United States having juris-diction of the parties, without respect to the amount in
controversy or without regard to the citizenship of theparties." 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a).

By its terms, this provision confers federal subject-matterjurisdiction only over "[s]uits for violation of contracts."
The Union, and the Government in an amicus brief filed insupport of the Union, contend that this includes suits alleging that a contract is invalid. Focusing on the breadth ofthe word "for," the Government argues that $ 301(a) "is
broad enough to encompass not only a suit that `alleges' aviolation of contract, but also one that concerns a violation
of contract, or is intended to establish a legal right to engagein what otherwise would be a contract violation." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 11 (footnotes omitted). Itis true enough, as the Government points out, that one of
the numerous definitions of the word "for" is "[i]ndicatingthe end with reference to which anything acts, serves, or is
done; . . . . As a preparation towards, against, or in view of;having as goal or object; . . . . With the purpose or object
of; . . . with a view to." Webster's New International Dicunion to sue in federal court to declare a collective bargaining agreement
voidable in the absence of any alleged violation of the agreement."

Opinion of the Court
tionary 984 (2d ed. 1950) (def. 2). Even applying that defi-nition, the Government must make a considerable stretch

to bring the present case within it. This suit obviously doesnot have as its "purpose or object" violation of any contract.
The most the Government can assert (and it falls short of the
definition) is that the suit seeks to facilitate "what otherwise
would be . . . contract violation[s]." Brief for United States
11 (emphasis added).More basically, however, it is a "fundamental principle of

statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) thatthe meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but
must be drawn from the context in which it is used." Deal
v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993). Accord, Cohen v.
de la Cruz, ante, at 220. It is not the meaning of "for" we
are seeking here, but the meaning of "[s]uits for violation
of contracts." That phrase cannot possibly bear the meaning ascribed to it by the Government. No one, for example,
would describe a corporation's harassing lawsuit against a
competitor as a "suit for unfair competition," even though
that is precisely its "goal or object." In the same vein, a
suit "for violation of a contract" is not one filed "with a view
to" a future contract violation (much less to facilitate action
that "otherwise would be" a contract violation). It is one
filed because a contract has been violated, just as a suit "for
unfair competition" is one filed because unfair competition
has occurred. In this context, the word "for" has an unmistakably backward-looking connotation, i. e., "[i]ndicating the
cause, motive, or occasion of an act, state, or condition; hence,
because of; on account of; in consequence of; as the effect
of; for the sake of; as, cursed himself for showing leniency."
Webster's New International Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1950)
(def. 7). "Suits for violation of contracts" under $ 301(a) are
not suits that claim a contract is invalid, but suits that claim
a contract has been violated.

This does not mean that a federal court can never adjudicate the validity of a contract under $ 301(a). That provision

Opinion of the Court

simply erects a gateway through which parties may pass intofederal court; once they have entered, it does not restrict the

legal landscape they may traverse. Thus if, in the courseof deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief for the
defendant's alleged violation of a contract, the defendant in-terposes the affirmative defense that the contract was invalid, the court may, consistent with $ 301(a), adjudicate thatdefense. See

Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U. S. 72,85-86 (1982). Similarly, a declaratory judgment plaintiff accused of violating a collective-bargaining agreement may aska court to declare the agreement invalid. But in these cases,
the federal court's power to adjudicate the contract's validity
is ancillary to, and not independent of, its power to adjudi-cate "[s]uits for violation of contracts."

This would seem to be the end of the matter. Here, theUnion neither alleges that Textron has violated the contract,
nor seeks declaratory relief from its own alleged violation.Indeed, as far as the Union's complaint discloses, both parties
are in absolute compliance with the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. Section 301(a) jurisdiction does not
lie over such a case.

The Union, however, asserts that the outcome is alteredby the fact that it seeks relief pursuant to the Declaratory

Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2201.2 It argues that in orderto determine whether $ 301(a) jurisdiction lies over the
declaratory-judgment aspect of its suit, we must look to the
character of the threatened action to which its suit wouldinterpose a defense, which in this case would be Textron's

action for breach of the collective-bargaining agreement. It
relies on our decision in Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum

2 The Declaratory Judgment Act provides, in relevant part, that "[i]n a
case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court of the
United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the
rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought." 28 U. S. C.

Co., 339 U. S. 667 (1950), which held that a declaratory actionasserting a federal defense to a nonfederal claim was not a

"civil actio[n] arising under the . . . laws . . . of the UnitedStates" within the meaning of the federal-question jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. This argument makesseveral assumptions that we do not think can be indulged.

First, it assumes that facts which were the converse of
Skelly Oil--i. e., a declaratory-judgment complaint raising anonfederal defense to an anticipated federal claim--would

confer $ 1331 jurisdiction. That is not clear. It can be ar-gued that anticipating a federal claim in a suit asserting a
nonfederal defense no more effectively invokes $ 1331 juris-diction than anticipating a federal defense in a suit asserting
a nonfederal claim. (The latter, of course, is barred by thewell-pleaded-complaint rule, see

Rivet v. Regions Bank ofLa., 522 U. S. 470, 475 (1998).) Perhaps it was the purpose

of the Declaratory Judgment Act to permit such anticipa-tion, see Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19,n. 19 (1983), but

Skelly Oil did not present that issue, andsome of its language suggests that the declaratory-judgment

plaintiff must himself have a federal claim.3 No decision

3 "Prior to [the Declaratory Judgment] Act, a federal court would entertain a suit on a contract only if the plaintiff asked for an immediately
enforceable remedy like money damages or an injunction . . . . The Declaratory Judgment Act allowed relief to be given by way of recognizing
the plaintiff's right even though no immediate enforcement of it was
asked." Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 671-672
(1950).

"[I]t has been settled doctrine that where a suit is brought in the federal
courts `upon the sole ground that the determination of the suit depends
upon some question of a Federal nature, it must appear, at the outset,
from the declaration or the bill of the party suing, that the suit is of that
character.' But `a suggestion of one party, that the other will or may set
up a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States, does not
make the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws.' " Id., at

AVCO CORP. v. AUTOMOBILE WORKERS

Opinion of the Court

of this Court has squarely confronted and explicitly upheldfederal-question jurisdiction on the basis of the anticipated

claim against which the declaratory-judgment plaintiff pre-sents a nonfederal defense; and neither the Union nor the
Government cites such a decision by any other federal court.4Second, the Union's Skelly Oil argument assumes that
what would suffice to sustain a declaratory-judgment actionpremised on $ 1331 federal-question jurisdiction would suffice
to sustain a declaratory-judgment action brought under$ 301(a). But the language of the two provisions is quite
different. Whereas $ 1331 authorizes "civil actions arisingunder the . . . laws . . . of the United States" (which can
arguably embrace a civil action presenting a defense to afederal claim), $ 301(a) authorizes only "[s]uits for violation
of contracts."But assuming (without deciding) that the converse of
Skelly Oil confers $ 1331 jurisdiction, and that what sufficesfor $ 1331 suffices for $ 301(a) as well, the Union's prayer for
a declaration that the collective-bargaining agreement wasvoidable is in our view inadequate to save the present suit,
because it does not, and as far as the record shows it neverdid, present a case or controversy giving the Union access
to federal courts. That is obviously so at the present time,because the collective-bargaining agreement, whether voidable or not, has expired; the only question is whether theparties had any concrete dispute over the contract's voidability at the time the suit was filed.

4 In Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation
Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1 (1983), we observed, with seeming
approval, that "[f]ederal courts have regularly taken original jurisdiction
over declaratory judgment suits in which, if the declaratory judgment
defendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit would
necessarily present a federal question." Id., at 19. The cases brought
forward to support that observation, however, were suits by alleged
patent infringers to declare a patent invalid, which of course themselves
raise a federal question. See id., at 19, n. 19.

Opinion of the Court
We see no evidence that they did. To be sure, Textronvigorously contested the complaint's allegations of fraud that

are the asserted cause of the claimed voidability as well asof the claimed damages; but that is no indication that Textron
had any interest in defending the binding nature of the con-tract. Indeed, there is not even any indication that the
Union had a concrete interest in establishing the nonbindingnature of the contract. This was not (as one might have
expected in a declaratory-judgment suit of this sort) a situa-tion in which the Union had threatened to strike over the
contracting-out, and Textron had asserted that a strikewould violate the collective-bargaining agreement. The
Union never threatened to strike. As far as appears, thecompany that had just eliminated the work of half its Williamsport employees would have been perfectly willing to beexcused from a contract negotiated when the Union was in a
stronger bargaining position, and the Union had no intent ordisposition to exercise a theoretical option to avoid a contract
that was better than what it could negotiate anew. The factthat the fraud damages claim, if successful, would establish
a voidability that (as far as appears) no one cared about, doesnot make the question of voidability a "case of actual controversy," 28 U. S. C. $ 2201, over which federal courts have$ 301(a) jurisdiction. "The Declaratory Judgment Act of
1934, in its limitation to `cases of actual controversy,' mani-festly has regard to the constitutional provision [Art. III, $ 2]
and is operative only in respect to controversies which aresuch in the constitutional sense."

under $ 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act. Ac-cordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
If the Union's allegations are true, it seems clear that peti-tioner violated its statutory duty to bargain in good faith.

Our conclusion that the federal courts do not have $ 301(a)jurisdiction over the Union's suit therefore comports with
the important goal of protecting the primary jurisdiction ofthe National Labor Relations Board in resolving disputes
arising from the collective-bargaining process. As theCourt has long recognized, "[i]t is implicit in the entire structure of the [National Labor Relations] Act that the Boardacts to oversee and referee the process of collective bargaining." H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99, 107-108 (1970)."Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtainuniform application of its substantive rules."

Garner v.Teamsters, 346 U. S. 485, 490 (1953). The rules governing

disputes that arise out of the collective-bargaining processare within the special competence of the National Labor Relations Board. Cf. San Diego Building Trades Council v.
Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 245 (1959). The fact that the Boardundoubtedly has more expertise in the collective-bargaining

area than federal judges provides an additional reason forconcluding that Congress meant what it said in $ 301(a) and
for rejecting the Union's and the Government's broad read-ing of the "[s]uits for violation of contracts" language.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.
I agree with the first five pages of the Court's opinion.See ante, at 654-658. I also agree with the Court that the
Union failed to show (or even to allege) a significant likeli-hood that it would strike and that Textron would then sue it

523US3 Unit: $U62 [05-09-00 11:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

for breach of its collective-bargaining agreement. See ante,at 661. I write separately, however, because this factual

circumstance has more significance than the Court's opinionsuggests. See

ante, at 658-660. Indeed, in my view, if the
Union had shown that a strike and consequent employer
breach-of-contract lawsuit were imminent, then the Declar-atory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2201, would have authorized the District Court to adjudicate this controversy. Un-like the Court, I would not leave the matter undecided.

My conclusion flows from the following two legal propo-sitions:

Proposition One. The Declaratory Judgment Act
permits a federal court to "declare the rights and other legal
relations of any interested party" as long as there exists an
"actual controversy" that is "within [the] jurisdiction" of a
federal court. 28 U. S. C. $ 2201(a).

Proposition Two. Section 301 of the Labor Management
Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a), permits a
federal court to adjudicate both an employer's claim that
a contract's (i. e., a collective-bargaining agreement's) "no
strike" clause forbids an ongoing strike and the related
Union defense that it is free to strike because the contract
itself is invalid. See ante, at 657-658; Brief for Petitioner
29 ("[B]efore enforcing an agreement, courts must adjudicate
affirmative defenses such as fraud . . . in the collective bargaining process"); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
13-14; Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U. S. 72, 85-86
(1982).

Proposition One means that the Declaratory Judgment
Act gives a federal court the power to declare the "rights"
and "legal relations" of both union and employer where the
"controversy" described in Proposition Two is "actual," e. g.,
where the strike and consequent employer lawsuit is imminent. Moreover, this Court has pointed out that "[f]ederal
courts have regularly taken original jurisdiction over declaratory judgment suits in which, if the declaratory judgment
defendant [such as the employer here] brought a coercive

Opinion of Breyer, J.

action to enforce its rights, that suit would necessarily pre-sent a federal question."

Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463U. S. 1, 19 (1983). Hence the characterization of the Union's

"no valid contract" claim as a "defense" that could not independently support $ 301 jurisdiction is beside the point. See
ibid.; Public Serv. Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S.
237, 248 (1952) (in declaratory judgment context, "it is thecharacter of the threatened action, and not of the defense,

which will determine whether there is federal-question juris-diction in the District Court"); see also 10A C. Wright, A.
Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2767,
p. 741 (2d ed. 1983) ("federal nature of the right claimed not
to exist is crucial to jurisdiction").

This conclusion draws support in principle from the Declaratory Judgment Act's basic objective, which is "to permit
adjudication of either party's claims of right." Franchise
Tax Board, supra, at 19, n. 19. And the conclusion draws
support in practice from the prevalence in the lower courts
of "reverse" declaratory judgment actions that focus upon a
party's likely defense, including actions found in contexts such
as that now before us. See, e. g., El Paso Bldg. & Constr.
Trades Council v. Associated Gen. Contractors of Am., 376
F. 2d 797, 799-800 (CA5 1967) (union threatened to strike,
then filed declaratory judgment action for determination
of contract's validity, and court took jurisdiction under $ 301);
McNally Pittsburg, Inc. v. International Assn. of Bridge,
Structural, and Ornamental Iron Workers, 812 F. 2d 615
(CA10 1987) (where actual controversy existed with union,
employer allowed to seek prospective declaration that contract was invalid); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO, 483 F. 2d 603 (CA5
1973) (same), rev'd on other grounds, 504 F. 2d 272 (1974)
(en banc). Cf. Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 176 (1965) (one
likely to be sued for patent infringement "need not await the

Opinion of Breyer, J.
filing of a threatened suit by the patentee; the validity of thepatent may be tested under the Declaratory Judgment Act").

I cannot find any reason for an exception that would forbid"reverse" declaratory judgment actions in labor law contexts
such as this one. To the contrary, this Court has suggestedthat the availability of declaratory judgment actions furthers
the LMRA's basic purposes. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln
Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 454-455 (1957) ($ 301 designedto promote "industrial peace" by "provid[ing] the necessary

legal remedies"); id., at 455-456 (quoting from floor state-ment of Representative Barden, 93 Cong. Rec. 3656-3657
(1947), that "the section . . . contemplates not only the ordi-nary lawsuits for damages but also such other remedial proceedings, both legal and equitable, as might be appropriate. . . [including a suit] under the Declaratory Judgments Act
in order to secure declarations from the Court of legal rightsunder the contract");

Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S.195, 199 (1962) ("[Section] 301 is not to be given a narrow

reading"). And the Government, in an amicus curiae brief,tells us that such an action would not interfere with the National Labor Relations Board's administration of federallabor law. See Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae27 ("The Board . . . has concluded in this and other cases . . .

that a suit under Section 301(a) to declare a contract voidablebased on fraud in the inducement does not unduly intrude
upon its authority").Thus Declaratory Judgment Act jurisdiction would lie in a
case like this one, provided, however, that the declaratoryjudgment plaintiff demonstrates an "actual controversy."
28 U. S. C. $ 2201(a); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.227, 239-240 (1937). The Union failed to make any such
showing here, and for that reason I agree with the Court'sultimate conclusion.

ARKANSAS EDUCATIONAL TELEVISIONCOMMISSION

v. FORBES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-779. Argued October 8, 1997--Decided May 18, 1998
Petitioner Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC), a stateowned public television broadcaster, sponsored a debate between the
major party candidates for the 1992 election in Arkansas' Third Congressional District. When AETC denied the request of respondent
Forbes, an independent candidate with little popular support, for permission to participate in the debate, Forbes filed this suit, claiming,
inter alia, that he was entitled to participate under the First Amendment. The jury made express findings that Forbes' exclusion had not
been influenced by political pressure or disagreement with his views.
The District Court entered judgment for AETC. The Eighth Circuit
reversed, holding that the debate was a public forum to which all ballotqualified candidates had a presumptive right of access. Applying strict
scrutiny, the court determined that AETC's assessment of Forbes' "political viability" was neither a compelling nor a narrowly tailored reason
for excluding him.

Held: AETC's exclusion of Forbes from the debate was consistent with

the First Amendment. Pp. 672-683.

(a) Unlike most other public television programs, candidate debates
are subject to scrutiny under this Court's public forum doctrine. Having first arisen in the context of streets and parks, the doctrine should
not be extended in a mechanical way to the different context of television broadcasting. Broad rights of access for outside speakers would
be antithetical, as a general rule, to the editorial discretion that broadcasters must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory
obligations. For two reasons, however, candidate debates present the
narrow exception to the rule. First, unlike AETC's other broadcasts,
the debate was by design a forum for candidates' political speech. Consistent with the long tradition of such debates, AETC's implicit representation was that the views expressed were those of the candidates,
not its own. The debate's very purpose was to allow the expression
of those views with minimal intrusion by the broadcaster. Second, candidate debates are of exceptional significance in the electoral process.
Deliberation on candidates' positions and qualifications is integral to
our system of government, and electoral speech may have its most pro523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

667Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)
Syllabus
found and widespread impact when it is disseminated through televised debates. Thus, the special characteristics of candidate debates
support the conclusion that the AETC debate was a forum of some type.
The question of what type must be answered by reference to this
Court's public forum precedents. Pp. 672-676.

(b) For the Court's purposes, it will suffice to employ the categories
of speech fora already established in the case law. The Court has
identified three types of fora: the traditional public forum, the public
forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum.
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,
802. Traditional public fora are defined by the objective characteristics
of the property, such as whether, "by long tradition or by government
fiat," the property has been "devoted to assembly and debate." Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45. The government can exclude a speaker from a traditional public forum only
when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and
is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest. Cornelius, supra, at 800.
Designated public fora are created by purposeful governmental action
opening a nontraditional public forum for expressive use by the general
public or by a particular class of speakers. E. g., International Soc.
for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678 (ISKCON).
If the government excludes a speaker who falls within the class to which
such a forum is made generally available, its action is subject to strict
scrutiny. E. g., Cornelius, supra, at 802. Property that is not a traditional public forum or a designated public forum is either a nonpublic
forum or not a forum at all. ISKCON, supra, at 678-679. Access to a
nonpublic forum can be restricted if the restrictions are reasonable and
are not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials
oppose the speaker's views. Cornelius, supra, at 800. Pp. 677-678.

(c) The AETC debate was a nonpublic forum. The parties agree
that it was not a traditional public forum, and it was not a designated
public forum under this Court's precedents. Those cases demonstrate,
inter alia, that the government does not create a designated public
forum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to a
forum to a particular class of speakers, whose members must then, as
individuals, "obtain permission," Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 804, to use it.
Contrary to the Eighth Circuit's assertion, AETC did not make its debate generally available to candidates for the congressional seat at issue.
Instead, it reserved eligibility for participation to candidates for that
seat (as opposed to some other seat), and then made candidate-bycandidate determinations as to which of the eligible candidates would
participate in the debate. Such "selective access," unsupported by evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not create a public

forum, but indicates that the debate was a nonpublic forum. Id., at
805. Pp. 678-682.

(d) AETC's decision to exclude Forbes was a reasonable, viewpointneutral exercise of journalistic discretion consistent with the First
Amendment. The record demonstrates beyond dispute that Forbes
was excluded not because of his viewpoint, but because he had not generated appreciable public interest. There is no serious argument that
AETC did not act in good faith in this case. Pp. 682-683.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
A state-owned public television broadcaster sponsored acandidate debate from which it excluded an independent candidate with little popular support. The issue before us iswhether, by reason of its state ownership, the station had a
constitutional obligation to allow every candidate access tothe debate. We conclude that, unlike most other public television programs, the candidate debate was subject to consti-tutional constraints applicable to nonpublic fora under our
forum precedents. Even so, the broadcaster's decision toexclude the candidate was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral
exercise of journalistic discretion.

ing positions. Ark. Code Ann. $ 6-3-102(a)(3) (Supp. 1997).To insulate its programming decisions from political pressure, AETC employs an executive director and professionalstaff who exercise broad editorial discretion in planning the
network's programming. AETC has also adopted the Statement of Principles of Editorial Integrity in Public Broadcast-ing, which counsel adherence to "generally accepted broadcasting industry standards, so that the programming serviceis free from pressure from political or financial supporters."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a.In the spring of 1992, AETC staff began planning a series
of debates between candidates for federal office in the November 1992 elections. AETC decided to televise a total
of five debates, scheduling one for the Senate election and
one for each of the four congressional elections in Arkansas.
Working in close consultation with Bill Simmons, Arkansas
Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, AETC staff developed a debate format allowing about 53 minutes during each
1-hour debate for questions to and answers by the candidates. Given the time constraint, the staff and Simmons
"decided to limit participation in the debates to the major
party candidates or any other candidate who had strong
popular support." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5.

On June 17, 1992, AETC invited the Republican and Democratic candidates for Arkansas' Third Congressional District to participate in the AETC debate for that seat. Two
months later, after obtaining the 2,000 signatures required
by Arkansas law, see Ark. Code Ann. $ 7-7-103(c)(1) (Supp.
1993), respondent Ralph Forbes was certified as an independent candidate qualified to appear on the ballot for the seat.
Forbes was a perennial candidate who had sought, without
success, a number of elected offices in Arkansas. On August
24, 1992, he wrote to AETC requesting permission to participate in the debate for his district, scheduled for October
22, 1992. On September 4, AETC Executive Director Susan
Howarth denied Forbes' request, explaining that AETC had

Opinion of the Court
"made a bona fide journalistic judgement that our viewerswould best be served by limiting the debate" to the candidates already invited. App. 61.On October 19, 1992, Forbes filed suit against AETC, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages.
Forbes claimed he was entitled to participate in the debateunder both the First Amendment and 47 U. S. C. $ 315, which

affords political candidates a limited right of access to tele-vision air time. Forbes requested a preliminary injunction
mandating his inclusion in the debate. The District Courtdenied the request, as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The District Court later dismissed Forbes' action for failure to state a claim.

Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Forbes' statutory claim, holding that he had failed
to exhaust his administrative remedies. The court reversed, however, the dismissal of Forbes' First Amendment
claim. Observing that AETC is a state actor, the court held
Forbes had "a qualified right of access created by AETN's
sponsorship of a debate, and that AETN must have [had] a
legitimate reason to exclude him strong enough to survive
First Amendment scrutiny." Forbes v. Arkansas Ed. Television Network Foundation, 22 F. 3d 1423, 1428 (CA8), cert.
denied, 513 U. S. 995 (1994), 514 U. S. 1110 (1995). Because
AETC had not yet filed an answer to Forbes' complaint, it
had not given any reason for excluding him from the debate,
and the Court of Appeals remanded the action for further
proceedings.

On remand, the District Court found as a matter of law
that the debate was a nonpublic forum, and the issue became
whether Forbes' views were the reason for his exclusion.
At trial, AETC professional staff testified Forbes was excluded because he lacked any campaign organization, had not
generated appreciable voter support, and was not regarded
as a serious candidate by the press covering the election.
The jury made express findings that AETC's decision to ex523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
clude Forbes had not been influenced by political pressureor disagreement with his views. The District Court entered

judgment for AETC.The Court of Appeals again reversed. The court acknowledged that AETC's decision to exclude Forbes "wasmade in good faith" and was "exactly the kind of journalistic
judgment routinely made by newspeople." 93 F. 3d 497, 505(CA8 1996). The court asserted, nevertheless, that AETC
had "opened its facilities to a particular group--candidatesrunning for the Third District Congressional seat."

Id.,at 504. AETC's action, the court held, made the debate a

public forum, to which all candidates "legally qualified to ap-pear on the ballot" had a presumptive right of access.

Ibid.Applying strict scrutiny, the court determined that AETC's

assessment of Forbes' "political viability" was neither a"compelling nor [a] narrowly tailored" reason for excluding
him from the debate. Id., at 504-505.A conflict with the decision of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Chandler v. Georgia
Public Telecommunications Comm'n, 917 F. 2d 486 (1990),cert. denied, 502 U. S. 816 (1991), together with the manifest

importance of the case, led us to grant certiorari. 520 U. S.1114 (1997). We now reverse.

II
Forbes has long since abandoned his statutory claimsunder 47 U. S. C. $ 315, and so the issue is whether his exclusion from the debate was consistent with the First Amend-ment. The Court of Appeals held it was not, applying our
public forum precedents. Appearing as amicus curiae insupport of petitioner, the United States argues that our
forum precedents should be of little relevance in the contextof television broadcasting. At the outset, then, it is instructive to ask whether public forum principles apply to the caseat all.

Having first arisen in the context of streets and parks, thepublic forum doctrine should not be extended in a mechanical

523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
way to the very different context of public television broad-casting. In the case of streets and parks, the open access

and viewpoint neutrality commanded by the doctrine is"compatible with the intended purpose of the property."
Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 49 (1983). So too was the requirement of viewpoint neu-trality compatible with the university's funding of student

publications in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). In the case of television broadcasting, however, broad rights of access for outside speakerswould be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that

stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill theirjournalistic purpose and statutory obligations.

Congress has rejected the argument that "broadcast facilities should be open on a nonselective basis to all personswishing to talk about public issues."

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412U. S. 94, 105 (1973). Instead, television broadcasters enjoy

the "widest journalistic freedom" consistent with their publicresponsibilities.

Id., at 110; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 378 (1984). Among the broadcast-er's responsibilities is the duty to schedule programming

that serves the "public interest, convenience, and necessity."
47 U. S. C. $ 309(a). Public and private broadcasters alike
are not only permitted, but indeed required, to exercise substantial editorial discretion in the selection and presentation
of their programming.

As a general rule, the nature of editorial discretion counsels against subjecting broadcasters to claims of viewpoint
discrimination. Programming decisions would be particularly vulnerable to claims of this type because even principled exclusions rooted in sound journalistic judgment can
often be characterized as viewpoint based. To comply with
their obligation to air programming that serves the public
interest, broadcasters must often choose among speakers
expressing different viewpoints. "That editors--newspaper
or broadcast--can and do abuse this power is beyond doubt,"

Opinion of the Court
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 412 U. S., at 124; but"[c]alculated risks of abuse are taken in order to preserve

higher values." Id., at 125. Much like a university select-ing a commencement speaker, a public institution selecting
speakers for a lecture series, or a public school prescribing
its curriculum, a broadcaster by its nature will facilitatethe expression of some viewpoints instead of others. Were

the judiciary to require, and so to define and approve, pre-established criteria for access, it would risk implicating
the courts in judgments that should be left to the exerciseof journalistic discretion.

When a public broadcaster exercises editorial discretion in
the selection and presentation of its programming, it engages
in speech activity. Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 636 (1994) ("Through `original programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire,' cable programmers and operators `see[k] to communicate messages on
a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats' ")
(quoting Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc.,
476 U. S. 488, 494 (1986)). Although programming decisions
often involve the compilation of the speech of third parties,
the decisions nonetheless constitute communicative acts.
See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 570 (1995) (a speaker
need not "generate, as an original matter, each item featured
in the communication").

Claims of access under our public forum precedents could
obstruct the legitimate purposes of television broadcasters.
Were the doctrine given sweeping application in this context,
courts "would be required to oversee far more of the day-today operations of broadcasters' conduct, deciding such questions as whether a particular individual or group has had
sufficient opportunity to present its viewpoint and whether
a particular viewpoint has already been sufficiently aired."
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra, at 127. "The

Opinion of the Court
result would be a further erosion of the journalistic discre-tion of broadcasters," transferring "control over the treatment of public issues from the licensees who are accountablefor broadcast performance to private individuals" who bring
suit under our forum precedents. 412 U. S., at 124. In effect, we would "exchange `public trustee' broadcasting, withall its limitations, for a system of self-appointed editorial

commentators." Id., at 125.In the absence of any congressional command to "[r]egimen[t] broadcasters" in this manner, id., at 127, we are disin-clined to do so through doctrines of our own design. This
is not to say the First Amendment would bar the legislative
imposition of neutral rules for access to public broadcasting.
Instead, we say that, in most cases, the First Amendment of
its own force does not compel public broadcasters to allow
third parties access to their programming.

Although public broadcasting as a general matter does
not lend itself to scrutiny under the forum doctrine, candidate debates present the narrow exception to the rule. For
two reasons, a candidate debate like the one at issue here
is different from other programming. First, unlike AETC's
other broadcasts, the debate was by design a forum for political speech by the candidates. Consistent with the long tradition of candidate debates, the implicit representation of
the broadcaster was that the views expressed were those
of the candidates, not its own. The very purpose of the debate was to allow the candidates to express their views with
minimal intrusion by the broadcaster. In this respect the
debate differed even from a political talk show, whose host
can express partisan views and then limit the discussion to
those ideas.

Second, in our tradition, candidate debates are of exceptional significance in the electoral process. "[I]t is of particular importance that candidates have the . . . opportunity
to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their

positions on vital public issues before choosing among themon election day." CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 U. S. 367, 396 (1981)

(internal quotation marks omitted). Deliberation on thepositions and qualifications of candidates is integral to our
system of government, and electoral speech may have itsmost profound and widespread impact when it is disseminated through televised debates. A majority of the popu-lation cites television as its primary source of election information, and debates are regarded as the "only occasionduring a campaign when the attention of a large portion of
the American public is focused on the election, as well asthe only campaign information format which potentially
offers sufficient time to explore issues and policies in depthin a neutral forum." Congressional Research Service, Campaign Debates in Presidential General Elections, summ.(June 15, 1993).

As we later discuss, in many cases it is not feasible forthe broadcaster to allow unlimited access to a candidate debate. Yet the requirement of neutrality remains; a broad-caster cannot grant or deny access to a candidate debate
on the basis of whether it agrees with a candidate's views.Viewpoint discrimination in this context would present not
a "[c]alculated ris[k]," Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,
supra, at 125, but an inevitability of skewing the electoraldialogue.

The special characteristics of candidate debates supportthe conclusion that the AETC debate was a forum of some
type. The question of what type must be answered by ref-erence to our public forum precedents, to which we now turn.

III
Forbes argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that thedebate was a public forum to which he had a First Amendment right of access. Under our precedents, however, thedebate was a nonpublic forum, from which AETC could exclude Forbes in the reasonable, viewpoint-neutral exerciseof its journalistic discretion.

Opinion of the Court

A
For our purposes, it will suffice to employ the catego-ries of speech fora already established and discussed in our

cases. "[T]he Court [has] identified three types of fora: thetraditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum." Corneliusv.

NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,802 (1985). Traditional public fora are defined by the objective characteristics of the property, such as whether, "bylong tradition or by government fiat," the property has been
"devoted to assembly and debate." Perry Ed. Assn., 460U. S.

, at 45. The government can exclude a speaker froma traditional public forum "only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclu-sion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest." Cornelius,
supra, at 800.Designated public fora, in contrast, are created by purposeful governmental action. "The government does notcreate a [designated] public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening anontraditional public forum for public discourse." 473 U. S.,
at 802; accord, International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678 (1992) (ISKCON) (desig-nated public forum is "property that the State has opened

for expressive activity by part or all of the public"). Hence"the Court has looked to the policy and practice of the
government to ascertain whether it intended to designatea place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a
public forum." Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 802. If the gov-ernment excludes a speaker who falls within the class to
which a designated public forum is made generally available,its action is subject to strict scrutiny. Ibid.; United States
v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 726-727 (1990) (plurality opinionof

O'Connor, J.).Other government properties are either nonpublic fora

or not fora at all. ISKCON, supra, at 678-679. The gov-ernment can restrict access to a nonpublic forum "as long

678 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBES

Opinion of the Court
as the restrictions are reasonable and [are] not an effort tosuppress expression merely because public officials oppose

the speaker's view." Cornelius, supra, at 800 (internal quo-tation marks omitted).

In summary, traditional public fora are open for expressiveactivity regardless of the government's intent. The objective characteristics of these properties require the govern-ment to accommodate private speakers. The government
is free to open additional properties for expressive use bythe general public or by a particular class of speakers,
thereby creating designated public fora. Where the prop-erty is not a traditional public forum and the government
has not chosen to create a designated public forum, the prop-erty is either a nonpublic forum or not a forum at all.

B
The parties agree the AETC debate was not a traditionalpublic forum. The Court has rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic con-fines, see ISKCON, 505 U. S., at 680-681; and even had a
more expansive conception of traditional public fora beenadopted, see, e. g., id., at 698-699 (

Kennedy, J., concurringin judgments), the almost unfettered access of a traditional

public forum would be incompatible with the programmingdictates a television broadcaster must follow. See supra, at
673-675. The issue, then, is whether the debate was a des-ignated public forum or a nonpublic forum.

Under our precedents, the AETC debate was not a desig-nated public forum. To create a forum of this type, the government must intend to make the property "generally avail-able,"

Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 264 (1981), to a classof speakers. Accord, Cornelius, supra, at 802. In Widmar,

for example, a state university created a public forum forregistered student groups by implementing a policy that expressly made its meeting facilities "generally open" to suchgroups. 454 U. S., at 267; accord, Perry, supra, at 45 (desig523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

679Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
nated public forum is "generally open"). A designated pub-lic forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general accessfor a class of speakers. In

Perry, for example, the Court
held a school district's internal mail system was not a designated public forum even though selected speakers were ableto gain access to it. The basis for the holding in

Perry was
explained by the Court in Cornelius:

"In contrast to the general access policy in Widmar,school board policy did not grant general access to the

school mail system. The practice was to require permission from the individual school principal before ac-cess to the system to communicate with teachers was

granted." 473 U. S., at 803.
And in Cornelius itself, the Court held the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) charity drive was not a designatedpublic forum because "[t]he Government's consistent policy

ha[d] been to limit participation in the CFC to `appropriate'[

i. e., charitable rather than political] voluntary agencies and
to require agencies seeking admission to obtain permissionfrom federal and local Campaign officials."

Id., at 804.
These cases illustrate the distinction between "generalaccess,"

id., at 803, which indicates the property is a designated public forum, and "selective access," id., at 805,
which indicates the property is a nonpublic forum. On onehand, the government creates a designated public forum

when it makes its property generally available to a certainclass of speakers, as the university made its facilities generally available to student groups in Widmar. On the other
hand, the government does not create a designated public
forum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers, whose
members must then, as individuals, "obtain permission," 473
U. S., at 804, to use it. For instance, the Federal Government did not create a designated public forum in Cornelius

523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
680 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBES

Opinion of the Court
when it reserved eligibility for participation in the CFCdrive to charitable agencies, and then made individual, nonministerial judgments as to which of the eligible agencieswould participate.

Ibid.
The Cornelius distinction between general and selective
access furthers First Amendment interests. By recognizingthe distinction, we encourage the government to open its

property to some expressive activity in cases where, if facedwith an all-or-nothing choice, it might not open the property
at all. That this distinction turns on governmental intentdoes not render it unprotective of speech. Rather, it reflects
the reality that, with the exception of traditional public fora,
the government retains the choice of whether to designate
its property as a forum for specified classes of speakers.

Here, the debate did not have an open-microphone format.
Contrary to the assertion of the Court of Appeals, AETC
did not make its debate generally available to candidates for
Arkansas' Third Congressional District seat. Instead, just
as the Federal Government in Cornelius reserved eligibility
for participation in the CFC program to certain classes of
voluntary agencies, AETC reserved eligibility for participation in the debate to candidates for the Third Congressional
District seat (as opposed to some other seat). At that point,
just as the Government in Cornelius made agency-by-agency
determinations as to which of the eligible agencies would
participate in the CFC, AETC made candidate-by-candidate
determinations as to which of the eligible candidates would
participate in the debate. "Such selective access, unsupported by evidence of a purposeful designation for public use,
does not create a public forum." Id., at 805. Thus the debate was a nonpublic forum.

In addition to being a misapplication of our precedents, the
Court of Appeals' holding would result in less speech, not
more. In ruling that the debate was a public forum open to
all ballot-qualified candidates, 93 F. 3d, at 504, the Court of
Appeals would place a severe burden upon public broadcast523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

681Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ers who air candidates' views. In each of the 1988, 1992,
and 1996 Presidential elections, for example, no fewer than
19 candidates appeared on the ballot in at least one State.
See Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Presidential Debates, Let America Decide 148 (1995); Federal Election Commission, Federal Elections 92, p. 9 (1993); Federal Election
Commission, Federal Elections 96, p. 11 (1997). In the 1996
congressional elections, it was common for 6 to 11 candidates
to qualify for the ballot for a particular seat. See 1996 Election Results, 54 Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report
3250-3257 (1996). In the 1993 New Jersey gubernatorial
election, to illustrate further, sample ballot mailings included
the written statements of 19 candidates. See N. Y. Times,
Sept. 11, 1993, section 1, p. 26, col. 5. On logistical grounds
alone, a public television editor might, with reason, decide
that the inclusion of all ballot-qualified candidates would
"actually undermine the educational value and quality of
debates." Let America Decide, supra, at 148.

Were it faced with the prospect of cacophony, on the one
hand, and First Amendment liability, on the other, a public
television broadcaster might choose not to air candidates'
views at all. A broadcaster might decide " `the safe course
is to avoid controversy,' . . . and by so doing diminish the
free flow of information and ideas." Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc., 512 U. S., at 656 (quoting Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 257 (1974)). In this
circumstance, a "[g]overnment-enforced right of access inescapably `dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public
debate.' " Ibid. (quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254, 279 (1964)).

These concerns are more than speculative. As a direct
result of the Court of Appeals' decision in this case, the
Nebraska Educational Television Network canceled a scheduled debate between candidates in Nebraska's 1996 United
States Senate race. See Lincoln Journal Star, Aug. 24, 1996,

p. 1A, col. 6. A First Amendment jurisprudence yieldingthese results does not promote speech but represses it.

C
The debate's status as a nonpublic forum, however, didnot give AETC unfettered power to exclude any candidate

it wished. As Justice O'Connor has observed, nonpublicforum status "does not mean that the government can restrict speech in whatever way it likes." ISKCON, 505 U. S.,at 687. To be consistent with the First Amendment, the
exclusion of a speaker from a nonpublic forum must not bebased on the speaker's viewpoint and must otherwise be reasonable in light of the purpose of the property. Cornelius,473 U. S., at 800.

In this case, the jury found Forbes' exclusion was notbased on "objections or opposition to his views." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 23a. The record provides ample support forthis finding, demonstrating as well that AETC's decision to
exclude him was reasonable. AETC Executive DirectorSusan Howarth testified Forbes' views had "absolutely" no
role in the decision to exclude him from the debate. App.142. She further testified Forbes was excluded because
(1) "the Arkansas voters did not consider him a serious can-didate"; (2) "the news organizations also did not consider him
a serious candidate"; (3) "the Associated Press and a nationalelection result reporting service did not plan to run his name
in results on election night"; (4) Forbes "apparently hadlittle, if any, financial support, failing to report campaign
finances to the Secretary of State's office or to the FederalElection Commission"; and (5) "there [was] no `Forbes for
Congress' campaign headquarters other than his house."Id., at 126-127. Forbes himself described his campaign
organization as "bedlam" and the media coverage of his cam-paign as "zilch." Id., at 91, 96. It is, in short, beyond dispute that Forbes was excluded not because of his viewpointbut because he had generated no appreciable public interest.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Cf. Perry, 460 U. S., at 49 (exclusion from nonpublic forum"based on the

status" rather than the views of the speaker
is permissible (emphasis in original)).There is no substance to Forbes' suggestion that he was

excluded because his views were unpopular or out of the
mainstream. His own objective lack of support, not hisplatform, was the criterion. Indeed, the very premise of

Forbes' contention is mistaken. A candidate with uncon-ventional views might well enjoy broad support by virtue of
a compelling personality or an exemplary campaign organi-zation. By the same token, a candidate with a traditional
platform might enjoy little support due to an inept campaignor any number of other reasons.

Nor did AETC exclude Forbes in an attempted manipulation of the political process. The evidence provided pow-erful support for the jury's express finding that AETC's exclusion of Forbes was not the result of "political pressurefrom anyone inside or outside [AETC]." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 22a. There is no serious argument that AETC did notact in good faith in this case. AETC excluded Forbes because the voters lacked interest in his candidacy, not becauseAETC itself did.

The broadcaster's decision to exclude Forbes was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral exercise of journalistic discretion
consistent with the First Amendment. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is Reversed.

Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court has decided that a state-owned television network has no "constitutional obligation to allow every candidate access to" political debates that it sponsors. Ante, at
669. I do not challenge that decision. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals should nevertheless be affirmed. The official action that led to the exclusion of respondent Forbes

Stevens, J., dissenting
from a debate with the two major-party candidates for elec-tion to one of Arkansas' four seats in Congress does not adhere to well-settled constitutional principles. The ad hocdecision of the staff of the Arkansas Educational Television
Commission (AETC) raises precisely the concerns addressed
by "the many decisions of this Court over the last 30 years,holding that a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, withoutnarrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional." Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147, 150-151 (1969).

In its discussion of the facts, the Court barely mentionsthe standardless character of the decision to exclude Forbes

from the debate. In its discussion of the law, the Court understates the constitutional importance of the distinction be-tween state ownership and private ownership of broadcast

facilities. I shall therefore first add a few words about therecord in this case and the history of regulation of the broadcast media, before explaining why I believe the judgmentshould be affirmed.

I
Two months before Forbes was officially certified as an
independent candidate qualified to appear on the ballot underArkansas law,

1 the AETC staff had already concluded that he

"should not be invited" to participate in the televised debatesbecause he was "not a serious candidate as determined by

the voters of Arkansas." 2 He had, however, been a seriouscontender for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant
Governor in 1986 and again in 1990. Although he was de-feated in a runoff election, in the three-way primary race
conducted in 1990--just two years before the AETC staffdecision--he had received 46.88% of the statewide vote and

had carried 15 of the 16 counties within the Third Congres-sional District by absolute majorities. Nevertheless, the

staff concluded that Forbes did not have "strong popularsupport." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5.

3

Given the fact that the Republican winner in the ThirdCongressional District race in 1992 received only 50.22% of

the vote and the Democrat received 47.20%,4 it would havebeen necessary for Forbes, who had made a strong showing
in recent Republican primaries, to divert only a handful ofvotes from the Republican candidate to cause his defeat.
Thus, even though the AETC staff may have correctly con-cluded that Forbes was "not a serious candidate," their decision to exclude him from the debate may have determinedthe outcome of the election in the Third District.

If a comparable decision were made today by a privatelyowned network, it would be subject to scrutiny under the
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 5 unless the net-work used "pre-established objective criteria to determine
which candidates may participate in [the] debate." 11 CFR$ 110.13(c) (1997). No such criteria governed AETC's refusal to permit Forbes to participate in the debate. Indeed,whether that refusal was based on a judgment about "newsworthiness"--as AETC has argued in this Court--or a judg-ment about "political viability"--as it argued in the Court
of Appeals--the facts in the record presumably would have

3 Simmons, a journalist working with the AETC staff on the debates,
stated that "[a]t the time this decision [to invite only candidates with
strong popular support] was made . . . , there were no third party or
non-party candidates to evaluate as to the likely extent of their popular
support." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5. Presumably Simmons
meant that there was no other ballot-qualified candidate, because an
AETC staff member, Amy Oliver, represented that there was consideration about whether to invite Forbes before he qualified as a candidate.

provided an adequate basis either for a decision to includeForbes in the Third District debate or a decision to exclude

him, and might even have required a cancellation of two ofthe other debates.

The apparent flexibility of AETC's purported standardsuggests the extent to which the staff had nearly limitless

discretion to exclude Forbes from the debate based on ad hocjustifications. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the staff 's appraisal of "political viability" was"so subjective, so arguable, so susceptible of variation in
individual opinion, as to provide no secure basis for theexercise of governmental power consistent with the First
Amendment." Forbes v. Arkansas Educational Television
Communication Network Foundation, 93 F. 3d 497, 505(CA8 1996).

AETC is a state agency whose actions "are fairly attribut-able to the State and subject to the Fourteenth Amendment,

unlike the actions of privately owned broadcast licensees."Forbes v. Arkansas Educational Television Communication

6 Although the contest between the major-party candidates in the Third
District was a relatively close one, in two of the other three districts
in which both major-party candidates had been invited to debate, it was
clear that one of them had virtually no chance of winning the election.
Democrat Blanche Lambert's resounding victory over Republican Terry
Hayes in the First Congressional District illustrates this point: Lambert
received 69.8% of the vote compared with Hays' 30.2%. R. Scammon &
A. McGillivray, America Votes 20: A Handbook of Contemporary American
Election Statistics 99 (1993). Similarly, in the Second District, Democrat
Ray Thornton, the incumbent, defeated Republican Dennis Scott and won
with 74.2% of the vote. Ibid. Note that Scott raised only $6,000, which
was less than Forbes raised; nevertheless, Scott was invited to participate
in a debate while Forbes was not. See App. 133-134, 175.

were employees of government." 93 F. 3d, at 505. TheCourt implicitly acknowledges these facts by subjecting the

decision to exclude Forbes to constitutional analysis. Yetthe Court seriously underestimates the importance of the
difference between private and public ownership of broad-cast facilities, despite the fact that Congress and this Court
have repeatedly recognized that difference.In

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. DemocraticNational Committee, 412 U. S. 94 (1973), the Court held that

a licensee is neither a common carrier, id., at 107-109, nor apublic forum that must accommodate " `the right of every
individual to speak, write, or publish,' " id., at 101 (quoting
Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 388 (1969)).Speaking for a plurality, Chief Justice Burger expressed

the opinion that the First Amendment imposes no con-straint on the private network's journalistic freedom. He
supported that view by noting that when Congress con-fronted the advent of radio in the 1920's, it "was faced with
a fundamental choice between total Government ownershipand control of the new medium--the choice of most other
countries--or some other alternative." 412 U. S., at 116.7

7 Interestingly, many countries that formerly relied upon state control
of broadcast entities appear to be moving in the direction of deregulation and private ownership of such entities. See, e. g., Bughin & Griekspoor, A New Era for European TV, 3 McKinsey Q. 90, 92-93 (1997)
("Most of Western Europe's public television broadcasters began to lose
their grip on the market in the mid-1980s. Only Switzerland, Austria, and
Ireland continue to operate state television monopolies . . . . In Europe as
a whole (including Eastern Europe, where television remains largely state
controlled), the number of private broadcasters holding market-leading
positions nearly doubled in the first half of this decade"); Rohwedder,

Congress chose a system of private broadcasters licensedand regulated by the Government, partly because of our traditional respect for private enterprise, but more importantlybecause public ownership created unacceptable risks of governmental censorship and use of the media for propaganda."Congress appears to have concluded . . . that of these two
choices--private or official censorship--Government cen-sorship would be the most pervasive, the most self-serving,
the most difficult to restrain and hence the one most to beavoided."

Id., at 105.8While noncommercial, educational stations generally have

exercised the same journalistic independence as commercialnetworks, in 1981 Congress enacted a statute forbidding
stations that received a federal subsidy to engage in "edi-torializing."

9 Relying primarily on cases involving the

rights of commercial entities, a bare majority of this Courtheld the restriction invalid.

FCC v. League of Women Vot-ers of Cal., 468 U. S. 364 (1984). Responding to the dissenting view that "the interest in keeping the Federal Govern-ment out of the propaganda arena" justified the restriction,
id., at 415 (opinion of Stevens, J.), the majority emphasizedthe broad coverage of the statute and concluded that it
"impermissibly sweeps within its prohibition a wide range
last ten years, in Germany and many other European countries, public
broadcasting has been weakened by competition from private television
channels").

8 The Court considered then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's

statement to a House committee expressing concern about government
involvement in broadcasting:

" `We can not allow any single person or group to place themselves in
[a] position where they can censor the material which shall be broadcasted
to the public, nor do I believe that the Government should ever be placed
in the position of censoring this material.' " 412 U. S., at 104 (quoting

of speech by wholly private stations on topics that . . . havenothing whatever to do with federal, state, or local government." Id., at 395. The Court noted that Congress hadconsidered and rejected a ban that would have applied only
to stations operated by state or local governmental entities,and reserved decision on the constitutionality of such a limited ban. See id., at 394, n. 24.The

League of Women Voters case implicated the rightof "wholly private stations" to express their own views on

a wide range of topics that "have nothing whatever to dowith . . . government." Id., at 395. The case before us
today involves only the right of a state-owned network toregulate speech that plays a central role in democratic government. Because AETC is owned by the State, deferenceto its interest in making ad hoc decisions about the political
content of its programs necessarily increases the risk of gov-ernment censorship and propaganda in a way that protection
of privately owned broadcasters does not.

III
The Court recognizes that the debates sponsored byAETC were "by design a forum for political speech by the

candidates." Ante, at 675. The Court also acknowledgesthe central importance of candidate debates in the electoral
process. See ibid. Thus, there is no need to review ourcases expounding on the public forum doctrine to conclude
that the First Amendment will not tolerate a state agency'sarbitrary exclusion from a debate forum based, for example,
on an expectation that the speaker might be critical of theGovernor, or might hold unpopular views about abortion or
the death penalty. Indeed, the Court so holds today.10

10 The Court correctly rejects the extreme position that the First
Amendment simply has no application to a candidate's claim that he or
she should be permitted to participate in a televised debate. See Brief
for FCC et al. as Amici Curiae 14 ("The First Amendment does not constrain the editorial choices of state-entity public broadcasters licensed

It seems equally clear, however, that the First Amend-ment will not tolerate arbitrary definitions of the scope of

the forum. We have recognized that "[o]nce it has openeda limited forum, . . . the State must respect the lawful
boundaries it has itself set." Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). It fol-lows, of course, that a State's failure to set any meaningful

boundaries at all cannot insulate the State's action fromFirst Amendment challenge. The dispositive issue in this
case, then, is not whether AETC created a designated publicforum or a nonpublic forum, as the Court concludes, but
whether AETC defined the contours of the debate forum
with sufficient specificity to justify the exclusion of a ballot-qualified candidate.

AETC asks that we reject Forbes' constitutional claim onthe basis of entirely subjective, ad hoc judgments about the
dimensions of its forum.11 The First Amendment demandsmore, however, when a state government effectively wields
the power to eliminate a political candidate from all consid-eration by the voters. All stations must act as editors, see
ante, at 673, and when state-owned stations participate inthe broadcasting arena, their editorial decisions may impact the constitutional interests of individual speakers.12 Astate-owned broadcaster need not plan, sponsor, and conduct
political debates, however. When it chooses to do so, theFirst Amendment imposes important limitations on its control over access to the debate forum.AETC's control was comparable to that of a local government official authorized to issue permits to use public
facilities for expressive activities. In cases concerning acto operate under the Communications Act"); see also Brief for State of
California et al. as Amici Curiae 4 ("In its role as speaker, rather than
mere forum provider, the state actor is not restricted by speaker-inclusive
and viewpoint-neutral rules").

cess to a traditional public forum, we have found an analogybetween the power to issue permits and the censorial power

to impose a prior restraint on speech. Thus, in our reviewof an ordinance requiring a permit to participate in a parade
on city streets, we explained that the ordinance, as written,"fell squarely within the ambit of the many decisions of this
Court over the last 30 years, holding that a law subjectingthe exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definitestandards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional." Shuttlesworth, 394 U. S., at 150-151.We recently reaffirmed this approach when considering
the constitutionality of an assembly and parade ordinancethat authorized a county official to exercise discretion in setting the amount of the permit fee. In Forsyth County v.Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123 (1992), relying on Shuttlesworth and similar cases,13 we described the breadth ofthe administrator's discretion thusly:

"There are no articulated standards either in the or-dinance or in the county's established practice. The
administrator is not required to rely on any objectivefactors. He need not provide any explanation for his
decision, and that decision is unreviewable. Nothing inthe law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discouraging others throughthe arbitrary application of fees. The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretionin a government official." 505 U. S., at 133 (footnotes
omitted).
13 After citing Shuttlesworth, we explained: "The reasoning is simple:
If the permit scheme `involves appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion,' Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.
296, 305 (1940), by the licensing authority, `the danger of censorship and
of abridgment of our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great'
to be permitted, Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546,
553 (1975)." 505 U. S., at 131.

692 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBES

Stevens, J., dissenting
Perhaps the discretion of the AETC staff in controllingaccess to the 1992 candidate debates was not quite as unbridled as that of the Forsyth County administrator. Never-theless, it was surely broad enough to raise the concerns that
controlled our decision in that case. No written criteriacabined the discretion of the AETC staff. Their subjective
judgment about a candidate's "viability" or "newsworthi-ness" allowed them wide latitude either to permit or to exclude a third participant in any debate.14 Moreover, in exercising that judgment they were free to rely on factors thatarguably should favor inclusion as justifications for exclusion.

Thus, the fact that Forbes had little financial support wasconsidered as evidence of his lack of viability when that factor might have provided an independent reason for allowinghim to share a free forum with wealthier candidates.

15

The televised debate forum at issue in this case may notsquarely fit within our public forum analysis,

16 but its importance cannot be denied. Given the special character of political speech, particularly during campaigns for elected office,

14 It is particularly troubling that AETC excluded the only independent candidate but invited all the major-party candidates to participate
in the planned debates, regardless of their chances of electoral success.
See n. 6, supra. As this Court has recognized, "political figures outside
the two major parties have been fertile sources of new ideas and new
programs; many of their challenges to the status quo have in time made
their way into the political mainstream." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460
U. S. 780, 794 (1983) (citing Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers
Party, 440 U. S. 173, 186 (1979)).

15 Lack of substantial financial support apparently was not a factor in

the decision to invite a major-party candidate with even less financial support than Forbes. See n. 6, supra.

16 Indeed, a plurality of the Court recently has expressed reluctance

about applying public forum analysis to new and changing contexts. See
Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518
U. S. 727, 741, 749 (1996) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t is not at all clear that
the public forum doctrine should be imported wholesale into the area
of common carriage regulation").

the debate forum implicates constitutional concerns of thehighest order, as the majority acknowledges. Ante, at 675.

Indeed, the planning and management of political debates bystate-owned broadcasters raise serious constitutional concerns that are seldom replicated when state-owned televisionnetworks engage in other types of programming.

17 We have

recognized that "speech concerning public affairs is . . . theessence of self-government."

Garrison v. Louisiana, 379U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964). The First Amendment therefore "has

its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the con-duct of campaigns for political office."

Monitor Patriot Co.
v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971). Surely the Constitutiondemands at least as much from the government when it takes

action that necessarily impacts democratic elections as when
local officials issue parade permits.The reasons that support the need for narrow, objective,

and definite standards to guide licensing decisions applydirectly to the wholly subjective access decisions made by
the staff of AETC.18 The importance of avoiding arbitrary

17 The Court observes that "in most cases, the First Amendment of its
own force does not compel public broadcasters to allow third parties access
to their programming." Ante, at 675. A rule, such as the one promulgated by the Federal Election Commission, that requires the use of preestablished, objective criteria to identify the candidates who may participate leaves all other programming decisions unaffected. This is not to
say that all other programming decisions made by state-owned television
networks are immune from attack on constitutional grounds. As long
as the State is not itself a "speaker," its decisions, like employment decisions by state agencies and unlike decisions by private actors, must respect the commands of the First Amendment. It is decades of settled
jurisprudence that require judicial review of state action that is challenged on First Amendment grounds. See, e. g., Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U. S. 263 (1981); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,
515 U. S. 819 (1995).

18 Ironically, it is the standardless character of the decision to exclude

Forbes that provides the basis for the Court's conclusion that the debates
were a nonpublic forum rather than a limited public forum. The Court

Stevens, J., dissenting
or viewpoint-based exclusions from political debates mili-tates strongly in favor of requiring the controlling state

agency to use (and adhere to) preestablished, objective crite-ria to determine who among qualified candidates may participate. When the demand for speaking facilities exceeds sup-ply, the State must "ration or allocate the scarce resources
on some acceptable neutral principle." Rosenberger, 515U. S., at 835. A constitutional duty to use objective standards--i. e., "neutral principles"--for determining whether andwhen to adjust a debate format would impose only a modest
requirement that would fall far short of a duty to grant everymultiple-party request.

19 Such standards would also have

the benefit of providing the public with some assurance thatstate-owned broadcasters cannot select debate participants

on arbitrary grounds.20Like the Court, I do not endorse the view of the Court
of Appeals that all candidates who qualify for a position onthe ballot are necessarily entitled to access to any statesponsored debate. I am convinced, however, that the con-stitutional imperatives that motivated our decisions in cases
like Shuttlesworth command that access to political debates
explains that "[a] designated public forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers." Ante, at 679. If, as AETC claims, it
did invite either the entire class of "viable" candidates, or the entire class
of "newsworthy" candidates, under the Court's reasoning, it created a
designated public forum.

19 The Court expresses concern that as a direct result of the Court of

Appeals' holding that all ballot-qualified candidates have a right to participate in every debate, a state-owned network canceled a 1996 Nebraska
debate. Ante, at 681. If the Nebraska station had realized that it could
have satisfied its First Amendment obligations simply by setting out participation standards before the debate, however, it seems quite unlikely
that it would have chosen instead to cancel the debate.

20 The fact that AETC and other state-owned networks have adopted

policy statements emphasizing the importance of shielding programming
decisions from political influence, see ante, at 670, confirms the significance
of the risk that would be minimized by the adoption of objective criteria.

planned and managed by state-owned entities be governedby preestablished, objective criteria. Requiring government

employees to set out objective criteria by which they choosewhich candidates will benefit from the significant media exposure that results from state-sponsored political debateswould alleviate some of the risk inherent in allowing government agencies--rather than private entities--to stage candi-date debates.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Courtof Appeals.

MONTANA et al. v. CROW TRIBE OF INDIANS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1829. Argued February 24, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998
In 1904, the Crow Tribe ceded part of its Montana Reservation to the

United States for settlement by non-Indians. The United States holds
rights to minerals underlying the ceded strip in trust for the Tribe. In
1972, with the approval of the Department of the Interior and pursuant
to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), Westmoreland Resources, Inc., a non-Indian company, entered into a mining lease with the
Tribe for coal underlying the ceded strip. After executing the lease,
Westmoreland signed contracts with its customers, four utility companies, allowing it to pass on to the utilities the cost of valid taxes. Westmoreland and the Tribe renegotiated the lease in 1974. The amended
lease had an extendable ten-year term, and set some of the highest royalties in the United States. In 1975, Montana imposed a severance tax
and a gross proceeds tax on all coal produced in the State, including
coal underlying the reservation proper and the ceded strip. Westmoreland paid these taxes without timely pursuit of the procedures Montana
law provides for protests and refunds. Some six months after the State
imposed its taxes, the Crow Tribal Council adopted its own severance
tax. The Department of the Interior approved the Tribe's tax as applied to coal underlying the reservation proper but, because of a limitation in the Tribe's constitution, did not approve as to coal beneath the
ceded strip. The Tribe again enacted a tax for coal mined on the ceded
strip in 1982, and again the Department rejected the tax.

In 1978, the Tribe brought a federal action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Montana and its counties, alleging that the State's
severance and gross proceeds taxes were preempted by the IMLA and
infringed on the Tribe's right to govern itself. The District Court dismissed the complaint. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the
Tribe's allegations, if proved, would establish that the IMLA preempted
the State's taxes. The Court of Appeals noted, however, that the Tribe
had paid none of Westmoreland's taxes and apparently would not be
entitled to any refund in the event that the taxes were declared invalid.
Crow Tribe v. Montana, 650 F. 2d 1104, 1113, n. 13 (Crow I). In 1982,
the Tribe and Westmoreland entered into an agreement, with Interior
Department approval, under which Westmoreland agreed to pay the
Tribe a tax equal to the State's then-existing taxes, less any tax pay523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
ments Westmoreland was required to pay to the State and its subdivisions. The agreement achieved, prospectively, the federal permission
the Tribe had long sought. It allowed the Tribe to have an approved
tax in place so that, if successful in the litigation against Montana, the
Tribe could claim for itself any tax amounts Westmoreland would be
ordered to pay into the District Court's registry pendente lite. It also
enabled Westmoreland to avoid double taxation, and absolved the company from any tax payment obligation to the Tribe for the 1976-1982
period. In 1983, the District Court granted a motion by the Tribe and
Westmoreland to deposit severance tax payments into the District
Court's registry, pending resolution of the controversy over Montana's
taxing authority. In 1987, the court granted the same interim relief for
the gross proceeds taxes. Later that year, the United States intervened on behalf of the Tribe to protect its interests as trustee of the
coal upon which Montana's taxes were levied. After trial, the District
Court determined that federal law did not preempt the State's taxes
on coal mined at the ceded strip. The Ninth Circuit again reversed,
concluding that the taxes were both preempted by the IMLA and void
for interfering with tribal self-governance. Crow Tribe v. Montana,
819 F. 2d 895, 903 (Crow II). The Court of Appeals stressed, inter
alia, that the State's taxes had at least some negative impact on the
marketability of the Tribe's coal. Id., at 900. This Court summarily
affirmed. When the case returned to the District Court in 1988, the
court ordered distribution of the funds in its registry to the United
States as trustee for the Tribe. Subsequently, the United States and
the Tribe filed amended complaints against Montana and Big Horn
County to recover taxes paid by Westmoreland prior to the 1983 and
1987 orders directing deposits into the court's registry. Neither the
Tribe nor the United States requested, as additional or alternate relief,
recovery for the Tribe's actual financial losses attributable to the
State's taxes.

After trial, the District Court concluded that the disgorgement remedy sought by the Tribe was not appropriate. Key to the court's decision was this Court's holding in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,
490 U. S. 163, that both State and Tribe may impose severance taxes on
on-reservation oil and gas production by a non-Indian lessee. Cotton
Petroleum indicated that Montana's taxes on ceded strip coal were invalidated in Crow II not because the State lacked power to tax the coal
at all, but because its taxes were "extraordinarily high." 490 U. S., at
186-187, n. 17. The District Court also considered that Westmoreland
would not have paid coal taxes to the Tribe before 1983, for Interior
Department approval was essential to allow pass-through to the company's customers. Furthermore, under the 1982 lease agreement, the

Syllabus
Tribe and Westmoreland stipulated that Westmoreland would have no
tax liability to the Tribe for the 1976-1982 period. Moreover, the deposited funds, Westmoreland's post-1982 tax payments, had been turned
over in full to the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. The court
further noted that Westmoreland did not timely endeavor to recover
taxes paid to the State and counties, and the Tribe did nothing to
prompt Westmoreland to initiate appropriate refund proceedings. The
court received additional evidence concerning the effect of Montana's
taxes on the marketability of Montana coal and described the parties'
conflicting positions on that issue, but made no findings on the matter.
The Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding that the District Court had
ignored the law of the case and abused its discretion.

Held: The restitution sought for the Tribe is not warranted.

Pp. 713-719.

(a) As a rule, a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund of taxes paid
by another. The Ninth Circuit evidently had that rule in mind when it
noted, in Crow I, that the Tribe was apparently not entitled to any
refund of taxes Westmoreland had paid to Montana. The Tribe maintains, however, that the disgorgement remedy it gained does not fall
within the "refund" category. The Tribe's disgorgement claim must be
examined in light of this Court's pathmarking decision in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163. There, the Court clarified
that neither the IMLA, nor any other federal law, categorically preempts state nondiscriminatory severance taxes on all extraction enterprises in a State, including on-reservation operations. Both State and
Tribe have taxing jurisdiction over on-reservation production. The
Court in Cotton Petroleum distinguished Crow II in a footnote, indicating that Montana had the power to tax Crow coal, but not at an exorbitant rate. Pp. 713-715.

(b) The Tribe first argues that it, not Montana, should have received
Westmoreland's 1975-1982 coal tax payments; therefore the proper remedy is to require the State to turn all taxes it collected from Westmoreland over to the Tribe. However, as Cotton Petroleum makes plain,
neither the State nor the Tribe enjoys authority to tax to the total
exclusion of the other. This situation differs from cases like Valley
County v. Thomas, 109 Mont. 345, 97 P. 2d 345, in which only one jurisdiction could tax a particular activity. Moreover, the Tribe could not
have taxed Westmoreland during the period in question, for the Interior
Department had withheld the essential permission, further distancing
this case from Valley County. The District Court correctly took these
and other factors into account in holding disgorgement an exorbitant,
and therefore inequitable, remedy. Pp. 715-716.

Syllabus
(c) The Tribe and the United States urge the negative impact of Montana's high taxes on the marketability of the Tribe's coal as an alternative justification for requiring Montana to disgorge the taxes collected
from Westmoreland. This claim rests on the concern that, by taxing
the coal actually mined and sold, Montana deprived the Tribe of its fair
share of the economic rent. Again, however, the Tribe could not have
exacted a tax from Westmoreland before 1983, because the Interior Department withheld approval. And no evidence suggests that Westmoreland would have agreed to pay even higher royalties to the Tribe in
1974, but for Montana's tax. It merits emphasis also that under Cotton
Petroleum, Montana could have imposed a severance tax, albeit not one
so extraordinarily high. The District Court did not consider awarding
the Tribe, in lieu of all the 1975-1982 taxes Montana collected, damages
based on actual losses the Tribe suffered. This was not an oversight.
The complaint contained no prayer for compensatory damages. Nor did
the proof establish entitlement to such relief. The Tribe concentrated
on disgorgement as the desired remedy; it deliberately sought and
proved no damages attributable to coal not sold because the State's tax
made the price too high. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) therefore could not aid the Tribe, for the Tribe had not shown entitlement to
actual damages. While not foreclosing the District Court from any
course the Federal Rules and that court's thorough grasp on this litigation may lead it to take, this Court is satisfied that the Court of Appeals
improperly overturned the District Court's judgment. Pp. 717-719.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case originated in 1978 when the Crow Tribe soughtto enjoin the State of Montana and its counties from taxing

coal extracted from mines held by the United States in trustfor the Tribe. Having succeeded in that endeavor, the Tribe
and the United States now seek to recover coal-related taxesonce paid to the State and counties by Westmoreland Resources, Inc., a nontribal enterprise that mined coal under alease from the Tribe. We hold that the restitution sought
for the Tribe is not warranted.

252 U. S. 159 (1920). Surface interests in the ceded stripwere thereafter conveyed to non-Indians, but the United

States holds rights to minerals underlying the strip in trustfor the Tribe. Since 1904, the State and the Counties of Big
Horn, Treasure, and Yellowstone have exercised full legalauthority and responsibility for public services on the ceded
strip, and the Tribe has not exercised civil jurisdiction overthis area. See

Crow Tribe v. Montana, 650 F. 2d 1104, 1107(CA9 1981) (noting the Court of Appeals' understanding, in

Little Light v. Crist, 649 F. 2d 683, 685 (CA9 1981), that "theceded area is not a part of the reservation").

In 1972, with the approval of the Department of the Inte-rior and pursuant to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938
(IMLA), 52 Stat. 347, 25 U. S. C. $ 396a et seq., WestmorelandResources, a non-Indian company, entered into a mining
lease with the Tribe for coal underlying approximately31,000 acres of the ceded strip. After executing the 1972
lease, Westmoreland signed contracts with its customers,four Midwest utility companies, allowing Westmoreland to
pass on the cost of valid taxes to the utilities. Westmore-land began mining the coal in the spring of 1974.

In November 1974, Westmoreland and the Tribe renegoti-ated the 1972 lease. The renegotiated royalties were recognized at the time as being among the highest in the UnitedStates. Crow Tribe v. United States, 657 F. Supp. 573, 587
(Mont. 1985); see App. 376 (testimony of Westmoreland'spresident that the renegotiated royalty was "by far the highest royalty that was being paid in the nation").1 A settle-ment agreement attending the 1974 renegotiation stated that
the Tribe found the amended lease and associated documents"satisfactory in that they provide the financial, economic and
social protections that the Tribe deems necessary." Id., at

which were "at that time . . . 17 and a half cents a ton, maybe 20 cents a
ton." App. 375-376.

44. The amended lease and the royalties for which it pro-vided had an extendable term of ten years, running from

October 1983. Crow Tribe v. United States, 657 F. Supp.,

gross proceeds tax on all coal produced in Montana, includingcoal underlying the reservation proper and the ceded strip.
See Mont. Code Ann. $$ 15-23-701 to 15-23-704, 15-35-101to 15-35-111 (1979). The severance tax rate applicable to
the ceded strip coal was 30 percent of the contract sales priceof the coal extracted;

2 the gross proceeds tax rate was approximately 5 percent of the contract sales price. Duringthe relevant periods,

3 Westmoreland paid approximately

$46.8 million in severance taxes to the State and $11.4 millionin gross proceeds taxes to Big Horn County.

4 Westmoreland

paid these taxes without timely pursuit of the procedures
Montana law provides for protests and refunds. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 37; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14. The company subsequently agreed, in exchange for $50,000, to dismiss with prejudice any claim of entitlement to a refund of

or Big Horn County. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37; see also

Id., at 81; see also id., at 97-98. Reservation boundaries, as
described in the code, included the coal beneath the ceded
strip. Id., at 81.5 Under the Tribe's constitution, the tax
adopted by the Tribal Council was subject to review by the
Department of the Interior. Id., at 329.

In January 1977, the Department approved the Tribe's
code "to the extent that it applied to coal underlying the
Crow Reservation proper." Id., at 98. Because of a limitation in the Tribe's constitution, however, the Department
"disapproved the tax to the extent that it applied to the
Crow Tribe's coal in the ceded strip." Id., at 153; see also
id., at 217-218, 329.6 In 1982, the Tribe again enacted a tax
for coal mined on the ceded strip, and again the Department
rejected the tax. See Crow Tribe v. Montana, 819 F. 2d
895, 897 (CA9 1987). According to the Superintendent of
the Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department
continued to withhold permission for extension of the Tribe's
tax to the ceded area because the Tribe's constitution "disclaimed jurisdiction outside the boundaries of the reservation." App. 218. The Tribe endeavored to amend its
constitution to satisfy the Department's objection; it did

5 The Tribe's Chairman, in a March 11, 1975, statement opposing an increase in Montana coal taxes, however, observed that the State "has an
important governmental responsibility" for development of Indian coal resources, particularly on the ceded strip; the role of the State, the Chairman
added, "is substantially reduced where development takes place on the
Crow Reservation, for under . . . federal law the Crow Tribe . . . exercises
governmental and proprietary jurisdiction over the people and property
within its reservation." App. 53.

6 On March 3, 1978, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior disapproved,

on procedural grounds, an amendment to the Crow Constitution that
would have had the effect of applying the Tribe's 1976 coal tax code to the
removal of coal underlying the ceded area. Id., at 98; see also Defendant's

Opinion of the Court
not petition for court review of the Department's refusal toapprove extension of the Tribe's tax to the ceded strip.

B
The Tribe brought a federal action against Montana andMontana counties in 1978, seeking declaratory and injunctive

relief against imposition of the State's severance and grossproceed taxes on coal belonging to the Tribe. The State's
taxes, the Tribe alleged, were preempted by the IMLA andinfringed on the Tribe's right to govern itself. The District
Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claimupon which relief could be granted.

Crow Tribe v. Mon-tana, 469 F. Supp. 154 (Mont. 1979). The Court of Appeals

for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 650 F. 2d 1104 (1981),amended, 665 F. 2d 1390 (1982) (Crow I). It held that the
Tribe's allegations, if proved, would establish that the IMLApreempted Montana's taxes, 650 F. 2d, at 1113-1115, and that
the taxes impermissibly infringed upon the Tribe's sover-eignty,

id., at 1115-1117.While the Ninth Circuit trained on the nonmonetary claim

the Tribe was then pursuing, one for declaratory and injunc-tive relief to stop the imposition of Montana's taxes, the
Court of Appeals noted: "As to the taxes already paid byWestmoreland . . . it is true that the Tribe has not paid any
of the taxes and is apparently not entitled to any refund ifthe tax statutes are declared invalid."

Id., at 1113, n. 13.The Ninth Circuit further observed that the Tribe's own attempt "to tax its lessees' coal production was partially frus-trated by the Secretary of the Interior's refusal to sanction
the Tribe's tax ordinances insofar as they applied to coal pro-duction on the ceded strip."

Id., at 1115, n. 19.In July 1982, after the
Crow I decision, the Tribe and
Westmoreland entered into an amended lease agreement, ap-proved by the Interior Department that September. Under

the amended arrangement, Westmoreland agreed to pay the

Opinion of the Court
Tribe a tax equal to the State's then-existing taxes, less any
tax payments Westmoreland was required to make to the
State and its subdivisions. See App. 135-141; see also id., at
329-330. The 1982 agreement achieved, prospectively, the
federal permission the Tribe had long sought. It allowed
the Tribe to have an approved tax in place so that, if successful in the litigation against Montana, the Tribe could claim
for itself any tax amounts Westmoreland might be ordered
to pay into the District Court's registry pendente lite. Correspondingly, the agreement enabled Westmoreland to avoid
double taxation, present and future, and it absolved the company from any tax payment obligation to the Tribe for the
1976-1982 period. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32-35.

In November 1982, in keeping with their amended lease
agreement, the Tribe and Westmoreland jointly filed a motion to deposit severance tax payments into the District
Court's registry, pending resolution of the controversy over
Montana's authority to tax coal mined at the ceded strip.
Id., at 32. In January 1983, the District Court granted the
motion. Thereafter, Westmoreland paid the Montana severance tax into the court's registry in lieu of paying the State.
The District Court granted the same interim relief, in November 1987, for the gross proceeds tax. Id., at 35, 36. In
ordering the registry deposits, which ultimately would be
paid over, with interest, to the prevailing party (Montana or
the Tribe), the District Court recalled the Ninth Circuit's
observation that "the Tribe is apparently not entitled to any
refund of taxes previously paid by Westmoreland to Montana." App. 213 (citing Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1113, n. 13).
The provisional remedy attended to that concern; it "preserve[d the District Court's] power . . . [to give post-1982]
tax moneys to their rightful owner after a trial on the merits." App. 215.

In June 1983, the United States intervened on behalf of
the Tribe to protect its interests as trustee of the coal upon

Opinion of the Court
which Montana's taxes were levied. Trial took place in January 1984, after which the District Court concluded that federal law did not preempt the State's taxes on coal underlying
the ceded strip. Crow Tribe v. United States, 657 F. Supp.
573 (Mont. 1985). The Ninth Circuit again reversed. Crow
Tribe v. Montana, 819 F. 2d 895 (1987) (Crow II). Montana's
taxes, as applied to the ceded strip coal, the Court of Appeals
held, were both "preempted by federal law and policies," as
reflected in the IMLA, and "void for interfering with tribal
self-government." Id., at 903. Explaining its decision, the
Ninth Circuit stressed these considerations: The Tribe had a
vital interest in the development of its coal resources, id., at
899, 901; the State's taxes had "at least some negative impact
on the . . . marketability [of the Tribe's coal]," id., at 900;
Montana's coal tax exactions were not "narrowly tailored"
to serve only the State's "legitimate" interests, id., at 902.
Montana appealed, and this Court summarily affirmed. 484
U. S. 997 (1988).

When the case returned to the District Court in 1988, the
Tribe sought an order directing release of the funds held in
the court's registry. Montana did not object but, in a new
twist, Westmoreland did. The company, for the first time in
this protracted litigation, asserted that neither Montana nor
the Tribe qualified for receipt of the funds. Montana was
out because the Ninth Circuit had declared the State's taxes
preempted. The Tribe, according to Westmoreland, did not
have a valid tax law in place even in the years following
1982--the fund deposit period--for want of proper Interior
Department approval. Therefore, Westmoreland urged, the
company should receive back all deposited funds.

Rejecting Westmoreland's novel claim of entitlement to
the deposited funds, the District Court observed that the
Ninth Circuit, in Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1117, and Crow II, 819
F. 2d, at 898, had characterized the minerals underlying the
ceded strip as a " `component of the Reservation land itself.' "

at 703, covered the strip as well, and the Interior Depart-ment had erred in ever opining otherwise, App. 286. As to
Westmoreland's operations on the strip, the District Courtfurther stated, the Crow tax had been modified by the 1982
agreement amending the lease. Id., at 287; see supra, at704-705. That 1982 Tribe-Westmoreland accord controlled,
the District Court concluded, rendering the amount depos-ited payable to the Tribe, and not to Westmoreland. Shortly
thereafter, the District Court ordered distribution of fundsin its registry to the United States, as trustee for the Tribe.
App. 288-291.Having secured exclusively for the Tribe's benefit Westmoreland's post-1982 tax payments once held in the DistrictCourt's registry, the United States and the Tribe commenced
the fray now before us. Filing amended complaints againstMontana and Big Horn County, they invoked theories of assumpsit and constructive trust in support of prayers to re-cover some $58.2 million in state and county taxes paid by
Westmoreland prior to the 1983 and 1987 orders directingdeposits into the court's registry. App. to Pet. for Cert.
243-260. These complaints alleged that, because the Stateand Big Horn County had collected taxes from Westmoreland
in violation of federal law, it would be unjust and inequitableto allow them to retain the funds. In "equity and good conscience," the United States and the Tribe urged, Montanashould pay over for the benefit of the Tribe all moneys illegally collected, together with interest thereon. See id., at249-250, 258-259.

Montana moved for summary judgment, arguing, interalia, that any refund right that may have existed belonged

to Westmoreland, as payer of the taxes in question. Id., at72. The District Court, in December 1990, denied Montana's
motion on the ground that full airing of the parties' positionswas in order.

Id., at 67-85.On Montana's application, the District Court certified for

interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b), thequestion whether summary judgment for the State was
properly denied. Id., at 61-66. The Ninth Circuit, in 1991,initially granted permission for the interlocutory appeal, but
one year later, in 1992, dismissed the appeal as improvidentlygranted.

Crow Tribe v. Montana, 969 F. 2d 848 (Crow III).In dismissing the appeal, the Ninth Circuit commented that

the "sole issue" presented was whether the Tribe and theUnited States, although they did not pay the Montana taxes,
were nevertheless positioned to state a claim for relief inassumpsit and constructive trust. That issue, the Ninth

8 An earlier amended complaint filed in November 1982, a year after
Crow I, sought in addition to the declaratory and injunctive relief originally requested, "restitutionary, tax refunds, money damages, and other
relief," including "punitive or exemplary damages." App. 143, 158. The
current complaints seek restitution, but do not refer to "refunds" or
"money damages."

In 1993, the Tribe sought once again to amend its complaint, inter alia,
to recover from Westmoreland taxes allegedly due under the Tribe's coal
tax ordinance for the period 1976-1982. In a July 1993 order, the District
Court denied leave to amend, observing: "This case is now more than
fifteen years old"; "defendants have allowed . . . previous motions to amend
the complaint to be granted without objection"; "[t]his motion, however,
contains additional causes of action . . . [which] could change the nature of
the litigation." Record, Doc. No. 637, p. 4. In so ruling, the District
Court noted that "[t]he trial court's discretion [to deny tardy amendments]
is . . . broadened" when newly alleged facts and theories "have been known
to the party seeking amendment since the inception of the cause of action."

Circuit said, "was already addressed" in Crow II. TheCourt of Appeals then recited passages from Crow II indicating why that court had determined that " `the state tax[es]threaten[ed] Congress' overriding objective of encouraging
tribal self-government and economic development.' " 969F. 2d, at 848-849 (quoting

Crow II, 819 F. 2d, at 903).

C
The District Court conducted a trial in April and May 1994to determine whether coal taxes paid by Westmoreland to

Montana and its counties in the years 1975-1982 unjustlyenriched the State and its subdivisions at the expense of

the Tribe. In detailed findings and conclusions, that courtexplained why, in its judgment, the disgorgement remedy
sought by the Tribe was not appropriate. App. to Pet. forCert. 17-38, 42-54.

The Tribe's case rested on three principal points: first, thefact, settled in Crow I, that the coal underlying the ceded
strip was a mineral resource of the Tribe; second, the federalpolicy favoring tribal self-government and economic development; finally, the Ninth Circuit's preemption decision. Criti-cal to the preemption decision, the District Court recognized,
was the Court of Appeals' determination that "Montana'scoal taxes burdened the Tribe's economic interests by increasing the costs of production by coal producers, whichreduced royalties received by the Tribe." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 45 (citing Crow II, 819 F. 2d, at 899).Counterbalancing the Tribe's case, the District Court observed first that the State and its subdivisions, not the Tribe,provided "[p]ublic services to residents and businesses on the
[c]eded [s]trip, many of which facilitate the mining of coal."App. to Pet. for Cert. 47; see supra, at 701, 703, n. 5. Key to
the District Court's reasoning, however, was the respectivetaxing authority of State and Tribe.

In a decision rendered two years after the Ninth Circuit'sCrow II preemption decision, this Court held that both State

Opinion of the Court
and Tribe may impose severance taxes on on-reservation oil
and gas production by a non-Indian lessee. Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163 (1989). Cotton Petroleum indicated that Montana's taxes on ceded strip coal
were invalidated, not because the State lacked power to tax
the coal at all, but because the taxes at issue were "extraordinarily high." Id., at 186-187, n. 17.

The Tribe's exercise of taxing authority, on the other hand,
required approval from the Secretary of the Interior, and
that approval had not been obtained in the relevant period,
1975-1982. See supra, at 703-704. In 1988, the District
Court had determined that the Interior Department's refusal
to approve the Tribe's tax on the ceded strip was an error,
see supra, at 707, but the presence of the state taxes did not
cause that error. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. Rather, the
Department initially questioned the Tribe's authority to tax
on the ceded strip and later pointed to the Tribe's noncompliance with the proper procedures for amending its constitution to impose the tax. Id., at 36-37.

Accorded weight in the District Court's evaluation, Westmoreland would not have paid coal taxes to the Tribe prior
to 1983, for Interior Department approval was essential to
allow pass-through to the company's customers. Id., at 35.
Furthermore, under the 1982 lease agreement, see supra, at
704-705, the Tribe and Westmoreland stipulated that Westmoreland would have no tax liability to the Tribe for the
1976-1982 period. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36.9 Moreover,

obligation to the Tribe in lieu of the State predating the 1982 lease agreement, but "as a basis for ordering that the escrowed funds be released to
the Tribe and not Westmoreland by virtue of [that] agreement." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 36; see also id., at 53-54.

had been turned over in full to the United States for thebenefit of the Tribe. Ibid.; see supra, at 705-707.

The District Court further noted that Westmoreland didnot timely endeavor to recover taxes paid to the State and
counties, and that the Tribe did nothing to prompt West-moreland to initiate appropriate proceedings for refunds.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 50-51. In that regard, the DistrictCourt recalled the Court of Appeals' statement in

Crow Ithat " `as to the taxes already paid by Westmoreland, . . . the

Tribe . . . is apparently not entitled to any refund if the taxstatutes are declared invalid.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 53
(quoting Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1113, n. 13).Concerning the negative effect of Montana's taxes on the
marketability of coal produced in Montana, the DistrictCourt entertained additional evidence, supplementing the
evidence offered ten years earlier. Westmoreland's presi-dent testified that "he could not identify any utility contracts
lost during the relevant time period due to Montana's coaltaxes," App. to Pet. for Cert. 29, and the parties' economic
experts presented conflicting testimony on the impact ofMontana's taxes on the sale of Montana coal. The District
Court described the conflicting positions, but made no find-ings on the matter. Id., at 29-30.

Satisfied that the factors justifying preemption did notimpel the disgorgement relief demanded by the Tribe, that
under Cotton Petroleum, the State could impose a reason-ably sized severance tax, and that the State, though enriched
by Westmoreland's tax payments, did not gain that enrich-ment unjustly at the expense of the Tribe, the District Court
refused to order that Montana coal taxes collected between1975 and 1982 be remitted to the Tribe.

10 The Tribe and the United States also claimed that the State and Big
Horn County were unjustly enriched as a result of their tortious interference with the Tribe's contractual and business relationships with the Shell
Oil Company. The District Court rejected this claim as not proved, see

712 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBE

Opinion of the Court
The Ninth Circuit again reversed the District Court'sjudgment; in a per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals

read its prior opinions to require the relief the Tribedemanded, i. e., an order directing the State and county to
disgorge approximately $58.2 million in coal taxes paid byWestmoreland to Montana and its subdivisions before Westmoreland began making payments into the District Court'sregistry. 92 F. 3d 826, amended, 98 F. 3d 1194 (1996)
(Crow IV). Acknowledging "the absence of traditional re-quirements for relief under theories of assumpsit or constructive trust," 92 F. 3d, at 828, the Court of Appealsremanded for entry of the disgorgement order. That court
left to the District Court only the "unresolved request[s]for prejudgment interest [and attorney's fees]." Id., at
830-831.In the Ninth Circuit's view, the District Court had not adhered to the "law of this case," id., at 828,11 and had thereforeabused its discretion, id., at 830. In particular, the Court of
Appeals faulted the District Court for giving undue weightto the fact that Westmoreland rather than the Tribe had paid
the taxes, id., at 828-829,12 and to the fact, made plain bythis Court in Cotton Petroleum, 490 U. S., at 176-187, that
"similar [state] taxes are not always preempted," Crow IV,92 F. 3d, at 829. Further, the Ninth Circuit discounted the
public services Montana provided at the ceded strip because"the State would have provided such services even if the

id., at 54-57, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that disposition. 92 F. 3d

522 U. S. 819 (1997).

11 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to "law of the case" made

in Crow III, see 92 F. 3d, at 828, and n. 2, 829, a decision denying interlocutory review and therefore containing no "holding," see supra, at 708-709.

12 But cf. Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1110 ("incidence of [Montana's] taxes is

on the non-Indian mineral lessee"); id., at 1113, n. 13 ("[a]s to the taxes
already paid by Westmoreland, . . . [the Tribe] is apparently not entitled
to any refund").

Westmoreland "would have paid the tribal tax even without[the Interior Department's] approval because [Westmoreland] agreed to do so in its 1982 lease." Id., at 830; see also
ibid. ("Westmoreland was willing to pay coal taxes to theTribe as early as 1976, so there was no reason for the [District Court] to distinguish between the taxes collected beforeand after 1982.").

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 912 (1997), and now re-verse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

II

A
The petition for certiorari presents the question whetherthe Tribe--or the United States as its trustee--may recover

state and county taxes imposed on and paid by the Tribe'smineral lessee, Westmoreland, a party who has forfeited entitlement to a tax refund. Taxpayer Westmoreland, it is un-disputed, did not qualify for a refund because the company
failed to pursue protest and claim procedures within the timeMontana law prescribes. Further, Westmoreland entered
into a settlement with the State and the county relinquishingany claim it might have had for return of the tax payments
in question. See supra, at 702.As a rule, a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund of taxes
paid by another. See, e. g., Furman Univ. v. Livingston, 136S. E. 2d 254, 256, 244 S. C. 200, 204 (1964);

Krauss Co. v.Develle, 236 La. 1072, 1077, 110 So. 2d 104, 106 (1959); Kesbec,

Inc. v. McGoldrick, 278 N. Y. 293, 297, 16 N. E. 2d 288, 290(1938); cf.

United States v. California, 507 U. S. 746, 752(1993). The Ninth Circuit evidently had that rule in mind

13 But cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 35 (District Court found that during the
1975 through 1982 period Westmoreland "would not have paid coal taxes
to the Tribe as no Department of Interior approval had been obtained to
allow a pass-through to its customers").

714 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBE

Opinion of the Court
when it noted, in Crow I, that the Tribe "is apparently notentitled to any refund" of taxes Westmoreland had paid to

Montana. 650 F. 2d, at 1113, n. 13.The Tribe now maintains, however, that the disgorgement
remedy approved by the Ninth Circuit does not fall withinthe "refund" category. The Tribe suggests two ways of analyzing its claim. First, Westmoreland was liable for tax pay-ments, but it paid the wrong sovereign; the Tribe, not the
State, should have been the recipient of those payments.Second, the State's taxes adversely affected the Tribe's economy by reducing the demand for the Tribe's coal and theroyalties the Tribe could charge; a remedial order transferring Westmoreland's 1975-1982 tax payments from Montanato the Tribe would eliminate the enrichment unjustly gained
by the State at the Tribe's expense.Before inspecting the Tribe's justifications for the disgorgement ordered by the Court of Appeals, we place inclear view a pathmarking decision this Court rendered less
than two years after our summary affirmance in Crow II.14In Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163
(1989), we held that the IMLA did not preempt New Mexico'snondiscriminatory severance taxes on the production of oil
and gas on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation by Cotton Pe-troleum, a non-Indian lessee. Id., at 186-187. In so holding, we acknowledged that the same on-reservation produc-tion of oil and gas was subject to tribal severance taxes,

id.,at 167-169, and that New Mexico's taxes might reduce

demand for on-reservation leases, id., at 186-187. CottonPetroleum clarified that neither the IMLA, nor any other
federal law, categorically preempts state mineral severancetaxes imposed, without discrimination, on all extraction enterprises in the State, including on-reservation operations."Unless and until Congress provides otherwise, each of the

and no more may be read into our action than was essential to sustain
that judgment." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 785, n. 5 (1983).

Opinion of the Court
. . . two sovereigns[--State and Tribe--]has taxing jurisdic-tion over all [on-reservation production]." Id., at 189.

The Court in Cotton Petroleum distinguished Crow II ina footnote referring to the Solicitor General's representation
that Montana's taxes were "extraordinarily high" and theNinth Circuit's recognition that "the state taxes had a negative effect on the marketability of coal produced in Mon-tana." 490 U. S., at 186-187, n. 17. Montana,

Cotton Petro-leum thus indicates, had the power to tax Crow coal, but not

at an exorbitant rate. See id., at 187, n. 17 (according to theTribe's expert, Montana's rate was " `more than twice that of
any other state's coal taxes' ").15 We examine the Tribe'sdisgorgement claim in light of Cotton Petroleum, a decision
on the books before the Tribe (and the United States) filedtheir current claims for restitution.

B
We consider first the argument that the Tribe, not Mon-tana, should have received Westmoreland's 1975-1982 coal

tax payments; therefore the proper remedy is to require theState to turn all taxes it collected from Westmoreland over
to the Tribe. As authority, the Tribe and the United Statesrely on cases typified by

Valley County v. Thomas, 109 Mont.345, 97 P. 2d 345 (1939). That case involved a Montana law

providing for the licensing of motor vehicles by the countyin which the vehicle is owned and taxable. Valley County
claimed that McCone County was unlawfully issuing licenses,and collecting license fees, for vehicles owned and taxable
within Valley County. Valley sued McCone for both injunc-tive and monetary relief. The Montana Supreme Court held
that if Montana's vehicle licensing law made Valley, not Mc-Cone, the county entitled to issue the licenses in question,

15 Since 1985, the District Court observed, "the Montana legislature has
enacted production incentive credits and incrementally reduced the
amount of the severance tax"; in November 1994, the rate was 15 percent
of the contract sales price. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25.

523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
716 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBE

Opinion of the Court
then Valley could recover from McCone the fees McCone improperly collected. It would make scant sense, the court
reasoned, to hold instead that Valley should "exact the . . .
license fee anew from the [vehicle] owner, leaving the latter
to his remedy, if any, for the illegal exaction." Id., at 385-
386, 97 P. 2d, at 366.

As the District Court in this case correctly recognized,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 49-50, the Valley County pattern is
not the one presented here. There, the Montana licensing statute bound both counties. One, and not the other,
was the sole subdivision authorized to issue the license and
collect the fee. Here, as Cotton Petroleum makes plain,
neither the State nor the Tribe enjoys authority to tax to
the total exclusion of the other. Moreover, dispositively
distancing the Tribe's situation from that of the prevailing
subdivision in Valley County, the Tribe itself could not have
taxed lessee Westmoreland during the period in question, for
the Interior Department (whether wrongly or rightly) had
withheld the essential permission.

It bears repetition that the Department did not approve
the Tribe's imposition of a coal tax on ceded strip production
until September 1982, see supra, at 705, that the Tribe never
sought judicial review of the Department's pre-1982 disapprovals, see supra, at 703-704, that Westmoreland would pay
no tax to the Tribe absent Department approval, see supra,
at 706, 710, 713, n. 13, that Montana's taxes did not impede
the Tribe from gaining the Department's clearance, see
supra, at 710, and that Montana received no share of the
post-1982 tax payments released from the District Court's
registry, see supra, at 705-707. These were factors the
District Court correctly considered significant in holding
disgorgement an exorbitant, and therefore inequitable,
remedy.16

16 In view of the evidence diligently canvassed by the District Court,
including the Tribe-Westmoreland 1982 agreement that Westmoreland
would have no tax liability to the Tribe for the 1976-1982 period, see

Opinion of the Court

C
The negative impact of Montana's high taxes on the mar-ketability of the Tribe's coal, as the District Court correctly

comprehended, was the principal basis for the Ninth Circuit's
Crow II preemption decision. See supra, at 709. TheTribe and the United States urge that impact as an alternative justification for requiring Montana to disgorge taxes col-lected from Westmoreland from 1975 through 1982.

At oral argument, counsel for the Tribe clarified that theimpact of concern was not coal that went unsold because the
State's tax made the price too high. See Tr. of Oral Arg.37. Instead, the Tribe's disgorgement claim rested on the
coal "actually produced and sold"; by taxing that coal, coun-sel maintained, Montana "deprived [the Tribe] of its fair
share of the economic rent." Ibid.Again, however, the Tribe itself could not have exacted
a tax from Westmoreland before 1983, because the InteriorDepartment withheld approval. And the royalty the Tribe
and Westmoreland agreed upon in 1974 was both high andlong term, running until June 1982. See supra, at 701-702.
No evidence suggests Westmoreland would have paid higherroyalties, but for Montana's tax. It merits emphasis also, as
the District Court recognized, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46, 50,that under our

Cotton Petroleum decision, Montana couldhave imposed a severance tax, albeit not one so extraordinarily high. See Cotton Petroleum, 490 U. S., at 186-187(New Mexico's oil and gas severance taxes imposed on onreservation production, amounting to about 8 percent of thevalue of the taxpayer's production, were not preempted by
federal law although the taxes could be expected to have "atleast a marginal effect on the demand for on-reservation

supra, at 705, 710-711, we see no substantial basis for believing that Westmoreland "would have paid the tribal tax even without [the Interior
Department's] approval" or that "Westmoreland was willing to pay coal
taxes to the Tribe as early as 1976," six years before the Department
agreed that the Tribe was positioned to tax coal mined at the ceded strip.

leases, the value to the Tribe of those leases, and the abilityof the Tribe to increase its tax rate").

The District Court did not consider awarding the Tribe, inlieu of all the 1975-1982 taxes Montana collected, damages
based on actual losses the Tribe suffered. We cannot callthis an oversight. The complaint contained no prayer for
compensatory damages. See supra, at 707-708, and nn. 7, 8.Nor did the proof establish entitlement to such relief. See
supra, at 711.17The only testimony homing in on Westmoreland's sales
came from the company's president. He could "identify [no]utility contracts lost during the relevant time period due to
Montana's coal taxes." App. to Pet. for Cert. 29. While heacknowledged that some customers "exercise[d] the payment
option under their contracts rather than continuing to re-ceive coal and that the Montana coal taxes were probably a
factor," he identified as other factors "demand, alternativesources, and transportation." Ibid. Indeed, as just noted,
see supra this page, the Tribe concentrated on disgorgementas the desired remedy; it deliberately sought "no damages
. . . now" for "coal that was not sold because the price wastoo high [due to] the State's tax." Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c), therefore, could not aidthe Tribe. That Rule instructs that "every final judgment
shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it isrendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such
relief in the party's pleadings." The Tribe, however, hadnot shown entitlement to actual damages.

In sum, the District Court carefully and fairly determinedthat the disgorgement demanded was not warranted and
should not be granted. In so ruling, that court endeavoredto heed both Crow II and Cotton Petroleum, and closely attended to the history of and record in this tangled, long17 The Tribe attempted, unsuccessfully, to show that Montana's high
taxes caused the Tribe to lose its lease with Shell Oil Company. See

pending case. See supra, at 708, n. 8. Proceeding as it did,the District Court ignored no tenable "law of the case" and

did not indulge in an "abuse of discretion." See Crow IV, 92F. 3d, at 829, 830.

As a result of the District Court's orders for registry de-posits, see

supra, at 705, the Tribe has displaced Montana tothis extent: With respect to ceded strip mining operations,

all severance taxes have gone to the Tribe since January1983, and all gross proceeds taxes since November 1987.
Montana's retention of preregistry deposit taxes must be as-sessed in light of the court-ordered distribution of all funds
in the registry to the United States, as trustee for the Tribe.See

supra, at 707. The District Court, best positioned tomake that assessment, was obliged to do so based on the case

and proof the parties presented. The Tribe and the UnitedStates here argued for total disgorgement. They did not
develop a case for relief of a different kind or size. Whilewe do not foreclose the District Court from any course the
Federal Rules and that court's thorough grasp on this litiga-tion lead it to take, we are satisfied that the Court of Appeals
improperly overturned the District Court's judgment.

Opinion of Souter, J.
requiring disgorgement to the Crow Tribe of all Montanataxes collected from Westmoreland based on coal mined from

the ceded strip between 1976 and 1982. As the Court ex-plains, ante, at 715, Cotton Petroleum makes clear that the
taxes were objectionable not because the State was whollydisentitled to tax the Tribe's coal operation, but because the
" `extraordinarily high' " taxes affecting the marketability ofthe Tribe's coal were simply excessive. 490 U. S., at 186-
187, n. 17. Since Montana was free to levy and collect theportion of taxes below the threshold of excessiveness, I concur in the Court's decision to reverse the judgment and re-mand for further proceedings.

If the Court stopped there, the Court of Appeals would befree to set the stage for the District Court to engage in serious weighing of a claim to partial disgorgement under theTribe's complaint, which, as now amended, seeks disgorgement of all moneys "illegally collected." * Although thisrequest for relief was originally predicated on a reading of
Crow II that Cotton Petroleum shows was too expansive,the Tribe's prayer naturally encompasses the lesser claim to
disgorgement of any taxes in excess of the State's limit.It would be open to the Court of Appeals, further, to indicate that nothing done either by the Department of the Inte-rior or by the Tribe raised a dispositive bar to the Tribe's
claim to pre-1983 revenues, contrary to what the DistrictCourt had suggested, App. to Pet. for Cert. 35-37, leaving
that latter court free to determine what had been excessiveand to reweigh the equities. After considering what the
Tribe had already received, among the other relevant facts,the District Court might require disgorgement of all, some,
or none of the excessive taxes for the period before 1983.The Court impedes any such exercise of trial court discretion, however, if it does not entirely foreclose it. Althoughthe Court says that it does not "foreclose the District Court

from any course the Federal Rules and that court's thoroughgrasp on this litigation lead it to take" when the case is returned to it, ante, at 719, the Court's conclusions effectivelythwart application of one of the principal rules of restitution
that should be brought to bear on this case. It is from the
resulting truncation of the District Court's discretion that Irespectfully dissent.

Although both Montana and the Tribe may tax the valueof the coal on its extraction or severance from the land,

ante,
at 714-715, Montana may tax only to a certain economicpoint. Beyond that point, as between Montana and the

Tribe, only the Tribe may add to the tax burden. When a
taxing authority like Montana has taxed unlawfully to the
prejudice of another jurisdiction that should have received
the revenue in payment of its own lawful tax, accepted principles of restitution entitle the latter government to claim
disgorgement of what the former had no business receiving. At the most general level, a "person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make
restitution to the other." Restatement of Restitution $ 1,
p. 12 (1937). At a more specific level, there is the rule that
"[w]here a person has paid money . . . to another in the erroneous belief, induced by mistake of fact, that he owed a duty
to the other so to do, whereas such duty was owed to a third
person, the transferee . . . is under a duty of restitution to the
third person." Id., $ 126(1), at 514. The Supreme Court of
Montana has accordingly held, as the majority recognizes,
ante, at 715-716, that as between two jurisdictions claiming
to tax the same transaction, one that collected taxes without
lawful authority must surrender them to the other one, entitled to impose them, Valley County v. Thomas, 109 Mont.
345, 97 P. 2d 345 (1939); see also, e. g., College Park v. Eastern
Airlines, Inc., 250 Ga. 741, 742-744, 300 S. E. 2d 513, 515-516

including $ 126(1), to hold that one municipality may recover

another); School Dist. No. 6 v. School Dist. No. 5, 255 Mich.428, 429, 238 N. W. 214, 215 (1931) (authorizing suit to recover

good conscience belongs to plaintiff "); Balkan v. Buhl, 158Minn. 271, 279, 197 N. W. 266, 269 (1924) ("[T]o permit defendant to retain any of the taxes wrongfully collected by itfrom its neighbor's territory, would be to permit it to benefit
from its own wrong . . . . Such a result is so objectional as
to require no discussion beyond its bare statement"). Under
Montana's own law, then, reflecting accepted principles of
restitution, the Tribe raises at least a facially valid claim
when it seeks disgorgement of the excess taxes collected by
the State in the period before 1983.

Although the Court seeks to differentiate this case from
the ambit of Valley County, the proffered distinctions come
up short. First, it is not to the point that in Valley County
only one jurisdiction could validly tax, whereas here both
may do so, ante, at 716. The remaining element of the
Tribe's claim against Montana goes only to the state revenues that might be found to have exceeded the limit of valid
state taxation; beyond the point at which state taxation became excessive the State had no authority, while the Tribe
did. (It is true, of course, that in this case the respective
spheres of the two taxing jurisdictions are bounded by an
economic, not a geographic, line. But that distinction does
not affect the principle involved, and the Court does not
argue otherwise.)

Second, Valley County is not distinguishable on the
ground that the governmental claimant there had an enforceable licensing and revenue scheme in place, whereas the
Tribe "could not have taxed lessee Westmoreland during the
period in question, for the Interior Department (whether

wrongly or rightly) had withheld the essential permission,"
ante, at 716. The District Court's original ruling, acknowledged in its most recent opinion and never challenged byMontana, was that the Tribe "at all relevant times . . . had a

valid coal mining tax applicable to Westmoreland's mining on
the Ceded Strip." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. After theNinth Circuit's ruling in

Crow II that the mineral estate beneath the surface of the ceded strip was a part of the Tribe'sreservation, 819 F. 2d, at 898, the District Court observed:

"This analysis of the Reservation status of the Crow
coal compels the conclusion that the approval which the
Department of the Interior gave to the 1976 tax ordi-nance was fully applicable to Westmoreland's mining of

Crow Ceded Strip coal because that coal was and is acomponent of the Reservation land itself. The approval
of the Department of Interior of the 1976 Crow TribalTax Code as it applied to activities on the Reservation
was necessarily an approval of that tax as being applicable to Westmoreland's mining of Crow Tribal coal. Ac-cordingly, the Interior Department's purported refusal

to approve the tax as it might apply to any mining oper-ation on the Ceded Strip was based on what the Ninth
Circuit has found to be a mistaken interpretation of theapplicable law." App. 286.

Thus, the Tribe's provision must now be recognized as validfor the period in question, and there is no apparent reason
why the Tribe should be disqualified from seeking to obtainthe State's excess revenues that should have gone to the
Tribe under the Tribe's own tax regulation. While the
Tribe could not have enforced the tax against Westmoreland
without the Interior Department's approval, that is neither
here nor there as between the Tribe and the State. And
although the Tribe failed to obtain judicial review of the Department's refusal, that has no bearing on the equity of the
State's retention of money to which it never had a valid

claim. That is, there is no apparent reason to hold that theoriginally unlitigated third-party mistake of the Interior Department should affect the restitution claim as between tworival taxing authorities, one of which was clearly entitled to
tax but got nothing, the other of which was entitled to nothing by way of excess taxes, but has pocketed the moneyanyway.

Third, despite a suggestion in the Court's opinion, ante, at710, 716,

Valley County is not rendered inapposite by the
Tribe's 1982 agreement with Westmoreland. So far as itmatters here, that agreement simply capped Westmoreland's

tax burden at the limit imposed by Montana's then-current
taxing scheme and did not purport to govern any claim the
Tribe might have against the State.

To reject the Court's attempts to distinguish this case
from Valley County is not, of course, to deny that any distinction exists. In fact, there is a significant difference between the two situations, and one that may prevent the door
from closing entirely against the pre-1983 claim. In Valley
County and the comparable cases, the disgorgement issue
turned on the relative merits of the competing jurisdictions'
claims of entitlement to impose a tax; neither rival government had any interest in the property or activity taxed except that of a taxing authority. In this case, however, that
is not so, for the Tribe that sought to tax the extraction of
the coal was also the owner of the coal before the extraction.
Thus, any tribal taxation was merely a way to recover or
retain some of the value of the Tribe's own property (a fact
unaffected by the favorable terms of the Tribe's royalty
agreement with Westmoreland, see ante, at 717); so, too,
Montana's receipt of the excess taxation (passed on by Westmoreland) was an appropriation of the Tribe's own property,
just as it was an invalid counterpart of the tax collection that
would have been rightful by the Tribe. The Ninth Circuit
recognized this when it found that "Montana made plain its
intention to appropriate most of the economic rent" of the

Opinion of Souter, J.
Tribe's coal. See Crow Tribe v. Montana, 650 F. 2d 1104,1113 (1981). Because the Tribe's claim may properly be

viewed in this light, we can put to one side any questionswhether the Court is right, or I am, about the significance of
the error by the Department of the Interior or the point-for-point applicability of

Valley County. We may bypass theprinciples specific to claims between contending taxing authorities entirely and simply ask whether something in thisrecord would in practical terms defeat the Tribe's claim to
disgorgement of its own property taken in the form of excesstaxes. The Court's answer to this question is uncertain.
The Court endorses the view that some degree of disgorge-ment would have been "exorbitant,"

ante, at 716, and "com-pensatory damages" unjustified, ante, at 718, and it suggests that the District Court's previous award to the Tribeof all taxes paid into the registry after 1982 amounted to
a windfall big enough to provide at least rough restitutionfor the excessive share of taxes collected in the preceding six years. Ante, at 716, 719. At the same time, theCourt says it imposes no bar to the possibility of further
remedial action in the trial court. Perhaps the Court seesthe windfall only when it regards the Tribe as one of two
rival taxing authorities, as distinct from the Tribe as a prop-erty owner that has suffered as such. I trust that this distinction is open for exploration and development upon re-mand. Whether the Tribe is equitably entitled to a penny
more than it has now, I do not know, but I think it is clearthat nothing in this record disentitles the Tribe at least to
press for disgorgement of some or all of Montana's pre-1983excess tax revenues.

OHIO FORESTRY ASSOCIATION, INC. v. SIERRACLUB

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 97-16. Argued February 25, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998
Pursuant to the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), the

United States Forest Service developed a Land and Resource Management Plan (Plan) for Ohio's Wayne National Forest. Although the Plan
makes logging in the forest more likely--it sets logging goals, selects
the areas suited to timber production, and determines which probable
methods of timber harvest are appropriate--it does not itself authorize
the cutting of any trees. Before the Service can permit logging, the
NFMA and applicable regulations require it to: (a) propose a particular
site and specific harvesting method, (b) ensure that the project is consistent with the Plan, (c) provide affected parties with notice and an
opportunity to be heard, (d) conduct an environmental analysis of the
project, and (e) make a final decision to permit logging, which affected
persons may challenge in administrative and court appeals. Furthermore, the Service must revise the Plan as appropriate. When the Plan
was first proposed, the Sierra Club and another environmental organization (collectively Sierra Club) pursued various administrative remedies
to bring about the Plan's modification, and then brought this suit challenging the Plan's lawfulness on the ground that it permits too much
logging and too much clearcutting. The District Court granted the
Forest Service summary judgment, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.
The latter court found the dispute justiciable because, inter alia, it was
"ripe for review" and held that the Plan violated the NFMA.

Held: This dispute is not justiciable, because it is not ripe for court

review. Pp. 732-739.

(a) In deciding whether an agency decision is ripe, this Court has
examined the fitness of the particular issues for judicial decision and the
hardship to the parties of withholding review. Abbott Laboratories v.
Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 149. Such an examination in this case reveals
that the relevant factors, taken together, foreclose court review. First,
withholding review will not cause the plaintiffs significant "hardship."
Ibid. The challenged Plan provisions do not create adverse effects of
a strictly legal kind; for example, they do not establish a legal right to
cut trees or abolish any legal authority to object to trees being cut. Cf.
United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., 273 U. S. 299, 309-310.

Nor would delaying review cause the Sierra Club significant practical
harm. Given the procedural requirements the Service must observe
before it can permit logging, the Sierra Club need not bring its challenge
now, but may await a later time when harm is more imminent and certain. Cf. Abbott Laboratories, 387 U. S., at 152-154. Nor has the Sierra Club pointed to any other way in which the Plan could now force
it to modify its behavior to avoid future adverse consequences, as, for
example, agency regulations can sometimes force immediate compliance
through fear of future sanctions. Cf., e. g., id., at 152-153. Second,
court review now could interfere with the system that Congress specified for the Forest Service to reach logging decisions. From that
agency's perspective, immediate review could hinder its efforts to refine
its policies through revision of the Plan or application of the Plan in
practice. Cf., e. g., id., at 149. Here, the possibility that further consideration will actually occur before the Plan is implemented is real, not
theoretical. Third, the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental
Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82. Review now would require timeconsuming consideration of the details of an elaborate, technically based
Plan, which predicts consequences that may affect many different parcels of land in a variety of ways, and which effects themselves may
change over time. That review would have to take place without benefit of the focus that particular logging proposals could provide. And,
depending upon the agency's future actions to revise the Plan or modify
the expected implementation methods, review now may turn out to have
been unnecessary. See FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U. S. 232,
242. Finally, Congress has not specifically provided for preimplementation judicial review of such plans, unlike certain agency rules, cf., e. g.,
Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 891, and forest
plans are unlike environmental impact statements prepared pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 because claims involving
such statements can never get any riper. Pp. 732-737.

(b) The Court cannot consider the Sierra Club's argument that the
Plan will hurt it immediately in many ways not yet mentioned. That
argument makes its first appearance in this Court in the briefs on the
merits and is, therefore, not fairly presented. Pp. 738-739.

The Sierra Club challenges the lawfulness of a federal landand resource management plan adopted by the United States

Opinion of the Court
Federal Register, United States Government Manual 135(1997/1998). The National Forest Service, which manages

the System, develops land and resource management planspursuant to NFMA, and uses these forest plans to "guide all
natural resource management activities," 36 CFR $ 219.1(b)
(1997), including use of the land for "outdoor recreation,range, timber, watershed, wildlife and fish, and wilderness."

16 U. S. C. $ 1604(e)(1). In developing the plans, the Servicemust take both environmental and commercial goals into account. See, e. g., $ 1604(g); 36 CFR $ 219.1(a) (1997).This case focuses upon a plan that the Forest Service has
developed for the Wayne National Forest located in southern
Ohio. When the Service wrote the plan, the forest consisted
of 178,000 federally owned acres (278 sq. mi.) in three forest
units that are interspersed among privately owned lands,
some of which the Forest Service plans to acquire over time.
See Land and Resource Management Plan, Wayne National
Forest, United States Department of Agriculture, Forest
Service, Eastern Region (1987) 1-3, 3-1, A-13 to A-17 (hereinafter Plan). The Plan permits logging to take place on
126,000 (197 sq. mi.) of the federally owned acres. Id., at
4-7, 4-180. At the same time, it sets a ceiling on the total
amount of wood that can be cut--a ceiling that amounts to
about 75 million board feet over 10 years, and which, the
Plan projects, would lead to logging on about 8,000 acres
(12.5 sq. mi.) during that decade. Id., at 4-180. According
to the Plan, logging on about 5,000 (7.8 sq. mi.) of those 8,000
acres would involve clearcutting, or other forms of what the
Forest Service calls "even-aged" tree harvesting. Id., at
3-5, 4-180.

Although the Plan sets logging goals, selects the areas of
the forest that are suited to timber production, 16 U. S. C.

$ 1604(k), and determines which "probable methods of timber
harvest" are appropriate, $ 1604(f )(2), it does not itself authorize the cutting of any trees. Before the Forest Service
can permit the logging, it must: (a) propose a specific area in

which logging will take place and the harvesting methods tobe used, Plan 4-20 to 4-25; 53 Fed. Reg. 26835-26836 (1988);

(b) ensure that the project is consistent with the Plan, 16U. S. C. $ 1604(i); 36 CFR $ 219.10(e) (1997); (c) provide those
affected by proposed logging notice and an opportunity to be
heard, 106 Stat. 1419 (note following 16 U. S. C. $ 1612); 36CFR pt. 215, $ 217.1(b) (1997); Plan 5-2; (d) conduct an environmental analysis pursuant to the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U. S. C. $ 4332

et seq.; Plan

(1997); Plan 1-2; and (e) subsequently make a final decision
to permit logging, which affected persons may challenge in
an administrative appeals process and in court, see 106
Stat. 1419-1420 (note folowing 16 U. S. C. $ 1612); 5 U. S. C.

$ 701 et seq. See also 53 Fed. Reg. 26834-26835 (1988); 58
Fed. Reg. 19370-19371 (1993). Furthermore, the statute
requires the Forest Service to "revise" the Plan "as appropriate." 16 U. S. C. $ 1604(a). Despite the considerable
legal distance between the adoption of the Plan and the moment when a tree is cut, the Plan's promulgation nonetheless
makes logging more likely in that it is a logging precondition;
in its absence logging could not take place. See ibid. (requiring promulgation of forest plans); $ 1604(i) (requiring all
later forest uses to conform to forest plans).

When the Forest Service first proposed its Plan, the Sierra
Club and the Citizens Council on Conservation and Environmental Control each objected. In an effort to bring about
the Plan's modification, they (collectively Sierra Club), pursued various administrative remedies. See Administrative
Decision of the Chief of the Forest Service (Nov. 14, 1990),
Pet. for Cert. 66a; Appeal Decision, Wayne National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (Jan. 14, 1992), id., at
78a. The Sierra Club then brought this lawsuit in federal
court, initially against the Chief of the Forest Service, the
Secretary of Agriculture, the Regional Forester, and the

Opinion of the Court
Forest Supervisor. The Ohio Forestry Association, some ofwhose members harvest timber from the Wayne National

Forest or process wood products obtained from the forest,later intervened as a defendant.

The Sierra Club's second amended complaint sets forth its
legal claims. That complaint initially states facts that de-scribe the Plan in detail and allege that erroneous analysis

leads the Plan wrongly to favor logging and clearcutting.Second Amended Complaint |||| 13-47 (hereinafter Complaint), App. 16-23. The Complaint then sets forth threeclaims for relief.

The first claim for relief says that the "defendants in approving the plan for the Wayne [National Forest] and in directing or permitting below-cost timber sales accomplished
by means of clearcutting" violated various laws including the
NFMA, the NEPA, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Complaint || 49, id., at 24.

The second claim says that the "defendants' actions in directing or permitting below-cost timber sales in the Wayne
[National Forest] under the plan violate [their] duties as public trustees." Complaint || 52, ibid.

The third claim says that, in selecting the amount of the
forest suitable for timber production, the defendants followed regulations that failed properly to identify "economically unsuitable lands." Complaint |||| 54-58, id., at 25-26.
It adds that, because the Forest Service's regulations
thereby permitted the Service to place "economically unsuitable lands" in the category of land where logging could take
place, the regulations violated their authorizing statute,
NFMA, 16 U. S. C. $ 1600 et seq., and were "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law,"
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C.

$ 701 et seq. Complaint || 60, App. 26.

The Complaint finally requests as relief: (a) a declaration
that the Plan "is unlawful as are the below-cost timber sales
and timbering, including clearcutting, authorized by the

Opinion of the Court
plan," (b) an "injunction prohibiting the defendants from
permitting or directing further timber harvest and/or
below-cost timber sales" pending Plan revision, (c) costs and
attorney's fees, and (d) "such other further relief as may be
appropriate." Complaint |||| (a)-(d), id., at 26-27.

The District Court reviewed the Plan, decided that the
Forest Service had acted lawfully in making the various
determinations that the Sierra Club had challenged, and
granted summary judgment for the Forest Service. Sierra
Club v. Robertson, 845 F. Supp. 485, 503 (SD Ohio 1994).
The Sierra Club appealed. The Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit held that the dispute was justiciable, finding
both that the Sierra Club had standing to bring suit, and
that since the suit was "ripe for review," there was no need
to wait "until a site-specific action occurs." Sierra Club v.
Thomas, 105 F. 3d 248, 250 (1997). The Court of Appeals
disagreed with the District Court about the merits. It held
that the Plan improperly favored clearcutting and therefore
violated NFMA. Id., at 251-252. We granted certiorari to
determine whether the dispute about the Plan presents a
controversy that is justiciable now, and if so, whether the
Plan conforms to the statutory and regulatory requirements
for a forest plan.

II

Petitioner alleges that this suit is nonjusticiable both because the Sierra Club lacks standing to bring this case and
because the issues before us--over the Plan's specifications
for logging and clearcutting--are not yet ripe for adjudication. We find that the dispute is not justiciable, because it
is not ripe for court review. Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens For
Better Environment, ante, at 100-101, n. 3.

As this Court has previously pointed out, the ripeness
requirement is designed

"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature
adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract

523US3 Unit: $U65 [05-03-00 09:04:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
disagreements over administrative policies, and also toprotect the agencies from judicial interference until an

administrative decision has been formalized and its ef-fects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties."
Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148-149(1967).

In deciding whether an agency's decision is, or is not, ripefor judicial review, the Court has examined both the "fitness
of the issues for judicial decision" and the "hardship to theparties of withholding court consideration."

Id., at 149. Todo so in this case, we must consider: (1) whether delayed

review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs; (2) whetherjudicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with
further administrative action; and (3) whether the courtswould benefit from further factual development of the issues
presented. These considerations, taken together, foreclosereview in the present case.

First, to "withhol[d] court consideration" at present willnot cause the parties significant "hardship" as this Court has
come to use that term. Ibid. For one thing, the provisionsof the Plan that the Sierra Club challenges do not create
adverse effects of a strictly legal kind, that is, effects of asort that traditionally would have qualified as harm. To
paraphrase this Court's language in United States v. LosAngeles & Salt Lake R. Co., 273 U. S. 299, 309-310 (1927)
(opinion of Brandeis, J.), they do not command anyone to doanything or to refrain from doing anything; they do not
grant, withhold, or modify any formal legal license, power, orauthority; they do not subject anyone to any civil or criminal
liability; they create no legal rights or obligations. Thus,for example, the Plan does not give anyone a legal right to
cut trees, nor does it abolish anyone's legal authority to ob-ject to trees being cut.

Nor have we found that the Plan now inflicts significantpractical harm upon the interests that the Sierra Club advances--an important consideration in light of this Court's

523US3 Unit: $U65 [05-03-00 09:04:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
734 OHIO FORESTRY ASSN., INC. v. SIERRA CLUB

Opinion of the Court
modern ripeness cases. See, e. g., Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 152-154. As we have pointed out, before the Forest Service can permit logging, it must focus upon a particu-lar site, propose a specific harvesting method, prepare an

environmental review, permit the public an opportunity to
be heard, and (if challenged) justify the proposal in court.
Supra, at 729-730. The Sierra Club thus will have ample
opportunity later to bring its legal challenge at a time whenharm is more imminent and more certain. Any such later

challenge might also include a challenge to the lawfulness ofthe present Plan if (but only if ) the present Plan then matters, i. e., if the Plan plays a causal role with respect to the
future, then-imminent, harm from logging. Hence we do not
find a strong reason why the Sierra Club must bring its challenge now in order to get relief. Cf. Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 152.

Nor has the Sierra Club pointed to any other way in which
the Plan could now force it to modify its behavior in order to
avoid future adverse consequences, as, for example, agency
regulations can sometimes force immediate compliance
through fear of future sanctions. Cf. Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 152-153 (finding challenge ripe where plaintiffs
must comply with Federal Drug Administration labeling rule
at once and incur substantial economic costs or risk later
serious criminal and civil penalties for unlawful drug distribution); Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United
States, 316 U. S. 407, 417-419 (1942) (finding challenge ripe
where plaintiffs must comply with burdensome Federal Communications Commission rule at once or risk later loss of
license and consequent serious harm).

The Sierra Club does say that it will be easier, and certainly cheaper, to mount one legal challenge against the Plan
now, than to pursue many challenges to each site-specific logging decision to which the Plan might eventually lead. It
does not explain, however, why one initial site-specific victory (if based on the Plan's unlawfulness) could not, through

523US3 Unit: $U65 [05-03-00 09:04:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
preclusion principles, effectively carry the day. See Lujanv.

National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 894 (1990).
And, in any event, the Court has not considered this kind oflitigation cost saving sufficient by itself to justify review in a

case that would otherwise be unripe. The ripeness doctrine
reflects a judgment that the disadvantages of a prematurereview that may prove too abstract or unnecessary ordinarily outweigh the additional costs of--even repetitive--postimplementation litigation. See,

e. g., ibid. ("The caseby-case approach . . . is understandably frustrating to an or-ganization such as respondent, which has as its objective

across-the-board protection of our Nation's . . . forests . . . .
But this is the traditional, and remains the normal, mode of
operation of the courts"); FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.,
449 U. S. 232, 244 (1980); Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft
Clothing Co., 415 U. S. 1, 24 (1974); Petroleum Exploration,
Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 304 U. S. 209, 222 (1938).

Second, from the agency's perspective, immediate judicial
review directed at the lawfulness of logging and clearcutting
could hinder agency efforts to refine its policies: (a) through
revision of the Plan, e. g., in response to an appropriate proposed site-specific action that is inconsistent with the Plan,
see 53 Fed. Reg. 23807, 26836 (1988), or (b) through application of the Plan in practice, e. g., in the form of site-specific
proposals, which are subject to review by a court applying
purely legal criteria. Cf. Abbott Laboratories, supra, at
149; Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 201
(1983). Cf. Standard Oil Co., supra, at 242 (premature review "denies the agency an opportunity to correct its own
mistakes and to apply its expertise"). And, here, the possibility that further consideration will actually occur before
the Plan is implemented is not theoretical, but real. See,
e. g., 60 Fed. Reg. 18886, 18901 (1995) (forest plans often not
fully implemented), id., at 18905-18907 (discussing process
for amending forest plans); 58 Fed. Reg. 19369, 19370-19371

interfere with the system that Congress specified for the
agency to reach forest logging decisions.

Third, from the courts' perspective, review of the Sierra
Club's claims regarding logging and clearcutting now would
require time-consuming judicial consideration of the details
of an elaborate, technically based plan, which predicts consequences that may affect many different parcels of land in a
variety of ways, and which effects themselves may change
over time. That review would have to take place without
benefit of the focus that a particular logging proposal could
provide. Thus, for example, the court below in evaluating
the Sierra Club's claims had to focus upon whether the Plan
as a whole was "improperly skewed," rather than focus upon
whether the decision to allow clearcutting on a particular
site was improper, say, because the site was better suited to
another use or logging there would cumulatively result in
too many trees being cut. See 105 F. 3d, at 250-251. And,
of course, depending upon the agency's future actions to revise the Plan or modify the expected methods of implementation, review now may turn out to have been unnecessary.
See Standard Oil Co., supra, at 242.

This type of review threatens the kind of "abstract disagreements over administrative policies," Abbott Laboratories, 387 U. S., at 148, that the ripeness doctrine seeks to
avoid. In this case, for example, the Court of Appeals panel
disagreed about whether or not the Forest Service suffered
from a kind of general "bias" in favor of timber production
and clearcutting. Review where the consequences had been
"reduced to more manageable proportions," and where the

Opinion of the Court
"factual components [were] fleshed out, by some concrete
action" might have led the panel majority either to demonstrate that bias and its consequences through record citation
(which it did not do) or to abandon the claim. National
Wildlife Federation, supra, at 891. All this is to say that
further factual development would "significantly advance our
ability to deal with the legal issues presented" and would
"aid us in their resolution." Duke Power Co. v. Carolina
Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82 (1978).

Finally, Congress has not provided for preimplementation
judicial review of forest plans. Those plans are tools for
agency planning and management. The Plan is consequently unlike agency rules that Congress has specifically
instructed the courts to review "pre-enforcement." Cf. National Wildlife Federation, supra, at 891; 15 U. S. C. $ 2618
(Toxic Substances Control Act) (providing preenforcement
review of agency action); 30 U. S. C. $ 1276(a) (Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977) (same); 42 U. S. C.

$ 6976 (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976)
(same); $ 7607( b) (Clean Air Act) (same); 43 U. S. C.

$ 1349(c)(3) (Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act); Harrison v.
PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 592-593 (1980). Nor
does the Plan, which through standards guides future use of
forests, resemble an environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to NEPA. That is because in this respect
NEPA, unlike the NFMA, simply guarantees a particular
procedure, not a particular result. Compare 16 U. S. C.

$ 1604(e) (requiring that forest plans provide for multiple coordinated use of forests, including timber and wilderness)
with 42 U. S. C. $ 4332 (requiring that agencies prepare environmental impact statements where major agency action
would significantly affect the environment). Hence a person
with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with the
NEPA procedure may complain of that failure at the time
the failure takes place, for the claim can never get riper.

738 OHIO FORESTRY ASSN., INC. v. SIERRA CLUB

Opinion of the Court

III
The Sierra Club makes one further important contrary argument. It says that the Plan will hurt it in many ways
that we have not yet mentioned. Specifically, the Sierra
Club says that the Plan will permit "many intrusive activities, such as opening trails to motorcycles or using heavy
machinery," which "will go forward without any additional
consideration of their impact on wilderness recreation."
Brief for Respondents 34. At the same time, in areas designated for logging, "affirmative measures to promote undisturbed backcountry recreation, such as closing roads and
building additional hiking trails," will not take place. Ibid.
These are harms, says the Sierra Club, that will not take
place at a distant future time. Rather, they will take place
now.

This argument suffers from the legally fatal problem that
it makes its first appearance here in this Court in the briefs
on the merits. The Complaint, fairly read, does not include
such claims. Instead, it focuses on the amount and method
of timber harvesting. The Sierra Club has not referred us
to any other court documents in which it protests the Plan's
approval of motorcycles or machinery, the Plan's failure to
close roads or to provide for the building of trails, or other
disruptions that the Plan might cause those who use the forest for hiking. As far as we can tell, prior to the argument
on the merits here, the harm to which the Sierra Club objected consisted of too much, and the wrong kind of, logging.

The matter is significant because the Government concedes that if the Sierra Club had previously raised these
other kinds of harm, the ripeness analysis in this case with
respect to those provisions of the Plan that produce the harm
would be significantly different. The Government's brief in
the Court of Appeals said:

"If, for example, a plan incorporated a final decision to
close a specific area to off-road vehicles, the plan itself

Opinion of the Court
could result in imminent concrete injury to a party withan interest in the use of off-road vehicles in that area."

Brief for Federal Appellees in No. 94-3407 (CA6), p. 20.
And, at oral argument, the Solicitor General agreed thatif the Sierra Club's claim was that the "plan was allowing

motorcycles into a bird-watching area or something [likethat], that would be immediately justiciable." Tr. of Oral
Arg. 5. Thus, we believe these other claims that the SierraClub now raises are not fairly presented here, and we cannot
consider them. IV

For these reasons, we find the respondents' suit not ripefor review. We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand this case with instructions to dismiss.

It is so ordered.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-391. Argued March 24, 1998--Decided May 26, 1998
Chapter 154 of 28 U. S. C., part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death

Penalty Act of 1996, provides, inter alia, an expedited review process--
including a 180-day filing period, 28 U. S. C. $ 2263(a) (1994 ed., Supp.
II)--for federal habeas proceedings in capital cases in States that meet
certain conditions. Proceedings against other States are governed by
Chapter 153, which has a 1-year filing period, $ 2244(d)(1), and lacks
expedited procedures. After California officials, including petitioner
state attorney general, indicated that they would invoke Chapter 154's
protections, respondent, a state capital prisoner, sought declaratory and
injunctive relief to resolve whether the chapter applied to a class of
capital prisoners whose convictions were affirmed after a particular
date. The Federal District Court issued a declaratory judgment, holding that California did not qualify for Chapter 154 and therefore the
chapter did not apply to the class, and enjoined petitioners from invoking the chapter in any proceedings involving class members. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected petitioners' claim that the Eleventh
Amendment barred respondent's suit; determined that the District
Court had authority to issue a declaratory judgment under the federal
Declaratory Judgment Act; and rejected petitioners' contention that the
injunction violated the First Amendment. Before reaching the Eleventh and First Amendment issues on which certiorari was granted, this
Court must address whether the action is the type of "Article III" "case
or controversy" to which federal courts are limited. See, e. g., FW/PBS,
Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 230-231.

Held: This action is not a justiciable case under Article III. The Declaratory Judgment Act validly confers jurisdiction on federal courts to
enter declaratory judgments in cases where the controversy would
admit "of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as
distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a
hypothetical state of facts." Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.

of the underlying controversy--whether respondent is entitled to federal habeas relief--respondent carved out of that claim only the ques523US3 Unit: $U66 [05-09-00 11:32:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion whether, when he sought habeas relief, California's defense would
be governed by Chapter 153 or Chapter 154. He would have obtained
such a determination in a habeas action itself, but he seeks instead to
have an advance ruling on the collateral issue. The Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be used for this purpose. See, e. g., Coffman v. Breeze
Corps., 323 U. S. 316. Such an action's disruptive effects are peculiarly great when the underlying claims must be adjudicated in federal
habeas, for it would allow respondent to obtain a declaration as to the
applicable limitations period without ever having shown that he has met
the exhaustion-of-state-remedies requirement. If class members file
habeas petitions and the State asserts Chapter 154, they can litigate
California's compliance with the chapter at that time. The risk associated with resolving the issue in habeas rather than in a pre-emptive
suit is no different from risks associated with choices that litigants commonly face. Respondent mistakenly relies on Steffel v. Thompson, 415
U. S. 452, for Steffel falls within the traditional scope of declaratory
judgment actions: It completely resolved a concrete controversy susceptible to conclusive judicial determination. Pp. 745-749.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Chapter 154 of 28 U. S. C., part of the Antiterrorism andEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C.

$ 2261 et seq. (1994 ed., Supp. II), provides certain proceduraladvantages to qualifying States in federal habeas proceedings. This case requires us to decide whether state death-row inmates may sue state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief limited to determining whether Californiaqualifies under Chapter 154.

Chapter 154 revises procedural rules for federal habeasproceedings in capital cases. Most notably, it provides for
an expedited review process in proceedings brought againstqualifying States. It imposes a 180-day limitation period
for filing a federal habeas petition. $ 2263(a). It treats anuntimely petition as a successive petition for purposes of obtaining a stay of execution, $ 2262(c), and it allows a prisonerto amend a petition after an answer is filed only where the
prisoner meets the requirements for a successive petition,$ 2266(b)(3)(B). Chapter 154 also obligates a federal district
court to render a final judgment on any petition within 180days of its filing, and a court of appeals to render a final
determination within 120 days of the briefing. $$ 2266(a)and (c).

Opinion of the Court
governs federal habeas proceedings against a State. Chapter 154 will apply in capital cases only if the State meets
certain conditions. A State must establish "a mechanism
for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel" in state
postconviction proceedings, and "must provide standards of
competency for the appointment of such counsel." $ 2261(b)
(States with separate postconviction review proceedings);

$ 2265(a) (States with unitary review procedures).1 The
State must offer counsel to all capital defendants, and the
state court must enter an order concerning appointment of
counsel. $$ 2261(b), 2265(b). If a State meets these criteria, then it may invoke Chapter 154.

Various California officials, including petitioner Attorney
General Lungren, publicly indicated that they thought California qualified under Chapter 154 and that they intended
to invoke the chapter's protections. Respondent Troy Ashmus, a state prisoner sentenced to death, filed a class-action
suit against petitioners. The class, which included all capital prisoners in California whose convictions were affirmed
on direct appeal after June 6, 1989, sought declaratory and
injunctive relief to resolve uncertainty over whether Chapter 154 applied.

The District Court issued a declaratory judgment holding
that California does not presently qualify for Chapter 154
and that Chapter 154 therefore does not apply to any class
members. It also issued a preliminary injunction enjoining petitioners from "trying or seeking to obtain for the
State of California the benefits of the provisions of Chapter
154 . . . in any state or federal proceedings involving any
class member." 935 F. Supp. 1048, 1076 (ND Cal. 1996).

1 It is undisputed here that California is a unitary review State, which
is a State that allows prisoners to raise collateral challenges in the course
of direct review of the judgment, such that all claims may be raised in a
single state appeal. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2265(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II).

744 CALDERON v. ASHMUS

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 123F. 3d 1199 (1997). As a threshold matter, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' claim that the Eleventh Amend-ment barred respondent's suit as one against the State. The
court concluded that the case falls within the Ex parte Young
exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity, Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), because respondent sufficiently
alleged a continuing violation of federal law. 123 F. 3d,at 1204-1206. California's announced intention to invoke

Chapter 154, without having complied with its requirements,threatened to violate the class members' right to thorough
federal review of their first habeas petitions, pursuant to
Chapter 153, and their right to assistance of counsel in federal habeas proceedings, pursuant to 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q). By
stating its intention to invoke Chapter 154, the Court of
Appeals reasoned, California forced inmates to make an unacceptable choice: filing a pro se petition within 180 days in
order to ensure compliance with Chapter 154, which may fail
to raise substantial claims, or waiting until counsel is appointed, which may miss the 180-day filing deadline if Chapter 154 applies. 123 F. 3d, at 1204-1205.

The Court of Appeals also determined that the District
Court had authority to issue a declaratory judgment under
28 U. S. C. $ 2201(a). 123 F. 3d, at 1206-1207. It noted that
a declaratory judgment plaintiff need only demonstrate an
independent basis of federal jurisdiction and an actual case
or controversy. Id., at 1206. The District Court had federal question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 because the
case challenged the interpretation of a federal Act. And the
case-or-controversy requirement was satisfied, the court concluded, because "the State's threats to invoke Chapter 154
will significantly affect the plaintiff-class's ability to obtain habeas corpus review by a federal court." 123 F. 3d,
at 1207.

The Court of Appeals agreed in large part with the District Court's conclusion that California does not qualify, and

Opinion of the Court
therefore found Chapter 154 inapplicable. In affirming thegrant of injunctive relief, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' contention that enjoining their advocacy of a particu-lar legal position violates the First Amendment. It thought
the injunction did not interfere with the state officials' rightssince they were free to voice their opinion that the decision
was wrong--only not in court in order to invoke the benefitsof Chapter 154.

Id., at 1207-1209.Petitioners sought review in this Court. We granted

certiorari on both the Eleventh Amendment and the FirstAmendment issues, 522 U. S. 1011 (1997), but in keeping with
our precedents, have decided that we must first address
whether this action for a declaratory judgment is the sort of"Article III" "case or controversy" to which federal courts

are limited. See, e. g., FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215,230-231 (1990).

Before the enactment of the federal Declaratory Judgment
Act, this Court expressed the view that a "declaratory judgment" was not within that jurisdiction. Willing v. Chicago
Auditorium Assn., 277 U. S. 274, 289 (1928). But in Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249 (1933), theCourt held that it did have jurisdiction to review a declaratory judgment granted by a state court. And in Aetna Life
Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227 (1937), we decided that the
federal Declaratory Judgment Act validly conferred juris-diction on federal courts to issue declaratory judgments in

appropriate cases.

That Act provides that "[i]n a case of actual controversywithin its jurisdiction, . . . any court of the United States . . .

may declare the rights and other legal relations of any inter2 While the Eleventh Amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is
a limitation on the federal court's judicial power, and therefore can be
raised at any stage of the proceedings, we have recognized that it is not
coextensive with the limitations on judicial power in Article III. See
Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267 (1997); Patsy v.
Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 515, n. 19 (1982).

ested party seeking such declaration, whether or not furtherrelief is or could be sought." 28 U. S. C. $ 2201. See also

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 57. Thus, in Aetna Life Ins., we heldthat an insurance company could bring a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of insurance policies.
The company and the insured disputed whether the policieshad lapsed and how much was currently payable, but the

insured had not brought suit to recover benefits. 300 U. S.,at 239-240. We observed that the controversy would admit
"of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law
would be upon a hypothetical state of facts." Id., at 241.See also

Wallace, supra, at 262. We have thus recognized
the potential for declaratory judgment suits to fall outside
the constitutional definition of a "case" in Article III: a claim" `brought before the court(s) for determination by such regular proceedings as are established by law or custom for theprotection or enforcement of rights, or the prevention, redress, or punishment of wrongs.' " Fairchild v. Hughes, 258U. S. 126, 129 (1922).

The underlying "controversy" between petitioners and re-spondent is whether respondent is entitled to federal habeas
relief setting aside his sentence or conviction obtained in
the California courts. But no such final or conclusive determination was sought in this action. Instead, respondent
carved out of that claim only the question whether, when he
sought habeas relief, California would be governed by Chapter 153 or by Chapter 154 in defending the action. Had he
brought a habeas action itself, he undoubtedly would have
obtained such a determination, but he seeks to have that
question determined in anticipation of seeking habeas so that
he will be better able to know, for example, the time limits
that govern the habeas action.

We think previous decisions of this Court bar the use of
the Declaratory Judgment Act for this purpose. In Coffman v. Breeze Corps., 323 U. S. 316 (1945), a patent owner
brought suit seeking to have the Royalty Adjustment Act

523US3 Unit: $U66 [05-09-00 11:32:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
declared unconstitutional and to enjoin his licensee from pay-ing accrued royalties to the government. The Court held

that the action presented no case or controversy. The valid-ity of the Act would properly arise only in a suit by the
patent holder to recover the royalties, which could afford
complete and adequate relief. In such a suit, if the licenseewere to assert compliance with the Act as a defense to an

obligation to pay the amounts due, the patent holder's rightof recovery would then depend on a determination of the
Act's validity. Id., at 322-323. The Court thus concludedthat there was no justiciable question "unless and until [the
patent owner] seeks recovery of the royalties, and then onlyif [the licensee] relies on the Act as a defense."

Id., at 324.
See also Public Serv. Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344
U. S. 237, 245-246 (1952).As in

Coffman, respondent here seeks a declaratory judgment as to the validity of a defense the State may, or maynot, raise in a habeas proceeding. Such a suit does not

merely allow the resolution of a "case or controversy" in analternative format, as in

Aetna Life Ins., supra, but rather
attempts to gain a litigation advantage by obtaining an ad-vance ruling on an affirmative defense, see

Coffman, supra,
at 322-324; Wycoff Co., supra, at 245-246. The "case or controversy" actually at stake is the class members' claims in
their individual habeas proceedings. Any judgment in this
action thus would not resolve the entire case or controversy
as to any one of them, but would merely determine a collateral legal issue governing certain aspects of their pending or
future suits.

The disruptive effects of an action such as this are peculiarly great when the underlying claim must be adjudicated
in a federal habeas proceeding. For we have held that any
claim by a prisoner attacking the validity or duration of his
confinement must be brought under the habeas sections of
Title 28 of the United States Code. Preiser v. Rodriguez,
411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973). As that opinion pointed out, this
means that a state prisoner is required to exhaust state rem523US3 Unit: $U66 [05-09-00 11:32:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
748 CALDERON v. ASHMUS

Opinion of the Court
edies before bringing his claim to a federal court. Id., at
489-491. But if respondent Ashmus is allowed to maintain
the present action, he would obtain a declaration as to the
applicable statute of limitations in a federal habeas action
without ever having shown that he has exhausted state remedies. This aberration illustrates the need, emphasized in
Coffman and Wycoff, to prevent federal-court litigants from
seeking by declaratory judgment to litigate a single issue
in a dispute that must await another lawsuit for complete
resolution.

If the class members file habeas petitions, and the State
asserts Chapter 154, the members obviously can litigate California's compliance with Chapter 154 at that time.3 Any
risk associated with resolving the question in habeas, rather
than a pre-emptive suit, is no different from risks associated
with choices commonly faced by litigants.

When asked at oral argument what authority existed for
allowing a declaratory judgment suit on an anticipated defense, respondent replied that Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.
452 (1974), allows a declaratory judgment action to prevent
interference with federal rights. See also Brief for Respondent 16. Although acknowledging that Steffel involved
a continuing threat of arrest in violation of the First Amendment, respondent argued that the Court's decision did not
distinguish types of threats. Here, according to respondent,
the State's "threat" to assert Chapter 154 in habeas proceedings and the risk that the class members will thereby lose

3 Respondent conceded this point in earlier briefings. Brief in Opposition 7. Respondent now contends, however, that habeas proceedings
will not provide an effective remedy because the class members still will
be put in the file-or-default dilemma and because a decision in one case
will not relieve the other members of their continuing uncertainty. Brief
for Respondent 35-36. But as explained, supra, at 747, the dilemma the
class members face does not establish a case in the constitutional sense.
And the inability to bind the government as to the whole class does not
affect that determination.

Breyer, J., concurring
their rights to application of Chapter 153 are sufficient toestablish federal court jurisdiction.

Steffel, however, falls within the traditional scope of de-claratory judgment actions because it completely resolved a
concrete controversy susceptible to conclusive judicial deter-mination. In

Steffel, protesters had twice been told theywould be arrested for handbilling in front of a shopping center, and the plaintiff 's companion had in fact been arrestedafter disregarding instructions to leave. Id., at 455-456.
The imminent threat of state criminal prosecution and theconsequent deterrence of the plaintiff 's exercise of constitutionally protected rights established a case or controversy.
Id., at 459. That controversy could have been completelyresolved by the declaratory judgment sought by the plaintiff.

Id., at 460-462.The differences between this case and Steffel are several.
Here, California's assertions on Chapter 154 have no coerciveimpact on the legal rights or obligations of either party. It
is the members of the class, and not the State, who anticipatefiling lawsuits. Those habeas actions would challenge the
validity of their state court convictions and sentences; theState will oppose such challenges. The present declaratory
judgment action would not completely resolve those chal-lenges, but would simply carve out one issue in the dispute
for separate adjudication.We conclude that this action for a declaratory judgment
and injunctive relief is not a justiciable case within the mean-ing of Article III. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
accordingly is reversed, and the case is remanded withinstructions that respondent's complaint be dismissed.

"file habeas petitions." Ante, at 748. In light of the Courtof Appeals' concern, echoed by respondent class members,

that without declaratory relief, they would be placed in anuntenable remedial "dilemma," Brief for Respondent 16-17,
35-37; 123 F. 3d 1199, 1205 (CA9 1997), I would add that itshould prove possible for at least some habeas petitioners to
obtain a relatively expeditious judicial answer to the Chapter154 compliance question and thereby provide legal guidance
for others. That is because, in at least some cases, whethera petitioner can or cannot amend, say, a "bare bones" habeas
petition (filed within 180 days) will likely depend uponwhether California does, or does not, qualify as an "opt-in"
State. Compare 28 U. S. C. $ 2242 (ordinary amendmentrules); $ 2254 Rule 11 (rules of civil procedure applicable to
federal habeas petitions); 1 J. Liebman & R. Hertz, FederalHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure $ 17.2 (2d ed. 1994
and Supp. 1997) (Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15's liberalstandard for amendment applies to habeas petitions in States
not eligible for Chapter 154); with 28 U. S. C. $ 2266(b)(3)(B)(1994 ed., Supp. II) (setting forth strict standard for amendment applicable where State falls within Chapter 154). Anda district court's determination that turned on the legal answer to that question might well qualify for interlocutoryappeal. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) (permitting certification,
and hence interlocutory appeal, of certain district court de-terminations). With this understanding, I join the Court's
opinion.

KIOWA TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA v. MANUFACTURINGTECHNOLOGIES, INC.

certiorari to the court of civil appeals ofoklahoma, first division
No. 96-1037. Argued January 12, 1998--Decided May 26, 1998
Petitioner, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, owns land in Oklahoma,

and the United States holds land in trust for it there. After the Tribe's
industrial development commission agreed to buy from respondent certain stock issued by a third party, the then-chairman of its business
committee signed a promissory note, in the Tribe's name, agreeing to
pay respondent $285,000 plus interest. The note recites it was signed
at Carnegie, Oklahoma, where the Tribe has a complex on trust land.
According to respondent, however, the note was executed and delivered
in Oklahoma City, beyond tribal lands, and obligated the Tribe to make
its payments in that city. The note does not specify a governing law,
but provides that nothing in it subjects or limits the Tribe's sovereign
rights. The Tribe defaulted on the note; respondent sued in state court;
and the Tribe moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, relying in part
on its sovereign immunity from suit. The trial court denied the motion
and entered judgment for respondent. The Oklahoma Court of Civil
Appeals affirmed, holding that Indian tribes are subject to suit in state
court for breaches of contract involving off-reservation commercial
conduct.

Held: Indian tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from civil suits on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental or commercial
activities and whether they were made on or off a reservation. As a
matter of federal law, a tribe is subject to suit only where Congress
has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity. See, e. g.,
Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S. 877, 890. Respondent's request to confine such
immunity to transactions on reservations and to tribal governmental
activities is rejected. This Court's precedents have not drawn those
distinctions, see, e. g., Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of
Wash., 433 U. S. 165, 168, 172, and its cases allowing States to apply
their substantive laws to tribal activities occurring outside Indian country or involving nonmembers have recognized that tribes continue to
enjoy immunity from suit, see, e. g., Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen
Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505, 510. The Okla523US3 Unit: $U67 [04-28-00 22:38:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

homa Court of Civil Appeals' belief that federal law does not mandate
such immunity is mistaken. It is a matter of federal law and is not
subject to diminution by the States. E. g., Three Affiliated Tribes,
supra, at 891. Nevertheless, the tribal immunity doctrine developed
almost by accident: The Court's precedents reciting it, see, e. g., United
States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506, 512, rest
on early cases that assumed immunity without extensive reasoning, see,
e. g., Turner v. United States, 248 U. S. 354, 358. The wisdom of perpetuating the doctrine may be doubted, but the Court chooses to adhere to
its earlier decisions in deference to Congress, see Potawatomi, supra,
at 510, which may wish to exercise its authority to limit tribal immunity
through explicit legislation, see, e. g., Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,
436 U. S. 49, 58. Congress has not done so thus far, nor has petitioner
waived immunity, so it governs here. Pp. 754-760.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this commercial suit against an Indian Tribe, the Okla-homa Court of Civil Appeals rejected the Tribe's claim of

sovereign immunity. Our case law to date often recites therule of tribal immunity from suit. While these precedents
rest on early cases that assumed immunity without extensivereasoning, we adhere to these decisions and reverse the
judgment. I

Petitioner Kiowa Tribe is an Indian Tribe recognized bythe Federal Government. The Tribe owns land in Oklahoma, and, in addition, the United States holds land in thatState in trust for the Tribe. Though the record is vague
about some key details, the facts appear to be as follows: In1990, a tribal entity called the Kiowa Industrial Development
Commission agreed to buy from respondent ManufacturingTechnologies, Inc., certain stock issued by Clinton-Sherman
Aviation, Inc. On April 3, 1990, the then-chairman of theTribe's business committee signed a promissory note in the
name of the Tribe. By its note, the Tribe agreed to payManufacturing Technologies $285,000 plus interest. The
face of the note recites it was signed at Carnegie, Oklahoma,

the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota) Community et al. by Steven
F. Olson.

Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the State of
Oklahoma by W. A. Drew Edmondson, Attorney General, and Neal

where the Tribe has a complex on land held in trust for theTribe. According to respondent, however, the Tribe executed and delivered the note to Manufacturing Technologiesin Oklahoma City, beyond the Tribe's lands, and the note obligated the Tribe to make its payments in Oklahoma City.The note does not specify a governing law. In a paragraph
entitled "Waivers and Governing Law," it does provide:"Nothing in this Note subjects or limits the sovereign rights
of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma." App. 14.The Tribe defaulted; respondent sued on the note in
state court; and the Tribe moved to dismiss for lack of ju-risdiction, relying in part on its sovereign immunity from
suit. The trial court denied the motion and entered judg-ment for respondent. The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals
affirmed, holding Indian tribes are subject to suit in statecourt for breaches of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct. The Oklahoma Supreme Court declined toreview the judgment, and we granted certiorari. 521 U. S.
1117 (1997). II

As a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject to suitonly where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has
waived its immunity. See Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort
Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S.877, 890 (1986); Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S.

49, 58 (1978); United States v. United States Fidelity &Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506, 512 (1940) (USF&G). To date,
our cases have sustained tribal immunity from suit withoutdrawing a distinction based on where the tribal activities
occurred. In one case, a state court had asserted jurisdic-tion over tribal fishing "both on and off its reservation."
Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433U. S. 165, 167 (1977). We held the Tribe's claim of immunity was "well founded," though we did not discuss the rele-vance of where the fishing had taken place.

Id., at 168, 172.Nor have we yet drawn a distinction between governmental

Opinion of the Court
and commercial activities of a tribe. See, e. g., ibid. (recog-nizing tribal immunity for fishing, which may well be a commercial activity); Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band
of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505 (1991) (recognizing tribal immunity from suit over taxation of cigarette
sales); USF&G, supra, (recognizing tribal immunity for coal-mining lease). Though respondent asks us to confine immunity from suit to transactions on reservations and to gov-ernmental activities, our precedents have not drawn these
distinctions.Our cases allowing States to apply their substantive laws
to tribal activities are not to the contrary. We have recognized that a State may have authority to tax or regulate
tribal activities occurring within the State but outside Indian
country. See Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S.
145, 148-149 (1973); see also Organized Village of Kake v.
Egan, 369 U. S. 60, 75 (1962). To say substantive state laws
apply to off-reservation conduct, however, is not to say that
a tribe no longer enjoys immunity from suit. In Potawatomi, for example, we reaffirmed that while Oklahoma may
tax cigarette sales by a Tribe's store to nonmembers, the
Tribe enjoys immunity from a suit to collect unpaid state
taxes. 498 U. S., at 510. There is a difference between the
right to demand compliance with state laws and the means
available to enforce them. See id., at 514.

The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals nonetheless believed
federal law did not mandate tribal immunity, resting its holding on the decision in Hoover v. Oklahoma, 909 P. 2d 59
(Okla. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1188 (1996). In Hoover,
the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that tribal immunity for
off-reservation commercial activity, like the decision not to
exercise jurisdiction over a sister State, is solely a matter of
comity. 909 P. 2d, at 62 (citing Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410,
426 (1979)). According to Hoover, because the State holds
itself open to breach of contract suits, it may allow its citizens to sue other sovereigns acting within the State. We

Opinion of the Court

have often noted, however, that the immunity possessed by
Indian tribes is not coextensive with that of the States.
See, e. g., Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S.
775 (1991). In Blatchford, we distinguished state sovereign
immunity from tribal sovereign immunity, as tribes were not
at the Constitutional Convention. They were thus not parties to the "mutuality of . . . concession" that "makes the
States' surrender of immunity from suit by sister States
plausible." Id., at 782; accord, Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe
of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268-269 (1997). So tribal immunity
is a matter of federal law and is not subject to diminution by
the States. Three Affiliated Tribes, supra, at 891; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S.
134, 154 (1980).

Though the doctrine of tribal immunity is settled law
and controls this case, we note that it developed almost by
accident. The doctrine is said by some of our own opinions
to rest on the Court's opinion in Turner v. United States,
248 U. S. 354 (1919). See, e. g., Potawatomi, supra, at 510.
Though Turner is indeed cited as authority for the immunity,
examination shows it simply does not stand for that proposition. The case arose on lands within the Creek Nation's
"public domain" and subject to "the powers of [the] sovereign
people." 248 U. S., at 355. The Creek Nation gave each individual Creek grazing rights to a portion of the Creek Nation's public lands, and 100 Creeks in turn leased their grazing rights to Turner, a non-Indian. He built a long fence
around the land, but a mob of Creek Indians tore the fence
down. Congress then passed a law allowing Turner to sue
the Creek Nation in the Court of Claims. The Court of
Claims dismissed Turner's suit, and the Court, in an opinion
by Justice Brandeis, affirmed. The Court stated: "The fundamental obstacle to recovery is not the immunity of a sovereign to suit, but the lack of a substantive right to recover
the damages resulting from failure of a government or its

523US3 Unit: $U67 [04-28-00 22:38:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
officers to keep the peace." Id., at 358. "No such liabilityexisted by the general law."

Id., at 357.
The quoted language is the heart of Turner. It is, atbest, an assumption of immunity for the sake of argument,

not a reasoned statement of doctrine. One cannot even say
the Court or Congress assumed the congressional enactmentwas needed to overcome tribal immunity. There was a very

different reason why Congress had to pass the Act: "Thetribal government had been dissolved. Without authorization from Congress, the Nation could not then have beensued in any court; at least without its consent."

Id., at 358.
The fact of tribal dissolution, not its sovereign status, was
the predicate for the legislation authorizing suit. Turner,
then, is but a slender reed for supporting the principle of
tribal sovereign immunity.

Turner's passing reference to immunity, however, did
become an explicit holding that tribes had immunity from
suit. We so held in USF&G, saying: "These Indian Nations
are exempt from suit without Congressional authorization."
309 U. S., at 512 (citing Turner, supra, at 358). As sovereigns or quasi sovereigns, the Indian Nations enjoyed immunity "from judicial attack" absent consent to be sued.
309 U. S., at 513-514. Later cases, albeit with little analysis,
reiterated the doctrine. E. g., Puyallup, 433 U. S., at 167,
172-173; Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U. S., at 58; Three Affiliated Tribes, 476 U. S., at 890-891; Blatchford, supra, at 782;
Coeur d'Alene, supra, at 268.

The doctrine of tribal immunity came under attack a few
years ago in Potawatomi, supra. The petitioner there
asked us to abandon or at least narrow the doctrine because
tribal businesses had become far removed from tribal selfgovernance and internal affairs. We retained the doctrine,
however, on the theory that Congress had failed to abrogate
it in order to promote economic development and tribal selfsufficiency. Id., at 510. The rationale, it must be said, can
be challenged as inapposite to modern, wide-ranging tribal

Opinion of the Court

enterprises extending well beyond traditional tribal customsand activities.

Justice Stevens, in a separate opinion,
criticized tribal immunity as "founded upon an anachronisticfiction" and suggested it might not extend to off-reservation

commercial activity. Id., at 514-515 (concurring opinion).

There are reasons to doubt the wisdom of perpetuatingthe doctrine. At one time, the doctrine of tribal immunity

from suit might have been thought necessary to protect nas-cent tribal governments from encroachments by States. In
our interdependent and mobile society, however, tribal im-munity extends beyond what is needed to safeguard tribal
self-governance. This is evident when tribes take part in
the Nation's commerce. Tribal enterprises now include ski
resorts, gambling, and sales of cigarettes to non-Indians.
See Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145 (1973);
Potawatomi, supra; Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517
U. S. 44 (1996). In this economic context, immunity can
harm those who are unaware that they are dealing with a
tribe, who do not know of tribal immunity, or who have no
choice in the matter, as in the case of tort victims.

These considerations might suggest a need to abrogate
tribal immunity, at least as an overarching rule. Respondent does not ask us to repudiate the principle outright, but
suggests instead that we confine it to reservations or to noncommercial activities. We decline to draw this distinction
in this case, as we defer to the role Congress may wish to
exercise in this important judgment.

Congress has acted against the background of our decisions. It has restricted tribal immunity from suit in limited
circumstances. See, e. g., 25 U. S. C. $ 450f(c)(3) (mandatory
liability insurance); $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) (gaming activities).
And in other statutes it has declared an intention not to
alter it. See, e. g., $ 450n (nothing in financial-assistance
program is to be construed as "affecting, modifying, diminishing, or otherwise impairing the sovereign immunity from
suit enjoyed by an Indian tribe"); see also Potawatomi, 498

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 510 (discussing Indian Financing Act of 1974, 88Stat. 77, 25 U. S. C. $ 1451

et seq.).
In considering Congress' role in reforming tribal immu-nity, we find instructive the problems of sovereign immunity

for foreign countries. As with tribal immunity, foreign sovereign immunity began as a judicial doctrine. Chief JusticeMarshall held that United States courts had no jurisdiction

over an armed ship of a foreign state, even while in an Amer-ican port.

Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116
(1812). While the holding was narrow, "that opinion cameto be regarded as extending virtually absolute immunity to

foreign sovereigns." Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983). In 1952, the State Department issued what came to be known as the Tate Letter, announcing the policy of denying immunity for the commercial
acts of a foreign nation. See id., at 486-487. Difficulties in
implementing the principle led Congress in 1976 to enact the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, resulting in more predictable and precise rules. See id., at 488-489 (discussing
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C.

$$ 1604, 1605, 1607).

Like foreign sovereign immunity, tribal immunity is a matter of federal law. Verlinden, supra, at 486. Although the
Court has taken the lead in drawing the bounds of tribal
immunity, Congress, subject to constitutional limitations, can
alter its limits through explicit legislation. See, e. g., Santa
Clara Pueblo, supra, at 58.

In both fields, Congress is in a position to weigh and accommodate the competing policy concerns and reliance interests. The capacity of the Legislative Branch to address
the issue by comprehensive legislation counsels some caution by us in this area. Congress "has occasionally authorized limited classes of suits against Indian tribes" and "has
always been at liberty to dispense with such tribal immunity or to limit it." Potawatomi, supra, at 510. It has not
yet done so.

Stevens, J., dissenting

In light of these concerns, we decline to revisit our caselaw and choose to defer to Congress. Tribes enjoy immunity from suits on contracts, whether those contracts in-volve governmental or commercial activities and whether
they were made on or off a reservation. Congress has notabrogated this immunity, nor has petitioner waived it, so
the immunity governs this case. The contrary decision ofthe Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

"Absent express federal law to the contrary, Indians goingbeyond reservation boundaries have generally been held

subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicableto all citizens of the State." Mescalero Apache Tribe v.
Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 148-149 (1973). There is no federalstatute or treaty that provides petitioner, the Kiowa Tribe
of Oklahoma, any immunity from the application of Oklahomalaw to its off-reservation commercial activities. Nor, in my
opinion, should this Court extend the judge-made doctrineof sovereign immunity to pre-empt the authority of the state
courts to decide for themselves whether to accord such im-munity to Indian tribes as a matter of comity.

I
"The doctrine of sovereign immunity is an amalgam oftwo quite different concepts, one applicable to suits in the

sovereign's own courts and the other to suits in the courtsof another sovereign."

Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 414(1979). In the former category, the sovereign's power to

determine the jurisdiction of its own courts and to define thesubstantive legal rights of its citizens adequately explains
the lesser authority to define its own immunity. Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353 (1907). The sover-eign's claim to immunity in the courts of a second sovereign,

Stevens, J., dissenting
however, normally depends on the second sovereign's law.
Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812).
An Indian tribe's assertion of immunity in a state judicialproceeding is unique because it implicates the law of three

different sovereigns: the tribe itself, the State, and the Federal Government.As the Court correctly observes, the doctrine of tribal immunity from judicial jurisdiction "developed almost by acci-dent."

Ante, at 756. Its origin is attributed to two federal
cases involving three of the Five Civilized Tribes. The for-mer case,

Turner v. United States, 248 U. S. 354 (1919), rejected a claim against the Creek Nation, whose tribal gov-ernment had been dissolved. The Court explains why that

case provides no more than "a slender reed" of support for
the doctrine even in federal court. Ante, at 757. In thelatter case,

United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506 (1940) (USF&G), the Federal Government sought to recover royalties due under coal leases
that the United States had executed on behalf of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. The Court held that the Government's action was not barred by a prior judgment against
it entered by a different federal court. The holding that the
prior judgment was "void in so far as it undertakes to fix a
credit against the Indian Nations," id., at 512, rested on two
grounds. First, in a companion case decided that day,1 the
Court ruled that "cross-claims against the United States are
justiciable only in those courts where Congress has consented to their consideration," ibid.; but no statute had
authorized the prior adjudication of the cross-claim against
the Federal Government. The second ground was the statement, supported by a citation of Turner and two Eighth Circuit decisions addressing the immunity of two of the Five
Civilized Tribes, that "[t]hese Indian Nations are exempt
from suit without Congressional authorization." 309 U. S.,

Stevens, J., dissenting

at 512 (emphasis added). At most, the holding extends onlyto federal cases in which the United States is litigating on

behalf of a tribe. Moreover, both Turner and USF&G aroseout of conduct that occurred on Indian reservations.

In subsequent cases, we have made it clear that the Stateshave legislative jurisdiction over the off-reservation conduct
of Indian tribes, and even over some on-reservation activi-ties.

2 Thus, in litigation that consumed more than a decade

and included three decisions by this Court, we rejected aTribe's claim that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded the State of Washington from regulating fishing activ-ities on the Puyallup Reservation.

Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v.Department of Game of Wash., 433 U. S. 165, 175-176 (1977).

It is true that as an incident to that important holding, wevacated the portions of the state-court decree that were directed against the Tribe itself. Id., at 172-173. That ac-tion, however, had little practical effect because we upheld
the portions of the decree granting relief against the entireclass of Indians that was represented by the Tribe. Although Justice Blackmun, one of the "strongest supportersof Indian rights on the Court,"

3 wrote separately to express

his "doubts . . . about the continuing vitality in this day ofthe doctrine of tribal immunity as it was enunciated in

United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.,"
id., at 178, our opinion did not purport to extend or to explainthe doctrine. Moreover, as the Tribe's predominant argument was that "the state courts of Washington are without

jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on its reservation,"id., at 167, we had no occasion to consider the validity of an

injunction relating solely to off-reservation fishing.In several cases since Puyallup, we have broadly referred
to the tribes' immunity from suit, but "with little analysis,"
ante, at 757, and only considering controversies arising onreservation territory. In Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,

436 U. S. 49 (1978), a Tribe member and her daughter whoboth lived on the Santa Clara Pueblo reservation sued in
federal court to challenge the validity of a tribal membershiplaw. We agreed with the Tribe that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide this "intratribal controvers[y] affectingmatters of tribal self-government and sovereignty."

Id., at53. Our decision in Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold

Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S. 877 (1986),held that North Dakota could not require a Tribe's blanket
waiver of sovereign immunity as a condition for permittingthe Tribe to sue private parties in state court. That condition was "unduly intrusive on the Tribe's common law sover-eign immunity, and thus on its ability to govern itself according to its own laws," because it required "that the Tribe openitself up to the coercive jurisdiction of state courts for

allmatters occurring on the reservation." Id., at 891.

Stevens, J., dissenting

In sum, we have treated the doctrine of sovereign im-munity from judicial jurisdiction as settled law, but in none

of our cases have we applied the doctrine to purely off-reservation conduct. Despite the broad language used in
prior cases, it is quite wrong for the Court to suggest thatit is merely following precedent, for we have simply never
considered whether a tribe is immune from a suit that hasno meaningful nexus to the tribe's land or its sovereign
functions. Moreover, none of our opinions has attempted toset forth any reasoned explanation for a distinction between
the States' power to regulate the off-reservation conduct ofIndian tribes and the States' power to adjudicate disputes
arising out of such off-reservation conduct. Accordingly,while I agree with the Court that it is now too late to repudiate the doctrine entirely, for the following reasons I wouldnot extend the doctrine beyond its present contours.

II
Three compelling reasons favor the exercise of judicialrestraint.

First, the law-making power that the Court has assumedbelongs in the first instance to Congress. The fact that Congress may nullify or modify the Court's grant of virtuallyunlimited tribal immunity does not justify the Court's performance of a legislative function. The Court is not merelyannouncing a rule of comity for federal judges to observe; it
is announcing a rule that pre-empts state power. The rea-sons that undergird our strong presumption against construing federal statutes to pre-empt state law, see, e. g., Cipol-lone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516, 518 (1992),
apply with added force to judge-made rules.In the absence of any congressional statute or treaty defining the Indian tribes' sovereign immunity, the creation of

the Eleventh Amendment from being sued in federal court by an Indian
tribe. The passing references to tribes' immunity from suit did not discuss the scope of that immunity and were, of course, dicta.

Stevens, J., dissenting
a federal common-law "default" rule of immunity might in
theory be justified by federal interests. By setting such a
rule, however, the Court is not deferring to Congress or exercising "caution," ante, at 759--rather, it is creating law.
The Court fails to identify federal interests supporting its
extension of sovereign immunity--indeed, it all but concedes
that the present doctrine lacks such justification, ante, at
758--and completely ignores the State's interests. Its opinion is thus a far cry from the "comprehensive pre-emption
inquiry in the Indian law context" described in Three Affiliated Tribes that calls for the examination of "not only the
congressional plan, but also `the nature of the state, federal,
and tribal interests at stake . . . .' " 476 U. S., at 884 (quoting
White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 145
(1980)). Stronger reasons are needed to fill the gap left by
Congress.

Second, the rule is strikingly anomalous. Why should an
Indian tribe enjoy broader immunity than the States, the
Federal Government, and foreign nations? As a matter of
national policy, the United States has waived its immunity
from tort liability and from liability arising out of its commercial activities. See 28 U. S. C. $$ 1346(b), 2674 (Federal
Tort Claims Act); $$ 1346(a)(2), 1491 (Tucker Act). Congress
has also decided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
of 1976 that foreign states may be sued in the federal and
state courts for claims based upon commercial activities carried on in the United States, or such activities elsewhere
that have a "direct effect in the United States." $ 1605(a)(2).
And a State may be sued in the courts of another State.
Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410 (1979). The fact that the
States surrendered aspects of their sovereignty when they
joined the Union does not even arguably present a legitimate
basis for concluding that the Indian tribes retained--or, indeed, ever had--any sovereign immunity for off-reservation
commercial conduct.

Third, the rule is unjust. This is especially so with re-spect to tort victims who have no opportunity to negotiate

for a waiver of sovereign immunity; yet nothing in theCourt's reasoning limits the rule to lawsuits arising out of
voluntary contractual relationships. Governments, like in-dividuals, should pay their debts and should be held accountable for their unlawful, injurious conduct.I respectfully dissent.

NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 120, Orig. Argued January 12, 1998--Decided May 26, 1998
An 1834 compact (hereinafter Compact) between New York and New Jersey, approved by Congress pursuant to the Compact Clause, set the
boundary line between the States as the middle of the Hudson River,
Article First; provided that Ellis Island, then three acres, was part of
New York, despite its location on the New Jersey side of the river,
Article Second; and provided that New York had exclusive jurisdiction
of submerged lands and waters between the two States to the low-water
mark on the New Jersey shore, subject to certain exceptions, including New Jersey's right to submerged lands on its side of the boundary,
Article Third. The States agree that Article Second gave New York
sovereign authority over the Island, and this Court has determined,
inter alia, that New Jersey has retained ultimate sovereign rights over
submerged lands on its side, Central R. Co. of N. J. v. Jersey City, 209
U. S. 473, 478-479. After 1891, when the United States decided to use
the Island to receive immigrants, the National Government began filling
around the Island's shoreline and over the next 42 years added some
24.5 acres to the original Island. In 1954, immigration was diverted
from the Island. Since then, the Island has been developed as a national historic site, but New York and New Jersey have asserted rival
claims of sovereign authority over its filled land. In 1993, New Jersey
invoked this Court's original jurisdiction to try the dispute. After a
trial, the Special Master concluded that Article First marks the line of
sovereignty between the two States; that although Article Second accords New York some sovereign jurisdiction over the Island as it existed
in 1834, the Compact does not address the issue of sovereign authority
over the Island's filled portions; and that the filled portions fall under
the sovereign authority of New Jersey under the common-law doctrine
of avulsion. He rejected New York's affirmative defense of having obtained sovereign authority over the filled portions by prescription and
acquiescence and its defense of laches. He pegged the Island's exact
dimensions to the mean low-water mark of the original Island, although
he recommended that the area covered by a pier extending from the
shore at the time of the Compact should be treated as part of the original Island. Finally, he recommended, for reasons of practicality, convenience, and fairness, that this Court adjust the Island boundary line
between the States, placing the main immigration building and the land

Syllabus
immediately surrounding it within New York. Both States have filed
exceptions.

Held: New Jersey has sovereign authority over the filled land added to the

original Island. New Jersey's exception to that portion of the Special
Master's report concerning the Court's authority to adjust the original
boundary line between the two States is sustained. The other exceptions of New Jersey and New York are overruled. Pp. 780-812.

(a) Article Second did not give New York jurisdiction over the Island's filled land. The absence of any description of the Island in metes
and bounds merely shows that in 1834 everybody knew what the Island
was. The Compact's failure to address the consequences of landfilling
does not support New York's argument that such filling in New York
Harbor was so common a practice in 1834 as to render it unnecessary to
mention it in Article Second. Rather, under that era's common law,
such filling was "avulsion," which has no effect on boundary, Nebraska
v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359, 361. This rule fills the Compact's silence and
leads to the conclusion that the lands surrounding the original Island
remained New Jersey's sovereign property when the United States
added landfill to them. Neither intuition nor history supports New
York's additional argument that the parties would hardly have wanted
to divide the Island between the States because any such division would
frustrate the Compact's purpose of giving New York control over navigation and commerce in the harbor. Pp. 780-785.

(b) New York has not obtained sovereignty over the filled land
through its exercise of prescriptive acts and New Jersey's acquiescence
in that exercise. As this is an affirmative defense, New York has a
plaintiff's burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence, Illinois v. Kentucky, 500 U. S. 380, 384, that it exercised dominion over the
made land with New Jersey's consent from 1890, when the United States
began to add landfill to the original Island, to 1954, when New Jersey
vigorously asserted its sovereignty claim. This task is made difficult
by two facts: that New Jersey must be supposed to know that, when
New York referred to the Island in its official dealings, it meant something other than the original, concededly New York territory; and that
the United States's occupation of the land affected New York's opportunity to act in support of its claim--e. g., by establishing towns, roads, or
public buildings--as well as the degree of attention that New Jersey
may reasonably have paid to whatever acts New York claims to have
performed in asserting its jurisdiction. New York's evidence--the recording of vital statistics of people on the Island; the inclusion of the
Island in New York voting districts, together with voting registration
lists with names of people living on filled portions; personal impressions

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

769Cite as: 523 U. S. 767 (1998)
Syllabus
that the filled portions belong to New York; and the United States's
understanding of the Island's sovereignty--is too slight to support any
finding of prescription. New York's official acts occurred off the Island
and were either equivocal in their territorial references or ill calculated
to give notice to New Jersey; and they did not leave officials of the
Island's actual occupants, the United States, with a settled or consistent
understanding that the filled land might be subject to New York's sovereignty. Pp. 785-806.

(c) New Jersey is not chargeable with laches through its delay in
bringing this action. Even if New York is correct that there would
have been more and better evidence to support its affirmative defense
of prescription and acquiescence had New Jersey brought its suit years
earlier, it cannot use the defense of laches to relieve it of the plaintiff's
burden of proof on its affirmative defense. Pp. 806-807.

(d) New Jersey is sovereign over the filled portions of the Island to
the mean low-water line, not, as it argues, the mean high-water line.
The Court assumes from the Compact's silence that the parties were
well aware of the general rule, recognized by this Court, that the lowwater mark is the most appropriate boundary between sovereigns, see,
e. g., Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, 383, and would have
explicitly provided for a high-water mark boundary if that is what they
intended. It would be unsound to infer from Article Third's specification of a low-water mark as a jurisdictional boundary on the New Jersey
shore that the high-water line was intended elsewhere. Pp. 807-810.

(e) This Court agrees with the Special Master's conclusion that the
land covered by the pier in 1834 falls within New York's authority. An
1819 map of the Island, on which the Special Master relied, appears to
show a filled area around the pier's location, and New York's expert
credibly testified that the use of pilings to create piers was still uncommon by the mid-1800's and that it would have been much easier to
add landfill to the shallow waters around the Island than build piers.
P. 810.

(f) This Court lacks the authority to adjust the original boundary line
between the two States to address considerations of practicality and
convenience. Congressional approval "transforms an interstate compact within [the Compact] Clause into a law of the United States,"
Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438. Unless the compact is unconstitutional, no court may order relief inconsistent with its express terms.
Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 564. The difficulties created by a
boundary line that divides not just an island but some of its buildings
are the price of New Jersey's success in litigating under a compact
whose fair construction calls for a line so definite. Pp. 810-812.

42 years added some 24.5 acres to the area of the original

that New Jersey does.

In April 1993, New Jersey invoked this Court's original
jurisdiction to try a dispute over its territorial jurisdiction,
see U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2, cl. 2, by seeking leave to file a
bill of complaint against New York. We granted New Jersey's petition, 511 U. S. 1080 (1994), and appointed Paul Verkuil as Special Master, 513 U. S. 924 (1994). After denying
the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, he conducted a trial from July 10 to August 15, 1996, and submitted
final and supplemental reports to us on June 16, 1997, 520
U. S. 1273, which were then subjected to the exceptions resolved here.

Ellis Island lies in New York Harbor 1,300 feet from Jersey
City, New Jersey, and one mile from the tip of Manhattan.
At the time of the first European settlement it was mostly
mud, sand, and oyster shells, which nearly disappeared at
high tide. The Mohegan Indians called it "Kioshk," or Gull
Island, while the Dutch of New Amsterdam, after its thrifty
acquisition, renamed it (along with two other nearby specks)
for the oyster, in recognition of the rich surrounding beds.
England seized it from the Dutch in 1664, the same year that
Charles II included the Island in a grant to his brother, the
Duke of York, of the land and water of the present States of
New York and New Jersey. The Duke in turn granted part
of this territory to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret,
the proprietors of New Jersey, whose domain was described
as "bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by
Hudson's river."

Having wasted no words, the noble grantor all but guaranteed the succession of legal fees and expenses arising from

Opinion of the Court
interstate boundary disputes, now extending into the fourthcentury since the conveyance of New Jersey received its seal.

After the Revolutionary War, New York and New Jerseybegan their long disagreement about the common boundary
on the lower Hudson and New York Harbor, with New York
arguing that the grant to the New Jersey proprietors setthe line at New Jersey's shore and so preserved New York's

sovereignty over the entire river, and New Jersey contend-ing that as a coequal State emerging after the Revolution it
was entitled to a sovereign boundary in the middle of theriver. Between the two competing lines, of course, lay the
Oyster Islands, one of which, in 1785, came into the private
ownership of the eponymous Samuel Ellis, whose heirs would
be its last private owners. In 1800, the State of New York
ceded "jurisdiction" over the Island to the United States,
reserving only the right to serve judicial process there. Act
of Feb. 15, 1800, ch. 6 (1797-1800 N. Y. Laws, p. 454). In
1808, after obtaining property title to the Island as well, the
State of New York granted all of its "right, title and interest"
in it to the United States, "for the purpose of providing for
the defense and safety of the city and port of New-York."
Act of Mar. 18, 1808, ch. 51 (1808 N. Y. Laws, p. 273); Act of
Mar. 20, 1807, ch. 51 (1807 N. Y. Laws, p. 67); Deed to Ellis
Island, by State of New York to the United States, June 30,
1808. Before the War of 1812 began, the United States
Army had taken over the Island, which it improved with the
construction of barracks and a magazine, and fortified with
a battery of 20 guns.

In the meantime, the two neighboring States tried to settle their controversy. In 1807, each appointed commissioners to prepare a compromise agreement, and when none was
forthcoming the States allowed the controversy to simmer
for another 20 years, when new commissioners were appointed. After they, too, had failed to agree, in 1829 New
Jersey decided to seek a judicial resolution and filed suit
against New York to establish its "rights of property, juris523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

diction and sovereignty" west of the midpoint of the watersof the Hudson River and New York Bay. N. J. Exh. 293

(Complaint filed in New Jersey v. New York, p. 22 (1829)).New Jersey made it clear in its papers, however, that the
dispute did not concern the islands in the waters betweenthe two States, by conceding in its Bill in Equity that during
the colonial period New York had taken possession of theislands "in the dividing waters between the two States," and
"that the possession thus acquired by New York, ha[d] beensince that time . . . acquiesced in" by New Jersey.

Id., at22-23.

Although we took jurisdiction over the suit, New Jersey v.
New York, 5 Pet. 284 (1831), it was never tried to judgment.Instead, the States once again negotiated and in 1833 actually reached agreement. Each enacted the terms into law,1834 N. Y. Laws, ch. 8; 1833-1834 N. J. Laws, pp. 118-121,
and jointly they sought the approval of Congress under theCompact Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I,

$ 10, cl. 3. Congressional consent came with the Act of June28, 1834, ch. 126, 4 Stat. 708.

The Compact comprises eight articles, the first three ofwhich directly concern us here. Article First sets the relevant stretch of the "boundary line" between New York andNew Jersey as the middle of the Hudson River "except

as hereinafter otherwise particularly mentioned." ArticleSecond provides that "New York shall retain its present jurisdiction of and over Bedlow's [1] and Ellis's islands; and shallalso retain exclusive jurisdiction of and over the other islands lying in the waters above mentioned and now underthe jurisdiction of that state." Under Article Third, "New
York shall have and enjoy exclusive jurisdiction of and overall the waters" between the two States as well as "of and
over the lands covered by the said waters to the low water-mark on the westerly or New Jersey side thereof." This

1 The name of this island, which is now commonly referred to as "Liberty
Island," was sometimes spelled "Bedloe's."

774 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction is, however, "subject to [certain] rights of prop-erty and of jurisdiction of the state of New Jersey." That

State, for example, "shall have the exclusive right of prop-erty in and to the land under water" on its side of the boundary line, as well as "the exclusive jurisdiction of and over
the wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be madeon the shore of the said state." The terms of the congressional consent to the Compact close with the provision that"nothing therein contained shall be construed to impair or in
any manner affect, any right of jurisdiction of the UnitedStates in and over the islands or waters which form the subject of the said agreement."

We have already addressed the meaning of some of these
terms in Central R. Co. of N. J. v. Jersey City, 209 U. S.
473 (1908), where we held that Jersey City, New Jersey, was
authorized to tax the submerged lands lying between the
middle of New York Harbor and the low-water mark on the
New Jersey shore. As expressed in an opinion by Justice
Holmes, we determined that the "boundary line" set by Article First is the line of sovereignty between the two States,
and that the islands in the waters between them fell on New
Jersey's side of the boundary. Id., at 478. We held that
even though Article Third grants New York "exclusive jurisdiction" over all the land and water between the States, New
Jersey retained "ultimate sovereign rights" over the lands
submerged beneath the waters. Id., at 478-479. We noted
that the term "jurisdiction" was used in a broader sense in
Article Second (relating to the islands) than in Article Third
(relating to water and submerged land west of the center
line), the purpose of the latter being "to promote the interests of commerce and navigation, not to take back the sovereignty that otherwise was the consequence of Article I."
Id., at 479. We said that "[w]hether . . . some power of police
regulation also was conferred upon New York [by the third
article] . . . need not be decided now." Ibid. Finally, we
explained that the provision for Ellis and Bedlow's Islands,

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

775Cite as: 523 U. S. 767 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
"that New York shall retain its `present' jurisdiction over
them, . . . would seem on its face simply to be intended to
preserve the status quo ante, whatever that may be." Ibid.
In the current litigation, New York and New Jersey agree
that the effect of Article Second was to recognize that New
York had obtained sovereign authority over all of the islands
in the waters between the two States, including Ellis Island,
and that reference to New York's retention of "present" jurisdiction over Ellis Island was a recognition of New York's
cession of jurisdiction over the Island to the United States
in 1800, save for its right to serve process there.

In the years after the Compact, the National Government
continued to use the Island as a fortress until 1861, when it
dismantled the fortifications but proceeded to use the Island
for a munitions magazine and a berth for ships defending
the harbor. In the 1880's, however, came a radical change.
Although the National Government had left the control of
immigration largely to the States up to that time, the swelling number of immigrants were overwhelming the state systems, to the point of leading Washington to impose national
regulation. While immigrants to New York and New Jersey
had traditionally come ashore at Castle Garden, located in
Manhattan and owned and operated by New York, Congress
decided that an island would be an ideal place for a new immigration station "in view of the frauds, robbery, and general
crookedness which seemed to be inseparable from the landing of immigrants." N. J. Exh. 488, p. 5 (V. Stafford, Immigration Problems: Personal Experiences of an Official 22
(1925)). Ellis Island turned out to be the one chosen.

The Island also turned out to be too small, and by the time
the new Ellis Island immigration station opened in January
1892, the United States had already added enough fill to the
surrounding submerged lands to double the original three
acres. By 1897, the Island was up to 14 acres and would go
on growing for almost 40 years more.

776 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
After the original wood and stucco depot burned in 1897,the United States expanded the land for even larger quarters. Although the new depot, which opened in 1900, sat onapproximately the same spot on the original Island as the
prior main immigration building, it was joined by a hospital
placed on a separate island created by landfill in 1899. TheNational Government often referred to the latter as Island

No. 2, which covered about three acres on the southwesternside of a ferry slip. A covered gangway built on piles connected the two islands, which were soon to be joined by onemore, though not before the occurrence of another step in
the boundary dispute.

Because the hospital of 1900 could not provide sufficiently
isolated wards for patients with contagious diseases, these
patients were sent to New York City for care and treatment.
When, in 1902, the City Health Department announced it
would no longer receive such immigrants, the United States
had to provide its own contagious disease hospital, which it
planned to build on a third island to be joined to Island No. 2
by another gangway. Construction stopped, however, when
New Jersey challenged the National Government's appropriation of the submerged lands surrounding the Island. The
dispute was not resolved until December 1904, when New
Jersey's Riparian Commissioners conveyed to the United
States "all the right, title, claim and interest of every kind,
of the State of New Jersey" to 48 acres of territory that
included and surrounded Ellis Island, in exchange for $1,000.

often called Island No. 3. Here the new contagious disease
hospital was constructed in 1909 and occupied by 1911.

Two acres more were added in the 1920's when the United
States filled the dock basin between Island Nos. 2 and 3, and

nal Island. In the end, the United States enlarged Ellis Is-land by roughly 24.5 acres, for a total area some nine times

the original.Ironically, however, as the land rose immigration fell. Although more than 12 million people disembarked at Ellis Island from 1892 to 1954, arrivals dropped from a high pointof roughly 5,000 daily in 1907 to only 200 a day in 1954, and in

November of that year the Immigration and NaturalizationService (INS) closed the Island station.

Soon after immigration was thus diverted from the Island,the United States General Services Administration (GSA)
classified the property as surplus and entertained various
proposals for using the Island as a home for educational institutions, as a clinic for alcoholics, as a historical site for public
recreation, and as a facility for the mentally retarded. Prospects for the Island's future were clouded, however, by the
fact that New York and New Jersey each carried the Island
on its tax rolls and announced its intention to collect taxes if
a private owner took over the Island. Although the GSA
noted sanguinely that "[t]he question of whether the property will be subject to taxes by the State of New Jersey
when it becomes eligible for taxation is one to be resolved
between the State of New Jersey and the grantee after the
disposal of the property has been consummated by the
United States," N. J. Exh. 117 (letter from Administrator,
GSA, to Sen. Clifford P. Case, dated Jan. 28, 1958), there
was clear reason to fear that the tax dispute would kill any
disposition the United States might like to make. In 1960,
the Council of State Governments tried to mediate the jurisdictional dispute, but negotiations simply came to impasse.
N. J. Exh. 134 (letter from Regional Director, Council of
State Governments, to Associate General Counsel, GSA,
dated July 28, 1960).

After the GSA had offered the Island for sale on the commercial market several times, the Secretary of the Interior
decided in 1964 that the Government should stop trying to

sell the property and instead develop it as a national historic
site, one advantage of such a course being the supposition
that "any opening of hostilities between New York and New
Jersey" would be obviated. N. J. Exh. 161 (N. Y. Times, Oct.
22, 1964, p. 37, col. 4). But again the optimism was premature, for although the National Park Service was given legal
title to the Island and to this day alone exercises jurisdiction
over it, and although restoration of the Island began in 1976,
New York and New Jersey have continued to assert rival
claims of sovereign authority over the filled land of the Island for the purposes of taxation, zoning, environmental protection, elections, education, residency, insurance, building
codes, historic preservation, labor and public welfare laws,
and civil and criminal law generally. In 1986, efforts of the
two States to resolve the tax issue came to naught when
New York failed to enact a proposed interstate agreement to
deposit tax revenues from the Island into a fund for the
homeless. Seven years later, New Jersey was prompted to
bring the instant action after the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Collins v. Promark
Prods., Inc., 956 F. 2d 383 (1992), that New York tort law
governed the filled portions of the Island. We are now
called upon to determine which State has sovereign authority over the filled portion of the Island.

B
In its complaint, the State of New Jersey seeks a declaration that the boundary between the two States on the Island
follows the high-water mark of the original Island, that the
original Island is within the territory and jurisdiction of
New York, and that the balance of the Island, as well as the
waters surrounding it, is within the territory and general
jurisdiction of New Jersey. New Jersey also asks for a permanent injunction prohibiting New York from enforcing its
laws on the filled land or asserting jurisdiction over it.

Opinion of the Court
The Special Master first concluded that Article First of theCompact, which establishes "[t]he boundary line between the

two states of New York and New Jersey" at the midpoint ofthe Hudson River and New York Harbor, marks the line of
sovereignty between the two States. Next, he concludedthat although Article Second accords New York some sovereign jurisdiction over the Island as it existed in 1834,2 theCompact does not address the issue of sovereign authority
over the filled portions of the Island. The Special Masterconcluded that the filled portions of the Island are subject to
the sovereign authority of New Jersey under the common-law doctrine of avulsion, and he rejected New York's affirmatively defensive claim to have obtained sovereign authorityover the filled portions of the Island by prescription and
acquiescence. He also rejected New York's defense thatlaches barred New Jersey's complaint, finding the doctrine
inapposite to interstate boundary actions.After concluding that New York's sovereign authority was
limited to the original area of the Island, the Special Masterwent on to determine its exact dimensions, which he pegged
to the mean low-water mark of the original Island, althoughhe recommended that the area covered by a pier extending
from the shore at the time of the Compact be treated as part
of the original Island. Finally, the Special Master recom-mended, "[i]n the interest of practicality, convenience, and

2 The Special Master did not determine the scope of such jurisdiction and
in particular did not determine the present effect of New York's cession of
"jurisdiction" to the United States in 1800. Because New Jersey's complaint pleaded only its sovereignty over the filled land, because this is not
an action between the United States and the State of New York, and
because the United States is only an amicus curiae in this proceeding, we
have no occasion to declare the extent of New York's sovereign jurisdiction over the original Island. As the United States noted in its amicus
brief, "the extent to which the federal government exercises legislative
jurisdiction over Ellis Island under the Enclave Clause" of the United
States Constitution, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 17, "is not at issue in this case." Brief

Opinion of the Court
fairness," that we adjust the Island boundary line betweenthe two States so as to place all of the main immigration

building and the land immediately surrounding it withinNew York. Final Report of Special Master 3.

New York and New Jersey each excepted to the recom-mendations. New York's exceptions amount to the following claims: (1) under Article Second of the Compact, NewYork has jurisdiction over the filled portion of the Island; (2)
New York has obtained sovereignty over the filled landthrough its exercise of prescriptive acts and New Jersey's
acquiescence in that exercise; and (3) New Jersey is charge-able with laches through its delay in bringing this action.
New Jersey's exceptions in effect state the following claims:(1) New Jersey is sovereign over the filled portions of the
Island to the mean high-water line, not the mean low-waterline, as it was when the Compact was adopted; (2) the record
contains no credible evidence to support the Special Master'sconclusion that the pier on Ellis Island in 1834 was partially
built on landfill, so as to place its area within New York'sjurisdiction; and (3) the present boundary across the Island
must follow the 1834 line, the Court having no authority tomodify that line to address considerations of practicality
and convenience. II

First we address New York's exceptions. Although thatState would be entitled to a declaration of its ultimate sovereignty over the filled land if successful on any of the pointsraised, we find each to be meritless.

A
New York's first exception rests on Article Second of theCompact, the provision that "[t]he state of New York shall

retain its present jurisdiction of and over Bedlow's and El-lis's islands; and shall also retain exclusive jurisdiction of and
over the other islands lying in the waters above mentionedand now under the jurisdiction of that state."

Opinion of the Court
Neither party takes issue with our holding in CentralR. Co. that the "boundary line" between the States established in Article First is the line of sovereignty and that EllisIsland is on New Jersey's side of this line.

3 The States also

agree that Article Second carves out an exception to theboundary provision as to all of the islands existing at the

time of the Compact, including Ellis Island. They agreethat the recognition in this Article of "present jurisdiction"
over Ellis Island suffices to bar any rival claim by New Jer-sey over the original portion of the Island. New York's contention is that Article Second also provides for its authorityover filled land; New Jersey says it does not.

New York concedes that at the time of the Compact thesubmerged land around the Island was under the sovereign
authority of New Jersey. But New York argues that be-cause the Compact recognized its own sovereign authority
over "Ellis Island," without describing that land mass inmetes and bounds, the recognition of sovereignty extended
to whatever area the Island so called might be enlarged tocover; that is, once any submerged territory was filled and
became fast land contiguous to the original Island, it becamesubject to the New York sovereignty recognized in Article
Second. New York rests its position on an allegation thatin 1834 adding landfill to subaqueous land adjacent to fast
land in New York Harbor was such a common practice as torender it unnecessary to mention it in Article Second of the
Compact or otherwise make provision for its legal conse-quences. New York also argues that the parties who agreed

3 New York's amici New York Historical Society et al. and New York
Landmarks Conservancy et al. would indeed take issue, arguing that the
Compact's terms "jurisdiction" and "property" as variously employed in
Articles Second and Third should be read to preclude the New Jersey
claim. But without even relying on stare decisis we must pass over the
arguments of the named amici for the reason that New York, the party
to the case, has in effect renounced them, or at least any benefit they
might provide. Accordingly, nothing in this opinion is meant to disparage
the scholarship those briefs embody.

Opinion of the Court
to the Compact in 1834 would hardly have wanted to divide
the Island between New York and New Jersey, since any
such division would frustrate one of the driving purposes of
the Compact, of giving New York control over navigation
and commerce in the harbor.4

The arguments are unavailing. To begin with, the absence of any description of the Island in metes and bounds
is highly dubious support for any inference beyond the obvi4 We note that New York does not claim that the recognition in Article
Third of its "exclusive jurisdiction" over the submerged lands (which have
been filled in part at the Island) includes an element of "police power" to
regulate historic preservation, land use, and zoning, as New York's amici
argue. See Brief for National Trust for Historic Preservation in the
United States and Municipal Art Society of New York as Amici Curiae
26, n. 12; Brief for New York Landmarks Conservancy, Preservation
League of New York State, and Historic Districts Council as Amici Curiae 17-27. Although we left this very issue open in Central R. Co. of
N. J. v. Jersey City, 209 U. S. 473, 479 (1908), counsel for New York said at
oral argument that the grant in Article Third of "exclusive jurisdiction"
over the submerged lands and waters between the States "is in the nature
of police power, over navigation and commerce in the harbor." Tr. of
Oral Arg. 34. New York's counsel argued that when the submerged lands
around the Island were filled, New York continued to have jurisdiction
over these lands when "used as anchorage, used for docking, used as storage areas, used for lighthouses . . . ." Id., at 35. New York does not
argue that Article Third gave New York the authority to regulate anything but commerce and navigation; indeed, counsel for New York said at
oral argument that "this case isn't about Article [Third]," id., at 36, and
conceded that if it lost its Article Second argument and New Jersey was
declared sovereign over the filled land, New Jersey law would apply to
that area of the island, id., at 46. Both the New York and New Jersey
state courts have also concluded that New York's "exclusive jurisdiction"
over the harbor concerns only power to regulate commerce and navigation.

broadly than the parties who signed it.

Opinion of the Court
ous one, that in 1834 everybody knew what Ellis Island was.The drafters' silence, then, can hardly be taken to convert

the Island's name into a definitional Proteus for validatingsovereignty claims.

Nor can we draw any conclusion in New York's favor fromthe failure of the Compact to address the consequences of
landfilling, however common the practice may have been.5There would have been no reason to do so, simply for the
reason that the legal consequences were sufficiently clearunder the common law as it was understood in 1834.

6 In

this case, as in Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 U. S. 376, 404(1990), the expansion of the Island "was not caused by either

of the adjoining States, but by the United States ArmyCorps of Engineers." Under the common law, a littoral
owner, like the United States in the instant case, "cannotextend [its] own property into the water by landfilling or
purposefully causing accretion." Ibid. (citing Seacoast RealEstate Co. v. American Timber Co., 92 N. J. Eq. 219, 221, 113
A. 489, 490 (1920)); see also United States v. California, 381U. S. 139, 177 (1965) (referring to "the rule of property law

5 Beyond the language cited already, nothing else in the Compact governs the consequence of expanding the Island. The closest approach to
the subject of avulsion comes in Article Third, which carves out an exception to New York's exclusive jurisdiction over all the waters of the New
York Harbor by specifically providing that New Jersey shall have "exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements, made
and to be made on the shore of the said state."

6 Although Justice Scalia, see post, at 831-832, seems to make some

of the same mistakes in assessing the evidence that Justice Stevens
makes, Justice Scalia applies his interpretation of the facts to the 1834
Compact, assuming that the agreement was ambiguous about which State
would have sovereignty over any land added to the Island, and concluding
that the parties' conduct in the years following the Compact indicates that
the filled land belonged to New York. But this is to convert an agreement's utter silence on an issue into contractual ambiguity; no such translation is possible here, for the silence of the Compact was on the subject
of settled law governing avulsion, which the parties' silence showed no
intent to modify.

that artificial fill belongs to the owner of the submerged land
onto which it is deposited" (citing Marine Railway & Coal
Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 47, 65 (1921))). The littoral
owner's act of placing artificial fill is thus treated under the
traditional common-law rule governing avulsive littoral
changes, "recognized where the boundaries between States
or nations are, by prescription or treaty, found in running
water." Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359, 361 (1892). We
have long recognized that a sudden shoreline change known
as avulsion (as distinct from accretion, or gradual change in
configuration) "has no effect on boundary," ibid, and that this
" `is the received rule of law of nations on this point, as laid
down by all the writers of authority,' " id., at 362 (quoting 8
Op. Atty. Gen. 175, 178 (1856)), including Sir William Blackstone, 143 U. S., at 364 (citing 2 Commentaries on the Laws
of England 262 (1766)). See also Mayor of New Orleans v.
United States, 10 Pet. 662, 717 (1836) (common-law rule of
accretion "is no less just when applied to public, than to private rights"); W. Hall, A Treatise on International Law 122
(J. Atlay 6th ed. 1909) (explaining the application of commonlaw rules of accretion and avulsion in boundary disputes between States). This common-law rule speaks in the silence
of the Compact, and we follow it to conclude that the lands
surrounding the original Island remained the sovereign
property of New Jersey when the United States added landfill to them.7

7 Prior to 1891, New Jersey law permitted littoral owners to extend their
land artificially by filling in or docking out; in 1891, however, New Jersey
repealed that law and enacted a new statement providing that "without
the grant or permission of [the New Jersey Riparian Commissioners] no
person or corporation shall fill in, build upon or make any erection on or
reclaim any of the lands under the tide-waters of this state." Riparian
Act, N. J. Comp. Stat., vol. 4, p. 4385, $ 10 (1911). Under the new law the
Riparian Commissioners were empowered to bring an ejectment action
against any person or corporation trespassing or occupying New Jersey
lands under water or previously under water. See Seacoast Real Estate

Opinion of the Court
Finally, there is no merit in New York's position that de-priving it of sovereign authority over the filled land would

frustrate the primary purpose of the Compact. The Stateargues that the Compact's framers must have thought it necessary to recognize New York's sovereign authority over theislands on New Jersey's side of the boundary line in order to
assure that New York would be able to regulate commerceand navigation in the New York Harbor. But neither intuition nor history supports its argument. Although it istaken for granted that one object of the Compact was to
preserve New York's authority to regulate water-borne com-merce in the harbor, a subject addressed in Article Third, the
more evident reason that the Compact declared New York'ssovereignty over the islands was simply that by 1834 New
York had concededly obtained sovereign rights over the is-lands through prescriptive acts. New Jersey conceded as
much when it filed its bill of complaint in New Jersey v. NewYork. While Article Third does speak to commerce and
navigation, New York's "exclusive jurisdiction" over thewater and submerged lands lying between the two States is
unaffected in any literal sense by the presence of the fill, andthere is no reason to think that recognizing New Jersey as
sovereign over the filled portions of the Island would affectNew York's ability to regulate navigation and commerce in
the harbor. B

On the assumption that Article Second or some other Com-pact provision fails to carry the day for New York, the State

786 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
falls back to its affirmative defense that it gained sovereignauthority over the made land by subjecting it to prescriptive

acts for a considerable period. Again, the State's positionis unsound.

As between two sovereigns, jurisdiction may be obtained
by one through prescriptive action at the other's expense,over the course of a substantial period, during which the

latter has acquiesced in the impositions upon it. See Illinois v. Kentucky, 500 U. S. 380, 384-385 (1991); Georgia
v. South Carolina, 497 U. S., at 389; Arkansas v. Tennessee,310 U. S. 563, 570 (1940);

Vermont v. New Hampshire, 289
U. S. 593, 613 (1933); Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S. 1,
53 (1906); Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503, 522-524
(1893). "For the security of rights, whether of states or individuals, long possession under a claim of title is protected.
And there is no controversy in which this great principle
may be involved with greater justice and propriety than in
a case of disputed boundary." Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639 (1846). The doctrine of prescription
and acquiescence "is founded upon the supposition, confirmed
by constant experience, that every person will naturally seek
to enjoy that which belongs to him; and the inference fairly
to be drawn from his silence and neglect, of the original
defect of his title, or his intention to relinquish it."
C. Phillipson, Wheaton's Elements of International Law 269
(5th ed. 1916). From such expectations, in part, have we
derived "moral considerations which should prevent any disturbance of long recognized boundary lines; considerations
springing from regard to the natural sentiments and affections which grow up for places on which persons have long
resided; the attachments to country, to home and to family,
on which is based all that is dearest and most valuable in
life." Virginia v. Tennessee, supra, at 524.

As the proponent of the defense, New York is in the position it would occupy if it had itself brought an original action
claiming title under the doctrine; thus it has the burden to

Opinion of the Court
"show by a preponderance of the evidence . . . a long andcontinuous possession of, and assertion of sovereignty over,"

the filled portions of the Island, as well as New Jersey's ac-quiescence in those acts of possession and jurisdiction.

Illinois v. Kentucky, supra, at 384. Because acquiescence presupposes knowledge, New York is bound to present eitherdirect evidence that New Jersey had knowledge that New

York acted upon a claim to the added land, or evidence ofsuch open, notorious, visible, and uninterrupted adverse acts
that New Jersey's knowledge and acquiescence may be pre-sumed. See

Georgia v. South Carolina, supra, at 393 (stating that it is well established " `that open and notorious adverse possession is evidence of notice; not of the adverse
holding only, but of the title under which the possession is
held' ") (quoting Landes v. Brant, 10 How. 348, 375 (1851));
Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, at 570 (noting that sovereign
rights to land can be won and lost by "open, long-continued
and uninterrupted possession of territory"); Michigan v.
Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 295, 307-308 (1926) (rejecting Michigan's claim of "excusable ignorance" on the ground that "[t]he
material facts . . . have been so obvious that knowledge of
them on the part of the Michigan authorities, if it were not
shown, as it is shown, by the evidence, must necessarily be
assumed"); Louisiana v. Mississippi, supra, at 53 (noting
that "Louisiana has always asserted [ownership of the disputed area]; and that Mississippi has repeatedly recognized
it, and not until recently has disputed it"); MacGibon, The
Scope of Acquiescence in International Law, in 31 Brit. Y. B.
Int'l L. 143, 173 (H. Lauterpacht ed. 1954) ("The proposition
that the possession on which title by prescription rests must
fulfil [sic] the requirement of notoriety is scarcely in doubt").

It is essential to appreciate the extent of this burden that
a claimant by prescription must shoulder. Even as to terra
nullius, like a volcanic island or territory abandoned by its
former sovereign, a claimant by right as against all others
has more to do than planting a flag or rearing a monument.

Opinion of the Court
Since the 19th century the most generous settled view hasbeen that discovery accompanied by symbolic acts gives no

more than "an inchoate title, an option, as against otherstates, to consolidate the first steps by proceeding to effective occupation within a reasonable time." 8 I. Brownlie,Principles of Public International Law 146 (4th ed. 1990); see
also 1 C. Hyde, International Law 329 (rev. 2d ed. 1945); 1L. Oppenheim, International Law $$ 222-223, pp. 439-441

Justice Stevens's dissent, post, at 824, something well be-yond "[a] solitary fingerprint,"

post, at 815, will always benecessary to carry the day. This rule underscores the burden on a sovereign claimant to an atoll already subject toclear title, as under the law of avulsion. Hence the law's
emphasis on the necessary length and continuity of adverseactivity, and the requirement to prove a knowing acquiescence in the claimant's demonstrated design. Conversely,the original titleholder's only obligation is that of refusing to
acquiesce in the hostile behavior of a rival sovereign claim-ant that was or should have been known to be disputing the
earlier title.9 Since the parties do not start out as equals in

8 After all, a contrary rule "would be an absolute infringement of the
natural rights of men, and repugnant to the views of nature, which, having
destined the whole earth to supply the wants of mankind in general, gives
no nation a right to appropriate to itself a country, except for the purpose
of making use of it, and not of hindering others from deriving advantage
from it." E. Vattel, Law of Nations $ 208, p. 99 (J. Chitty 6th Am. ed.
1844).

9 Accordingly, New York cannot meet its burden of proving prescription

by pointing to New Jersey's failure to present evidence that it exercised
dominion over the filled portions of the Island occupied by the United
States or secondary evidence that third parties understood the filled land

Opinion of the Court
sovereign pretension, a single fingerprint that can never suffice for title even when there is only one claimant will fail all
the more abjectly when a claim is made against a holder of
title independently established.

Before turning to the evidence, a word must be said on one
threshold issue, on which the parties agree. As the Special
Master thought, the time period during which New York's
prescriptive acts ripened into sovereignty, if they did at all,
is 1890 to 1954. The United States added no fill to the original Island until 1890, and after 1954 it is undisputed that
New Jersey vigorously asserted its own sovereignty over the
filled portions of the Island. At most, then, New York may
rely upon exercises of dominion over the made land with
New Jersey's consent for 64 years,10 a period that is not insufficient as a matter of general law. To be sure, we have
never established a minimum period of prescription necessary to perfect a jurisdictional claim over another State's
territory, and it is clear that "no general rule can be laid
down as regards the length of time and other circumstances
which are necessary to create a title by prescription. Everything depends upon the merits of the individual case. . . .

to be in New Jersey. That is, however, what Justice Stevens would
apparently permit New York to do. See, e. g., post, at 814-815 ("There is
no evidence that any of those people ever believed that any part of Ellis
Island was in the State of New Jersey"); post, at 818 ("There is no evidence
that any [birth or death] certificate was issued by New Jersey"); post, at
819 ("There is no evidence of any Ellis Island resident being married
under New Jersey law"); post, at 821 ("There is no evidence that any of
[the Island] residents prepared or received any mail or other documents
describing their residence as in New Jersey"); post, at 822 (relying upon
the lack of evidence that New Jersey provided municipal services on the
Island); post, at 823 ("Nor is there any evidence that any judge, state or
federal, ever held that Ellis Island was a part of New Jersey").

10 Because the United States continued to expand the Island until 1934,

the relevant period for some parts of the Island is much shorter. As will
appear, niceties of timing do not affect the outcome here.

Opinion of the Court
There are indeed immeasurable and imponderable circum-stances and influences besides the mere lapse of time at work

to create the conviction that in the interest of stability oforder the present possessor should be considered the rightful
owner of a territory." 1 Oppenheim, supra, $ 242, at 456-457. We have, however, found 60 years adequate in one
case, see Michigan v. Wisconsin, supra, and that holding isenough to open the door to litigation of the relevant period
here.The evidence that has come through the door, however, is
too slight to support any finding of prescription. At the outset, we note that two facts exact a discount from the probative force of much of the evidence New York presents.First, as between New York and New Jersey, New York is

concededly vested with whatever state sovereignty may beexercised over the original portion of the Island. Second,
throughout the entire period of arguable prescription, theIsland was entirely occupied by the United States.

We have already seen that Article Second of the Compactrecognizes New York's then-existing jurisdiction over Ellis
Island and Bedlow's Island as well as its exclusive jurisdiction over the other islands then on New Jersey's side of theboundary. So long as the original Island was all that went

by the name of Ellis, there was no question about the refer-ent of any indication of jurisdiction over Ellis Island. But
after the Island grew, acts expressly pertaining to the Islandbut falling short of physical occupation became to a degree
vague in the absence of further indication that their subjectwas the new land as well as the original territory.

11 Thus,

every reference to "Ellis Island" on a New York tax roll or

11 For this reason there is no prescriptive significance in the fact pointed
out by Justice Stevens, post, at 822, that a New York state court exercised jurisdiction over an assault that took place "upon government property at Ellis Island," Rettig v. John E. Moore Co., 90 Misc. 664, 154 N. Y. S.
124 (N. Y. App. Term 1915), there being no indication that the court considered whether the assault took place on the filled portion of the Island.

Opinion of the Court
a statute outlining the confines of a voting district was neces-sarily sound in part (so far as New Jersey might be concerned) in the absence of a physical description making aclaim to the new land as well as the old. So, registrations
of vital statistics did not on their face refer to events beyond
the original Island (though knowledge of the geographywould point to hospitals on the new land in a number of instances). And the use of mailing addresses of the Island in"New York" was likewise equivocal (a point underscored by
the fact that the Island was within the New York postal dis-trict, whatever the political geography might otherwise be).
This vagueness was important, having a significance that
stems from the burden to give notice to the adverse party
before a prescriptive claim can begin to run. See supra,
at 786-789. Thus, New Jersey suffers nothing unless New
Jersey must at least reasonably be supposed to have known
that an attempt by New York to deal officially with "Ellis
Island" referred to something more than the original, concededly New York territory (on the assumption that it was
subject to the authority of any State at all).

Second, it is well to realize how far the presence of the
National Government and its particular activities throughout
the period necessarily limited the range of prescriptive acts
New York might possibly have performed and the information any acts performed might convey to New Jersey about
New York's intentions. Although New Jersey has not argued that the occupation of the filled land exclusively by the
United States throughout the prescriptive period precluded
any requisite occupation by New York as a matter of law
(and we express no opinion on that point, cf. Georgia v. South
Carolina, 497 U. S., at 389 (finding prescription where
United States Army Corps of Engineers had performed
some work on territory in dispute); Arkansas v. Tennessee,
310 U. S., at 571-572 (rejecting argument that prescription
is not possible where the United States holds title to land)),
much of the standard evidence of sovereign prescription is

792 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
out of the question in this case. New York, for example,has been in no position to establish towns, roads, or public

buildings, see Michigan v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S., at 306-307;Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1, 40 (1910), or otherwise actually occupy the area of the Island in dispute, see
Georgia v. South Carolina, supra, at 393 (charging Georgiawith the knowledge that South Carolina was cultivating the

territory in question). Instead, the United States ArmyCorps of Engineers and the Procurement Division of the
Treasury Department controlled all construction and im-provements. Nor did New York enjoy any substantial opportunity to assess taxes on the land and activities on theIsland, and so generate the kind of evidence of prescription
that we have found particularly persuasive in prior cases.See

Illinois v. Kentucky, 500 U. S., at 385; Georgia v. SouthCarolina, supra, at 392; Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, at

567; Maryland v. West Virginia, supra, at 40-41; Virginiav. Tennessee, 148 U. S., at 515. Until the passage of the
Buck Act, ch. 787, 54 Stat. 1059,12 in 1940, no State or munici-pality could impose taxes in a federal area located within
that State or municipality, and there is no evidence that NewYork collected any taxes from activities taking place on the
Island until 1991, long after the possible prescription periodwas over. Nor was there any significant opportunity for
New York to grant land or register deeds to land on theIsland, actions that have produced evidence in prior cases

12 The Buck Act provides that "[n]o person shall be relieved from liability
for payment of, collection of, or accounting for any sales or use tax levied
by any State, or by any duly constituted taxing authority therein, having
jurisdiction to levy such a tax, on the ground that the sale or use, with
respect to which such tax is levied, occurred in whole or in part within a
Federal area; and such State or taxing authority shall have full jurisdiction
and power to levy and collect any such tax in any Federal area within
such State to the same extent and with the same effect as though such
area was not a Federal area." 4 U. S. C. $ 105(a). The definition of "Federal area" under the Act includes "any lands or premises held or acquired
by or for the use of the United States or any department, establishment,
or agency, of the United States." $ 110(e).

Opinion of the Court
when assessing prescriptive acts, see, e. g., Vermont v. New
Hampshire, 289 U. S., at 614-615; Indiana v. Kentucky, 136
U. S. 479, 510 (1890); it is undisputed that by 1904 the United
States held title to all of the Island. Nor was there the normal opportunity for a claimant State or its agencies to meet
the normal governmental responsibility for public protection, as in providing police and fire protection to the disputed
area. The National Government had its own firefighting
equipment and security force and rarely received any help
from New York; the State showed that it furnished assistance on only three isolated occasions, in 1897 when the immigration depot burned to the ground, in 1905, when a cheating
federal employee working in the telegraph office was sent off
to the Ludlow Street jail in New York City, and in 1916,
when German saboteurs set fire to barges that floated to
Ellis Island and ignited the Island's seawall.13

13 Not only are these incidents spotty, they are also consistent with New
York's jurisdiction over the harbor waters granted by Article Third of the
Compact and with New York's undisputed authority over the original Island. The fire of 1897 involved buildings that were almost entirely on the
original Island, and the telegraph official arrested in 1905 was working in
the main immigration building, which was also located on the original Island. Finally, as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recognized in 1991, "[t]he City of New York has historically provided fireboat
protection for the waterfront areas of the New York Harbor." N. Y. Exh.
917 (letter to Norman Steisel, First Deputy Mayor, dated Apr. 12, 1991).
Accordingly, putting out the fire on the seawall of the Island in 1916 was
not an apparent act of prescription; it was in keeping with New York's
exclusive jurisdiction over waters of the harbor. But even leaving New
York's harbor jurisdiction aside, the act of one sovereign in helping a
neighboring government put out a fire would hardly suggest that territorial aggrandizement was afoot.

There is also evidence that two criminal complaints were filed in New
York City Municipal Court involving Ellis Island residents, but, as New
York admitted, "it is not clear from those complaints whether the criminal
acts occurred on Ellis Island." New York's Response to New Jersey Request for Admission 35 (Request No. 82).

In stating that "[i]n 1942, the New York City Police Department formed
a special squad to assist federal officials in questioning immigrants arriv523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
794 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
The United States' occupation of the land under the cession affected not only New York's opportunity to act in support of its claim but also the degree of attention that New
Jersey may reasonably be supposed to have paid to whatever
acts New York claims to have performed in asserting its jurisdiction. Thus, for example, a State should well know that
the residents of a populated enclave of its land have wholly
failed to register or vote; but it is far less likely that New
Jersey was aware of such resident population as the United
States did maintain on the Island, or that it had any idea
that some of those residents were registered to vote in New
York instead of some other place where they might vote as
absentees. Governor Rockefeller put this point well when
he remarked in 1959 that "[f]or more than fifty years, the
question [of which State has sovereignty over Ellis Island]
has been of relatively little importance because the Federal
Government has owned and administered [the Island]."
N. J. Exh. 123 (letter from Governor Rockefeller to Louis
Harris, dated June 4, 1959).

In sum, the peculiar facts of this case affected New York's
capacity to invoke a sovereign's claim as well as the significance of such acts it now adduces as prescriptive in character. New York's position as sovereign of the original Island

ing at the Island," post, at 822, Justice Stevens presumably relies upon
the testimony of New York's expert witness Harlan Unrau. As evidence
that New York provided this assistance, however, Unrau relied upon 10
letters from the New York City Police Department to the INS requesting
information about aliens originating in Germany. These documents give
no indication that members of the New York City Police Department were
themselves present on the Island to question immigrants. Indeed, although the INS's 1942 year-end report mentioned that "the Army and
Navy intelligence services, the Department of State, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cooperated in a plan whereby all incoming
passengers, both aliens and those claiming U. S. citizenship, were carefully
investigated," N. J. Exh. 530, pp. 8-9, the report does not mention that
any state agency participated in the interrogation.

Opinion of the Court
under the Compact rendered any statement of "Ellis Island,New York" equivocal, without more, for prescriptive purposes, and the National Government's occupation tended tolimit the notice to New Jersey of such acts as New York did
perform. To weigh New York's evidence with an apprecia-tion of these twin hurdles is not, as

Justice Stevenscharges, to resort to hypertechnicality, but to recognize that

New York has a substantial burden to establish that it gavegood notice to New Jersey of its designs on the made land.
We accordingly examine the evidence of prescriptive activitythat New York did serve up, which is closer to famine than
feast. It falls into four principal categories.

1
There is some evidence that New York recorded vital sta-tistics of people on the Island. The record contains New

York certificates recording five births that probably occurredon the filled portions of the Island,

14 22 New York certificates

recording deaths on the Island, all but one of which are froma single 4-month period in 1924, and five

15 marriage certificates, four from 1901 and one from 1914.16 For a period of

14 New York also presented evidence of 17 birth certificates recording
births before the 1897 fire on the Island. These certificates are not evidence of prescription, however, because New York failed to show that
these births took place on the original Island; nothing in the record indicates where the hospital was located in 1897.

15 There are actually six certificates in evidence, but one is a duplicate.

16 The marriage certificates are augmented by Edward Corsi's interview

of an Island employee named Frank Martocci, who recalled "numberless"
weddings on the Island (said to have been solemnized under New York
law) until the policy of marrying immigrants on the Island was dropped
and the immigrants were brought to City Hall in New York instead. N. Y.
Exh. 74, p. 409 (E. Corsi, In the Shadow of Liberty: The Chronicle of
Ellis Island 87 (1935)). One of New York's witnesses, Harlan Unrau, the
historian for the National Park Service, testified that Fiorello La Guardia's
memoirs also describe trips to and from the Island to Manhattan to tie the
knot. Tr. 3615-3618 (Aug. 8, 1996). This evidence amounts to little in
the absence of recording, and at most would show that immigrants undomi523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
796 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
64 years, this does not add up to much,17 and even its meagersignificance is diminished by the absence of evidence of any

regulation of the State or City of New York or the NationalGovernment providing for the registration in New York of
births and deaths that occurred on the Island. Of the mar-riage certificates, the one dated 1914 indicates that the marriage took place on Manhattan Island, not Ellis Island, andthe 1901 certificates reflect marriages that were probably
performed in the Main Building, located on the original Is-land. There is no evidence that any marriages solemnized
under New York law took place on the filled portion of theIsland. Immigration officials were apparently concerned
about complying with a law passed by New York in 1907 thatrequired couples getting married to obtain a marriage license from the town in which the woman resided. 1907N. Y. Laws, ch. 742. But that same law also provided that
if the woman or both parties were nonresidents of the State,the marriage license could be obtained from the State in
which the marriage was to be performed. Ibid. Obtaininga New York marriage license therefore carried no necessary
implication of residence, and at the times in question the im-migrants were, of course, undomiciled in America.

18 In sum,

the foregoing evidence cannot possibly be claimed to showany continuous practice, and 32 record entries over more

than six decades is not even arguably persuasive as circum-stantial evidence that New York was acting on a claim of

ciled in America were probably married in the Main Building at one time
and later were taken to Manhattan.

17 New York's expert testified that from 1890 to 1954 there were hundreds of births and thousands of deaths on the Island. Tr. 2719-2720,
2740 (July 31, 1996).

18 The record suggests that all the marriages taking place on the Island

and later at City Hall in Manhattan were marriages between immigrants
or between a resident of the United States and a person who had just
arrived. Immigration officials hoped that requiring young single women
to marry their fiance's before they would be admitted to the country would
help stem the importation of prostitutes.

right to any part of the Island or that New Jersey's officialsmust have known about the acts or the claim.

2
New York presented evidence of New York State and NewYork City statutes and ordinances that included the Island in

voting districts, together with voting registration lists withnames of people who indicated that they lived on filled portions of the Island. The limited force of this evidence is,however, manifest. The state statutes make no specific reference to the filled land, and even if they are read as doingso, they are evidence of claims made in Albany or Manhattan,
not acts of sovereignty on the Island. Nor does the legisla-tion reflect any awareness of changes in the Island's territory
over time. The same New York statutes for the establish-ment of Senate and Assembly districts covering Ellis Island
also purport to include another of the so-called Oyster Is-lands that had been dredged out of existence by 1903, see
1916 N. Y. Laws, ch. 373; 1917 N. Y. Laws, ch. 798; 1943 N. Y.Laws, ch. 359; in fact, the reference to the latter was not
deleted from the New York statutes until 1953, see 1953 N. Y.Laws, ch. 893, and the related maps of the First and Second
Assembly districts continued to show the missing Oyster Is-land as late as 1945. The depiction of Ellis Island on these
maps remains constant even though throughout the firstthird of this century the Island continued to change size and
shape. N. Y. Exhs. 957-963 (maps of Borough of Manhattan,1st and 2d Assembly Dists., issued by Bd. of Elections of
N. Y. C. (1918, 1926, 1927, 1929, 1930, 1939, 1945)). SinceNew York made no effort to update its description of voting
districts to eliminate the reference to Oyster Island, neverspecifically indicated an intent to include the filled land in
its voting districts, and failed to make any alteration in itsrepresentation of the Island on its voting maps, its legislative
acts were not overtly prescriptive and furnished no reasonfor New Jersey to infer that New York intended to include

798 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
the filled portions of the Island in its voting districts. Tothe extent that the registration lists, on the other hand, have

at least some tendency to suggest activity on the Island,there are lists for only 10 years out of the prescriptive period
(1917, 1918, 1919, 1925, 1926, 1930, 1936, 1939, 1945, and1953), and why New Jersey might have known about these
lists is not addressed by any specific evidence.

3
The third category of New York's proffered prescriptionevidence covers personal impressions that the filled portions

of the Island belong to New York. We have recognized be-fore that the belief of the inhabitants of disputed territory
that they are citizens of one of the competing States is "of noinconsiderable importance." Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5
Wheat. 374, 384 (1820); see also Maryland v. West Virginia,217 U. S., at 41, 44 (noting that people living in the disputed
territory gave allegiance to West Virginia); Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S., at 527 (noting that all but a handful of theresidents of the disputed territory considered themselves citizens of Tennessee). New York's strongest items of this sortof circumstantial evidence are the voting registration lists
for 10 of the possible 60 years, on which numerous individu-als list their residence as "Ellis Island, New York." The
significance of the declarations is qualified, however, for thereasons we have already given, and the rest of New York's
evidence about the understanding of individuals is hardlyworth mentioning. This includes, for example, documents
indicating that the same two men who witnessed the Com-missioner of Immigration's signature on contracts four different times in 1908 and 1909 listed their residences as "EllisIsland, NY"; that another witness did the same once in 1904,
and two others did in 1908. On one petition for naturaliza-tion filed in 1911 the applicant listed her residence as "Ellis
Island, New York," as did her witness. Finally, one WilliamHewitt, who lived in the officers' quarters on the Island with

Opinion of the Court
his family from July to September 1940 when he was oneyear old, testified that although he had "no personal recollection" of living on the Island, he has always thought that atthat time he was living in New York. Tr. 3144-3145 (Aug.
5, 1996).19 4

The final category of relatively noteworthy evidence cov-ers indications that during the relevant period the United
States understood the filled portions of the Island to be partof New York. It is not, of course, that the understanding
of officials of the United States, even those on the Island,is itself tantamount to prescriptive activity. The United
States was in no sense New York's proxy. See Californiav.

Nevada, 447 U. S. 125, 131 (1980) (noting that the UnitedStates does not have the power to reestablish boundary

lines). It may, however, amount to persuasive evidence thata State's prescriptive acts have succeeded in their object.

20

While the record does indeed contain some such evidencefavorable to New York, other indications point the other way.

19 Justice Stevens contends that "[t]he evidence indicates that the millions of immigrants entering the country . . . believed that Ellis Island was
located in New York." Post, at 820. Because New York presented no
testimony to this effect, Justice Stevens relies upon steamship tickets,
certificates of arrival, and landing cards that stated that the holder was
going to or had arrived in New York. These various documents are entirely accurate insofar as every immigrant arriving at Ellis Island was
processed through the New York Immigration District. But the documents prove nothing for this case, since throughout the period from 1891
to 1956 the New York Immigration District included northern New Jersey.

20 When the understanding of national officials takes the form of published records, it may help to place a State on notice of an adverse claim
and present occasion to protest or acquiesce. See, e. g., California v. Nevada, 447 U. S., at 129-130 (noting that both States had adopted the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey line by statute and used it for nearly
80 years); Vermont v. New Hampshire, 289 U. S. 593, 613 (1933) (there
was evidence that both States were familiar with congressional resolutions
locating the disputed territory in Vermont but New Hampshire did not
object); Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S. 1, 53-58 (1906).

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
800 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
In fact, the full record reveals not merely one understandingon the part of some United States officials about the Island's

sovereignty, but three different understandings on thispoint, inconsistent with each other and inconstant over time.

First, there is some evidence that officials of the UnitedStates may have thought the entire Island was in New York.
At various times from 1903 to 1925 the Commissioner of Im-migration on Ellis Island used New York wages as a benchmark to show the need to raise the wages of federal workerson the Island. And although federal specifications governed
construction projects on the Island, federal inspectors are
known to have alluded to New York building codes as if they
had been bases for relevant comparisons; a federal inspectorwould occasionally remark that if a particular building were

subject to New York regulations, it would have to be con-demned, and once, in 1935, when an official in the Public
Works Branch of the Procurement Division recommendedaccepting a contractor's request to use a particular kind of

bolt, the official noted that his New York counterparts hadallowed the bolt to be used.

21 References to New York regulations as benchmarks do not, then, necessarily indicate thatfederal officials actually thought the filled land was part of

New York.After the passage of the Davis-Bacon Act, 46 Stat. 1494,
however, comes less equivocal evidence of understanding.As originally enacted, this statute provided that workers on
"any public buildings of the United States" be paid at a rate
"not less than the prevailing rate of wages for work of asimilar nature in the city, town, village, or other civil division

of the State in which the public buildings are located," ibid.,

21 In 1905, a contract for work on the Island required that the work
"must be of the best quality and in strict accordance with the present
rules and regulations of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, New York, N. Y." N. Y. Exh. 638, p. 47. This is the only contract
on record where contractors were required to follow New York regulations
as if they were binding.

Opinion of the Court
and there is evidence that from 1931 to 1934 construction
contracts for work on filled portions of the Island provided
that wages for the City of New York applied.22 The National Government also treated Ellis Island as part of New
York in the 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1940 national censuses, and
throughout the prescription period various officials referred
to "Ellis Island, New York," in correspondence.23

But the National Government was nothing if not pluralistic in its views on the matter. In 1900, when the Government requested proposals for a kitchen and restaurant building on the Island, its announcement stated that "Ellis Island
is not under the jurisdiction of the State or City of New
York. The New York City and State Building Laws and

22 New York also presented evidence that in 1934 New York processed
two workmen compensation claims for injuries sustained on filled land; it
was not until 1936, however, that Congress permitted the application of
state law to federal workmen's compensation claims. See Murray v. Joe
Gerrick & Co., 291 U. S. 315 (1934). Nor is it clear from the record that
the processing of these claims actually involved the application of New
York law; the processing may be explained simply by the fact that the
contractor for whom the victims worked was located in New York.

23 In United States ex rel. Belardi v. Day, 50 F. 2d 816, 817 (1931), the

Third Circuit held that Ellis Island was within the territorial jurisdiction
of the District Courts of the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York.
The court explained that "[w]hen [the Island] was property of New York
it was within one or another of the counties of that state or within the
waters thereof," and the former 28 U. S. C. $ 178 (now 28 U. S. C. $ 112)
places the waters of the New York counties within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Southern and Eastern Districts. The court held that even
though the 1834 Compact placed the Island on New Jersey's side of the
boundary, "[t]he running of a boundary line in 1834 through the waters
dividing the states of New York and New Jersey cannot disturb the statutory designation of jurisdiction in 1910." 50 F. 2d, at 817. Thus, the
Third Circuit simply read the jurisdictional statute as placing any location
within the waters subject to New York jurisdiction (as, under the Compact, the harbor waters were, for police purposes, even on the New Jersey
side of the line) within the concurrent jurisdiction of the two named federal districts. The Third Circuit explicitly avoided determining anything
about state sovereignty over the Island.

City Ordinances will not apply to the same in regard to build-ing matters." N. Y. Exh. 775, sheet OO. From 1890 to

1911, however, the federal spokesmen did not stop at sayingmerely that the Island was not part of New York; in these
years the federal Harbor Line Board prepared surveys of
recommended Island pierhead and bulkhead lines for the ap-proval of the Secretary of War, all of which were titled "Pierhead & Bulkhead Lines for Ellis' Island, New Jersey, NewYork Harbor, as recommended by the New York Harbor Line
Board." App. to Exceptions of New Jersey 21a, 22a.24 In1904, as said before, the United States made an application
to the Riparian Commission of New Jersey for certain landsunder water adjacent to Ellis Island. The United States Attorney General, William Moody, at that time explained thatthe Government had not made the application earlier because it had previously "proceeded upon the theory that the
ownership of the lands under water around Ellis Island wasin the State of New York," but changed its view because "it

would seem from [the Compact] that the ownership of thelands under water west of the middle of the Hudson River
and of the Bay of New York is in the State of New Jersey."N. J. Exh. 351 (letter from U. S. Atty. Gen. William Moody
to the Riparian Comm'n of New Jersey 1-2, dated July 15,1904).

25 In 1933, New Jersey got the nod again when the

24 Justice Stevens brands this ascription to New Jersey as "obviously
. . . a mistake." Post, at 826, n. 17. But the mistake (as to the original
Island) was not obvious. See n. 25, infra.

25 The New York Times reported that "[t]he chief interest in the application lies in the fact that it is a recognition of the claim that New Jersey
and not New York owns the submerged lands in the vicinity of Ellis Island." N. J. Exh. 5 (N. Y. Times, July 19, 1904).

Justice Stevens contends that once New Jersey transferred title to
the submerged lands to the United States "the parties may reasonably

surface." Post, at 816. On the contrary, the reasonableness of any such
belief is belied by the fact that New York, to this day, has never claimed
that it had any such understanding, presumably for two very good reasons.
First, in transferring "all the right, title, claim and interest of every kind"
in certain submerged lands to the United States in 1904, New Jersey's
conveyance sounded much like New York's conveyance to the National
Government in 1808 of all "right, title, and interest" in the original Island.
(While the latter transfer was expressly "for the defense and safety" of
the city and port, these words were not treated as limitations on the rights
of the United States even when it converted the Island from a military
installation to an immigration station.) If, then, New York had believed
that New Jersey had no interest left to assert, it would have had to say
the same for itself in relation to the original Island. Indeed, New York
would have been in an arguably weaker position: in 1800 it had ceded
"jurisdiction" to the United States (saving only its right to serve process),
the territory subject to its conveyance was within the boundary of New
Jersey, and New York had no general territorial right in the area except
police jurisdiction over the waters. The arguably comprehensive extent
of the New York conveyances is, moreover, the reason that Justice Stevens is mistaken to label the 1890-1911 federal Harbor Line Board maps
as obviously wrong. See post, at 826-827, n. 17.

Second, if the United States, and not New Jersey, had sovereign authority over the filled land as a result of the 1904 transfer, New York's prescriptive claim to that territory would fail as a matter of law; the United
States is immune to prescription by a domestic entity. Texas v. Louisiana, 410 U. S. 702, 714 (1973); United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19,
39-40 (1947).

26 Justice Stevens, post, at 826, n. 17, contends that Corsi, who made

the application on behalf of the INS, must have thought the seawall would
be constructed in New York because he entered "New York" in a space
on the permit application asking "[w]here work is contemplated." If Corsi
truly thought the seawall was going to be constructed in New York, however, he must have been a whimsical soul to apply to New Jersey for
a permit.

804 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
Hamilton F. Kean and Representative Mary T. Norton, wroteto the Department of Labor expressing concern that federal

contractors were not hiring members of New Jersey's unionlocals even though the Island work site was part of New
Jersey. N. J. Exhs. 12, 24-27. The Department of Labor
asked the Procurement Division of the Public Works Branchof the Treasury Department for advice on this issue, and the

Procurement Division originally decided that "[s]ince EllisIsland is not clearly within the boundary lines of either state
and is clearly outside of the jurisdiction of either, workersshould be drawn in roughly equal proportions from the two
states." N. J. Exhs. 24, 33-35. When the Jersey City, New
Jersey, chapter of Bricklayers, Masons, and Plasterers International Union would not settle for this neutrality and
pressed the Treasury Department for a statement that Ellis
Island was in New Jersey, the Department managed to lob
the question back to the Department of Labor, whose solicitor (later Judge) Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., sent this
response: "[I]t seems to me perfectly apparent that your
answer is sound: Ellis Island and Bedloe's Island are no
more a part of New York or New Jersey than the Philippine
Islands or Hawaii are. They are territories of the United
States not falling under the jurisdiction of any one of the
forty-eight states." N. J. Exh. 43. And yet matters did not
rest there for long, for when a Government contractor, the
Driscoll Company, later learned that it would have to employ
both New York and New Jersey workers, it wrote to the
Treasury Department calling attention to the 1834 Compact,
of which the agency apparently had been unaware. With
skillful evasiveness, the Treasury replied that under the
Compact, "[t]he question appears to be one of fact: whether
Ellis Island is within the territorial limits of New York or
New Jersey. This does not seem to be a matter for determination by the Board of Labor Review." N. J. Exh. 51.
When the contractor continued to protest any requirement
to hire workers from New Jersey, the Procurement Division

805Cite as: 523 U. S. 767 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
responded that "Article 2 of [the 1834 Compact] seems toindicate clearly that New York has jurisdiction over Ellis

Island." N. J. Exh. 52. The union local and Norton pro-tested this decision, arguing that Solicitor Wyzanski was correct and calling attention to New Jersey's 1933 permit to theUnited States for work on the Island's seawall, as well as the
1904 deed from New Jersey to the United States conveyingtitle to the submerged lands. The Procurement Division,
again erroneously citing Article Second of the Compact, re-fused to budge.

The record does not reveal whether the Compact was everbrought to the notice of the Department of Labor, but if it
was it made an impression markedly different from its effecton the Treasury. For in the 1940's, the Secretary of Labor
moved from its solicitor's rejection of both States' claims toan acceptance of New Jersey's, issuing several decisions in
the 1947-1949 period on proper wage rates for constructionprojects on the Island, to which he referred as "Ellis Island,
New York Harbor, Hudson County, New Jersey." In thesame period, the Department of Labor expressly ruled that
New York building trade wage rates were not applicable toconstruction on the Island because "Ellis Island [is in] New
York Harbor, in Hudson County, New Jersey." In June1949, the Secretary declared that once again New York wage
rates would apply; the Secretary explained only that "ad-ditional data and more current information have been
assembled."At the end of the day, or the possible prescription period,
the circumstantial evidence of official federal views of Islandsovereignty shows no consistent understanding, but simply
a grab bag of opinions shifting back and forth between, andwithin, the agencies of the Government.

5
After reviewing all the evidence New York has presented,we find that with the arguable exception of maintenance of

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
806 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
some voting lists, New York has shown nothing more than amodest number of sporadic acts that might be regarded as

prescriptive. Even the compilations of voting lists fromtime to time shared the characteristic of New York's other
official acts in occurring off the Island, being either equivocalin their territorial references or ill calculated to give notice
to New Jersey. Surely it is highly significant that the actsclaimed as prescription by New York did not leave officials
of the Island's actual occupants, the United States, with asettled or consistent understanding that the filled land might
be subject to the sovereignty of New York.

C
New York also asserts the affirmative defense of laches,which " `requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party

against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice tothe party asserting the defense.' "

Kansas v. Colorado, 514U. S. 673, 687 (1995) (quoting Costello v. United States, 365

U. S. 265, 282 (1961)). It presses this defense in spite of ourexplanation in Illinois v. Kentucky, 500 U. S., at 388, that
"[a]lthough the law governing interstate boundary disputestakes account of the broad policy disfavoring the untimely
assertion of rights that underlies the defense of laches andstatutes of limitations, it does so through the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence." New York seemingly hopes tobenefit from the possibility recognized in

Kansas v. Colo-rado, supra, at 687-688, that a laches defense may be available in some cases founded upon interstate compacts. Wehave no reason to explore that possibility here, however, because New York has made it plain that what it calls the de-fense of laches is not at all what it really asserts.

The claim of prejudice that New York raises under the
guise of a laches defense includes no prejudice in defendingagainst suit insofar as it is based upon the Compact and the

doctrine of avulsion. New York does not, for example,

Opinion of the Court
argue that evidence going to the meaning of the Compact'sterms has been lost as a result of delay by New Jersey. Indeed, several of New York's amici have proffered extensivematerial bearing on those terms (though to no avail as explained in footnote 3, supra), and the State itself has reliedupon historical records of littoral filling practices in the Compact period, without suggesting that delay by New Jerseycontributed to the loss of any such evidence.

New York claims prejudice, rather, in presenting its af-firmative defense of prescription and acquiescence. To establish that defense, as we have seen, New York must provethat it took action to acquire sovereignty independent of the
Compact, and that New Jersey failed to protest. When NewYork thus asserts prescription as an affirmative defense, it
is in the same position it would have occupied if it had itselfbrought an original action against New Jersey claiming sovereignty by prescription. On each of the essential elementsof prescription and acquiescence New York has the burden
of persuasion, and therefore, though raising a "defense," it isin effect a plaintiff. And it is in aid of this plaintiff 's burden
of proof that New York claims to have been prejudiced: itargues that if this action had been brought many years ago
there would have been more evidence of sovereign acts byits officials, and better evidence of general understanding of
where sovereignty lay, to enable it to carry its burden.New York may be right, as a matter of fact, though it is
hard to say. But even if the State is right, it cannot benefitfrom the defense of laches. This is so because New York is
effectively a plaintiff on the issue of prescription and cannotinvoke laches to escape the necessity of proving its affirmative case. III

New Jersey's first and second exceptions go only to thedimensions of the original portion of the Island, the first
questioning the Special Master's choice of water levels to

Opinion of the Court
define the shoreline, the second challenging a miniscule de-tail of that line. Its third exception questions the authority

to improve upon that line, once located.

A
As the Special Master saw it, under Article Second, which
awarded the Island to New York without further geographical specification, that State's authority extends to the original Island's low-water mark, a conclusion with which we
agree, though not for the same reasons that persuaded the
Special Master. He relied heavily on the negotiations between New Jersey and New York in 1827, in which New
Jersey at one point offered to give New York "the islands
called Bedlow's Island, Ellis' Island, Oyster Island and Robbins Reef, to [the] low water mark of the same . . . ." N. J.
Exhs. 280-292 (Report of the Commissioners of New York
to the New York Legislature, Jan. 26, 1828, p. 3). We rest
our own, like conclusion (given the silence of the Compact)
on the general rule we have previously recognized, that the
low-water mark is the most appropriate boundary between
sovereigns. See Vermont v. New Hampshire, 289 U. S., at
606; Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat., at 383. We
explained this in Handly's Lessee:

"This rule has been established by the common consent
of mankind. It is founded on common convenience.
Even when a State retains its dominion over a river
which constitutes the boundary between itself and another State, it would be extremely inconvenient to extend its dominion over the land on the other side, which
was left bare by the receding of the water. . . . Wherever
the river is a boundary between States, it is the main,
the permanent river, which constitutes the boundary;
and the mind will find itself embarrassed with insurmountable difficulty in attempting to draw any other
line than the low-water mark." Id., at 380-381.

809Cite as: 523 U. S. 767 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
We assume that the parties to the Compact were well awareof our precedent and would have explicitly provided for a

high-water mark boundary if that is what they intended.Nor is our assumption unsettled by the fact, emphasized
by New Jersey, that Article Third gives New York jurisdiction over "lands covered by the . . . waters [of the rivers andthe Harbor] to the low-water mark on the westerly or New

Jersey side thereof [subject to certain exceptions]." NewJersey argues that specification of a low-water mark as a
jurisdictional boundary on the New Jersey shore suggeststhat some other, or high-water, line was intended elsewhere,
as on Ellis Island. But we think any such inference would
be unsound.

The jurisdiction bounded at the low-water mark under Article Third was New York's jurisdiction over the waters of
the river and harbor. New York was also given jurisdiction
over the land submerged by this water. Since jurisdiction
over the submerged land followed from jurisdiction over the
water, one might question whether the submerged land jurisdiction crept inland at high water. On the assumption that
title to fast land generally extended to mean low water, the
answer to this question was wholly academic so far as it related to Ellis Island and the other islands, but of potential
consequence so far as it concerned the New Jersey shore. If
New York's jurisdiction over submerged lands moved inland
on Ellis Island with rising water, it would simply extend
over land already subject to New York's jurisdiction under
the general rule recognized in Handly's Lessee, since New
York had jurisdiction over the original Island. But that
would not be so on the New Jersey shore. If New Jersey's
sovereignty extended to mean low water under the general
rule, there would be a conflict with New York's jurisdiction
over submerged lands on the margin covered by high water.
The specification that New York's submerged land jurisdiction would stop at the low-water mark on the New Jersey
shore thus resolved a question that would only arise at that

810 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
westerly shore, and the fact that the Compact so provides
raises no implication that anything but the general rule of
sovereignty to mean low water was intended with respect to
any shoreline. The provision in question, indeed, confirms
the intent of the compacting parties to follow the general,
low-water mark rule.

B

New Jersey's second exception takes us to much narrower
detail. The State challenges the sufficiency of the evidence
for the Special Master's conclusion that the pier extending
from the Island in 1834 was built on landfill, with the result
that the area covered by it was meant to fall within New
York's authority recognized in Article Second. The Special
Master relied on a map of the Island from 1819, which appears to show a filled area around the location of the pier,
and although New Jersey is correct that "it is possible that
the pier was built on pilings," New Jersey Exceptions 47,
New York's expert credibly testified that in the mid-1800's
the use of pilings to create piers was still uncommon, and
that it would have been much easier to add landfill to the
shallow waters around the Island. We have to agree with
the Special Master that the likely conclusion is that the pier
was built on landfill.

C

Finally, New Jersey argues that this Court lacks the authority to adjust the boundary between the States in the
manner that the Special Master recommended for reasons of
practicality and convenience, and with this we agree. The
Compact Clause, Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, provides that "[n]o State
shall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any
Agreement or Compact with another State . . . ." As we
explained long ago, once a compact between States has been
approved, "it settles the line or original right; it is the law
of the case binding on the states and its citizens, as fully as
if it had been never contested." Rhode Island v. Massachu523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

setts, 12 Pet. 657, 727 (1838). Indeed, congressional consent"transforms an interstate compact within [the Compact]

Clause into a law of the United States," Cuyler v. Adams,449 U. S. 433, 438 (1981); accord, Texas v. New Mexico, 462
U. S. 554, 564 (1983). Just as if a court were addressing afederal statute, then, the "first and last order of business" of
a court addressing an approved interstate compact "is inter-preting the compact."

Id., at 567-568. "[U]nless the com-pact to which Congress has consented is somehow unconstitutional, no court may order relief inconsistent with itsexpress terms," id., at 564, no matter what the equities of
the circumstances might otherwise invite. See Arizona v.
California, 373 U. S. 546, 565-566 (1963) ("[C]ourts haveno power to substitute their own notions of an `equitable apportionment' for the apportionment chosen by Congress");Washington v. Oregon, 211 U. S. 127, 135 (1908) (noting that
Congress had established the boundary between Washingtonand Oregon in the middle of the north channel, and that
"[t]he courts have no power to change the boundary thusprescribed and establish it at the middle of some other channel," even though changes in the waterway over the courseof time seemed to indicate the equity of altering the boundary line); cf. New Jersey v. Delaware, 291 U. S. 361, 385(1934);

Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S., at 46.We appreciate the difficulties of a boundary line that divides not just an island but some of the buildings on it, butthese drawbacks are the price of New Jersey's success in
litigating under a compact whose fair construction calls fora line so definite.

n. 13 (noting that litigation of disputes between States "isobviously a poor alternative to negotiation between the interested States"). A more convenient boundary line must

IV
The exception of the State of New Jersey to Part VII ofthe Special Master's report, which concerns our authority to

adjust the original boundary line between the two States, issustained. The other exceptions of New Jersey and those
of the State of New York are overruled. The case will berecommitted to the Special Master for preparation of a
proposal for a decree consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring.

Many of us have parents or grandparents who landed asimmigrants at "Ellis Island, New York." And when this
case was argued, I assumed that history would bear out thatEllis Island was part and parcel of New York. But that is
not what the record has revealed. Rather, it contains a setof facts, set forth with care by

Justice Souter and Justice
Stevens (who do not disagree about the facts), which shows,in my view, that the filled portion of Ellis Island belongs to

New Jersey.I cannot agree with

Justice Scalia that custom, assump-tion, and late 19th-century history fills in, and explains, an

ambiguity in the original Compact between the States, for Ido not find sufficient, relevant ambiguity. The word "relevant" is important, for the document, in fact, is highly ambig-uous. But what I find the more serious and difficult ambiguity arises in sections upon which New York State does not

Breyer, J., concurring
rely. See ante, at 773-775, 781-782, and nn. 3, 4 (discussingArticle Third). The State has basically rested its case upon

Article First and Article Second. See Brief for Defendant11-15; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35-36, 46. Those Articles specify
that Ellis Island is in New Jersey waters, for the border
between the States lies far to the east. Those Articles domention an exception for New York's "present jurisdiction of

and over Bedlow's and Ellis's islands," but they are silentabout what would happen to an Ellis Island "avulsion,"

i. e.,
the creation of significant additional territory through land-fill. As

Justice Souter points out, ante, at 783, n. 6, silence is not ambiguity; silence means that ordinary back-ground law applies; and that ordinary background law gives

an island's avulsion not to the State that owns the island,
but to the State in whose waters the avulsion is found. See
Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 U. S. 376, 404 (1990); Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359, 361-362 (1892); see also ante,at 783-784.

Nor can I agree with Justice Stevens that New Jerseylost through prescription what once rightfully was its own.
Too much of the evidence upon which he relies is evidenceof events that took place during the time that neither
New York nor New Jersey, but the Federal Government,
controlled Ellis Island. At that time, Judge Wyzanski ex-pressed the view that:

"Ellis Island and Bedloe's Island are no more a part of
New York or New Jersey than the Philippine Islands or
Hawaii are. They are territories of the United Statesnot falling under the jurisdiction of any one of the fortyeight states." N. J. Exh. 43.
The Federal Government's virtually exclusive authority over
the Island means that New Jersey could well have thought
about the same. Perhaps more specialized property lawyers
would have phrased their own conclusions in less ringing
terms and with more numerous qualifications. But, still,

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
814 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Stevens, J., dissenting
one cannot reasonably expect New Jersey to have mounted amajor protest against

New York's assertions of "sovereignty"
(modest as they were) over territory that was within thecontrol of the Federal Government. Nor can one expect the

immigrants themselves to have taken a particular interest in
state boundaries, for most would have thought not in terms
of "New York" or "New Jersey," but of a New World that
offered them opportunities denied them by the Old. Given
this background, any legal rule of "prescription" that found
New York to have surmounted its high barrier here would
create serious problems of fairness in other cases.

For these reasons, in particular, and others, all spelled out
in detail by Justice Souter, I must conclude that the filled
portion of Ellis Island belongs not to New York, but to New
Jersey. I therefore join the Court's opinion.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
While I agree with the Court's analysis of the relevant
legal issues, I do not agree with its appraisal of the evidence.
Because we are in effect sitting as a trial court, and because
the relevant evidence is either documentary or uncontradicted oral testimony, we are able to make our own findings
of fact and draw appropriate inferences from those findings.
In my judgment a preponderance of that evidence supports
a finding that all interested parties shared the belief that the
filled portions, as well as the original three acres, of Ellis
Island were a part of the State of New York for over 60
years. That finding, in turn, supports the conclusion that
New York acquired the power to govern the entire Island
by prescription.

During the period between 1892 and 1954 Ellis Island
served as the Gateway to America for over 12 million immigrants. Thousands of citizens worked on the Island and
hundreds resided there during those six decades. There is
no evidence that any of those people ever believed that any

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

815Cite as: 523 U. S. 767 (1998)
Stevens, J., dissenting
part of Ellis Island was in the State of New Jersey. Whatevidence is available uniformly supports the proposition that

whenever a question of state authority was considered byany members of that multitude of immigrants and citizens,
both they and the responsible authorities in New York as-sumed that all of Ellis Island was a part of New York. The
relevant facts were sufficiently public and obvious to supporta presumption that, with one temporary exception, the authorities in New Jersey shared that belief. The fact that allof the relevant evidence concerning that period points in the
same direction is far more significant than the fact that thequantity of evidence supporting certain propositions is not
large. A solitary fingerprint may establish a preponderanceof the evidence when there is a total absence of evidence
pointing in another direction.

I
As a preface to its factfinding, the Court provides us withtwo reasons for discounting the probative force of much of

New York's evidence: the fact that New Jersey concedes thatthe original Island is in New York and the fact that the Island was occupied by the United States during the relevantperiod.

Ante, at 790-794. Neither of those facts under-mines the force of the uncontradicted evidence. I believe

that a more appropriate preface to our factfinding functionis a comment on the probable expectations of the three sovereigns who participated in the decision to enlarge the Islandfor use as an immigration station.

In 1890, when that decision was made, the 1834 Compactestablishing the boundary between the two States had not
yet been construed. Article Second of the Compact made itclear that Ellis Island was in New York, but Article Third
identified separate interests in the area surrounding the Is-land. New Jersey was accorded "the exclusive right of
property in and to the land under water" but New York was

523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
816 NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK

Stevens, J., dissenting
accorded exclusive jurisdiction over those waters.1 In 1904,when New Jersey conveyed to the United States its entire

"right, title, claim and interest of every kind" in those sub-merged lands, the parties may reasonably have believed that
the State thereafter possessed neither ownership nor juris-diction over that area, particularly since the Compact had
provided that New York was entitled to exercise jurisdictionover the surrounding surface.

It is thus not surprising that during the entire periodwhen the Island was enlarged, and when buildings were constructed on filled land, there appears to have been no discus-sion of the possibility that the Island might be located in two
different States. Indeed, even in 1955 and for several yearsthereafter when representatives of New Jersey vociferously
asserted jurisdiction over Ellis Island, they claimed not justthe filled portions but the entire Island. It was not until
1963 that New Jersey first advanced the claim that the stateline split the Island (and, consequently, three buildings on
the Island). Thus, the preponderance of the evidence sup-ports a finding that during the relevant period between 1890
and 1954 both New Jersey and New York believed that theentire Island was located in one State.

II
Census data collected by both New York and the FederalGovernment establish that nonimmigrants resided on Ellis

Island throughout the relevant period. This population in-creased from 93 in 1915, to 124 in 1920, and 182 in 1925.

1 Article Third also preserved New Jersey's jurisdiction "over the
wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made on the shore of
the said state," but that provision is not relevant because the original
additions to Ellis Island were improvements to the shore of New York,
not New Jersey. 4 Stat. 710.

2 These figures refer to nonimmigrants. The 1920 federal census stated

that there also were 270 "patients" and 97 "immigrants" on the Island.
The 1940 federal census stated that 717 people lived on the Island but
does not indicate how many of them were nonimmigrants. Since the 1940

Stevens, J., dissenting
The uncontradicted testimony indicates that these peoplelived only on the filled portion of the Island. They were

employed as cooks, maids, nurses, and hospital attendants.Both the New York and federal censuses counted these people as residents of New York.The evidence also indicates that these residents voted in
New York elections. According to maps prepared by theNew York City Board of Elections in 1918, 1926, 1927, 1930,
and 1945-1946, Ellis Island was part of a New York StateAssembly District. Moreover, both the 1894 and the 1938
New York State Constitutions place Ellis Island in a NewYork State Senate District. Furthermore, since 1911 New
York law has explicitly included Ellis Island in a federal con-gressional district. Finally, records of the New York City
Board of Elections for 1918, 1919, 1925,3 1930, and 1953 indi-cate that Ellis Island residents actually voted during those
years. Indeed, an official list of enrolled voters for "1944-1945" identifies the party affiliation of over 50 residents of
Ellis Island. It is reasonable to infer that residents of EllisIsland regularly voted in elections for New York offices and
for candidates to represent New York in the United StatesSenate and House of Representatives. Given the public
character of that activity it is also reasonable to infer thatNew Jersey was fully aware of that voting.

The Court fails to give proper weight to the fact that theentire population of the Island was counted as a part of New
York in the federal census. The accuracy of the census is amatter of great importance to every State because it determines the size of a State's congressional delegation, as wellas providing "the basis for the allocation of various benefits
and burdens among the States under a variety of federal
total was roughly 50% greater than the 1920 total, the number of nonimmigrants may also have risen by a similar percentage.

3 The 1925 records refer to 25 voters from Ellis Island, 14 of whom gave

their addresses as on either Island No. 2 or Island No. 3, both of which

programs." Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 814(1992). Given the fact that a shift of only one or two hundred persons from one State to another might cause a Stateeither to lose one of its seats in Congress or to fail to gain
the number warranted by its relative increase in population,the accuracy of the census count is surely a matter of vital
importance to the State.4 The consistent treatment of EllisIsland residents as residents of New York in the federal census is a matter that must have come to the attention of NewJersey and which was clearly of sufficient importance to
prompt a vigorous objection if responsible state officials be-lieved that those residents really lived in New Jersey. The
fact that the Island was under federal control does not mini-mize in the slightest the importance of the census figures, or
the importance of the other public acts that authorized EllisIsland residents to vote in New York elections.

III
There is uncontradicted testimony that between 1892 and1954 there were hundreds of births and thousands of deaths

on the Island. Since the hospital was located on the filledportions of the Island, virtually all of those births and deaths
must have occurred in what is now claimed to be part of NewJersey. Presumably each of those births and each of those
deaths was recorded in either a birth certificate or a deathcertificate. There is no evidence that any such certificate
was issued by New Jersey. Given the fact that all of therelevant birth certificates and all of the relevant death certificates that have been found were issued by New York au-thorities, it is reasonable to infer that New York actually
issued hundreds of birth certificates and thousands of deathcertificates to record events that occurred on Ellis Island.
A preponderance of the evidence therefore would support afinding that throughout the relevant period New York per4 See generally Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442

formed the governmental function of recording the births
and deaths on Ellis Island, and that the families of those
decedents and newborn infants thought that those events
occurred in New York.

IV

There is evidence that hundreds of marriages were performed on Ellis Island from 1892 to 1907. The exact number
is uncertain, but it is undisputed that they were solemnized
under New York law.5 Moreover, after a 1907 amendment
to New York's domestic relations law, Ellis Island residents
obtained their marriage licenses at City Hall in New York
City. Fiorello La Guardia, who served as an interpreter on
the Island between 1907 and 1910, escorted couples to Manhattan so that they could get married. Presumably similar
trips were made by engaged couples throughout the balance
of the relevant period.6 There is no evidence of any Ellis
Island resident being married under New Jersey law.

5 Although only a few marriage licenses are in the record, they are all
New York licenses.

While there is some dispute over where these marriages occurred on
the Island, it is fair to conclude, as the Court does, that these marriages
were typically performed in the Great Hall of the Main Building, which
was located on the original Island. Thus, they were performed in New
York. The Court discounts the significance of this evidence because it
does not necessarily constitute prescriptive activity on the filled portion
of the Island. But if we assume, as the record plainly indicates, that everyone then believed that the entire Island was located in the same State,
these marriages provide further confirmation of the proposition that everyone on the Island believed that that State was New York.

6 One Ellis Island employee, who worked on the Island during the early

part of the century, remembered as follows:
" `Very often brides came over to marry here, and of course we had to act
as witnesses. I have no count, but I'm sure I must have helped at hundreds and hundreds of weddings of all nationalities and all types. The
weddings were numberless, until they dropped the policy of marrying
them at the Island and brought them to City Hall in New York.' "

The evidence indicates that the millions of immigrantsentering the country, as well as the hundreds of residents

of the Island, believed that Ellis Island was located inNew York. For many of the immigrants, their journey to
America began with a steamship ticket with the destinationlisted as "New York." Upon arrival, the "certificate of arrival" for each newcomer was marked "Ellis Island, NewYork"; indeed, hundreds of thousands of such certificates of
arrival are on file at the National Archives. Moreover, uponarrival, a federal official pinned a Landing Card on each newcomer; according to a representative card, the Landing Cardstated, in eight different languages: "When landing at New
York this card is to be pinned to the coat or dress of thepassenger in a prominent position."

7 One such Landing Card read as follows:

Stevens, J., dissenting
it is certainly fair to infer that the new immigrants believedthat they had arrived in New York.

Similarly, residents of Ellis Island--all of whom lived onthe filled portions of the Island--believed that they lived in
New York. Documents executed by residents of the Islandduring the relevant period consistently referred to their address either as "Ellis Island, N. Y.," or as "Ellis Island, NewYork." These references appear not only in voting records,
but in other miscellaneous documents as well. Given thefact that the United States Postal Service placed the Island
in a New York postal zone, presumably the residents regu-larly received mail addressed to "Ellis Island, N. Y." There
is no evidence that any of those residents prepared or re-ceived any mail or other documents describing their residence as in New Jersey.Thus, the available evidence supports the proposition that
the new immigrants, as well as everyone who lived on theIsland during that period, thought that all of Ellis Island was
a part of New York. Significantly, as far as I am aware,there is not a single indication in the voluminous record

8 that

any immigrant or any resident thought that Ellis Island, inwhole or in part, was a part of New Jersey.

On the few occasions identified in the record when it wasnecessary to obtain state or municipal assistance for law enforcement or fire protection on Ellis Island during the rele-vant period, those services were performed by New York
employees. Thus, in the 1897 fire, "New York rushedtwenty policemen to keep order among the panic-stricken
immigrants." 9 In 1916, New York City firemen extin-guished a fire in the seawall cribbing. In 1934, New York
police investigated a fatality that resulted from a construc8 The record contains over 2,000 documents (some of which are hundreds

tion accident on the Island. In 1942, the New York CityPolice Department formed a special squad to assist federal

officials in questioning immigrants arriving at the Island.Thus, despite the fact that federal officials were in control of
the Island, these incidents are consistent with the view thatNew York retained an interest in the Island, but New Jersey
did not.10 VII

When courts considered the question, they consistently as-sumed or decided that Ellis Island was a part of New York.
Thus, in 1915 one New York state court assumed that it hadjurisdiction over an action for assault allegedly committed
on the Island.11 In 1931, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit, which includes New Jersey, held that

alien detained on the Island.12 The federal judges sitting in

over such counties and their waters, the United States by statute (28

the Southern District of New York exercised jurisdictionover cases arising out of the detention or deportation of

aliens on Ellis Island. During the relevant period there isno evidence that any judge, state or federal, considered the

Courts of the two named New York districts. But the relator, showing
that by the Act of June 28, 1834 (4 Stat. 708) a boundary line between the
states of New York and New Jersey had been run down the Hudson River
to the sea, `submitted' that Ellis Island is on the westerly or New Jersey
side of the harbor and therefore is in--or `not entirely' outside--the District of New Jersey and within at least `the concurrent jurisdiction of the
District Court for the District of New Jersey and the District Courts for
the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York.' Jurisdiction is determined by statute, not by geography. The statute expressly, and therefore
exclusively, placed federal jurisdiction of Ellis Island in the District Courts
of the two named New York districts. The running of a boundary line in
1834 through the waters dividing the states of New York and New Jersey
cannot disturb the statutory designation of jurisdiction in 1910.

of New Jersey had no power to issue the writ of habeas corpus prayed for

reached the same conclusion as the Third:

"Ellis Island remains a part of New York by acknowledgment of the
government and without objection (except in this case) by New Jersey.

VIIIThe Court discounts the probative force of most of New

York's evidence by repeatedly reminding us that New Yorkhas the burden of proving prescription, and in many instances has failed to prove that New Jersey had actual noticeof what happened on the Island, or, more narrowly, that the
relevant events occurred on the filled portion rather than theoriginal three acres. The discount would be appropriate if
we were reviewing the history of a remote atoll in the farPacific. In fact, Ellis Island was an enclave entirely within
the geographic boundaries of New Jersey; a ferry connectedit with Jersey City, which is less than a quarter of a mile
away. Particularly during the first few decades of the pre-scriptive period, it teemed with activity that was open and
notorious. Moreover, given the fact that 90% of the Islandwas filled land, it is surely reasonable to infer that whenever
the specific location of a prescriptive event was in doubt, itis more likely than not that it occurred in what is now
claimed to have been New Jersey.Not only should we presume notice to New Jersey of what
was occurring within the outer boundaries of the State; wemust also presume that New Jersey was aware of the official
acts of both New York and the United States that were pred-icated on the understanding that all of Ellis Island was in
New York. Judicial districts, legislative districts, postaldistricts, and census districts all included the entire Island
within New York. IX

14 There was also evidence that Hudson County, New Jersey, had placed

Ellis Island on its tax roles. The county, however, did not ever attempt
to collect taxes; because the Island was owned by the Federal Government, Ellis Island was marked as "exempt."

prescription of the entire Island relates to RepresentativeNorton's efforts in 1934 and 1935 to persuade federal officials

to use New Jersey labor in construction work on Ellis andBedloe's Islands. In her letter of August 25, 1934, she advised the Division of Procurement of the Treasury Depart-ment that a local union in her home city contended

15 that

"these islands are part and parcel of the State of New Jer-sey."

16 On March 19, 1935, she again advanced the position

that Ellis Island was in New Jersey. When the TreasuryDepartment ultimately rejected her submission, the matter

appears to have been dropped.Representative Norton's correspondence fails to establish
nonacquiescence for several reasons. First, it demonstratesthat people in New Jersey were actually aware of what was
happening on Ellis Island. Second, when the Treasury De-partment ultimately rejected Representative Norton's sub15 In a letter of July 31, 1934, the union wrote to Representative Norton:
"At the present time on Ellis Island there are under the course of erection several buildings and from maps obtained by us of the Department of
Conservation and Development of the State of New Jersey, the latest edition of which was printed and revised in 1932 [sic] show specifically that
this Island is entirely within the boundary lines of the State of New Jersey.

the right to cover this operation." N. J. Exh. 18 (letter of Thomas F.
Moore, Secretary, Bricklayers, Masons & Plasterers International Union,

Similarly, on August 18, 1934, the union wrote to Representative
Norton:

Islands lying in New York Bay, known as Ellis and Bedloes Islands, from
the Executive Board of our International Union. It is our contention that

mission, she acquiesced in that rejection and the entire Statejoined in that acquiescence for another 20 years. Finally,

the fact that her correspondence espoused the manifestlyuntenable position that the entire Island belonged to New
Jersey makes it rather clear that she was not advancing aserious claim on behalf of the State.

17

17 The Court points to a few incidents when federal officials equivocated
over whether Ellis Island belonged to New York or New Jersey. Ante,
at 801-805. These incidents do not, of course, speak to New Jersey's nonacquiescence; nonetheless, they are relevant to New York's claims of
prescription. None of these incidents, however, is significant.

First, maps from the Harbor Line Board from 1890 to 1911 labeled Ellis
Island as being part of New Jersey. Yet since only the original Island
existed in 1890, the first mapmaker obviously made a mistake; given the
fact that the state designation had no practical consequence, it is reasonable to conclude that the mistake was simply carried forward in subsequent maps. Second, the Federal Government purchased the underwater
land surrounding the Island from New Jersey in 1904; but because the
1834 Compact gave New Jersey property rights to such land, it is fair to
assume that the Federal Government merely saw itself as purchasing this
property from its rightful owner. Third, Edward Corsi, the Commissioner of Immigration on Ellis Island, applied to New Jersey's Board of
Commerce and Navigation for permission to construct a new seawall in
1933. One of the blanks on the permit application asked "[w]here work is
contemplated"; Corsi entered "New York." N. J. Exh. 10. So while it is
unclear why Corsi applied to New Jersey for the permit, it is clear from
the face of the document that Corsi believed the work was being performed in New York. Fourth, after Representative Norton argued that
some of the jobs on Ellis Island should be given to New Jersey residents,
federal officials initially proposed a compromise solution, dividing the jobs
between New Jersey and New York; as noted, however, the officials eventually concluded that all of Ellis Island belonged to New York. Finally,
from 1947 to 1949, the Department of Labor used New Jersey wage rates
to determine wages for construction projects on the Island; in 1949, however, the Secretary reversed his decision--because "additional data and
more current information ha[d] been assembled." N. J. Exh. 90.

These five incidents do not undermine New York's claim of prescription.
Moreover, these isolated incidents are dwarfed by the Federal Government's repeated statements and actions that treated all of Ellis Island as
a part of New York. The Immigration Service, the federal agency most
intimately involved with the Island, clearly believed that all of Ellis Island

Justice Breyer's concurrence merits a separate com-ment. He places great reliance on Charles Wyzanski's statement that Ellis Island was not a part of either New Jerseyor New York during the prescriptive period, but rather was
a territory of the United States not falling within the ju-risdiction of any of the then 48 States. See

ante, at 813.Wyzanski, who was then the Solicitor of Labor, made this

statement during the Federal Government's consideration ofRepresentative Norton's request. As already noted, after
full consideration, the Government rejected her request.It is true that Wyzanski was an exceptionally able lawyer,
but it is perfectly clear that in this instance he was simplywrong. Like numerous other federal enclaves within the
United States, Ellis Island was unquestionably subject to thejurisdiction of the State or States in which it was located.
Nevertheless, even though Wyzanski was clearly wrong, Iwould agree with

Justice Breyer that Wyzanski's opinionwould be relevant if it stated a view that was expressed by

others during the prescriptive period. In fact, there is nota shred of evidence that anyone else shared that view, either
before or after Wyzanski made the statement. The prevail-ing view during the relevant period was that shared by the
legislators who drew the boundaries of the congressional dis-tricts, the census takers who treated Ellis Island residents
as citizens of New York, and the New York officials who su-pervised their voting in New York and recorded the births,
marriages, and deaths that occurred on the Island. Indeed,
was part of New York, as is evidenced by dozens and dozens of documents
in the record. Similarly, the Department of Public Health, the Navy Department, the Department of Treasury, and the Justice Department all
repeatedly treated Ellis Island as a part of New York. (Although my
analysis does not turn on this point, it is worth noting that many of these
documents specifically refer to the filled portions of the Island.) In addition, as far as I am aware, every Act of Congress that mentioned the
location of Ellis Island gave its location as New York.

one may infer from Justice Breyer's opinion that his
grandparents shared that view as well.

XI
In my opinion the conclusion that New York acquired jurisdiction over the entire Island by prescription is supported
not merely by a preponderance, but by clear, convincing, and
uncontradicted evidence.18 With all respect, I am persuaded
that the Court's contrary conclusion rests on a hypertechnical focus on detail that overlooks the significance of the record as a whole. What I believe was apparent to virtually
everyone in New York and New Jersey, as well as to the
millions of immigrants who entered our melting pot through
the Ellis Island Gateway during the early part of this century, is somehow obscured in a voluminous trial record. The
implausibility of the Court's conclusion is underscored by the
strange boundary line that it has decreed.

Instead of the entire Island constituting an enclave within
the borders of New Jersey, now New York's share of the
Island is an enclave within New Jersey's share of the Island.
The new state line intersects three buildings--the Main
Building, the Baggage and Dormitory Building, and the
Boathouse Building. Thin strips of New Jersey's sovereign
territory separate New York from the ferry slip where boats
operated by the City of New York have been delivering millions of visitors annually. By ending New York's sovereignty over a large portion of the ferry slip in front of the
Main Building, well short of the slip's seawall, the decree
denies New York access to, and control over, the area of land
most intimately and functionally connected to the operation

18 Because I think it clear that New York has acquired the power to
govern the entire Island by prescription, it is not necessary for me to
comment on the eminently sensible approach set forth by Justice
Scalia, post, p. 829.

of the Main Building. The Master correctly stated that thisresult is "neither just nor fair to New York."

19

In my opinion it is not only the bizarre boundary that isunfair to New York. It is the failure to draw the commonsense inference that neither State could have contemplatedsuch a bizarre division of the Island during the prescriptive
period that lasted for over 60 years. During that entire period both States most certainly treated Ellis Island as part ofa single State. Unquestionably, that State was New York.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

I agree with Justice Stevens that the available evidencesupports the conclusion that "all interested parties shared

the belief that the filled portions, as well as the original three
acres, of Ellis Island were a part of the State of New Yorkfor over 60 years,"

ante, at 814 (dissenting opinion). And I
agree that New Jersey's claim to the filled portions shouldbe rejected for that reason.

I would not, however, rely upon prescription. Since that
doctrine permits a claimant to oust the original, undoubted
owner, it justifiably demands a very high burden of proof.
Specifically, and in the context of the present case, it requires, as the Court points out, not merely acts of possession
and jurisdiction on the part of New York, but also, on the
part of New Jersey, "acquiescence in those acts of possession
and jurisdiction," which in turn requires "knowledge that
New York acted upon a claim to the added land, or evidence
of such open, notorious, visible, and uninterrupted adverse
acts that New Jersey's knowledge and acquiescence may be
presumed." Ante, at 787.

I see no reason to climb that mountain in the present case.
New Jersey is not the original, undoubted owner whose title

could have been eliminated only by prescription. The statusof Ellis Island is governed by a contract between New York

and New Jersey--the Compact of 1834--that is, on this point,poorly drafted and ambiguous.* It is hornbook contracts

*Justice Breyer asserts that there is no "sufficient, relevant ambiguity" because New York has "basically rested its case upon Article First
and Article Second" of the Compact, which "are silent about what would
happen to an Ellis Island `avulsion,' " leading Justice Breyer to the conclusion that the normal rules of avulsion apply. Ante, at 812, 813 (concurring opinion). It is true that the State of New York did not claim title
through Article Third, but it relied heavily upon Article Third in giving
meaning to Articles First and Second--as we must do as well, since the
Compact was meant to form an integrated whole. Justice Breyer contends that Articles First and Second "specify that Ellis Island is in New
Jersey waters, for the [Article First] border between the States lies far to
the east." Ante, at 813. But Article First establishes a boundary down
the middle of the Hudson only "except as hereinafter otherwise particularly mentioned." The exceptions include (in Article Second) New York's
jurisdiction over Ellis Island, and its "exclusive jurisdiction of and over
the other islands lying in the waters above mentioned and now under the
jurisdiction of that state." New York's claim that the normal rules of
avulsion were not meant to apply to this exception rests largely upon its
contention that one of the major purposes of the Compact was to "guarante[e] New York's control over commerce and navigation in New York Harbor," which was achieved (1) by Article Second's giving New York "exclusive jurisdiction" over all the islands in the bay, and (2) by Article Third's
giving New York "exclusive jurisdiction" (the same language) over all the
waters and submerged lands of the bay. Exceptions of State of New York
to Report of Special Master 16. This major purpose, according to New
York, would be defeated if landfill additions to the islands on the New
Jersey side of the bay became little enclaves of New Jersey. It is therefore not true that New York did not rest its argument upon Article
Third--and not true (when one reads the Compact as a whole) that Article
Second unambiguously leaves the question of landfill on Ellis Island to the
background law of avulsion.

I may add that even if Article Third were totally unconnected to Articles First and Second, I do not think in a matter of this consequence we
should hear only the arguments of the State of New York, and disregard
those of New York City, which has a vital interest in this matter and
participated actively as an amicus, in submitting evidence, examining wit523US3 Unit: $U68 [05-03-00 11:22:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

law that the practical construction of an ambiguous agree-ment revealed by later conduct of the parties is good indication of its meaning. See, e. g., 17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts$ 357 (1991); Restatement (Second) of Contracts $$ 202(4), 203

Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S. 423, 431-432(1943)). We have also applied similar reasoning to the precise area of interstate boundary disputes. See Vermont v.
New Hampshire, 289 U. S. 593, 619 (1933) ("[T]he practicalconstruction of the boundary by the acts of the two states

and of their inhabitants tends to support our interpretationof the Order-in-Council of 1764"). I would do so again here.

For a lengthy period of time all the parties to the Com-pact--New York, New Jersey, and the United States--behaved as though all of Ellis Island belonged to New York.New York provided to the residents of the Island, including the filled portions, privileges and services a sovereignnormally provides--the right to vote, civil marriages, birth
and death certificates, police and fire protection. As far asappears, New Jersey provided none of them; and whether
or not New Jersey knew that New York was behaving likea sovereign, it assuredly knew that it was not. And the
United States, for its part, treated the Island as part of NewYork for its governmental purposes, including the constitutionally required decennial census, the assignment of postal
nesses, and presenting argument. The city did rely upon Article Third
as an independent basis for New York's jurisdiction. It seems to me that
Justice Breyer and the Court bend over backward to pronounce clarity
in this document where there is none.

COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO et al. v. LEWIS, et al.,

personal representatives of the ESTATE

OF LEWIS, DECEASED

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1337. Argued December 9, 1997--Decided May 26, 1998
After petitioner James Smith, a county sheriff's deputy, responded to a

call along with another officer, Murray Stapp, the latter returned to his
patrol car and saw a motorcycle approaching at high speed, driven by
Brian Willard, and carrying Philip Lewis, respondents' decedent, as a
passenger. Stapp turned on his rotating lights, yelled for the cycle to
stop, and pulled his car closer to Smith's in an attempt to pen the cycle
in, but Willard maneuvered between the two cars and sped off. Smith
immediately switched on his own emergency lights and siren and began
high-speed pursuit. The chase ended after the cycle tipped over.
Smith slammed on his brakes, but his car skidded into Lewis, causing
massive injuries and death. Respondents brought this action under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging a deprivation of Lewis's Fourteenth Amendment
substantive due process right to life. The District Court granted summary judgment for Smith, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding, inter
alia, that the appropriate degree of fault for substantive due process
liability for high-speed police pursuits is deliberate indifference to, or
reckless disregard for, a person's right to life and personal security.

Held: A police officer does not violate substantive due process by causing death through deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a highspeed automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender.
Pp. 840-855.

(a) The "more-specific-provision" rule of Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S.
386, 395, does not bar respondents' suit. Graham simply requires that
if a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision,
the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, not under substantive due process. E. g., United States
v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 272, n. 7. Substantive due process analysis is
therefore inappropriate here only if, as amici argue, respondents' claim
is "covered by" the Fourth Amendment. It is not. That Amendment
covers only "searches and seizures," neither of which took place here.
No one suggests that there was a search, and this Court's cases foreclose finding a seizure, since Smith did not terminate Lewis's freedom

Syllabus
of movement through means intentionally applied. E. g., Brower v.
County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 597. Pp. 842-845.

(b) Respondents' allegations are insufficient to state a substantive
due process violation. Protection against governmental arbitrariness
is the core of due process, e. g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516,
527, including substantive due process, see, e. g., Daniels v. Williams,
474 U. S. 327, 331, but only the most egregious executive action can be
said to be "arbitrary" in the constitutional sense, e. g., Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 129; the cognizable level of executive abuse of
power is that which shocks the conscience, e. g., id., at 128; Rochin v.
California, 342 U. S. 165, 172-173. The conscience-shocking concept
points clearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends
of the tort law's culpability spectrum: Liability for negligently inflicted
harm is categorically beneath the constitutional due process threshold,
see, e. g., Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S., at 328, while conduct deliberately intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government
interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscienceshocking level, see id., at 331. Whether that level is reached when culpability falls between negligence and intentional conduct is a matter for
closer calls. The Court has recognized that deliberate indifference is
egregious enough to state a substantive due process claim in one context, that of deliberate indifference to the medical needs of pretrial detainees, see City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S.
239, 244; cf. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104, but rules of due process
are not subject to mechanical application in unfamiliar territory, and the
need to preserve the constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an exact analysis of context and circumstances before deliberate indifference is condemned as conscience shocking, cf. Betts v.
Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 462. Attention to the markedly different circumstances of normal pretrial custody and high-speed law enforcement
chases shows why the deliberate indifference that shocks in the one
context is less egregious in the other. In the circumstances of a highspeed chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender, where unforeseen circumstances demand an instant judgment on the part of an officer
who feels the pulls of competing obligations, only a purpose to cause
harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest will satisfy the shocksthe-conscience test. Such chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to substantive due
process liability. Cf. Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 320-321. The
fault claimed on Smith's part fails to meet this test. Smith was faced
with a course of lawless behavior for which the police were not to blame.
They had done nothing to cause Willard's high-speed driving in the first
place, nothing to excuse his flouting of the commonly understood police

authority to control traffic, and nothing (beyond a refusal to call off
the chase) to encourage him to race through traffic at breakneck speed.
Willard's outrageous behavior was practically instantaneous, and so was
Smith's instinctive response. While prudence would have repressed
the reaction, Smith's instinct was to do his job, not to induce Willard's
lawlessness, or to terrorize, cause harm, or kill. Prudence, that is, was
subject to countervailing enforcement considerations, and while Smith
exaggerated their demands, there is no reason to believe that they were
tainted by an improper or malicious motive. Pp. 845-855.

836 COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO v. LEWIS

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether a police officer violatesthe Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of substantive due

process by causing death through deliberate or reckless in-difference to life in a high-speed automobile chase aimed at
apprehending a suspected offender. We answer no, and holdthat in such circumstances only a purpose to cause harm
unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest will satisfy theelement of arbitrary conduct shocking to the conscience,
necessary for a due process violation.

On May 22, 1990, at approximately 8:30 p.m., petitionerJames Everett Smith, a Sacramento County sheriff 's deputy,

along with another officer, Murray Stapp, responded to a call
to break up a fight. Upon returning to his patrol car, Stappsaw a motorcycle approaching at high speed. It was operated by 18-year-old Brian Willard and carried Philip Lewis,respondents' 16-year-old decedent, as a passenger. Neither
boy had anything to do with the fight that prompted the call
to the police.Stapp turned on his overhead rotating lights, yelled to the

boys to stop, and pulled his patrol car closer to Smith's, at-tempting to pen the motorcycle in. Instead of pulling over

slowly maneuvered the motorcycle between the two policecars and sped off. Smith immediately switched on his own

emergency lights and siren, made a quick turn, and beganpursuit at high speed. For 75 seconds over a course of 1.3
miles in a residential neighborhood, the motorcycle wove inand out of oncoming traffic, forcing two cars and a bicycle to
swerve off the road. The motorcycle and patrol car reachedspeeds up to 100 miles an hour, with Smith following at a
distance as short as 100 feet; at that speed, his car wouldhave required 650 feet to stop.

The chase ended after the motorcycle tipped over as Wil-lard tried a sharp left turn. By the time Smith slammed on
his brakes, Willard was out of the way, but Lewis was not.The patrol car skidded into him at 40 miles an hour, propelling him some 70 feet down the road and inflicting massiveinjuries. Lewis was pronounced dead at the scene.

Respondents, Philip Lewis's parents and the representa-tives of his estate, brought this action under Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, against petitioners SacramentoCounty, the Sacramento County Sheriff 's Department, and
Deputy Smith, alleging a deprivation of Philip Lewis's Four-teenth Amendment substantive due process right to life.

entitled to qualified immunity, because respondents couldpoint to no "state or federal opinion published before May,

found that Smith was immune from state tort liability by operation of
California Vehicle Code $ 17004, which provides that "[a] public employee
is not liable for civil damages on account of personal injury to or death of
any person or damage to property resulting from the operation, in the line
of duty, of an authorized emergency vehicle . . . when in the immediate
pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law." Cal. Veh. Code

liability of the county under state law, instead dismissing the tort claims
against the county without prejudice to refiling in state court.

reckless disregard for, a person's right to life and personal
security," 98 F. 3d 434, 441 (1996), and concluding that "thelaw regarding police liability for death or injury caused by

an officer during the course of a high-speed chase was clearlyestablished" at the time of Philip Lewis's death,

id., at
445. Since Smith apparently disregarded the Sacramento
County Sheriff 's Department's General Order on police pursuits, the Ninth Circuit found a genuine issue of material
fact that might be resolved by a finding that Smith's conduct
amounted to deliberate indifference:

"The General Order requires an officer to communicate his intention to pursue a vehicle to the sheriff 's department dispatch center. But defendants concede that
Smith did not contact the dispatch center. The General
Order requires an officer to consider whether the seriousness of the offense warrants a chase at speeds in excess of the posted limit. But here, the only apparent
`offense' was the boys' refusal to stop when another officer told them to do so. The General Order requires
an officer to consider whether the need for apprehen2 The District Court also granted summary judgment in favor of the
county and the Sheriff's Department on the $ 1983 claim, concluding that
municipal liability would not lie under Monell v. New York City Dept. of
Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978), after finding no genuine factual dispute
as to whether the county adequately trains its officers in the conduct of
vehicular pursuits or whether the pursuit policy of the Sheriff's Department evinces deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of the
public. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court on these points,
98 F. 3d 434, 446-447 (1996), and the issue of municipal liability is not
before us.

Opinion of the Court
sion justifies the pursuit under existing conditions. YetSmith apparently only `needed' to apprehend the boys

because they refused to stop. The General Order re-quires an officer to consider whether the pursuit presents unreasonable hazards to life and property. Buttaking the facts here in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, there existed an unreasonable hazard to Lewis'sand Willard's lives. The General Order also directs an
officer to discontinue a pursuit when the hazards of con-tinuing outweigh the benefits of immediate apprehension. But here, there was no apparent danger involvedin permitting the boys to escape. There certainly was
risk of harm to others in continuing the pursuit." Id.,at 442.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the summaryjudgment in favor of Smith and remanded for trial.

We granted certiorari, 520 U. S. 1250 (1997), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits over the standard of culpability
on the part of a law enforcement officer for violating substan-tive due process in a pursuit case. Compare 98 F. 3d, at
441 ("deliberate indifference" or "reckless disregard"),3 with
Evans v. Avery, 100 F. 3d 1033, 1038 (CA1 1996) ("shocks theconscience"), cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1210 (1997);

caused by police pursuit. Subsequently, in Foy v. Berea, 58 F. 3d 227, 230
(1995), the Sixth Circuit, without specifically mentioning Jones, disavowed
the notion that "gross negligence is sufficient to support a substantive due
process claim." Although Foy involved police inaction, rather than police
pursuit, it seems likely that the Sixth Circuit would now apply the "deliberate indifference" standard utilized in that case, see 58 F. 3d, at 232-233,
rather than the "gross negligence" standard adopted in Jones, in a police
pursuit situation.

Our prior cases have held the provision that "[n]o State
shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law," U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1, to "guarante[e] more than fair process," Washington v. Glucksberg,
521 U. S. 702, 719 (1997), and to cover a substantive sphere
as well, "barring certain government actions regardless of
the fairness of the procedures used to implement them,"
Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986); see also Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U. S. 113, 125 (1990) (noting that substantive due process violations are actionable under $ 1983).
The allegation here that Lewis was deprived of his right
to life in violation of substantive due process amounts to
such a claim, that under the circumstances described earlier, Smith's actions in causing Lewis's death were an abuse
of executive power so clearly unjustified by any legitimate
objective of law enforcement as to be barred by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503
U. S. 115, 126 (1992) (noting that the Due Process Clause
was intended to prevent government officials " ` "from abusing [their] power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression" ' ") (quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept.
of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189, 196 (1989), in turn quoting
Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U. S. 344, 348 (1986)).4

4 Respondents do not argue that they were denied due process of law by
virtue of the fact that California's postdeprivation procedures and rules of
immunity have effectively denied them an adequate opportunity to seek
compensation for the state-occasioned deprivation of their son's life. We
express no opinion here on the merits of such a claim, cf. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 281-286 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment);
Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527 (1981), or on the adequacy of California's
postdeprivation compensation scheme.

Opinion of the Court
Leaving aside the question of qualified immunity, which
formed the basis for the District Court's dismissal of their
case,5 respondents face two principal objections to their

5 As in any action under $ 1983, the first step is to identify the exact
contours of the underlying right said to have been violated. See Graham
v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 394 (1989). The District Court granted summary
judgment to Smith on the basis of qualified immunity, assuming without
deciding that a substantive due process violation took place but holding
that the law was not clearly established in 1990 so as to justify imposition
of $ 1983 liability. We do not analyze this case in a similar fashion because, as we have held, the better approach to resolving cases in which
the defense of qualified immunity is raised is to determine first whether
the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all. Normally, it is only then that a court should ask whether the right allegedly
implicated was clearly established at the time of the events in question.
See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232 (1991) ("A necessary concomitant
to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a
plaintiff is `clearly established' at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all," and courts should not "assum[e], without deciding, this
preliminary issue").

Justice Stevens suggests that the rule of Siegert should not apply
where, as here, the constitutional question presented "is both difficult and
unresolved." Post, at 859. But the generally sound rule of avoiding determination of constitutional issues does not readily fit the situation presented here; when liability is claimed on the basis of a constitutional violation, even a finding of qualified immunity requires some determination
about the state of constitutional law at the time the officer acted. What
is more significant is that if the policy of avoidance were always followed
in favor of ruling on qualified immunity whenever there was no clearly
settled constitutional rule of primary conduct, standards of official conduct
would tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment both of officials and
individuals. An immunity determination, with nothing more, provides no
clear standard, constitutional or nonconstitutional. In practical terms, escape from uncertainty would require the issue to arise in a suit to enjoin
future conduct, in an action against a municipality, or in litigating a suppression motion in a criminal proceeding; in none of these instances would
qualified immunity be available to block a determination of law. See Shapiro, Public Officials' Qualified Immunity in Section 1983 Actions Under
Harlow v. Fitzgerald and its Progeny, 22 U. Mich. J. L. Ref. 249, 265, n. 109
(1989). But these avenues would not necessarily be open, and therefore

claim. The first is that its subject is necessarily governedby a more definite provision of the Constitution (to the exclusion of any possible application of substantive due process);the second, that in any event the allegations are insufficient
to state a substantive due process violation through execu-tive abuse of power. Respondents can meet the first objection, but not the second. A

Because we have "always been reluctant to expand theconcept of substantive due process,"

Collins v. HarkerHeights, supra, at 125, we held in Graham v. Connor, 490

U. S. 386 (1989), that "[w]here a particular Amendmentprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, thatAmendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive
due process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims."
Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 273 (1994) (plurality opin-ion of

Rehnquist, C. J.) (quoting Graham v. Connor, supra,at 395) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the rule

in Graham, we were presented at oral argument with thethreshold issue raised in several

amicus briefs,6 whetherfacts involving a police chase aimed at apprehending suspects can ever support a due process claim. The argumentruns that in chasing the motorcycle, Smith was attempting to make a seizure within the meaning of the FourthAmendment, and, perhaps, even that he succeeded when
Lewis was stopped by the fatal collision. Hence, any liabil-ity must turn on an application of the reasonableness standthe better approach is to determine the right before determining whether
it was previously established with clarity.

ard governing searches and seizures, not the due processstandard of liability for constitutionally arbitrary executive

action. See Graham v. Connor, supra, at 395 ("[A]ll claimsthat law enforcement officers have used excessive force--
deadly or not--in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop,
or other `seizure' of a free citizen should be analyzed under theFourth Amendment and its `reasonableness' standard, rather

than under a `substantive due process' approach" (emphasis inoriginal));

Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S., at 276 (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring); id., at 288, n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring in judg-ment). One Court of Appeals has indeed applied the rule of

Graham to preclude the application of principles of general-ized substantive due process to a motor vehicle passenger's
claims for injury resulting from reckless police pursuit. See
Mays v. East St. Louis, 123 F. 3d 999, 1002-1003 (CA7 1997).The argument is unsound. Just last Term, we explained

that Graham

"does not hold that all constitutional claims relating to
physically abusive government conduct must arise
under either the Fourth or Eighth Amendments; rather,
Graham simply requires that if a constitutional claim is
covered by a specific constitutional provision, such as
the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must be
analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific
provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process." United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 272, n. 7
(1997).

Substantive due process analysis is therefore inappropriate
in this case only if respondents' claim is "covered by" the
Fourth Amendment. It is not.

The Fourth Amendment covers only "searches and seizures," neither of which took place here. No one suggests
that there was a search, and our cases foreclose finding a
seizure. We held in California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621,

Opinion of the Court
626 (1991), that a police pursuit in attempting to seize a
person does not amount to a "seizure" within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. And in Brower v. County of Inyo,
489 U. S. 593, 596-597 (1989), we explained that "a Fourth
Amendment seizure does not occur whenever there is a
governmentally caused termination of an individual's freedom of movement (the innocent passerby), nor even whenever there is a governmentally caused and governmentally
desired termination of an individual's freedom of movement

termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied." We illustrated the point by saying
that no Fourth Amendment seizure would take place where
a "pursuing police car sought to stop the suspect only by the
show of authority represented by flashing lights and continuing pursuit," but accidentally stopped the suspect by
crashing into him. Id., at 597. That is exactly this case.
See, e. g., Campbell v. White, 916 F. 2d 421, 423 (CA7 1990)
(following Brower and finding no seizure where a police officer accidentally struck and killed a fleeing motorcyclist during a high-speed pursuit), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 922 (1991).
Graham's more-specific-provision rule is therefore no bar
to respondents' suit. See, e. g., Frye v. Akron, 759 F. Supp.
1320, 1324 (ND Ind. 1991) (parents of a motorcyclist who was
struck and killed by a police car during a high-speed pursuit
could sue under substantive due process because no Fourth
Amendment seizure took place); Evans v. Avery, 100 F. 3d,

person injured as a result of police misconduct may prosecute a substantive due process claim under section 1983");

Since the time of our early explanations of due process, wehave understood the core of the concept to be protection

against arbitrary action:

"The principal and true meaning of the phrase has neverbeen more tersely or accurately stated than by Mr. Justice Johnson, in Bank of Columbia v. Okely, 4 Wheat.235-244 [(1819)]: `As to the words from Magna Charta,
incorporated into the Constitution of Maryland, aftervolumes spoken and written with a view to their exposition, the good sense of mankind has at last settled downto this: that they were intended to secure the individual
from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of govern-ment, unrestrained by the established principles of
private right and distributive justice.' " Hurtado v.
California, 110 U. S. 516, 527 (1884).

We have emphasized time and again that "[t]he touchstoneof due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government," Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S.539, 558 (1974), whether the fault lies in a denial of funda7 Several amici suggest that, for the purposes of Graham, the Fourth
Amendment should cover not only seizures, but also failed attempts to
make a seizure. See, e. g., Brief for National Association of Counties
et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11. This argument is foreclosed by California
v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621 (1991), in which we explained that "neither
usage nor common-law tradition makes an attempted seizure a seizure.
The common law may have made an attempted seizure unlawful in certain
circumstances; but it made many things unlawful, very few of which were
elevated to constitutional proscriptions." Id., at 626, n. 2. Attempted
seizures of a person are beyond the scope of the Fourth Amendment. See
id., at 646 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (disagreeing with the Court's position
that "an attempt to make [a] . . . seizure is beyond the coverage of the
Fourth Amendment").

mental procedural fairness, see, e. g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407U. S. 67, 82 (1972) (the procedural due process guarantee protects against "arbitrary takings"), or in the exercise of powerwithout any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective, see, e. g., Daniels v. Williams,
474 U. S., at 331 (the substantive due process guarantee pro-tects against government power arbitrarily and oppressively

exercised). While due process protection in the substantivesense limits what the government may do in both its legislative, see, e. g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965),and its executive capacities, see,

e. g., Rochin v. California,
342 U. S. 165 (1952), criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue.

Our cases dealing with abusive executive action have repeatedly emphasized that only the most egregious official
conduct can be said to be "arbitrary in the constitutional
sense," Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S., at 129, thereby
recognizing the point made in different circumstances by
Chief Justice Marshall, " `that it is a constitution we are expounding,' " Daniels v. Williams, supra, at 332 (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819) (emphasis in
original)). Thus, in Collins v. Harker Heights, for example,
we said that the Due Process Clause was intended to prevent
government officials " ` "from abusing [their] power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression." ' " 503 U. S., at
126 (quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social
Servs., 489 U. S., at 196, in turn quoting Davidson v. Cannon,

474 U. S., at 348).

To this end, for half a century now we have spoken of the
cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that which
shocks the conscience. We first put the test this way in
Rochin v. California, supra, at 172-173, where we found the
forced pumping of a suspect's stomach enough to offend due
process as conduct "that shocks the conscience" and violates
the "decencies of civilized conduct." In the intervening

years we have repeatedly adhered to Rochin's benchmark.See, e. g., Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U. S. 432, 435 (1957) (reiterating that conduct that " `shocked the conscience' and wasso `brutal' and `offensive' that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency" would violate substan-tive due process);

Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 327 (1986)(same); United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987)

("So-called `substantive due process' prevents the govern-ment from engaging in conduct that `shocks the conscience,'
. . . or interferes with rights `implicit in the concept of or-dered liberty' ") (quoting Rochin v. California, supra, at 172,
and Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325-326 (1937)).Most recently, in

Collins v. Harker Heights, supra, at 128,we said again that the substantive component of the Due

Process Clause is violated by executive action only when it"can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience
shocking, in a constitutional sense." While the measure ofwhat is conscience shocking is no calibrated yard stick, it
does, as Judge Friendly put it, "poin[t] the way." Johnsonv.

8 As Justice Scalia has explained before, he fails to see "the usefulness
of `conscience shocking' as a legal test," Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,
428 (1993), and his independent analysis of this case is therefore understandable. He is, however, simply mistaken in seeing our insistence on
the shocks-the-conscience standard as an atavistic return to a scheme of
due process analysis rejected by the Court in Washington v. Glucksberg,
521 U. S. 702 (1997).

Glucksberg presented a disagreement about the significance of historical
examples of protected liberty in determining whether a given statute
could be judged to contravene the Fourteenth Amendment. The differences of opinion turned on the issues of how much history indicating recognition of the asserted right, viewed at what level of specificity, is necessary
to support the finding of a substantive due process right entitled to prevail
over state legislation.

As we explain in the text, a case challenging executive action on substantive due process grounds, like this one, presents an issue antecedent
to any question about the need for historical examples of enforcing a lib523US3 Unit: $U69 [04-28-00 22:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
848 COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO v. LEWIS

Opinion of the Court
It should not be surprising that the constitutional concept
of conscience shocking duplicates no traditional category of
common-law fault, but rather points clearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort law's
spectrum of culpability. Thus, we have made it clear that
the due process guarantee does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with
state authority causes harm. In Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S.
693, 701 (1976), for example, we explained that the Fourteenth Amendment is not a "font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered
by the States," and in Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S., at 332,
we reaffirmed the point that "[o]ur Constitution deals with
the large concerns of the governors and the governed, but it
does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying
down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that
attend living together in society." We have accordingly rejected the lowest common denominator of customary tort liaerty interest of the sort claimed. For executive action challenges raise a
particular need to preserve the constitutional proportions of constitutional
claims, lest the Constitution be demoted to what we have called a font of
tort law. Thus, in a due process challenge to executive action, the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so
egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience. That judgment may be informed by a history of liberty
protection, but it necessarily reflects an understanding of traditional executive behavior, of contemporary practice, and of the standards of blame
generally applied to them. Only if the necessary condition of egregious
behavior were satisfied would there be a possibility of recognizing a substantive due process right to be free of such executive action, and only
then might there be a debate about the sufficiency of historical examples
of enforcement of the right claimed, or its recognition in other ways. In
none of our prior cases have we considered the necessity for such examples, and no such question is raised in this case.

In sum, the difference of opinion in Glucksberg was about the need for
historical examples of recognition of the claimed liberty protection at some
appropriate level of specificity. In an executive action case, no such issue
can arise if the conduct does not reach the degree of the egregious.

Opinion of the Court
bility as any mark of sufficiently shocking conduct, and haveheld that the Constitution does not guarantee due care on

the part of state officials; liability for negligently inflictedharm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional
due process. See id., at 328; see also Davidson v. Cannon,
474 U. S., at 348 (clarifying that Daniels applies to substan-tive, as well as procedural, due process). It is, on the contrary, behavior at the other end of the culpability spectrumthat would most probably support a substantive due process
claim; conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiableby any government interest is the sort of official action most
likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level. See Danielsv.

Williams, 474 U. S., at 331 ("Historically, this guarantee
of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of
government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, orproperty" (emphasis in original)).

Whether the point of the conscience shocking is reached
when injuries are produced with culpability falling within
the middle range, following from something more than negligence but "less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or `gross negligence,' " id., at 334, n. 3, is a matter for
closer calls.9 To be sure, we have expressly recognized the
possibility that some official acts in this range may be actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment, ibid., and our cases
have compelled recognition that such conduct is egregious
enough to state a substantive due process claim in at least
one instance. We held in City of Revere v. Massachusetts
Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239 (1983), that "the due process
rights of a [pretrial detainee] are at least as great as the

9 In Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952), the case in which we
formulated and first applied the shocks-the-conscience test, it was not the
ultimate purpose of the government actors to harm the plaintiff, but they
apparently acted with full appreciation of what the Court described as the
brutality of their acts. Rochin, of course, was decided long before Graham v. Connor (and Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)), and today would
be treated under the Fourth Amendment, albeit with the same result.

Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner." Id., at 244 (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 535,
n. 16, 545 (1979)). Since it may suffice for Eighth Amendment liability that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of their prisoners, see Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104 (1976), it follows that such deliberately indifferent conduct must also be enough to satisfy the
fault requirement for due process claims based on the medical needs of someone jailed while awaiting trial, see, e. g.,
Barrie v. Grand County, Utah, 119 F. 3d 862, 867 (CA10
1997); Weyant v. Okst, 101 F. 3d 845, 856 (CA2 1996).10

Rules of due process are not, however, subject to mechanical application in unfamiliar territory. Deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently
egregious in another, and our concern with preserving the
constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an exact analysis of circumstances before any abuse
of power is condemned as conscience shocking. What we
have said of due process in the procedural sense is just as
true here:

"The phrase [due process of law] formulates a concept
less rigid and more fluid than those envisaged in other
specific and particular provisions of the Bill of Rights.
Its application is less a matter of rule. Asserted denial
is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in
a given case. That which may, in one setting, constitute
a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice, may, in other circumstances, and in
the light of other considerations, fall short of such denial." Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 462 (1942).

10 We have also employed deliberate indifference as a standard of culpability sufficient to identify a dereliction as reflective of municipal policy
and to sustain a claim of municipal liability for failure to train an employee
who causes harm by unconstitutional conduct for which he would be individually liable. See Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388-389 (1989).

Opinion of the Court
Thus, attention to the markedly different circumstancesof normal pretrial custody and high-speed law enforcement

chases shows why the deliberate indifference that shocks inthe one case is less egregious in the other (even assuming
that it makes sense to speak of indifference as deliberate inthe case of sudden pursuit). As the very term "deliberate
indifference" implies, the standard is sensibly employed onlywhen actual deliberation is practical, see

Whitley v. Albers,475 U. S., at 320,
11 and in the custodial situation of a prison,

forethought about an inmate's welfare is not only feasible butobligatory under a regime that incapacitates a prisoner to

exercise ordinary responsibility for his own welfare.

"[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody andholds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some re-sponsibility for his safety and general well-being. The
rationale for this principle is simple enough: when theState by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unableto care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide
for his basic human needs--e. g., food, clothing, shelter,medical care, and reasonable safety--it transgresses the
substantive limits on state action set by the . . . DueProcess Clause." DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept.
of Social Servs., 489 U. S., at 199-200 (citation and foot-note omitted).

Nor does any substantial countervailing interest excuse theState from making provision for the decent care and protection of those it locks up; "the State's responsibility to attend

11 By "actual deliberation," we do not mean "deliberation" in the narrow,
technical sense in which it has sometimes been used in traditional homicide
law. See, e. g., Caldwell v. State, 84 So. 272, 276 (Ala. 1919) (noting that
" `deliberation here does not mean that the man slayer must ponder over
the killing for a long time' "; rather, "it may exist and may be entertained
while the man slayer is pressing the trigger of the pistol that fired the
fatal shot[,] even if it be only for a moment or instant of time").

Opinion of the Court
to the medical needs of prisoners [or detainees] does not or-dinarily clash with other equally important governmental

responsibilities." Whitley v. Albers, supra, at 320.12But just as the description of the custodial prison situation
shows how deliberate indifference can rise to a constitu-tionally shocking level, so too does it suggest why indifference may well not be enough for liability in the differ-ent circumstances of a case like this one. We have, indeed,
found that deliberate indifference does not suffice for con-stitutional liability (albeit under the Eighth Amendment)
even in prison circumstances when a prisoner's claim arisesnot from normal custody but from response to a violent disturbance. Our analysis is instructive here:

"[I]n making and carrying out decisions involving theuse of force to restore order in the face of a prison

disturbance, prison officials undoubtedly must take intoaccount the very real threats the unrest presents to
inmates and prison officials alike, in addition to thepossible harms to inmates against whom force might be
used. . . . In this setting, a deliberate indifference stand-ard does not adequately capture the importance of such
competing obligations, or convey the appropriate hesi-tancy to critique in hindsight decisions necessarily made
in haste, under pressure, and frequently without theluxury of a second chance." Whitley v. Albers, 475
U. S., at 320.
We accordingly held that a much higher standard of faultthan deliberate indifference has to be shown for officer liabil12 Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), can be categorized on much
the same terms. There, we held that a severely retarded person could
state a claim under $ 1983 for a violation of substantive due process if the
personnel at the mental institution where he was confined failed to exercise professional judgment when denying him training and habilitation.
Id., at 319-325. The combination of a patient's involuntary commitment
and his total dependence on his custodians obliges the government to take
thought and make reasonable provision for the patient's welfare.

Opinion of the Court
ity in a prison riot. In those circumstances, liability shouldturn on "whether force was applied in a good faith effort to

maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadisticallyfor the very purpose of causing harm."

Id., at 320-321 (internal quotation marks omitted). The analogy to sudden police chases (under the Due Process Clause) would be hardto avoid.

Like prison officials facing a riot, the police on an occasioncalling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug
against each other. Their duty is to restore and maintainlawful order, while not exacerbating disorder more than necessary to do their jobs. They are supposed to act decisively
and to show restraint at the same moment, and their decisions have to be made "in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance." Id., at 320;
cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S., at 397 ("[P]olice officers are
often forced to make split-second judgments--in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving"). A
police officer deciding whether to give chase must balance on
one hand the need to stop a suspect and show that flight from
the law is no way to freedom, and, on the other, the highspeed threat to all those within stopping range, be they suspects, their passengers, other drivers, or bystanders.

To recognize a substantive due process violation in these
circumstances when only midlevel fault has been shown
would be to forget that liability for deliberate indifference to
inmate welfare rests upon the luxury enjoyed by prison officials of having time to make unhurried judgments, upon the
chance for repeated reflection, largely uncomplicated by the
pulls of competing obligations. When such extended opportunities to do better are teamed with protracted failure even
to care, indifference is truly shocking. But when unforeseen
circumstances demand an officer's instant judgment, even
precipitate recklessness fails to inch close enough to harmful
purpose to spark the shock that implicates "the large concerns of the governors and the governed." Daniels v. Wil523US3 Unit: $U69 [04-28-00 22:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

liams, 474 U. S., at 332. Just as a purpose to cause harm isneeded for Eighth Amendment liability in a riot case, so it

ought to be needed for due process liability in a pursuit case.Accordingly, we hold that high-speed chases with no intent
to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight donot give rise to liability under the Fourteenth Amendment,
redressible by an action under $ 1983.13The fault claimed on Smith's part in this case accordingly
fails to meet the shocks-the-conscience test. In the countcharging him with liability under $ 1983, respondents' complaint alleges a variety of culpable states of mind: "negli-gently responsible in some manner," App. 11, Count one, || 8,
"reckless and careless," id., at 12, ||15, "recklessness, grossnegligence and conscious disregard for [Lewis's] safety,"

id.,at 13, ||18, and "oppression, fraud and malice,"
ibid. Thesubsequent summary judgment proceedings revealed that

the height of the fault actually claimed was "conscious dis-regard," the malice allegation having been made in aid
of a request for punitive damages, but unsupported either inallegations of specific conduct or in any affidavit of fact
offered on the motions for summary judgment. The Courtof Appeals understood the claim to be one of deliberate indifference to Lewis's survival, which it treated as equivalent toone of reckless disregard for life. We agree with this reading of respondents' allegations, but consequently part com-pany from the Court of Appeals, which found them sufficient
to state a substantive due process claim, and from the Dis-trict Court, which made the same assumption

arguendo.14

13 Cf. Checki v. Webb, 785 F. 2d 534, 538 (CA5 1986) ("Where a citizen
suffers physical injury due to a police officer's negligent use of his vehicle,
no section 1983 claim is stated. It is a different story when a citizen
suffers or is seriously threatened with physical injury due to a police officer's intentional misuse of his vehicle" (citation omitted)).

14 To say that due process is not offended by the police conduct described

here is not, of course, to imply anything about its appropriate treatment
under state law. See Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 128-129

Smith was faced with a course of lawless behavior forwhich the police were not to blame. They had done nothing

to cause Willard's high-speed driving in the first place, noth-ing to excuse his flouting of the commonly understood law
enforcement authority to control traffic, and nothing (beyonda refusal to call off the chase) to encourage him to race
through traffic at breakneck speed forcing other drivers outof their travel lanes. Willard's outrageous behavior was
practically instantaneous, and so was Smith's instinctive re-sponse. While prudence would have repressed the reaction,
the officer's instinct was to do his job as a law enforcementofficer, not to induce Willard's lawlessness, or to terrorize,
cause harm, or kill. Prudence, that is, was subject to coun-tervailing enforcement considerations, and while Smith exaggerated their demands, there is no reason to believe thatthey were tainted by an improper or malicious motive on
his part.Regardless whether Smith's behavior offended the reasonableness held up by tort law or the balance struck in lawenforcement's own codes of sound practice, it does not shock
the conscience, and petitioners are not called upon to answerfor it under $ 1983. The judgment below is accordingly
reversed.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court in this case. The first ques-tion presented in the county's petition for certiorari is:

"Whether, in a police pursuit case, the legal standardof conduct necessary to establish a violation of substanicy choices . . . must be made by locally elected representatives [or by
courts enforcing the common law of torts], rather than by federal judges
interpreting the basic charter of Government for the entire country").

The county's petition assumed that the constitutional ques-tion was one of substantive due process, and the parties

briefed the question on that assumption. The assumptionwas surely not without foundation in our case law, as the
Court makes clear. Ante, at 846-847. The Court is correctin concluding that "shocks the conscience" is the right choice
among the alternatives posed in the question presented, andcorrect in concluding that this demanding standard has not
been met here.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, and write this explanationof the objective character of our substantive due process
analysis.The Court is correct, of course, in repeating that the prohibition against deprivations of life, liberty, or property con-tained in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extends beyond the command of fair procedures. Itcan no longer be controverted that due process has a substantive component as well. See, e. g., Washington v. Glucks-berg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992); Collins v. HarkerHeights, 503 U. S. 115, 125-128 (1992); Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110 (1989). As a consequence, certain ac-tions are prohibited no matter what procedures attend them.
In the case before us, there can be no question that an inter-est protected by the text of the Constitution is implicated:
The actions of the State were part of a causal chain resultingin the undoubted loss of life. We have no definitional problem, then, in determining whether there is an interest suffi-cient to invoke due process. Cf.

What we do confront is the question of the standard ofconduct the Constitution requires the State, in this case the

local police, to follow to protect against the unintentionaltaking of life in the circumstances of a police pursuit. Unlike the separate question whether or not, given the fact of
a constitutional violation, the state entity is liable for dam-ages, see

Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,
436 U. S. 658, 694-695 (1978); Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S.378 (1989), which is a matter of statutory interpretation or

elaboration, the question here is the distinct, anterior issuewhether or not a constitutional violation occurred at all.
See Collins v. Harker Heights, supra, at 120, 124.

The Court decides this case by applying the "shocks the
conscience" test first recognized in Rochin v. California, 342
U. S. 165, 172-173 (1952), and reiterated in subsequent decisions. The phrase has the unfortunate connotation of a
standard laden with subjective assessments. In that respect, it must be viewed with considerable skepticism. As
our opinion in Collins v. Harker Heights illustrates, however, the test can be used to mark the beginning point in
asking whether or not the objective character of certain conduct is consistent with our traditions, precedents, and historical understanding of the Constitution and its meaning. 503
U. S., at 126-128. As Justice Scalia is correct to point
out, we so interpreted the test in Glucksberg. Post, at 860-
861 (opinion concurring in judgment). In the instant case,
the authorities cited by Justice Scalia are persuasive, indicating that we would contradict our traditions were we to
sustain the claims of the respondents.

That said, it must be added that history and tradition are
the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the
substantive due process inquiry. There is room as well for
an objective assessment of the necessities of law enforcement, in which the police must be given substantial latitude
and discretion, acknowledging, of course, the primacy of the
interest in life which the State, by the Fourteenth Amend523US3 Unit: $U69 [04-28-00 22:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment, is bound to respect. I agree with the Court's assess-ment of the State's interests in this regard. Absent intent

to injure, the police, in circumstances such as these, may con-duct a dangerous chase of a suspect who disobeys a lawful
command to stop when they determine it is appropriate to
do so. There is a real danger in announcing a rule, or suggesting a principle, that in some cases a suspect is free to
ignore a lawful police command to stop. No matter how narrow its formulation, any suggestion that suspects may ignore
a lawful command to stop and then sue for damages sustained in an ensuing chase might cause suspects to flee more
often, increasing accidents of the kind which occurred here.

Though I share Justice Scalia's concerns about using the
phrase "shocks the conscience" in a manner suggesting that
it is a self-defining test, the reasons the Court gives in support of its judgment go far toward establishing that objective considerations, including history and precedent, are the
controlling principle, regardless of whether the State's action
is legislative or executive in character. To decide this case,
we need not attempt a comprehensive definition of the level
of causal participation which renders a State or its officers
liable for violating the substantive commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. It suffices to conclude that neither our
legal traditions nor the present needs of law enforcement
justify finding a due process violation when unintended injuries occur after the police pursue a suspect who disobeys
their lawful order to stop.

Justice Breyer, concurring.
I join the Court's judgment and opinion. I write separately only to point out my agreement with Justice Stevens, post, at 859, that Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226 (1991),
should not be read to deny lower courts the flexibility, in
appropriate cases, to decide 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 claims on the
basis of qualified immunity, and thereby avoid wrestling with

constitutional issues that are either difficult or poorly pre-sented. See

Siegert, supra, at 235 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (lower court "adopted the altogether normal procedureof deciding the case before it on the ground that appeared

to offer the most direct and appropriate resolution, and one
argued by the parties").

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
When defendants in a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action argue in the
alternative (a) that they did not violate the Constitution, and
(b) that in any event they are entitled to qualified immunity
because the constitutional right was not clearly established,
the opinion in Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226 (1991), tells us
that we should address the constitutional question at the
outset. That is sound advice when the answer to the constitutional question is clear. When, however, the question is
both difficult and unresolved, I believe it wiser to adhere to
the policy of avoiding the unnecessary adjudication of constitutional questions. Because I consider this such a case,
I would reinstate the judgment of the District Court on the
ground that the relevant law was not clearly defined in 1990.

The Court expresses concern that deciding the immunity
issue without resolving the underlying constitutional question would perpetuate a state of uncertainty in the law.
Ante, at 841-842, n. 5. Yet the Court acknowledges, as it
must, that a qualified immunity defense is unavailable in an
action against the municipality itself. Ibid. Sound reasons
exist for encouraging the development of new constitutional
doctrines in adversarial suits against municipalities, which
have a substantial stake in the outcome and a risk of exposure to damages liability even when individual officers are
plainly protected by qualified immunity.

In sum, I would hold that Officer Smith is entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment, but I do not join its opinion.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.

Today's opinion gives the lie to those cynics who claim thatchanges in this Court's jurisprudence are attributable to
changes in the Court's membership. It proves that thechanges are attributable to nothing but the passage of time
(not much time, at that), plus application of the ancientmaxim, "That was then, this is now."

Just last Term, in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702,720-722 (1997), the Court specifically rejected the method of
substantive-due-process analysis employed by Justice Souter in his concurrence in that case, which is the very samemethod employed by

Justice Souter in his opinion for theCourt today. To quote the opinion in

Glucksberg:

"Our established method of substantive-due-processanalysis has two primary features: First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause speciallyprotects those fundamental rights and liberties which
are, objectively, `deeply rooted in this Nation's historyand tradition,' . . . and `implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty' . . . . Second, we have required in substantive-due-process cases a `careful description' of the asserted
fundamental liberty interest. . . . Our Nation's history,legal traditions, and practices thus provide the crucial
`guideposts for responsible decisionmaking,' . . . thatdirect and restrain our exposition of the Due Process
Clause. . . ."J

ustice Souter . . . would largely abandon this re-strained methodology, and instead ask `whether [Washington's] statute sets up one of those "arbitrary imposi-tions" or "purposeless restraints" at odds with the Due
Process Clause . . . ' [citations and footnote omitted].In our view, however, the development of this Court's
substantive-due-process jurisprudence . . . has been aprocess whereby the outlines of the `liberty' specially
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . . . have at

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
least been carefully refined by concrete examples involv-ing fundamental rights found to be deeply rooted in

our legal tradition. This approach tends to rein in thesubjective elements that are necessarily present in due
process judicial review." Id., at 720-722.
Today, so to speak, the stone that the builders had rejectedhas become the foundation stone of our substantive-dueprocess jurisprudence. The atavistic methodology that Justice Souter announces for the Court is the very samemethodology that the Court called atavistic when it was

proffered by Justice Souter in Glucksberg. In fact, if any-thing, today's opinion is even more of a throwback to highly
subjective substantive-due-process methodologies than theconcurrence in

Glucksberg was. Whereas the latter saidmerely that substantive due process prevents "arbitrary impositions" and "purposeless restraints" (without any objec-tive criterion as to what is arbitrary or purposeless), today's
opinion resuscitates the ne plus ultra, the Napoleon Brandy,the Mahatma Gandhi, the Cellophane

1 of subjectivity, th' ol'

"shocks-the-conscience" test. According to today's opinion,this is the measure of arbitrariness when what is at issue is

executive, rather than legislative, action. Ante, at 846-847.2

1 For those unfamiliar with classical music, I note that the exemplars of
excellence in the text are borrowed from Cole Porter's "You're the Top,"
copyright 1934.

2 The proposition that "shocks-the-conscience" is a test applicable only

to executive action is original with today's opinion. That has never been
suggested in any of our cases, and in fact "shocks-the-conscience" was
recited in at least one opinion involving legislative action. See United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987) (in considering whether the
Bail Reform Act of 1984 violated the Due Process Clause, we said that
"[s]o-called `substantive due process' prevents the government from engaging in conduct that `shocks the conscience' "). I am of course happy to
accept whatever limitations the Court today is willing to impose upon the
"shocks-the-conscience" test, though it is a puzzlement why substantive
due process protects some liberties against executive officers but not
against legislatures.

862 COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO v. LEWIS

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Glucksberg, of course, rejected "shocks-the-conscience,"just as it rejected the less subjective "arbitrary action" test.

A 1992 executive-action case, Collins v. Harker Heights,503 U. S. 115, which had paid lipservice to "shocks-theconscience," see id., at 128, was cited in Glucksberg for the
proposition that "[o]ur Nation's history, legal traditions, andpractices . . . provide the crucial `guideposts for responsible

decisionmaking.' " 521 U. S., at 721, quoting Collins, supra,at 125. In fact, even before

Glucksberg we had characterized the last "shocks-the-conscience" claim to come beforeus as "nothing more than [a] bald assertio[n]," and had rejected it on the objective ground that the petitioner "failed
to proffer any historical, textual, or controlling precedential
support for [his alleged due process right], and we decline to
fashion a new due process right out of thin air." Carlisle v.
United States, 517 U. S. 416, 429 (1996).

Adhering to our decision in Glucksberg, rather than ask
whether the police conduct here at issue shocks my unelected
conscience, I would ask whether our Nation has traditionally
protected the right respondents assert. The first step of our
analysis, of course, must be a "careful description" of the
right asserted, Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Here the complaint alleges that the police officer deprived Lewis "of his
Fourteenth Amendment right to life, liberty and property
without due process of law when he operated his vehicle with
recklessness, gross negligence and conscious disregard for
his safety." App. 13. I agree with the Court's conclusion
that this asserts a substantive right to be free from "deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a high-speed automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender."
Ante, at 836; see also ante, at 853.

Respondents provide no textual or historical support for
this alleged due process right, and, as in Carlisle, I would
"decline to fashion a new due process right out of thin air."
517 U. S., at 429. Nor have respondents identified any precedential support. Indeed, precedent is to the contrary:

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
"Historically, th[e] guarantee of due process has been appliedto

deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a
person of life, liberty, or property." Daniels v. Williams,474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986) (citations omitted);

Collins, supra,
at 127, n. 10 (same). Though it is true, as the Court explains, that "deliberate indifference" to the medical needs ofpretrial detainees,

City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen.
Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 244-245 (1983), or of involuntarilycommitted mental patients,

Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S.
307, 314-325 (1982), may violate substantive due process, itis not the deliberate indifference alone that is the "deprivation." Rather, it is that combined with "the State's affirmative act of restraining the individual's freedom to act on
his own behalf--through incarceration, institutionalization,
or other similar restraint of personal liberty," DeShaney v.
Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189, 200
(1989). "[W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its
power so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him
unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs[,] . . . it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the . . . Due Process
Clause." Ibid. (emphasis added). We have expressly left
open whether, in a context in which the individual has not
been deprived of the ability to care for himself in the relevant respect, "something less than intentional conduct, such
as recklessness or `gross negligence,' " can ever constitute
a "deprivation" under the Due Process Clause. Daniels, 474
U. S., at 334, n. 3. Needless to say, if it is an open question
whether recklessness can ever trigger due process protections, there is no precedential support for a substantive-dueprocess right to be free from reckless police conduct during
a car chase.

To hold, as respondents urge, that all government conduct
deliberately indifferent to life, liberty, or property violates
the Due Process Clause would make " `the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever

systems may already be administered by the States.' " Id.,at 332, quoting

Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 701 (1976) (other
citation omitted). Here, for instance, it is not fair to say thatit was the police officer alone who "deprived" Lewis of his life.

Though the police car did run Lewis over, it was the driver
of the motorcycle, Willard, who dumped Lewis in the car'spath by recklessly making a sharp left turn at high speed.

(Willard had the option of rolling to a gentle stop and show-ing the officer his license and registration.) Surely Willard
"deprived" Lewis of his life in every sense that the policeofficer did. And if Lewis encouraged Willard to make the
reckless turn, Lewis himself would be responsible, at least
in part, for his own death. Was there contributory fault on
the part of Willard or Lewis? Did the police officer have
the "last clear chance" to avoid the accident? Did Willard
and Lewis, by fleeing from the police, "assume the risk" of
the accident? These are interesting questions of tort law,
not of constitutional governance. "Our Constitution deals
with the large concerns of the governors and the governed,
but it does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in
laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries
that attend living together in society." Daniels, supra, at
332. As we have said many times, "the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . does not transform every
tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation." DeShaney, supra, at 202 (citations omitted).

If the people of the State of California would prefer a system that renders police officers liable for reckless driving
during high-speed pursuits, "[t]hey may create such a system
. . . by changing the tort law of the State in accordance with
the regular lawmaking process." 489 U. S., at 203. For
now, they prefer not to hold public employees "liable for civil
damages on account of personal injury to or death of any
person or damage to property resulting from the operation,
in the line of duty, of an authorized emergency vehicle . . .

lator of the law." Cal. Veh. Code Ann. $ 17004 (West 1971).It is the prerogative of a self-governing people to make that

legislative choice. "Political society," as the Seventh Circuithas observed, "must consider not only the risks to passengers, pedestrians, and other drivers that high-speed chasesengender, but also the fact that if police are forbidden to
pursue, then many more suspects will flee--and successfulflights not only reduce the number of crimes solved but also
create their own risks for passengers and bystanders."
Mays v. City of East St. Louis, 123 F. 3d 999, 1003 (1997).In allocating such risks, the people of California and their

elected representatives may vote their consciences. But forjudges to overrule that democratically adopted policy judgment on the ground that it shocks their consciences is notjudicial review but judicial governance.

I would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, not onthe ground that petitioners have failed to shock my still, soft
voice within, but on the ground that respondents offer notextual or historical support for their alleged due process
right. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION v. MILLER et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 97-428. Argued March 23, 1998--Decided May 26, 1998
Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector

labor organization covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by Delta Air Lines
(Delta). The collective-bargaining agreement between ALPA and
Delta includes an "agency shop" clause that requires nonunion Delta
pilots to pay ALPA a monthly service charge for representing them.
For 1992, the first year ALPA collected an "agency fee" under the
agency-shop agreement, the Union ultimately determined that 19 percent of its expenses were not germane to collective bargaining. Accordingly, ALPA collected an agency fee that amounted to 81 percent of
its members' dues. Alleging that the Union had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to "germane" activities, respondents, 153 Delta pilots, challenged in this federal-court action the manner in which ALPA calculated agency fees. Under ALPA's
"Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees," adopted to comply
with the "impartial decisionmaker" requirement set forth in Teachers v.
Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 310, pilots who object to the fee calculation may
request arbitration under procedures devised by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). When 174 Delta pilots (including 91 of the
respondents) filed timely objections to the 1992 agency-fee calculation,
ALPA treated the objects as a request for arbitration and referred them
to the AAA for resolution in a single, consolidated proceeding. The
arbitrator declined to stay the arbitration in deference to the court proceeding, and sustained ALPA's calculation in substantial part. The District Court then granted ALPA's motion for summary judgment, concluding, inter alia, that pilots seeking to challenge the fee calculation
must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court. Reversing,
the Court of Appeals found no legal basis for requiring objectors to
arbitrate agency-fee challenges when they had not agreed to do so.
Having determined that the arbitrator's decision was no longer part of
the legal picture, the appellate court remanded the case to the District
Court.

Held: When a union adopts an arbitration process to comply with Hudson's "impartial decisionmaker" requirement, agency-fee objectors who
have not agreed to the procedure may not be required to exhaust the

Syllabus
arbitral remedy before challenging the union's calculation in a federalcourt action. Pp. 872-880.

(a) Section 2, Eleventh, of the RLA allows employers and unions to
conclude agency-shop agreements. Under such arrangements, nonmembers must pay their fair share of union expenditures necessarily or
reasonably incurred in performing the duties of an exclusive employee
representative dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.
Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 448. To avoid constitutional
shoals, however, fee objectors cannot be compelled to pay costs unrelated to those representative duties. See, e. g., id., at 448-455. In
Hudson, a public-sector case in which limitations on the use of agency
fees were prompted directly by the First Amendment, the Court held
that unions and employers must provide three procedural protections
for nonunion workers who object to the agency-fee calculation: sufficient
information to gauge the fee's propriety, 475 U. S., at 306; "a reasonably
prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker," id., at 310; and the escrowing of any amount
of the fee "reasonably in dispute" while the challenge is pending, ibid.
Pp. 872-874.

(b) The parties have not challenged the Court of Appeals' determination that Hudson's safeguards transfer fully to employment relations
governed by the RLA. Accordingly, the Court turns to the question
whether agency-fee objectors must exhaust Hudson's "impartial decisionmaker" procedure before pursuing their claims in federal court.
The Court answers that question "no," and rejects ALPA's request to
extend the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine, see McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 144, to agency-fee arbitration. A principal purpose of that doctrine--allowing agencies, not courts, to have primary responsibility for the programs that Congress has charged them
to administer, see id., at 145--is not relevant here: ALPA seeks exhaustion of an arbitral remedy established by a private party, not of an administrative remedy established by Congress. As a rule, arbitration
is a matter of contract, and a party ordinarily cannot be required to
submit to arbitration any dispute which he or she has not agreed so
to submit. E. g., Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S.
574, 582. ALPA, it is true, acted to comply with Hudson rather than
out of its own unconstrained choice. But the purpose of Hudson's "impartial decisionmaker" requirement is to advance the swift, fair, and
final settlement of objectors' rights, see 475 U. S., at 307, not to compel
objectors to pursue arbitration. The Court resists reading Hudson in
a manner that might frustrate its very purpose. ALPA's assertion of
the efficiency served by requiring objectors to proceed first to arbitration, thereby gaining definition of the scope of the dispute, overstates

Opinion of the Court
the difficulties entailed in holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration, and is answered by conscientious management of
the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not by a judicially imposed
exhaustion requirement. Genuine as the Union's interest in avoiding
multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors' resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their
election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal
rights. Pp. 874-880.

An "agency-shop" arrangement permits a union, obliged toact on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to

charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of therepresentation. The purposes for which a union may spend
the "agency fee" paid by nonmembers, however, are circum-scribed by the First Amendment (when public employers are
involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) orRailway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject
to their provisions are involved). In Teachers v. Hudson,475 U. S. 292 (1986), we held that the First Amendment requires public-employee unions to accord workers who object

private-sector labor organization covered by the RLA, ac-knowledges that it is bound by

Hudson. ALPA endeavoredto comply with Hudson's "impartial decisionmaker" requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the
agency fee collected by the Union in 1992. ALPA urgedthat the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies. The Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting
the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court. Wehold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees
need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they havenever agreed to do so.

ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilotsemployed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta). In November 1991, ALPAand Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement
to include, inter alia, an "agency-shop" clause. That clause,similar to provisions in ALPA's agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member topay the Union a monthly "service charge as a contribution
for the administration of [the collective-bargaining agree-ment] and the representation of such employee." App. 31.

On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this ac-tion against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the
District of Columbia. Their complaint charged that the"agency-shop" clause was unlawful on its face. (Three of the
original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently in-tervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated tothe issue we resolve. Delta was also dismissed from the

case on grounds not pertinent here.) The pilots unsuccess-fully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency-shop arrangement, and ALPA begancollecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.

In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35
percent of each pilot's earnings. The Union ultimately de-termined, in its final, audited "Statement of Germane and

Nongermane Expenses" (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percentof ALPA's expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining. Accordingly, the Union adjusted feescharged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount
members paid.

On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had
begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their
complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which
ALPA calculated the fee. They alleged, inter alia, that
ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures
genuinely attributable to "germane" activities. The District
Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993. The
pilots' original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause
were later resolved in the Union's favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal). Thus,
the challenge to the 1992 agency-fee calculation is the only
claim before us.

Under ALPA's "Policies and Procedures Applicable to
Agency Fees," pilots who object to the fee calculation may
request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.
Id., at 69-70. One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed
timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992
SGNE. ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA. On October 15,
1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.

The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here. (The other 62 respondents intervened in

the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.) Prefer-ring to pursue their challenges to ALPA's agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, therespondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration. The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who
declined to defer to the federal-court litigation. Id., at 106.After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, id., at 111-114, respondents' counsel entered a "con-ditional appearance" in the arbitral proceedings. The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.He ultimately sustained the Union's agency-fee calculation in
substantial part, although he concluded that "nongermane"
expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union's budget, not 19
percent as the Union had determined. App. to Pet. for Cert.
71a-115a, 158a-161a.

After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for
summary judgment in the federal-court action. Granting
the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking
to challenge the Union's agency-fee calculation must exhaust
arbitral remedies before proceeding in court. Id., at 26a-
31a. Accordingly, the court held, the 62 respondents who
did not join the arbitration were bound by the arbitrator's
decision. Id., at 32a. The other 91 respondents, the District Court ruled, qualified for clear-error review of the arbitrator's factfindings and de novo review of all legal issues.
Id., at 31a. Determining that the arbitrator had committed
no error of law or clear error of fact, the court sustained
his decision.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
reversed. 108 F. 3d 1415 (1997). That court found "no legal
basis" for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges unless they had agreed to do so (as respondents had
not). Id., at 1421 (emphasis deleted). It therefore concluded that "the arbitrator's decision [was] no longer a part
of the legal picture," and for that reason the case "must be
remanded." Id., at 1422. We granted certiorari, 522 U. S.

Because Delta is a "common carrier by air engaged ininterstate or foreign commerce," 45 U. S. C. $ 181, the RLA

governs its bargaining relationship with ALPA. Section 2,Eleventh, of the RLA allows employers and unions to conclude agency-shop agreements.2 The statutory authoriza-tion for such agreements aims to resolve the problem of "free
riders--employees in the bargaining unit on whose behalf

(CA10 1996) (exhaustion of arbitral remedy required), with Knight v.

(exhaustion not required), and Bromley v. Michigan Ed. Assn.-NEA, 82

2 The RLA, $ 2, Eleventh, as added by 64 Stat. 1238, 45 U. S. C. $ 152,

Eleventh, provides in pertinent part:

"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, or of any other
statute or law of the United States, or Territory thereof, or of any State,
any carrier or carriers as defined in this chapter and a labor organization or labor organizations duly designated and authorized to represent
employees in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall be
permitted--

"(a) to make agreements, requiring, as a condition of continued employment, that within sixty days following the beginning of such employment,
or the effective date of such agreements, whichever is the later, all employees shall become members of the labor organization representing their
craft or class: Provided, That no such agreement shall require such condition of employment with respect to employees to whom membership is not
available upon the same terms and conditions as are generally applicable
to any other member or with respect to employees to whom membership
was denied or terminated for any reason other than the failure of the
employee to tender the periodic dues, initiation fees, and assessments (not
including fines and penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership."

the union [is] obliged to perform its statutory functions, butwho refus[e] to contribute to the cost thereof."

Ellis v.
Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 447 (1984). Under agency-shop arrangements, nonmembers must pay their fair share

of union expenditures "necessarily or reasonably incurred for
the purpose of performing the duties of an exclusive repre-sentative of the employees in dealing with the employer on

labor-management issues." Id., at 448. To avoid constitu-tional questions that might arise were we to adopt a contrary
interpretation of the RLA, however, we have held that costsunrelated to those representative duties may not be imposed
on objecting employees. See id., at 448-455; see also Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U. S. 113, 121 (1963) ($ 2, Eleventh,
distinguishes between "the union's political expenditures,"
to which nonmembers may not be compelled to contribute,
and expenditures "germane to collective bargaining," to
which they may); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 768-769
(1961) ("$ 2, Eleventh is to be construed to deny the unions,
over an employee's objection, the power to use his exacted
funds to support political causes which he opposes"); see also
Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 762-763
(1988) (same limitations apply under NLRA).

A similar rule--based explicitly on the Constitution--applies to public-sector employment. In Abood v. Detroit Bd.
of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 232 (1977), we upheld the constitutionality of agency-shop agreements made by government employers with their workers' exclusive bargaining representatives.
As the Court explained, imposition of agency fees under the
RLA "is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the
system of labor relations established by Congress," and
"[t]he same important government interests . . . presumptively support" agency-shop arrangements in the public sector. Id., at 222, 225.

The agency fees assessed from nonmembers, we said in
Abood, may be "used to finance expenditures by the Union

Opinion of the Court
for the purposes of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment." Id., at 225-226. We
cautioned, however, in view of the presence of state action,
that objecting employees have a First Amendment right to
"prevent the Union's spending a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express
political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining
representative." Id., at 234. In Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty
Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 519 (1991), we relied on both publicsector and RLA cases to hold that agency fees assessed by
public-employee unions "must (1) be `germane' to collectivebargaining activity; (2) be justified by the government's vital
policy interest in labor peace and avoiding `free riders'; and
(3) not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that
is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop."

In Hudson, a public-sector case, we held that the First
Amendment required unions and employers to provide procedural protections for nonunion workers who object to the
calculation of the agency fee. Three safeguards, we declared, are essential to "minimize the infringement" on nonmembers' rights and provide workers with "a fair opportunity to identify the impact of [the agency-fee assessment] on
[their] interests," Hudson, 475 U. S., at 303: Employees must
receive "sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the
union's fee," id., at 306; the union must give objectors "a
reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of
the fee before an impartial decisionmaker," id., at 310; and
any amount of the objector's fee "reasonably in dispute"
must be held in escrow while the challenge is pending, ibid.

The Court of Appeals held that Hudson's procedural requirements transfer fully to employment relations governed
by the RLA, 108 F. 3d, at 1419, and the parties have not

Opinion of the Court
challenged that determination.3 We therefore turn directlyto the question presented: When a union adopts an arbitration process to comply with Hudson's "impartial decision-maker" requirement, must agency-fee objectors pursue and
exhaust the arbitral remedy before challenging the union'scalculation in a federal-court action?

In his concurring opinion in Hudson, Justice White ( joinedby Chief Justice Burger) answered that question "yes." He
stated: "[I]f the union provides for arbitration and complieswith the other requirements specified in our opinion, it
should be entitled to insist that the arbitration procedure beexhausted before resorting to the courts." 475 U. S., at 311.
The Court's opinion did not comment on that unelaboratedassertion, however, so the issue remains live for the decision
we now reach. The Court of Appeals recognized that "Jus-tice White raised a legitimate practical concern," but found
"no legal basis for forcing into arbitration a party who neveragreed to put his dispute over federal law to such a process."
108 F. 3d, at 1421 (emphasis in original). We agree, and de-cline to read

Hudson as a decision that protects nonunionmembers at a cost--delayed access to federal court--they do

not wish to pay.ALPA urges extension of the discretionary exhaustion-ofremedies doctrine to agency-fee arbitration. See Brief forPetitioner 19 (citing McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 144

apply to agency-fee cases involving private employers governed by the

branches of Government, that agencies, not the courts, oughtto have primary responsibility for the programs that Congress has charged them to administer." Id., at 145. ALPAseeks exhaustion not of an administrative remedy established by Congress but of an arbitral remedy established bya private party. Ordinarily, "arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitrationany dispute which he has not agreed so to submit."

Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960);see also First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S.

938, 942 (1995) ("a party who has not agreed to arbitrate willnormally have a right to a court's decision about the merits

decision in Hudson rather than out of its own unconstrainedchoice. But

Hudson's requirement of "a reasonably prompt

4 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness. Illegality depends
on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA
maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector
has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed
amounts are released from escrow. See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18-20. Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses
NEA's argument. See Reply Brief 16-17. The contention, however, is
inconsistent with Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986). There, we
rejected the union's position that "because a 100% escrow completely
avoids the risk that dissenters' contributions could be used improperly, it
eliminates any valid constitutional objection to the procedure and thereby
provides an adequate remedy." Id., at 309. We held that even if the
entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors
(who are deprived of the use of what may be their property pending the
outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the
prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

Opinion of the Court
decision by an impartial decisionmaker," 475 U. S., at 307,
aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them
access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be
resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel
objectors to pursue that remedy. See ibid. ("The nonunion
employee, whose First Amendment rights are affected by
the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting,
is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious,
fair, and objective manner."). Indeed, Hudson's emphasis
on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion,
even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges. See McCarthy, 503
U. S., at 146 ("[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued
if the litigant's interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government's interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed
to further." (internal quotation marks omitted)). We resist
reading Hudson in a manner that might frustrate its very
purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of
objectors' rights.

Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration
first. The Union asserts: "It is difficult to conceive how a
court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute ab initio, given
that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation
are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their
challenge." Reply Brief 6-7. Arbitration, in ALPA's view,
will serve a useful, if not essential, role in defining the scope
of the dispute. See Brief for Petitioner 21-23; Reply Brief
4-7.

ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court
hearing without a preparatory arbitration. We have held
that "the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an
objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof."

Opinion of the Court
Hudson, 475 U. S., at 306. And when pursuing the union's
internal remedies, an objector may preserve the right to
subsequent judicial relief without "indicat[ing] to the Union
the specific expenditures to which he objects." Abood, 431
U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original). In stating that the "nonmember's `burden' is simply the obligation to make his objection known," Hudson, 475 U. S., at 306, n. 16, however, we
did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally
phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to
prove the "germaneness" of its expenditures without a clue
as to "which of its thousands of expenditures" the objectors
oppose. Reply Brief 4. Agency-fee challengers, like all
other civil litigants, must make their objections known with
the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches: motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.

The very purpose of Hudson's notice requirement is to
provide employees sufficient information to enable them to
identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has
improperly classified as germane. See 475 U. S., at 306-307.
With the Hudson notice, plus any additional information
developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be
expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable. Although the union must
establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the
shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal
court in the first instance, if that is their preference. The
answer to ALPA's efficiency concern lies in conscientious
management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse,
not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.

Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement
would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain. To the
extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to
the union's fee calculation, exhaustion would require the ob523US3 Unit: $U70 [04-28-00 23:04:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
jector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.5Furthermore, if the union's arbitration process in fact operates to provide an inexpensive, swift, and sure remedy foragency-fee errors, dissenting employees may avail themselves of that process even if not required to do so. Cf.
Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513, n. 15
(1982) (under a " `free market' system" of no required exhaustion, "litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if
they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more
effective").

The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral
fora. We note that unions do not lack means to limit the
expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges: objections may be consolidated for consideration in a
single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may
be consolidated in a single district court. See 28 U. S. C.

$$ 1404, 1407. But genuine as the Union's interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors' resistance to arbitration to which they did
not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to
court for adjudication of their federal rights.6 We hold that,
unless they agree to the procedure, agency-fee objectors may

5 Inevitably limiting the utility of exhaustion in relieving the courts of
the task of adjudicating agency-fee disputes is the nonbinding character
of Hudson arbitration, a characteristic on which the dissent centrally relies. See post, at 880, 881, 882, 883-885.

6 Our recognition of the right of objectors to proceed directly to court

does not detract from district courts' discretion to defer discovery or other
proceedings pending the prompt conclusion of arbitration. See, e. g., Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254-255 (1936) ("[T]he power to
stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to
control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time
and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. How this can best be
done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing
interests and maintain an even balance.").

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

In Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986), this Courtheld that

"the constitutional requirements for the Union's collec-tion of agency fees include an adequate explanation of
the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity
to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartialdecisionmaker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending." Id.,at 310 (emphasis added).

The Court added that, if the "impartial decisionmaker" is anarbitrator, that arbitrator's decision would not bind a court
in a subsequent court action. Id., at 308, n. 21 ("arbitrator'sdecision would not receive preclusive effect in any subsequent $ 1983 action"). Cf. ante, at 874-875, and n. 3 (treat-ing procedural requirements set forth in

Hudson, a 42U. S. C. $ 1983 case, as "transfer[ing] fully" to Railway Labor

Act cases such as this one).I read Hudson as implying approval, not disapproval, of
a union rule that would require initial participation in"prompt," but non-binding, arbitration. Indeed, Justice
White, joined by Chief Justice Burger, concurring in theCourt's judgment and opinion in

Hudson, specifically statedthat

"if the union provides for arbitration and complies withthe other requirements specified in our opinion, it should

at 311.
I agree with Justice White that the law permits the Unionto insist upon compliance with that internal procedure--as

long as the required arbitration is nonbinding and conductedexpeditiously by an "impartial" arbitrator, as

Hudson re-quires. Id., at 310.

The Court majority quotes with approval the Court of Ap-peals' statement that Justice White's concern, while " `practical,' " lacked a " `legal basis.' " Ante, at 875 (quoting 108F. 3d 1415, 1421 (CADC 1997)) (emphasis deleted). But
Hudson itself, and the case law upon which Hudson rests,provide more than adequate legal support for Justice White's
basic position. Those cases make clear that Hudson's re-quirements do not rest solely upon the interests of dissenting
employees, but, rather, grow out of a judicial effort to bal-ance two distinct interests.

One interest is the Union's concern that nonmember em-ployees share the cost of the collective bargaining from
which they benefit. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431U. S. 209, 222 (1977) (imposition of agency fees "is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the impor-tant contribution of the union shop to the system of labor
relations established by Congress"); Railway Clerks v.
Allen, 373 U. S. 113, 122 (1963) ("no decree would be properwhich appeared likely to infringe the unions' right to expend

uniform exactions under the union-shop agreement"); Ma-chinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 761-764 (1961); see also
Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 520-521(1991). The other interest is that of the nonmember in

notpaying for "nongermane" union activity, which activity may

promote ideological or political views that the nonmemberdoes not share. Lehnert, supra, at 515-519; Abood, supra,
at 233-236; Allen, supra, at 118-121; Street, supra, at765-769.

882 AIR LINE PILOTS v. MILLER

Breyer, J., dissenting
This Court has interpreted the relevant labor statutes, inlight of the Constitution's requirements, as requiring procedures that "protect both" these "interests to the maximumextent possible without undue impingement of one on the
other." Street, supra, at 773 (emphasis added). Indeed,
Hudson itself makes clear that procedural requirements" `must' " seek as their " `objective' " to " `preven[t] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity by employees whoobject thereto

without restricting the Union's ability to require every employee to contribute to the cost of collectivebargaining activities.' " 475 U. S., at 302 (quoting Abood,
supra, at 237) (emphasis added). The mandatory, but nonbinding, arbitration requirement at issue here satisfies these
objectives, for it amounts to a reasonable elaboration of
Hudson's own mandate: that the Union provide "a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee
before an impartial decisionmaker." 475 U. S., at 310.

First, consider the matter from the Union's perspective.
The "arbitration first" requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and
makes their resolution manageable. As this case illustrates,
different groups of nonmember dissenters with different
motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.
Without the "arbitration first" rule, they might do so simultaneously. Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different
information, hearing different arguments, operating under
different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising
different judgments (each without knowledge of the other),
could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions. Amicus National Education Association
says that this "would be the most expensive and burdensome
system imaginable." Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 14. Amicus AFL-CIO adds that the
"costs of defending such litigation" (which may involve no

Breyer, J., dissenting
more than $50 or so for any individual dissenter, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 10) "can easily consume the union's agency fee

receipts." Brief for AFL-CIO as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 5.The Court itself recognizes as "[g]enuine" the Union's "concern" about defending "its fee calculation simultaneously in
judicial and arbitral fora." Ante, at 878, 879.Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the

dissenting employee. The Court's decision, rejecting theUnion's rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of
a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a waythat does

not offset the corresponding harm caused the
Union. That is because "arbitration first" does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See Hudson, supra, at 307. Moreover,
nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose
objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to
minimize the fee they must pay. See Gilpin v. AFSCME,
875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors
are "free riders" seeking representation at the lowest cost
possible); Weaver v. University of Cincinnati, 970 F. 2d 1523,
1530 (CA6 1992) (same); Kidwell v. Transportation Comm.
Int'l Union, 946 F. 2d 283, 304-306 (CA4 1991) (same).

Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the
remaining unsatisfied objectors. The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief
additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent
in escrow during the arbitration proceedings. Hudson,
supra, at 305, 310. Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the
objectors free to press their claims in a later court action--
if the arbitration's result leaves them dissatisfied. And, as
the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later
action, though informed by the arbitrator's decision, would
not accord it any special legal weight. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16,
20-21; see also Hudson, supra, at 308, n. 21 ("arbitrator's
decision would not receive preclusive effect in any subse523US3 Unit: $U70 [04-28-00 23:04:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
quent $ 1983 action"). Cf. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.134, 140 (1944) (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the "power to persuade, if lacking powerto control"). In other words, the objecting dissenter, though
briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.
See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration: An AlternativeView, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory non-binding arbitration overagency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory

binding
arbitration).From the courts' perspective too, nonbinding arbitration

can prove helpful. Insofar as it settles matters to the
parties' satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps timeconsuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations. Cf. Allen, 373 U. S., at 122
(describing difficulties surrounding "judicially administered
relief " for agency fee objectors, as compared with "internal
union remedy"); Abood, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).

The upshot is that the "arbitration first" rule "prevent[s]
compulsory subsidization of ideological activity" without unduly "restricting the Union's ability" to collect a legitimate
agency fee. Consequently, neither the First Amendment,
nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the
Union's insistence upon that rule.

I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion
through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the
circumstances before us. First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in
contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties. Ante, at 876.
But "consent" is not relevant to the legal justification for the
"arbitration first" rule before us. Rather, that rule finds its
legal anchor in the Union's legal authority (indeed, obligation) under Hudson to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement
of objectors' constitutional rights. I have explained above

arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try non-binding arbitration before they pursue a case in court. See,
e. g., 28 U. S. C. $$ 651-658 (authorizing district courts to
refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); Alterna-tive Dispute Resolution, Local Rules 2-3, 4-2 (ND Cal.

1998); see also B. Meierhoefer, Federal Judicial Center,Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).

Second, the Court describes the Union's proposed "ar-bitration first" rule as an "extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine." Ante, at 875. But
whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in
this case is beside the point. The "arbitration first" rule
amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in Hudson. Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that
permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the
competing demands of the First Amendment. Hudson decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory,
nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution. Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.
Why then should those principles prevent the Court from
elaborating upon Hudson's requirements, by permitting a
union to impose a reasonable "arbitration first" rule of the
kind before us?

I note one additional matter. The Court's opinion refers
to the "pilots . . . proceed[ing] at once in federal court."
Ante, at 869. The Court does not decide, however, whether
a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious
arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.
Ante, at 879, n. 6. Should it await arbitration's conclusion,
the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement
or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration
proceeding produced. Doing so would alleviate many of the
concerns that I have expressed in this opinion. See supra,
at 882-884.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Even so, the question before us is whether the Union caninsist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration. For

the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistentwith, and a reasonable extension of, this Court's decision in
Hudson.I therefore dissent.

Thomas, J., dissenting1036
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice
Scalia join, dissenting.

In 1995, the Ohio General Assembly passed, by an overwhelm-ing majority, House Bill 135, which, among other things, places

certain restrictions on abortions after fetal viability. To thatend, it provides that--

"(A) No person shall purposely perform or induce or at-tempt to perform or induce an abortion upon a pregnant
woman if the unborn human is viable, unless . . ."(1) The abortion is performed or induced or attempted to
be performed or induced by a physician, and that physiciandetermines, in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
medical judgment, that the abortion is necessary to preventthe death of the pregnant woman or a serious risk of the
substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodilyfunction of the pregnant woman." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 2919.17 (1996).
The District Court enjoined the law as unconstitutional on itsface, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals

for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 130 F. 3d 187 (1997). The panelmajority held that the statute's limitation of postviability abortions is unconstitutionally vague and that it impermissibly lacksan exception for abortions based upon the "mental health" of the
mother. Both of these conclusions are unwarranted extensions ofour precedents. Moreover, reflecting our recent reaffirmation of
the principle that a State's interests in restricting abortions areat their strongest after viability, see

Planned Parenthood ofSoutheastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 879 (1992) ( joint opinion

of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.), over three-quarters ofthe States have in place statutes limiting the reasons for which
abortions may be performed late in pregnancy. The vast major-ity of those statutes do not contain an explicit mental health
exception. I would therefore grant the State's petition for certiorari to decide the constitutionality of House Bill 135's postviabil-ity restrictions.

The panel majority first found unconstitutional the Ohio stat-ute's requirement that a physician's determination of medical necessity be made "in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable

medical judgment." Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2919.17(A)(1) (1996).*Relying on our decision in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379
(1979), the panel held that the "combination of . . . objective andsubjective standards without a scienter requirement" renders
the medical necessity exception "unconstitutionally vague." 130F. 3d, at 205. The panel explained that the statute does not
"adequately notify a physician that certain conduct is prohibited;rather, a physician may be held criminally and civilly liable for
adhering to his or her own best medical judgment." Id., at 206.This holding is simply not supported by Colautti. The statute
in that case required physicians to adhere to a standard of carecalculated to preserve the life and health of the fetus if the physician determined that "the fetus is viable" or "if there is sufficientreason to believe that the fetus may be viable." 439 U. S., at 391
(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). Our conclu-sion that this formulation was void for vagueness in no way suggests that the Ohio statute's more specific language--"in goodfaith and in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment"--is unconstitutionally vague. The statutory language in Colautti wasambiguous because it could be read as imposing either a purely
subjective or a mixed subjective and objective mental require-ment, thereby leaving physicians uncertain of the relevant legal
standard. Id., at 391-394. House Bill 135, by contrast, plainlyimposes both a subjective and an objective mental requirement,
and thus its commands are clear.The panel majority appears to have been concerned not so much
with vagueness, but rather with the statute's lack of a scienterrequirement relating to physician determinations about the medical necessity of an abortion. See 130 F. 3d, at 205 (stating thatthe statute was "especially troublesome" for this reason). Yet as
the majority opinion implicitly recognized, see id., at 204-205, wehave never held that, in the abortion context, a scienter requirement is mandated by the Constitution. To the contrary, in Co-lautti itself, we explicitly declined to address whether "under a
properly drafted statute, a finding of bad faith or some other typeof scienter would be required before a physician could be held

*If a physician makes such a determination, he must then comply withcertain certification requirements, unless he determines, also "in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment," that a medical emer-gency prevents compliance. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2919.17(B)(2) (1996).
The panel majority found this requirement unconstitutional as well.

criminally responsible for an erroneous determination of viabil-ity." 439 U. S., at 396. We only stated that the vagueness of the
statute at issue was "compounded" by the fact that it lacked ascienter requirement. Id., at 394; cf. 130 F. 3d, at 216 (Boggs, J.,
dissenting) ("[T]he principle invoked by the Court in Colautti . . .is . . . not that the absence of a scienter requirement will `create'
vagueness where it does not otherwise exist"). This Court shouldgrant certiorari rather than allow a constitutional scienter requirement to be imposed under the guise of the void-for-vaguenessdoctrine.

The panel majority similarly wrenched this Court's prior state-ments out of context in finding the statute's lack of a mental
health exception constitutionally infirm. The panel majoritystated that the question whether a maternal health exception may
constitutionally be limited to physical health depends upon whatwe meant in Casey by abortions " `necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of themother.' " 130 F. 3d, at 208 (quoting Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, supra, at 879). To answer this ques-tion, however, the panel relied on our conclusion in Doe v. Bolton,
410 U. S. 179 (1973), that an exception in Georgia's abortion stat-ute for abortions performed when a physician determined, " `based
upon his best clinical judgment[,] [that] an abortion [was] neces-sary,' " id., at 183, was not unconstitutionally vague because the
phrase had been construed to allow physicians to consider " `allfactors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the
woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient,' " id., at192 (emphasis added). Our conclusion that the statutory phrase
at issue in Doe was not vague because it included emotional andpsychological considerations in no way supports the proposition
that, after viability, a mental health exception is required as amatter of federal constitutional law. Doe simply did not address
that question. As with its void-for-vagueness holding, the panelmajority's quarrel with the wishes of the Ohio Legislature on this
score appears to be grounded in abortion policy, not constitu-tional law.

The decision below, moreover, may do more than thwart thewill of the Ohio Legislature. The vast majority of the 38 States
that have enacted postviability abortion restrictions have notspecified whether such abortions must be permitted on mental
health grounds. See Brief for A Majority of Members of the

Ohio General Assembly as Amicus Curiae 3-4. If the decisionbelow stands, it is likely to create needless uncertainty about the
constitutionality of many of those statutes as well. When statestatutes on matters of significant public concern have been declared unconstitutional, we have not hesitated to review the deci-sions in question, even in the absence of a circuit split. See, e. g.,
Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996). This case presents notonly this compelling reason for certiorari, but also the ground
that our failure to review the decision below may cast unnecessarydoubt on the validity of other state statutes. I would grant the

1243INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Case or Controversy.

1. Declaratory and injunctive relief--Resolution of underlying dispute.--Respondent's action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief
to determine what procedural rules will apply in federal habeas cases filed
by California prisoners is not a justiciable case under Article III because
it would not completely resolve underlying habeas claims. Calderon v.
Ashmus, p. 740.

2. Mootness--Habeas corpus petition.--Expiration of petitioner's sentence rendered moot his habeas petition challenging validity of his parole
revocation because petition no longer presented an Article III case or controversy. Spencer v. Kemna, p. 1.

3. Ripeness--Forest management.--A dispute between Sierra Club and
Forest Service over lawfulness of latter's National Forest Management
Act Plan for Ohio's Wayne National Forest is not ripe for court review.
Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, p. 726.

4. Ripeness--Voting Rights Act of 1965--Preclearance of educational
achievement law.--Texas' claim that Act's preclearance provisions do not
apply to implementation of sections of a state law permitting State to
sanction local school districts for failing to meet state-mandated educational achievement levels is not ripe for adjudication. Texas v. United
States, p. 296.

5. Standing to sue--Discrimination in grand jury selection.--A white
criminal defendant has requisite standing to raise equal protection and
due process objections to discrimination against black persons in selection
of Louisiana grand jurors. Campbell v. Louisiana, p. 392.

6. Standing to sue--Emergency Planning and Community Right-ToKnow Act of 1986--Citizen suit.--Because none of relief sought would
likely remedy respondent's alleged injury, respondent lacks standing to
maintain a citizen suit under EPCRA, and this Court and lower courts
lack jurisdiction to entertain it. Steel Co. v. Citizens For Better Environment, p. 83.

II. Confrontation of Witness.

Redacted confession--Obvious alterations.--Bruton v. United States,
391 U. S. 123, forbids use at a joint trial of a defendant's confession redacted to replace a codefendant's name with an obvious blank space, a
word such as "deleted," a symbol, or other similarly obvious indications of
alteration. Gray v. Maryland, p. 185.

III. Due Process.

High-speed chase--Deliberate or reckless indifference to life.--Police
do not violate substantive due process by causing death through deliberate

523IND Unit: $UBV [04-26-00 15:12:49] PGT: INDBV (Bound Volume)
1244 INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
or reckless indifference to life in a high-speed automobile chase to apprehend a suspected offender. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, p. 833.

IV. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Immigration and Nationality Act--Citizenship determinations.--
Court of Appeals' judgment, that equal protection is not violated by Act's
requirement that children born out of wedlock to citizen fathers, but not
to citizen mothers, obtain formal proof of paternity by age 18, is affirmed.
Miller v. Albright, p. 420.

V. Export Clause.

Harbor Maintenance Tax.--Federal HMT, as applied to goods loaded at
United States ports for export, violates Export Clause. United States v.
United States Shoe Corp., p. 360.

VI. Freedom of Speech.

Public television broadcaster--Candidates' debate.--Decision by petitioner public television broadcaster to exclude respondent from a congressional candidates' debate because he had little popular support was a
reasonable, viewpoint-neutral exercise of journalistic discretion consistent with First Amendment. Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes,
p. 666.

VII. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

Clemency review--Voluntary interview.--Ohio's clemency review process does not violate Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination
by giving an inmate option of a voluntary interview. Ohio Adult Parole
Authority v. Woodard, p. 272.

VIII. Right to Jury Trial.

1. Copyright Act of 1976--Statutory damages.--While there is no statutory right to a jury trial when a copyright owner elects to recover statutory damages under $ 504(c) of Act, Seventh Amendment provides such a
right on all issues pertinent to award, including amount itself. Feltner v.
Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., p. 340.

2. Mandamus--Reduction of damages award.--Fourth Circuit's writ of
mandamus, requiring District Court to enter judgment for a lesser amount
than damages determined by jury without allowing petitioner/plaintiff
option of a new trial, violated petitioner's Seventh Amendment right to a
jury trial. Hetzel v. Prince William County, p. 208.

IX. Right to Present a Defense.

Military Rules of Evidence--Admissibility of polygraph evidence.--
Rule 707, which makes polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial

proceedings, does not unconstitutionally abridge an accused service member's right to present a defense. United States v. Scheffer, p. 303.

X. Searches and Seizures.

"No-knock" entry--Effect of property destruction on lawfulness.--
Fourth Amendment does not hold police to a higher standard than reasonable suspicion standard set forth in Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385,
when a "no-knock" entry results in property destruction; such destruction
did not violate 18 U. S. C. $ 3109 in this case. United States v. Ramirez,
p. 65.

XI. States' Immunity from Suit.

In rem admiralty action--Possession of res.--Eleventh Amendment
does not bar a federal court's jurisdiction over an in rem admiralty action
against a State where res is not within State's possession. California v.
Deep Sea Research, Inc., p. 491.

CONSUMER RIGHTS. See Truth in Lending Act.
CONTRACTS BY INDIAN TRIBES. See Indians.
COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1976. See also Constitutional Law, VIII, 1.

Imported copies--"First-sale" doctrine.--Since a copyright owner's
right under $ 602(a) of Act to prohibit unauthorized importation of copies
of its copyrighted works is subject to "first sale" doctrine endorsed in

$ 109(a), respondent could not use $ 602(a) to protect it from actions of
foreign distributors who resold its products to American vendors unable
to buy from respondent's domestic distributors. Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L'anza Research Int'l, Inc., p. 135.

to an aggravated felony conviction--is merely a penalty provision that
need not be charged in Government's indictment. Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, p. 224.

2. Murder--Application of state law on federal enclave.--Because federal Assimilative Crimes Act does not make Louisiana's first-degree murder statute applicable on federal enclaves--such as Army bases--in that
State, federal second-degree murder statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1111, governed
crime at issue in this case. Lewis v. United States, p. 155.

Calderon v. Thompson, p. 538.

Vienna Convention right to consular notification was violated when he was
arrested and charged with capital murder in Virginia; Convention gives
Paraguay no private right of action to set aside conviction. Breard v.
Greene, p. 371.

2. Incompetence claim--Second or successive petition.--Respondent's
claim that he was incompetent to be executed, which was dismissed as
premature in an earlier federal habeas petition, was not a "second or successive" petition subject to restrictions of Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996. Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, p. 637.

3. Procedural default--Actual innocence.--Although petitioner's habeas claim--challenging his guilty plea to a charge of "using" a firearm in
violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)--was procedurally defaulted, he may be
entitled to a hearing on merits if he makes necessary actual innocence
