The question presented is whether a state common-lawtort action seeking damages from the manufacturer of anoutboard motor is pre-empted either by the enactment ofthe Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, 46 U. S. C. $$ 4301-4311(FBSA, 1971 Act, or Act), or by the decision of the CoastGuard in 1990 not to promulgate a regulation requiring propeller guards on motorboats.IOn July 10, 1995, petitioner's wife, Jeanne Sprietsma, diedas a result of a boating accident on an inland lake that spansthe Kentucky-Tennessee border. She was riding in an 18-foot ski boat equipped with a 115-horsepower outboardmotor manufactured by respondent, Mercury Marine, whichis a division of the Brunswick Corporation (Brunswick).Apparently when the boat turned, she fell overboard and wasstruck by the propeller, suffering fatal injuries.Attorneys General for their respective States as follows: Mark Pryor ofArkansas, Bill Lockyer of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut,Robert A.

MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the Courtthis character.4 Because the pre-emption defense raises athreshold issue, we have no occasion to consider the meritsof petitioner's claims, or even whether the claims are viableas a matter of Illinois law. We must, however, evaluatethree distinct theories that may support the pre-emption de-fense: (1) that the 1971 Act expressly pre-empts common-lawclaims; (2) that the Coast Guard's decision not to regulatepropeller guards pre-empts the claims; and (3) that the potential conflict between diverse state rules and the federalinterest in a uniform system of regulation impliedly preempts such claims. Before considering each of these theo-ries, we review the history of federal regulation in this area.IIThe 1971 Act is the most recent and most comprehensiveof the several statutes that Congress has enacted to improvethe safe operation of recreational boats. A 1910 enactmentrequired three classes of motorboats to carry certain lights,sound signals, life preservers, and fire extinguishers. Actof June 9, 1910, 36 Stat. 462. In 1918, Congress passed alaw that required the numbering of motorboats over 16 feetlong, Act of June 7, 1918, ch. 93, 40 Stat. 602, and in 1940, itreenacted the above requirements, provided a system of fed-eral inspection, and authorized penalties for the reckless operation of motorboats, Act of Apr. 25, 1940, ch. 155, 54 Stat.163. In 1958, Congress enacted additional numbering requirements to be administered by the States and directedthe States to compile and transmit boating accident statisticsto the Secretary of the Treasury. Federal Boating Act of1958, 72 Stat. 1754. Section 9 of the 1958 Act expresseda policy of encouraging uniformity of boating laws insofaras practicable.The accident statistics compiled by the States presumablywere instrumental in persuading the 1971 Congress that ad4 Brunswick has asserted that federal maritime law governs this case.Because this argument was not raised below, it is waived.537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Courtditional federal legislation was necessary.5 In its statementof purposes, the FBSA recites that it was enacted "to improve boating safety," to authorize "the establishment of na-tional construction and performance standards for boats andassociated equipment," and to encourage greater "uniformityof boating laws and regulations as among the several Statesand the Federal Government." Pub. L. 92-75, $ 2, 85 Stat.213-214. Three of the provisions implementing these goalsare particularly relevant to this case.Section 5 of the FBSA, as amended and codified in 46U. S. C. $ 4302, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation toissue regulations establishing "minimum safety standardsfor recreational vessels and associated equipment," and re-quiring the installation or use of such equipment.6 The Secretary has delegated this authority to the Coast Guard. See49 CFR $ 1.46(n)(1) (1997). Before exercising that authority,5 The Senate Report on the 1971 Act observed that approximately 40million Americans engaged in recreational boating activities every year,and that nearly 7,000 persons had died in boating accidents during thepreceding 5-year period. S. Rep. No. 92-248, pp. 6-7 (1971) (hereinafterS. Rep.). The Report added: "It seems apparent that the annual loss oflife is of sufficiently alarming proportion that the Federal Governmentshould require products involved to be built to standards of safety commensurate with the risks associated with their use. Similar federal legislation exists with regard to other products, including aircraft and motorvehicles. Also, safety standards and requirements for certain categoriesof larger commercial vessels have existed for many years." Id., at 13.6 Title 46 U. S. C. $ 4302 provides:"(a) The Secretary may prescribe regulations--"(1) establishing minimum safety standards for recreational vessels andassociated equipment, and establishing procedures and tests required tomeasure conformance with those standards, with each standard--"(A) meeting the need for recreational vessel safety; and"(B) being stated, insofar as practicable, in terms of performance;"(2) requiring the installation, carrying, or use of associated equipment. . . on recreational vessels and classes of recreational vessels subject tothis chapter, and prohibiting the installation, carrying, or use of associatedequipment that does not conform with safety standards established underthis section . . . ."537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN58 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the Courtthe Coast Guard must consider certain factors, such as theextent to which the proposed regulation will contribute toboating safety, and must consult with a special NationalBoating Safety Advisory Council appointed pursuant to $ 33of the Act, 46 U.

The Coast Guardmay also issue exemptions from its regulations if it deter-mines that boating safety "will not be adversely affected."$ 4305.Section 10 of the Act, as codified in 46 U. S.

On August 11, 1971, the Secretary issued astatement exempting all then-existing state laws from pre-emption under the Act. 36 Fed. Reg. 15764-15765. He explained that boating safety would "not be adversely affectedby continuing in effect those existing laws and regulationsof the various States and political subdivisions" until newfederal regulations could be issued.Id., at 15765.One year later, on August 4, 1972, the Coast Guard issuedits first regulations under $ 5 of the Act. See 37 Fed. Reg.15777-15785. Those regulations included boat performanceand safety standards such as requirements for hull identifi537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the Courtcation numbers, maximum capacity and warnings of such ca-pacity, and minimum boat flotation. They did not includeany propeller guard requirement. After those federal regu-lations became effective, the Secretary limited the scope ofhis original blanket exemption to pre-empt those "State stat-utes and regulations" that concerned requirements coveredby the 1972 regulations. See 38 Fed. Reg. 6914-6915 (1973).Existing state laws that regulated matters not covered bythe federal regulations continued to be exempted from pre-emption.Ibid.In the years since, the Coast Guard has promulgated ahost of detailed regulations. Some prescribe the use ofspecified equipment, such as personal flotation devices andvisual distress signals, 33 CFR pts. 175(B), (C) (2001), andcertain procedures, such as compliance labeling by manufacturers and prompt accident reporting by operators, pts.181(B), 173(C). See generally pts. 173-181. Other regulations impose precise standards governing the design andmanufacture of boats themselves and of associated equipment, such as electrical and fuel systems, ventilation, and"start-in-gear protection" devices.

App. in Lewis v.Brunswick, O. T. 1997, No. 97-288, p. 170. A 1992 study by members ofthe Johns Hopkins University Injury Prevention Center and the Institutefor Injury Reduction concluded that, when adjusted for underreporting,537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Courtat the request of the Coast Guard, the National BoatingSafety Advisory Council appointed a special Propeller GuardSubcommittee. The subcommittee was directed to review"the available data on the prevention of propeller-strike accidents" and to study the "various methods of shrouding pro-pellers to prevent contact with [a] person in the water."App. 43.After 18 months of study, the subcommittee recommendedthat the Coast Guard "should take no regulatory action torequire propeller guards."Id., at 40. Its recommendationrested upon findings that, given current technology, feasiblepropeller guards might prevent penetrating injuries but in-crease the potential for blunt trauma caused by collision withthe guard, which enlarges the boat's underwater profile; fea-sible models would cause power and speed loss at higherspeeds; and it would be "prohibitive[ly]" expensive to retrofitall existing boats with propeller guards because "[n]o simpleuniversal design suitable for all boats and motors in exist-ence" had been proved feasible.Id., at 36-38.The Advisory Council endorsed the subcommittee's recommendation, as did the Coast Guard. In a 1990 letter to theCouncil, the Chief of the Coast Guard's Office of NavigationSafety and Waterway Services agreed that the available acci-dent data did not support the adoption of a regulation requiring propeller guards on motorboats, but stated that theCoast Guard would continue to review information "regarding development and testing of new propeller guarding de-vices or other information on the state of the art." Id.,at 81. In 1995, 1996, and 1997, the Coast Guard invited pub-lic comment on various proposals to reduce the number ofinjuries involving propeller strikes.In April 2001, the Advisory Council recommended that theCoast Guard develop four specific regulations. See 66 Fed."the true number of propeller injuries and fatalities may be closer to . . .2,000-3,000 per year." Id., at 199.537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN62 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the CourtReg. 63645, 63647.9 In response, in December 2001, theCoast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing one of the recommendations. The proposed rule, ifadopted, would require an owner of a nonplaning houseboatfor rent to equip her vessel with either a propeller guard or"a combination of three propeller injury avoidance measures." Ibid. The Advisory Council also recommended thatthe Coast Guard require "manufacturers and importers ofnew planing vessels 12 feet to 26 feet in length with propel-lers aft of the transom to select and install one of severalfactory installed propeller injury avoidance methods." Ibid.Although the Coast Guard has indicated that this recommendation, along with the Advisory Council's other recommenda-tions, will be addressed in "subsequent regulatory projects,"ibid., it has not yet issued any regulation either requiring orprohibiting propeller guards on recreational planing vesselssuch as the boat involved in this case.IIIBecause the FBSA contains an express pre-emptionclause, our "task of statutory construction must in the firstinstance focus on the plain wording of the clause, which nec9 "After discussing the alternatives and their cost, the Council recommended that the Coast Guard . . . develop four specific regulations:"(1) Require owners of all propeller driven vessels 12 feet in length andlonger with propellers aft of the transom to display propeller warninglabels and to employ an emergency cut-off switch, where installed;"(2) Require manufacturers and importers of new planing vessels 12 feetto 26 feet in length with propellers aft of the transom to select and installone of several factory installed propeller injury avoidance methods;"(3) Require manufacturers and importers of new non-planing vessels12 feet in length and longer with propellers aft of the transom to selectand install one of several factory installed propeller injury avoidancemethods; and"(4) Require owners of all non-planing rental boats with propellers aftof the transom to install either a jet propulsion system or a propellerguard or all of several propeller injury avoidance measures." 66 Fed.Reg., at 63647.537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Courtessarily contains the best evidence of Congress' pre-emptiveintent." CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664(1993). Here, the express pre-emption clause in $ 10 appliesto "a [state or local] law or regulation." 46 U. S. C. $ 4306.We think that this language is most naturally read as notencompassing common-law claims for two reasons. First,the article "a" before "law or regulation" implies a discreteness--which is embodied in statutes and regulations--thatis not present in the common law. Second, because "a wordis known by the company it keeps," Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995), the terms "law" and "regulation"used together in the pre-emption clause indicate that Congress pre-empted only positive enactments. If "law" wereread broadly so as to include the common law, it might alsobe interpreted to include regulations, which would renderthe express reference to "regulation" in the pre-emptionclause superfluous.The Act's saving clause buttresses this conclusion. SeeGeier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S., at 867-868.It states that "[c]ompliance with this chapter or standards,regulations, or orders prescribed under this chapter does notrelieve a person from liability at common law or under Statelaw." $ 4311(g). As we held in Geier, the "saving clauseassumes that there are some significant number of commonlaw liability cases to save [and t]he language of the preemption provision permits a narrow reading that excludescommon-law actions." Id., at 868.The saving clause is also relevant for an independent reason. The contrast between its general reference to "liabilityat common law" and the more specific and detailed description of what is pre-empted by $ 10--including the exceptionfor state regulations addressing "uniquely hazardous conditions"--indicates that $ 10 was drafted to pre-empt performance standards and equipment requirements imposed bystatute or regulation.537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the CourtOur interpretation of the statute's language does notproduce anomalous results. It would have been perfectlyrational for Congress not to pre-empt common-law claims,which--unlike most administrative and legislative regulations--necessarily perform an important remedial rolein compensating accident victims. Cf. Silkwood v. KerrMcGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984). Indeed, compensa-tion is the manifest object of the saving clause, which focusesnot on state authority to regulate, but on preserving "liabil-ity at common law or under State law." In context, thisphrase surely refers to private damages remedies.10 Wethus agree with the Illinois Supreme Court's conclusion thatpetitioner's common-law tort claims are not expressly pre-empted by the FBSA.IVEven if $ 10 of the FBSA does not expressly pre-emptstate common-law claims, respondent contends that suchclaims are implicitly pre-empted by the entire statute, andmore specifically by the Coast Guard's decision not to regulate propeller guards. Both are viable pre-emption theories:"We have recognized that a federal statute implicitlyoverrides state law either when the scope of a statuteindicates that Congress intended federal law to occupya field exclusively,English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S.72, 78-79 (1990), or when state law is in actual conflictwith federal law. We have found implied conflict pre-emption where it is `impossible for a private party tocomply with both state and federal requirements,' id.,at 79, or where state law `stands as an obstacle to theaccomplishment and execution of the full purposes andobjectives of Congress.'Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.10 The FBSA itself imposes civil money penalties payable to the UnitedStates, as well as imprisonment for willful violations, 46 U. S. C. $ 4311,but does not authorize any private damages remedies for persons injuredby noncomplying operators, boats, or equipment.537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Court52, 67 (1941)." Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S.280, 287 (1995).Moreover, Congress' inclusion of an express pre-emptionclause "does not bar the ordinary working of conflict preemption principles," Geier, 529 U. S., at 869 (emphasis inoriginal), that find implied pre-emption "where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federalrequirements, or where state law stands as an obstacle tothe accomplishment and execution of the full purposes andobjectives of Congress." Freightliner Corp., 514 U. S., at287 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Weare not persuaded, however, that the FBSA has any suchpre-emptive effect.We first consider, and reject, respondent's reliance on theCoast Guard's decision not to adopt a regulation requiringpropeller guards on motorboats. It is quite wrong to viewthat decision as the functional equivalent of a regulation pro-hibiting all States and their political subdivisions from adopting such a regulation. The decision in 1990 to accept thesubcommittee's recommendation to "take no regulatory action," App. 80, left the law applicable to propeller guardsexactly the same as it had been before the subcommitteebegan its investigation. Of course, if a state common-lawclaim directly conflicted with a federal regulation promulgated under the Act, or if it were impossible to comply withany such regulation without incurring liability under statecommon law, pre-emption would occur. This, however, isnot such a case.Indeed, history teaches us that a Coast Guard decision notto regulate a particular aspect of boating safety is fully consistent with an intent to preserve state regulatory authoritypending the adoption of specific federal standards. Thatwas the course the Coast Guard followed in 1971 immediatelyafter the Act was passed, and again when it imposed its firstregulations in 1972 and 1973. The Coast Guard has nevertaken the position that the litigation of state common-law537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the Courtclaims relating to an area not yet subject to federal regula-tion would conflict with "the accomplishment and executionof the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Hines v.Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).The Illinois Supreme Court concluded "that the CoastGuard's failure to promulgate a propeller guard requirementhere equates to a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate pursuant to the policy of the FBSA." 197 Ill. 2d, at128, 757 N. E. 2d, at 85. With regard to policies defined byCongress, we have recognized that "a federal decision toforgo regulation in a given area may imply an authoritativefederal determination that the area is best left unregulated,and in that event would have as much pre-emptive force asa decision to regulate." Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp.v.Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 384 (1983);see also Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Bd., 330 U. S. 767, 774 (1947) (state law is pre-empted"where failure of the federal officials affirmatively to exercisetheir full authority takes on the character of a ruling that nosuch regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to thepolicy of the statute"). In this instance, however, the Illi-nois Supreme Court's conclusion does not accurately reflectthe Coast Guard's entire explanation for its decision:"The regulatory process is very structured and stringent regarding justification. Available propeller guardaccident data do not support imposition of a regulationrequiring propeller guards on motorboats. Regulatoryaction is also limited by the many questions aboutwhether a universally acceptable propeller guard isavailable or technically feasible in all modes of boat operation. Additionally, the question of retrofitting millions of boats would certainly be a major economic consideration." App. 80.This statement reveals only a judgment that the availabledata did not meet the FBSA's "stringent" criteria for federal537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Courtregulation. The Coast Guard did not take the further stepof deciding that, as a matter of policy, the States and theirpolitical subdivisions should not impose some version of pro-peller guard regulation, and it most definitely did not rejectpropeller guards as unsafe.11 The Coast Guard's apparentfocus was on the lack of any "universally acceptable" propeller guard for "all modes of boat operation." But nothing inits official explanation would be inconsistent with a tort verdict premised on a jury's finding that some type of propellerguard should have been installed on this particular kind ofboat equipped with respondent's particular type of motor.Thus, although the Coast Guard's decision not to require propeller guards was undoubtedly intentional and carefully con-sidered, it does not convey an "authoritative" message ofa federal policy against propeller guards. And nothing inthe Coast Guard's recent regulatory activities alters thisconclusion.The Coast Guard's decisionnot to impose a propeller guardrequirement presents a sharp contrast to the decision of theSecretary of Transportation that was given pre-emptive ef-fect inGeier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861(2000). As the Solicitor General had argued in that case,the promulgation of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard(FMVSS) 208 embodied an affirmative "policy judgment thatsafety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed al-ternative protection systems in their fleets rather than oneparticular system in every car." Id., at 881. In findingpre-emption, we expressly placed "weight upon the DOT'sinterpretation of FMVSS 208's objectives and its conclusion,as set forth in the Government's brief, that a tort suit suchas this one would ` " `stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplish11 Indeed, in response to the Propeller Guard Subcommittee's recommendation in favor of "educational and awareness campaigns," the CoastGuard indicated that it would publish a series of articles "aimed at avoiding boat/propeller strike accidents," which could include the topic of "available propeller guards."

Congresshas delegated to DOT authority to implement the statute;the subject matter is technical; and the relevant history andbackground are complex and extensive. The agency is likelyto have a thorough understanding of its own regulation andits objectives and is `uniquely qualified' to comprehend thelikely impact of state requirements." Id., at 883. In thecase before us today, the Solicitor General, joined by counselfor the Coast Guard, has informed us that the agency doesnot view the 1990 refusal to regulate or any subsequent regulatory actions by the Coast Guard as having any pre-emptive effect. Our reasoning inGeier therefore providesstrong support for petitioner's submission.VEven though the refusal to regulate propeller guards in1990 had no pre-emptive effect, it is possible that the statutory scheme as a whole implicitly pre-empted common-lawclaims such as petitioner's when it was enacted in 1971. Ifthat were so, the exemption carried forward by the Secre-tary in 1973 after the first federal regulations were adoptedmight have saved existing state common-law rules "in effecton the effective date" of the 1971 Act, so far as those rulesrelate to propeller guards. 38 Fed. Reg., at 6915. But evenif that is not the case, we think it clear that the FBSA didnot so completely occupy the field of safety regulation of rec-reational boats as to foreclose state common-law remedies.In Ray v.

S. 151 (1978), weconsidered a federal statute that directed the Secretary ofTransportation to determine "which oil tankers are suffi-ciently safe to be allowed to proceed in the navigable watersof the United States," and after inspection to certify "eachvessel as sufficiently safe to protect the marine environment." Id., at 163, 165. We held that this scheme of man-datory federal regulation implicitly pre-empted the power ofthe State of Washington "to exclude from Puget Sound ves537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 537 U. S. 51 (2002)Opinion of the Courtsels certified by the Secretary as having acceptable designcharacteristics, unless they satisfy the different and higherdesign requirements imposed by state law." Id., at 165.As we explained inUnited States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89(2000), the analysis in Ray was governed by field-pre-emption rules because the rules at issue were in a "field reserved for federal regulation" and "Congress ha[d] left noroom for state regulation of these matters." 529 U. S., at111. In particular, Title II of the Ports and WaterwaysSafety Act of 1972 (PWSA) required the Secretary to issue"such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of the covered vessels." 435 U. S., at 161.The Illinois Supreme Court relied on both Ray and Locketo find petitioner's claims impliedly pre-empted. But theFBSA, unlike Title II of the PWSA, does not require theCoast Guard to promulgate comprehensive regulations covering every aspect of recreational boat safety and design;nor must the Coast Guard certify the acceptability of everyrecreational boat subject to its jurisdiction. Moreover, neither Title II of the PWSA nor the holding in either Ray orLocke purported to pre-empt possible common-law claims,whereas the FBSA expressly preserves such claims.The FBSA might be interpreted as expressly occupyingthe field with respect to state positive laws and regulationsbut its structure and framework do not convey a "clear andmanifest" intent, English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72,79 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted),to go even further and implicitly pre-empt all state commonlaw relating to boat manufacture. Rather, our conclusionthat the Act's express pre-emption clause does not covercommon-law claims suggests the opposite intent. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 517 (1992); id.,at 547 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Nor is a clear and manifest intent to sweepaway state common law established by an unembellished537US1 Unit: $$U7 [04-14-04 19:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN70 SPRIETSMA v. MERCURY MARINEOpinion of the Courtstatement in a House Report that the 1971 Act "preemptsthe field on boating standards or regulations." H. R. Rep.No. 92-324, p. 11 (1971). The statement was made prior tothe amendment containing the saving clause, and nothing inthe entire report suggests that it meant the occupied "field"to include judge-made common law.Respondent ultimately relies upon one of the FBSA's maingoals: fostering uniformity in manufacturing regulations.Uniformity is undoubtedly important to the industry, and thestatute's pre-emption clause was meant to "assur[e] thatmanufacture for the domestic trade will not involve compli-ance with widely varying local requirements." S. Rep. 20.Yet this interest is not unyielding, as is demonstrated bothby the Coast Guard's early grants of broad exemptions forstate regulations and by the position it has taken in this liti-gation. Absent a contrary decision by the Coast Guard, theconcern with uniformity does not justify the displacement ofstate common-law remedies that compensate accident victims and their families and that serve the Act's more promi-nent objective, emphasized by its title, of promoting boating safety.The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.
