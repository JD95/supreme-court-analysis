The question we address iswhether statements the officer made to her therapist duringthe counseling sessions are protected from compelled disclo-sure in a federal civil action brought by the family of thedeceased. Stated otherwise, the question is whether it isappropriate for federal courts to recognize a "psychotherapist privilege" under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules ofEvidence.IPetitioner is the administrator of the estate of RickyAllen. Respondents are Mary Lu Redmond, a former policeofficer, and the Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, her em-ployer during the time that she served on the police force.1Petitioner commenced this action against respondents afterRedmond shot and killed Allen while on patrol duty.On June 27, 1991, Redmond was the first officer to respondto a "fight in progress" call at an apartment complex. Asshe arrived at the scene, two of Allen's sisters ran towardher squad car, waving their arms and shouting that therehad been a stabbing in one of the apartments. Redmondtestified at trial that she relayed this information to her dis-patcher and requested an ambulance. She then exited hercar and walked toward the apartment building. BeforeRedmond reached the building, several men ran out, onewaving a pipe. When the men ignored her order to get onthe ground, Redmond drew her service revolver. Two othermen then burst out of the building, one, Ricky Allen, chasingthe other. According to Redmond, Allen was brandishing abutcher knife and disregarded her repeated commands todrop the weapon. Redmond shot Allen when she believedhe was about to stab the man he was chasing. Allen diedat the scene. Redmond testified that before other officers1 Redmond left the police department after the events at issue in thislawsuit.518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT5Cite as: 518 U.

The complaint sought damages under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the Illinois wrongful-deathstatute, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 740, $ 180/1 et seq. (1994). Attrial, petitioner presented testimony from members of Allen's family that conflicted with Redmond's version of theincident in several important respects. They testified, forexample, that Redmond drew her gun before exiting hersquad car and that Allen was unarmed when he emergedfrom the apartment building.During pretrial discovery petitioner learned that after theshooting Redmond had participated in about 50 counselingsessions with Karen Beyer, a clinical social worker licensedby the State of Illinois and employed at that time by theVillage of Hoffman Estates. Petitioner sought access toBeyer's notes concerning the sessions for use in crossexamining Redmond. Respondents vigorously resisted thediscovery. They asserted that the contents of the conversations between Beyer and Redmond were protected againstinvoluntary disclosure by a psychotherapist-patient privilege. The district judge rejected this argument. NeitherBeyer nor Redmond, however, complied with his order todisclose the contents of Beyer's notes. At depositions andon the witness stand both either refused to answer certainquestions or professed an inability to recall details of theirconversations.In his instructions at the end of the trial, the judge advisedthe jury that the refusal to turn over Beyer's notes had no"legal justification" and that the jury could therefore presume that the contents of the notes would have been un518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT6 JAFFEE v.

Addressing the issue for the firsttime, the court concluded that "reason and experience," thetouchstones for acceptance of a privilege under Rule 501of the Federal Rules of Evidence, compelled recognition ofa psychotherapist-patient privilege.3 51 F. 3d 1346, 1355(1995). "Reason tells us that psychotherapists and patientsshare a unique relationship, in which the ability to communicate freely without the fear of public disclosure is the key tosuccessful treatment." Id., at 1355-1356. As to experience, the court observed that all 50 States have adoptedsome form of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Id., at1356. The court attached particular significance to the factthat Illinois law expressly extends such a privilege to socialworkers like Karen Beyer.4 Id., at 1357. The court alsonoted that, with one exception, the federal decisions rejecting the privilege were more than five years old and that the"need and demand for counseling services has skyrocketedduring the past several years." Id., at 1355-1356.2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 67.3 Rule 501 provides as follows: "Except as otherwise required by theConstitution of the United States or provided by Act of Congress or inrules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority,the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as theymay be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light ofreason and experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings, withrespect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law suppliesthe rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, Stateor political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance withState law."4 See Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act, Ill.

Id., at 1357. Balancing thoseconflicting interests, the court observed, on the one hand,that the evidentiary need for the contents of the confidentialconversations was diminished in this case because therewere numerous eyewitnesses to the shooting, and, on theother hand, that Officer Redmond's privacy interests weresubstantial.5 Id., at 1358. Based on this assessment, thecourt concluded that the trial court had erred by refusing toafford protection to the confidential communications betweenRedmond and Beyer.The United States Courts of Appeals do not uniformlyagree that the federal courts should recognize a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501.

" `For morethan three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public . . . has a right to every man'sevidence. When we come to examine the various claims ofexemption, we start with the primary assumption that thereis a general duty to give what testimony one is capable ofgiving, and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule.' " United States v. Bryan, 339 U. S. 323,331 (1950) (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2192, p. 64 (3ded. 1940)).8 See also United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,709 (1974). Exceptions from the general rule disfavoringtestimonial privileges may be justified, however, by a " `public good transcending the normally predominant principle ofutilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.' " Trammel, 445 U. S., at 50 (quoting Elkins v. United States, 364U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)).Guided by these principles, the question we address todayis whether a privilege protecting confidential communications between a psychotherapist and her patient "promotessufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for8 The familiar expression "every man's evidence" was a well-knownphrase as early as the mid-18th century.

Ibid. Treatment by aphysician for physical ailments can often proceed successfully on the basis of a physical examination, objective infor-mation supplied by the patient, and the results of diagnostictests. Effective psychotherapy, by contrast, depends uponan atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patientis willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts,emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psycho-therapists, disclosure of confidential communications madeduring counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or dis-grace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosuremay impede development of the confidential relationshipnecessary for successful treatment.9 As the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee observed in 1972 when itrecommended that Congress recognize a psychotherapistprivilege as part of the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence,a psychiatrist's ability to help her patients" `is completely dependent upon [the patients'] willing-ness and ability to talk freely. This makes it difficult ifnot impossible for [a psychiatrist] to function withoutbeing able to assure . . . patients of confidentiality and,indeed, privileged communication. Where there maybe exceptions to this general rule . . . , there is wideagreement that confidentiality is a sine qua non for suc-cessful psychiatric treatment.'

D. 183, 242 (1972)(quoting Group for Advancement of Psychiatry, ReportNo. 45, Confidentiality and Privileged Communication inthe Practice of Psychiatry 92 (June 1960)).By protecting confidential communications between a psy-chotherapist and her patient from involuntary disclosure, theproposed privilege thus serves important private interests.Our cases make clear that an asserted privilege must also"serv[e] public ends." Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S.383, 389 (1981). Thus, the purpose of the attorney-clientprivilege is to "encourage full and frank communication be-tween attorneys and their clients and thereby promotebroader public interests in the observance of law and admin-istration of justice."Ibid. And the spousal privilege, asmodified in Trammel, is justified because it "furthers the important public interest in marital harmony," 445 U. S., at 53.See alsoUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.

The psychotherapist privilege serves the public interest by facilitating the provisionof appropriate treatment for individuals suffering the effectsof a mental or emotional problem. The mental health of ourcitizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good oftranscendent importance.10In contrast to the significant public and private interestssupporting recognition of the privilege, the likely evidentiarybenefit that would result from the denial of the privilege ismodest. If the privilege were rejected, confidential conver10 This case amply demonstrates the importance of allowing individualsto receive confidential counseling.

Without a privilege, much ofthe desirable evidence to which litigants such as petitionerseek access--for example, admissions against interest by aparty--is unlikely to come into being. This unspoken "evi-dence" will therefore serve no greater truth-seeking functionthan if it had been spoken and privileged.That it is appropriate for the federal courts to recognize apsychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is confirmed by thefact that all 50 States and the District of Columbia haveenacted into law some form of psychotherapist privilege.11We have previously observed that the policy decisions of theStates bear on the question whether federal courts should11 Ala.

SeeTrammel, 445 U. S., at 48-50; United States v.Gillock, 445 U. S. 360, 368, n. 8 (1980). Because state legis-latures are fully aware of the need to protect the integrityof the factfinding functions of their courts, the existence of aconsensus among the States indicates that "reason and expe-rience" support recognition of the privilege. In addition,given the importance of the patient's understanding that hercommunications with her therapist will not be publicly disclosed, any State's promise of confidentiality would have lit-tle value if the patient were aware that the privilege wouldnot be honored in a federal court.12 Denial of the federalprivilege therefore would frustrate the purposes of the statelegislation that was enacted to foster these confidentialcommunications.It is of no consequence that recognition of the privilege inthe vast majority of States is the product of legislative actionrather than judicial decision. Although common-law rulingsmay once have been the primary source of new developmentsin federal privilege law, that is no longer the case. In Funkv. United States, 290 U. S. 371 (1933), we recognized that itis appropriate to treat a consistent body of policy determinations by state legislatures as reflecting both "reason" and"experience." Id., at 376-381. That rule is properly respectful of the States and at the same time reflects the factthat once a state legislature has enacted a privilege thereis no longer an opportunity for common-law creation of theprotection. The history of the psychotherapist privilegeillustrates the latter point. In 1972 the members of the12 At the outset of their relationship, the ethical therapist must discloseto the patient "the relevant limits on confidentiality."

Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D., at 242(citation omitted). The present unanimous acceptance of theprivilege shows that the state lawmakers moved quickly.That the privilege may have developed faster legislativelythan it would have in the courts demonstrates only that theStates rapidly recognized the wisdom of the rule as the fieldof psychotherapy developed.13The uniform judgment of the States is reinforced by thefact that a psychotherapist privilege was among the ninespecific privileges recommended by the Advisory Committeein its proposed privilege rules. InUnited States v. Gillock,445 U.

She nevertheless discounts the relevance of the stateprivilege statutes by pointing to divergence among the States concerningthe types of therapy relationships protected and the exceptions recognized. A small number of state statutes, for example, grant the privilegeonly to psychiatrists and psychologists, while most apply the protectionmore broadly. Compare Haw. Rules Evid. 504, 504.1 and N. D. Rule Evid.503 (privilege extends to physicians and psychotherapists), with Ariz. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 32-3283 (1992) (privilege covers "behavioral health professional[s]"); Tex. Rule Civ.

The range of exceptions recognized by the States is similarlyvaried. Compare Ark. Code Ann. $ 17-46-107 (1987) (narrow exceptions);Haw. Rules Evid. 504, 504.1 (same), with Cal. Evid. Code Ann. $$ 1016-1027 (West 1995) (broad exceptions); R. I. Gen. Laws $ 5-37.3-4 (1995)(same). These variations in the scope of the protection are too limited toundermine the force of the States' unanimous judgment that some form ofpsychotherapist privilege is appropriate.518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT15Cite as: 518 U.

In rejecting the proposeddraft that had specifically identified each privilege rule andsubstituting the present more open-ended Rule 501, the Senate Judiciary Committee explicitly stated that its action"should not be understood as disapproving any recognitionof a psychiatrist-patient . . . privileg[e] contained in the[proposed] rules." S. Rep. No. 93-1277, at 13.Because we agree with the judgment of the state legisla-tures and the Advisory Committee that a psychotherapistpatient privilege will serve a "public good transcending thenormally predominant principle of utilizing all rationalmeans for ascertaining truth," Trammel, 445 U. S., at 50, wehold that confidential communications between a licensedpsychotherapist and her patients in the course of diagnosisor treatment are protected from compelled disclosure underRule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.14IVAll agree that a psychotherapist privilege covers con-fidential communications made to licensed psychiatrists andpsychologists. We have no hesitation in concluding in thiscase that the federal privilege should also extend to confidential communications made to licensed social workers inthe course of psychotherapy. The reasons for recognizing aprivilege for treatment by psychiatrists and psychologistsapply with equal force to treatment by a clinical socialworker such as Karen Beyer.15 Today, social workers pro14 Like other testimonial privileges, the patient may of course waivethe protection.15 If petitioner had filed her complaint in an Illinois state court, respondents' claim of privilege would surely have been upheld, at least with respect to the state wrongful-death action.

Karen Beyer, having satisfied the strict standardsfor licensure, qualifies as a clinical social worker in Illinois. 51 F. 3d 1346,1358, n. 19 (CA7 1995).Indeed, if only a state-law claim had been asserted in federal court, thesecond sentence in Rule 501 would have extended the privilege to thatproceeding. We note that there is disagreement concerning the properrule in cases such as this in which both federal and state claims are asserted in federal court and relevant evidence would be privileged understate law but not under federal law. See C. Wright & K. Graham, 23Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5434 (1980). Because the parties do notraise this question and our resolution of the case does not depend on it,we express no opinion on the matter.16 The Judicial Conference Advisory Committee's proposed psychotherapist privilege defined psychotherapists as psychologists and medical doctors who provide mental health services. Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D., at240. This limitation in the 1972 recommendation does not counsel againstrecognition of a privilege for social workers practicing psychotherapy. Inthe quarter century since the Committee adopted its recommendations,much has changed in the domains of social work and psychotherapy. Seegenerally Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al. as AmiciCuriae 5-13 (and authorities cited). While only 12 States regulated socialworkers in 1972, all 50 do today. See American Association of State Social Work Boards, Social Work Laws and Board Regulations: A State Comparison Study 29, 31 (1996). Over the same period, the relative portionof therapeutic services provided by social workers has increased substantially. See U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for MentalHealth Services, Mental Health, United States, 1994, pp. 85-87, 107-114.518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT17Cite as: 518 U. S. 1 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsocial workers.17 We therefore agree with the Court ofAppeals that "[d]rawing a distinction between the counseling provided by costly psychotherapists and the counselingprovided by more readily accessible social workers servesno discernible public purpose." 51 F. 3d, at 1358, n. 19.We part company with the Court of Appeals on a separatepoint. We reject the balancing component of the privilegeimplemented by that court and a small number of States.18Making the promise of confidentiality contingent upon a trialjudge's later evaluation of the relative importance of the patient's interest in privacy and the evidentiary need for disclosure would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege.

REDMONDScalia, J., dissentingwe explained in Upjohn, if the purpose of the privilege is tobe served, the participants in the confidential conversation"must be able to predict with some degree of certaintywhether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but re-sults in widely varying applications by the courts, is littlebetter than no privilege at all." 449 U. S., at 393.These considerations are all that is necessary for decisionof this case. A rule that authorizes the recognition of newprivileges on a case-by-case basis makes it appropriate todefine the details of new privileges in a like manner. Be-cause this is the first case in which we have recognized apsychotherapist privilege, it is neither necessary nor feasibleto delineate its full contours in a way that would "govern allconceivable future questions in this area." Id., at 386.19VThe conversations between Officer Redmond and KarenBeyer and the notes taken during their counseling sessionsare protected from compelled disclosure under Rule 501 ofthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals is affirmed.
