This case presents the question whether a court reporteris absolutely immune from damages liability for failing toproduce a transcript of a federal criminal trial.IIn March 1986, after a 2-day trial, a jury convicted peti-tioner of bank robbery. Petitioner promptly appealed andordered a copy of the transcript from respondent Ruggen-berg, who had served as the court reporter. The court ordered Ruggenberg to produce a transcript by May 29, 1986.Over two years later, Ruggenberg had yet to provide atranscript, despite a long series of hearings, court orders,and new filing deadlines. In July 1988, Ruggenberg finallyexplained that she had lost many of her trial notes, thoughadditional notes and tapes were later to come to light. Atone point in the proceedings, Ruggenberg was fined and ar-rested as the Court of Appeals sought to obtain this andother overdue transcripts. Eventually, making use of Rug-genberg's partial notes and materials submitted by the parties pursuant to Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of AppellateProcedure,1 another reporter produced a partial transcript*Denise Meyer, Michael J. Brennan, Dennis E. Curtis, Judith Resnik,and Charles D. Weisselberg filed a brief for the National Association ofCriminal Defense Lawyers et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.Jeffrey P. Altman filed a brief for the National Court Reporters Association as amicus curiae urging affirmance.1 Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(c) provides in relevant part:"Statement on the evidence or proceedings when no report was madeor when the transcript is unavailable.--If no report of the evidence orproceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable,the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedingsfrom the best available means, including the appellant's recollection."508us2$88z 02-13-97 19:56:42 PAGES OPINPGT431Cite as: 508 U.

See generally Ratteray,Verbatim Reporting Comes of Age, 56 Judicature 368 (1973).It was not until the late 19th century that official court reporters began to appear in state courts. Id., at 368-369.Prior to enactment of the Court Reporter Act in 1944,6 thefederal system did not provide for official court reporting.7Court reporters were not among the class of persons protected by judicial immunity in the 19th century.85 For purposes of immunity, we have not distinguished actions broughtunder 42 U.

The practicehas been for the parties to agree that a designated person shall so report.The one selected must be paid by private arrangement with one or moreof the parties to the litigation. The amount paid to him is not costs inthe cause nor taxable as such against any of the parties." Miller v.United States, 317 U.

BYERS & ANDERSON, INC.Opinion of the CourtFaced with the absence of a common-law tradition involving court reporters themselves, respondents urge us to treatas their historical counterparts common-law judges whomade handwritten notes during trials. We find the analogyunpersuasive. The function performed by judicial notetakers at common law is significantly different from that performed by court reporters today. Whereas court reportersare charged by statute with producing a "verbatim" transcript of each session of the court, for inclusion in the officialrecord, 28 U. S. C. $ 753(b), common-law judges exercise discretion and judgment in deciding exactly what, and howmuch, they will write. Early judicial notetakers, for instance, left records from which the "narrative of the trialcannot be reconstructed"; their notes were for their own purposes in charging the jury and were never entered into thepublic record. Langbein, Shaping the Eighteenth-CenturyCriminal Trial: A View from the Ryder Sources, 50 U. Chi.L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (1983).9tion from a road tax is not in fact exempt, or that one arrested is in defaultfor not having worked out the assessment; to members of a township boardin deciding upon the allowance of claims; to arbitrators, and to the collector of customs in exercising his authority to sell perishable property,and in fixing upon the time for notice of sale.' Id., at 410-411 (footnotesomitted)."As is evident from the foregoing catalog, judicial immunity extendednot only to public officials but also to private citizens (in particular jurorsand arbitrators); the touchstone for its applicability was performance ofthe function of resolving disputes between parties, or of authoritativelyadjudicating private rights." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 499-500(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).9 Indeed, the doctrine of judicial immunity was recognized in part toavoid imposing on judges the obligation to make complete trial transcripts."If upon such allegations a judge could be compelled to answer in a civilaction for his judicial acts, not only would his office be degraded and hisusefulness destroyed, but he would be subjected for his protection to thenecessity of preserving a complete record of all the evidence producedbefore him in every litigated case, and of the authorities cited and arguments presented, in order that he might be able to show to the judgebefore whom he might be summoned by the losing party . . . that he had508us2$88z 02-13-97 19:56:43 PAGES OPINPGT435Cite as: 508 U. S. 429 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThere is a second problem with respondents' theory.Even had common-law judges performed the functions of acourt reporter, that would not end the immunity inquiry. Itwould still remain to consider whether judges, when performing that function, were themselves entitled to absoluteimmunity. We do not doubt that judicial notetaking as it iscommonly practiced is protected by absolute immunity, be-cause it involves the kind of discretionary decisionmakingthat the doctrine of judicial immunity is designed to protect.But if we could imagine a hypothetical case in which acommon-law judge felt himself bound to transcribe an entireproceeding verbatim, it is far less clear--and neither respondent refers us to any case law suggesting--that thisadministrative duty would be similarly protected. Indeed,we have recently held that judges are not entitled to absoluteimmunity when acting in their administrative capacity.Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229 (1988).We are also unpersuaded by the contention that our "functional approach" to immunity, see Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.,at 486, requires that absolute immunity be extended to courtreporters because they are "part of the judicial function,"see 950 F. 2d, at 1476. The doctrine of judicial immunity issupported by a long-settled understanding that the inde-pendent and impartial exercise of judgment vital to the judiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential damagesliability.10 Accordingly, the "touchstone" for the doctrine'sapplicability has been "performance of the function of resolvdecided as he did with judicial integrity . . . ." Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall.335, 349 (1872).10 "For it is a general principle of the highest importance to the properadministration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authorityvested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequences to himself. Liability to answer to everyone who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge, would beinconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy thatindependence without which no judiciary can be either respectable oruseful." Id., at 347. See also Mireles v. Waco, 502 U. S. 9, 10 (1991), andcases cited therein.508us2$88z 02-13-97 19:56:43 PAGES OPINPGT436 ANTOINE v. BYERS & ANDERSON, INC.Opinion of the Courting disputes between parties, or of authoritatively adjudicat-ing private rights." 500 U. S., at 500 (Scalia, J., concurringin judgment in part and dissenting in part). When judicialimmunity is extended to officials other than judges, it is be-cause their judgments are "functional[ly] comparab[le]" tothose of judges--that is, because they, too, "exercise a dis-cretionary judgment" as a part of their function. Imbler v.Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 423, n. 20. Cf. Westfall v. Erwin,484 U. S. 292, 297-298 (1988) (absolute immunity from statelaw tort actions available to executive officials only whentheir conduct is discretionary).The function performed by court reporters is not in thiscategory. As noted above, court reporters are required bystatute to "recor[d] verbatim" court proceedings in their entirety. 28 U. S. C. $ 753(b). They are afforded no discretionin the carrying out of this duty; they are to record, as accurately as possible, what transpires in court. See McLallenv.Henderson, 492 F. 2d 1298, 1299 (CA8 1974) (court reporters not absolutely immune "because their duties are ministe-rial, not discretionary, in nature");Waterman v. State, 35Misc. 2d 954, 957, 232 N. Y. S. 2d 22, 26 (Ct. Cl. 1962), aff 'din part, rev'd in part, 241 N. Y. S. 2d 314 (4th Dept., App.Div. 1963) (same).11 We do not mean to suggest that thetask is less than difficult, or that reporters who do it well areless than highly skilled. But the difficulty of a job does notby itself make it functionally comparable to that of a judge.Cf. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986) (police officernot entitled to absolute immunity for conduct involved inapplying for warrant). Nor is it sufficient that the task of acourt reporter is extremely important or, in the words of the11 "A court stenographer, notwithstanding the fact that he is an officerof the court, by the very nature of his work performs no judicial function.His duties are purely ministerial and administrative; he has no power ofdecision. The doctrine [of judicial immunity] has no application to thefacts with which we are confronted here." Waterman, 35 Misc. 2d, at 957,232 N. Y.

As we explained in Forrester, some ofthe tasks performed by judges themselves, "even thoughthey may be essential to the very functioning of the courts,have not . . . been regarded as judicial acts." 484 U. S.,at 228. In short, court reporters do not exercise the kindof judgment that is protected by the doctrine of judicialimmunity.Finally, respondents argue that strong policy reasons support extension of absolute immunity to court reporters. According to respondents, given the current volume of litigation in the federal courts, some reporters inevitably will beunable to meet deadlines. Absolute immunity would help toprotect the entire judicial process from vexatious lawsuitsbrought by disappointed litigants when this happens. Requiring court reporters to defend against allegations likethose asserted here, on the other hand, would not only beunfair, but would also aggravate the problem by contributing further to the caseload in the federal courts.Assuming the relevance of respondents' policy arguments,we find them unpersuasive for three reasons. First, our understanding is that cases of this kind are relatively rare. Respondents have not provided us with empirical evidencedemonstrating the existence of any significant volume of vexatious and burdensome actions against reporters, even in theCircuits in which reporters are not absolutely immune. Seen. 3, supra. Second, if a large number of cases does materialize, and we have misjudged the significance of this burden,then a full review of the countervailing policy considerationsby the Congress may result in appropriate amendment tothe Court Reporter Act. Third, and most important, wehave no reason to believe that the Federal Judiciary, whichsurely is familiar with the special virtues and concerns of thecourt reporting profession, will be unable to administer justice to its members fairly.508us2$88z 02-13-97 19:56:43 PAGES OPINPGT438 ANTOINE v.

Argued April 19, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993*The Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753 (1916 Act), among other things,authorized any national bank doing business in a community with a population not exceeding 5,000 to act as the agent for any insurance company. Although early editions of the United States Code included thisprovision as section 92 of Title 12 (section 92), the 1952 Code and subsequent editions omitted section 92 with a note indicating that Congresshad repealed it in 1918. Nevertheless, interpreting section 92 to permitbanks located in small communities to sell insurance outside those communities, petitioner Comptroller of the Currency ruled in 1986 that petitioner national bank could sell insurance through its branch in a smallOregon town to customers nationwide. Respondents, various trade organizations representing insurance agents, brought this suit challengingthe Comptroller's decision as inconsistent with section 92's terms. TheDistrict Court disagreed with that assertion and granted summaryjudgment for petitioners, noting that section 92 apparently was inadvertently repealed in 1918, but expressing the view that the provisionexists "in proprio vigore." Respondents did not challenge section 92'svalidity in the District Court or the Court of Appeals, despite the lattercourt's invitation to do so at oral argument. Only after that court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue did respondents even urge thecourt to resolve the question, while still taking no position on the merits.In reversing and remanding with instructions to enter judgment forrespondents, the Court of Appeals found first that, though the partieshad not on their own questioned section 92's validity, the court had aduty to do so, and, second, that the relevant statutes, traditionally construed, demonstrated that section 92 was repealed in 1918.Held:1. The Court of Appeals had discretion to consider the validity ofsection 92, and under the circumstances did not abuse it. There is nodoubt that the court had before it an Article III case or controversy*Together with No. 92-507, Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, et al.v.

AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Syllabusinvolving section 92's status. Though the parties did not lock hornsover that issue, they did clash over whether the Comptroller properlyrelied on section 92 as authority for his ruling. A court properly presented with an issue is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but retains the independent power to identifyand apply the proper construction of governing law, Kamen v. KemperFinancial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99, even where that constructionis that a law does not govern because it is not in force, cf. Cohens v.Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 405 (Marshall, C. J.). Nor did prudence obligethe court below to treat the unasserted argument that section 92 hadbeen repealed as having been waived, since a court may consider anissue antecedent to and ultimately dispositive of the dispute before it,even if the parties fail to identify and brief the issue. Arcadia v. OhioPower Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77. The court was asked to construe a statutory provision that the Code's keepers had suggested was no longer inforce, on appeal from a District Court justifying its reliance on the lawby the logic that, despite its "inadverten[t] repea[l]," section 92 remained in effect of its own force. After giving the parties ample opportunity to address the issue, the court acted without any impropriety inrefusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation on the question oflaw as to section 92's validity. Pp. 445-448.2. Section 92 was not repealed in 1918. Despite its omission fromthe Code, section 92 must remain on the books if the Statutes at Large,which provides "the legal evidence of laws" under 1 U. S. C. $ 112, sodictates. Viewed in isolation, the deployment of certain quotationmarks in the 1916 Act appears to support the argument, adopted by theCourt of Appeals and pressed by respondents, that the Act places section 92 in Rev. Stat. $ 5202, and that section 92 was subsequently repealed when the War Finance Corporation Act, ch. 45, 40 Stat. 506 (1918Act), eliminated the relevant portion of $ 5202. An examination of thestructure, language, and subject matter of the relevant statutes, however, provides overwhelming evidence that, despite the placement of thequotation marks in question, the 1916 Act placed section 92 not in Rev.Stat. $ 5202, but in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act. Since the 1918 Actdid not touch $ 13, it did not affect, much less repeal, section 92. Itwould appear that the misplacement of the quotation marks in the 1916Act was a simple scrivener's error by someone unfamiliar with the law'sobject and design. Courts should disregard punctuation, or repunctuate, if necessary to render the true meaning of a statute. Hammock v.Loan & Trust Co., 105 U. S. 77, 84-85. Pp. 448-463.293 U. S. App. D.

These cases present the unlikely question whether Congress repealed that provision in1918. We hold that no repeal occurred.IAlmost 80 years ago, Congress authorized any nationalbank "doing business in any place the population of whichdoes not exceed five thousand inhabitants . . . [to] act as theagent for any fire, life, or other insurance company." Act ofSept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753. In the first compilation of theUnited States Code, this provision appeared as section 92 ofTitle 12. See 12 U. S. C. $ 92 (1926 ed.); see also UnitedStates Code editions of 1934, 1940, and 1946. The 1952edition of the Code, however, omitted the insurance provision, with a note indicating that Congress had repealed it#John J. Gill III, Michael F. Crotty, Richard M.

Though theprovision has also been left out of the subsequent editionsof the United States Code, including the current one (eachcontaining in substance the same note that appeared in 1952,see United States Code editions of 1958, 1964, 1970, 1976,1982, and 1988), the parties refer to it as "section 92," and sowill we.Despite the absence of section 92 from the Code, Congresshas assumed that it remains in force, on one occasion actuallyamending it.

Theregulators concerned with the provision's subject, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, havelikewise acted on the understanding that section 92 remains1 The note states that "[t]he provisions of this section, which were addedto R. S. $ 5202 by act Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 461, 39 Stat. 753, were omitted inthe amendment of R.

We do not know what prompted the 1952codifiers to reverse the judgment of their predecessors. The 1952 codifiers' decision, along with legislation that treated section 92 as valid law,apparently prompted a House of Representatives Committee to take alook at the status of section 92 in 1957. See Financial Institutions Act of1957: Hearings on S. 1451 and H. R. 7206 before the House Committee onBanking and Currency, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 989-990, 1010-1025,1036-1040, 1060-1071 (1957). After hearing conflicting testimony, theCommittee took no action. See id., at 1090, 1199. Several years later,congressional staffers explored the issue again and concluded, with thecodifiers, that Congress had repealed section 92 in 1918.

S. C. $ 706(2)(A). Respondents argued,2 Courts too, including this one, have assumed the validity of section 92.See Commissioner v. First Security Bank of Utah, N. A., 405 U.

AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the Courtamong other things, that the ruling was inconsistent withsection 92, which respondents maintained permits nationalbanks located in small communities to sell insurance only tocustomers in those communities. The District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment for the federal parties and the Bank, a defendant-intervenor, on the groundthat the Comptroller's interpretation was "rational and consistent with [section 92]." National Assn. of Life Underwriters v. Clarke, 736 F. Supp. 1162, 1173 (1990) (internalquotation marks and citation omitted). The District Courtthought it "worth noting that this section no longer appearsin the United States Code" as it "apparently was inadvertently repealed" in 1918; but because Congress, the Comptroller, and other courts have presumed its continuing validity,the court was content to assume that the provision exists "inproprio vigore," meaning, we take it, of its own force. Id.,at 1163, n. 2.Respondents had not asked the District Court to rule thatsection 92 no longer existed, and they took the same tackbefore the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, merely noting in their opening brief that section 92 mayhave been repealed in 1918 and then stating that all the relevant players had assumed its validity. The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, directed the parties to be prepared toaddress the status of section 92 at oral argument, and afteroral argument (at which respondents' counsel declined toargue that the provision was no longer in force) ordered supplemental briefing on the issue. In their supplemental brief,respondents urged the court to decide the question, but tookno position on whether section 92 was valid law. The Courtof Appeals did decide the issue, reversing the DistrictCourt's decision and remanding with instructions to enterjudgment for respondents. The court found first that,though the parties had not on their own questioned the validity of section 92, the court had a "duty" to do so, Independent508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT445Cite as: 508 U.

Judge Silberman, dissenting, would have affirmedwithout addressing the validity of section 92, an issue hethought was not properly before the court. Id., at 413-416,955 F. 2d, at 741-744. The Court of Appeals denied respondents' suggestion for rehearing en banc, with several judgesfiling separate statements. See 296 U. S. App. D. C. 115, 965F. 2d 1077 (1992).The Bank and the federal parties separately petitioned forcertiorari, both petitions presenting the question whethersection 92 remains in force and the Bank presenting the additional question whether the Court of Appeals properly ad-dressed the issue. Because of a conflict on the importantquestion whether section 92 is valid law, see American LandTitle Assn. v. Clarke, 968 F. 2d 150, 151-154 (CA2 1992), cert.pending, Nos. 92-482, 92-645, we granted the petitions. 506U. S. 1032 (1992). We now reverse.IIBefore turning to the status of section 92, we address theBank's threshold question, whether the Court of Appealserred in considering the issue at all. Respondents did notchallenge the validity of section 92 before the District Court;they did not do so in their opening brief in the Court ofAppeals or, despite the court's invitation, at oral argument.Not until the Court of Appeals ordered supplementalbriefing on the status of section 92 did respondents even urgethe court to resolve the issue, while still taking no positionon the merits. The Bank contends that the Court of Appeals lacked the authority to consider whether section 92remains the law and, alternatively, that it abused its discretion in doing so. There is no need to linger long overeither argument.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT446 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the Court"The exercise of judicial power under Art. III of the Con-stitution depends on the existence of a case or controversy,"and "a federal court [lacks] the power to render advisoryopinions."Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975); seealso Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 97 (1968). The Bank maintains that there was no case or controversy about the valid-ity of section 92, and that in resolving the status of the provision the Court of Appeals violated the Article III prohibitionagainst advisory opinions.There is no doubt, however, that from the start respond-ents' suit was the "pursuance of an honest and actual antagonistic assertion of rights by one [party] against another,"Muskrat v. United States, 219 U. S. 346, 359 (1911) (internalquotation marks and citation omitted), that "valuable legalrights . . . [would] be directly affected to a specific and substantial degree" by a decision on whether the Comptroller'sruling was proper and lawful, Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co.v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 262 (1933), and that the Court ofAppeals therefore had before it a real case and controversyextending to that issue. Though the parties did not lockhorns over the status of section 92, they did clash overwhether the Comptroller properly relied on section 92 as authority for his ruling, and "[w]hen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retainsthe independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law," Kamen v. Kemper FinancialServices, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99 (1991), even where the properconstruction is that a law does not govern because it is notin force. "The judicial Power" extends to cases "arisingunder . . . the Laws of the United States," Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1,and a court properly asked to construe a law has the constitutional power to determine whether the law exists, cf.Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 405 (1821) ("[I]f, in any controversy depending in a court, the cause should depend onthe validity of such a law, that would be a case arising under508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT447Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthe constitution, to which the judicial power of the UnitedStates would extend") (Marshall, C. J.). The contrary conclusion would permit litigants, by agreeing on the legal issuepresented, to extract the opinion of a court on hypotheticalActs of Congress or dubious constitutional principles, anopinion that would be difficult to characterize as anythingbut advisory.Nor did prudence oblige the Court of Appeals to treat theunasserted argument that section 92 had been repealed ashaving been waived. Respondents argued from the start,as we noted, that section 92 was not authority for the Comptroller's ruling, and a court may consider an issue "antecedent to . . . and ultimately dispositive of " the dispute beforeit, even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief. Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77 (1990); cf. CardinalChemical Co. v. Morton Int'l, Inc., ante, at 88-89, n. 9 (addressing a legal question as to which the parties agreed onthe answer). The omission of section 92 from the UnitedStates Code, moreover, along with the codifiers' indicationthat the provision had been repealed, created honest doubtabout whether section 92 existed as law, and a court "neednot render judgment on the basis of a rule of law whosenonexistence is apparent on the face of things, simply because the parties agree upon it." United States v. Burke,504 U. S. 229, 246 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).While the Bank says that by initially accepting the widespread assumption that section 92 remains in force, respondents forfeited their right to have the Court of Appeals consider whether the law exists, "[t]here can be no estoppel inthe way of ascertaining the existence of a law," South Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 260, 267 (1877). In addressing thestatus of section 92, the Court of Appeals did not stray beyond its constitutional or prudential boundaries.The Court of Appeals, accordingly, had discretion to consider the validity of section 92, and under the circumstancesdid not abuse it. The court was asked to determine under508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT448 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the Courtthe APA whether the Comptroller's ruling was in accordancewith a statutory provision that the keepers of the UnitedStates Code had suggested was no longer in force, on appealfrom a District Court justifying its reliance on the law bythe logic that, despite its "inadverten[t] repea[l]," section 92remained in effect of its own force. 736 F. Supp., at 1163,n. 2. After giving the parties ample opportunity to addressthe issue, the Court of Appeals acted without any impropri-ety in refusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation ona question of law. Cf. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co.,243 U. S. 281, 289 (1917). We need not decide whether theCourt of Appeals had, as it concluded, a "duty" to addressthe status of section 92 (which would imply error in decliningto do so), for the court's decision to consider the issue wascertainly no abuse of its discretion.IIIAThough the appearance of a provision in the current edition of the United States Code is "prima facie" evidence thatthe provision has the force of law, 1 U. S. C. $ 204(a), it isthe Statutes at Large that provides the "legal evidence oflaws," $ 112, and despite its omission from the Code section92 remains on the books if the Statutes at Large so dictates.3Cf. United States v. Welden, 377 U. S. 95, 98, n. 4 (1964);Stephan v. United States, 319 U. S. 423, 426 (1943) (per curiam). The analysis that underlies our conclusion that section 92 is valid law calls for familiarity with several provisions appearing in the Statutes at Large. This sectionprovides the necessary statutory background.3 When Congress has enacted a title of the Code as positive law (as ithas done, for instance, with Title 11, the Bankruptcy Code, see $ 101, 92Stat. 2549), the text of the Code provides "legal evidence of the laws." 1U. S. C. $ 204(a). But Congress has not enacted as positive law Title 12,in which section 92 for a time appeared.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT449Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThe background begins in 1863 and 1864, when the CivilWar Congress enacted and then reenacted the National BankAct, which launched the modern national banking system byproviding for federal chartering of private commercial banksand empowering the newly created national banks to issueand accept a uniform national currency. Act of Feb. 25,1863, ch. 58, 12 Stat. 665; Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, 13 Stat.99; see E. Symons, Jr., & J. White, Banking Law 22-25 (3ded. 1991); see also 12 U. S. C. $ 38. In a section importantfor these cases, the National Bank Act set limits on theindebtedness of national banks, subject to certain exceptions.See $ 42, 12 Stat. 677 (1863 Act); $ 36, 13 Stat. 110 (1864 Act).Ten years later, Congress adopted the indebtedness provision again as part of the Revised Statutes of the UnitedStates, a massive revision, reorganization, and reenactmentof all statutes in effect at the time, accompanied by a simultaneous repeal of all prior ones. Rev. Stat. $$ 1-5601 (1874);see also Dwan & Feidler, The Federal Statutes--Their History and Use, 22 Minn. L. Rev. 1008, 1012-1015 (1938).4Title 62 of the Revised Statutes, containing $$ 5133 through5243, included the Nation's banking laws, and, with a fewstylistic alterations, the National Bank Act's indebtednessprovision became $ 5202 of the Revised Statutes:Sec. 5202. No association shall at any time be indebted, or in any way liable, to an amount exceeding theamount of its capital stock at such time actually paid4 The 1874 edition of the Revised Statutes marked the last time Congress codified United States laws by reenacting all of them. An 1878edition of the Revised Statutes updated the original Revised Statutes, butwas not enacted as positive law. See Act of Mar. 9, 1878, ch. 26, 20 Stat.27; Act of Mar. 2, 1877, ch. 82, 19 Stat. 268. In 1919, the House Committeeon the Revision of the Laws of the United States began work on whateventually became the United States Code, the first edition of which waspublished in 1926. See 44 Stat., pt. 1; Dwan & Feidler, 22 Minn. L. Rev.,at 1018-1021.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT450 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS.

The amendmentwas a detail of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (FederalReserve Act or 1913 Act), which created Federal Reservebanks and the Federal Reserve Board and required thenational banks formed pursuant to the National Bank Actto become members of the new Federal Reserve System.Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251; see P. Studenski& H. Krooss, Financial History of the United States 255-262 (2d ed. 1963). The amendment came in $ 13 of the 1913Act, the first five paragraphs of which set forth the powers ofthe new Federal Reserve banks, such as the authority toaccept and discount various forms of notes and commercialpaper, including those issued by national banks. FederalReserve Act, $ 13, 38 Stat. 263-264.

Unlike the1913 Act, the 1916 Act employed quotation marks, and thosequotation marks proved critical to the Court of Appeals'sfinding that the 1916 Act placed section 92 in Rev. Stat.$ 5202. After amending $ 11 of the Federal Reserve Act, the1916 Act provided, without quotation marks,[t]hat section thirteen be, and is hereby, amended toread as follows:Ibid. Then followed within quotation marks several para-graphs that track the first five paragraphs of $ 13 of the 1913Act, the modifications generally expanding the powers ofFederal Reserve banks.

The second-to-last paragraph just quotedis the first appearance of the provision eventually codified as12 U. S. C. $ 92. After the quotation marks closed, the 1916Act went on to amend $ 14 of the Federal Reserve Act, introducing the amendment with a phrase not surrounded by quo-tation marks and then placing the revised language of $ 14within quotation marks. 39 Stat. 754. The pattern was re-peated for amendments of $$ 16, 24, and 25 of the FederalReserve Act. Id., at 754-756.The final relevant statute is the War Finance CorporationAct, ch. 45, 40 Stat. 506 (1918 Act), which in $ 20 amendedRev.

BThe argument that section 92 is no longer in force, adoptedby the Court of Appeals and pressed here by respondents, is508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT454 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the Courtsimply stated: the 1916 Act placed section 92 in Rev. Stat.$ 5202, and the 1918 Act eliminated all of Rev. Stat. $ 5202except the indebtedness provision (to which it added a sixthexception), thus repealing section 92. Our discussion beginswith the first premise of that argument, and there it ends,for we conclude with petitioners that the 1916 Act placedsection 92 not in Rev. Stat. $ 5202 but in $ 13 of the FederalReserve Act; since the 1918 Act did not touch $ 13, it did notaffect, much less repeal, section 92.A reader following the path of punctuation of the 1916 Actwould no doubt arrive at the opposite conclusion, that thestatute added section 92 to Rev. Stat. $ 5202. The 1916 Actreads, without quotation marks, Section fifty-two hundredand two of the Revised Statutes of the United States ishereby amended so as to read as follows.6 39 Stat. 753.That phrase is followed by a colon and then opening quotation marks; closing quotation marks do not appear until sev-eral paragraphs later, and the paragraph that was later codified as 12 U. S. C. $ 92 is one of those within the opening andclosing quotation marks. The unavoidable inference fromfamiliar rules of punctuation is that the 1916 Act placed sec-tion 92 in Rev. Stat. $ 5202.A statute's plain meaning must be enforced, of course, andthe meaning of a statute will typically heed the commandsof its punctuation. But a purported plain-meaning analysisbased only on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runsthe risk of distorting a statute's true meaning. Along withpunctuation, text consists of words living "a communal existence," in Judge Learned Hand's phrase, the meaning ofeach word informing the others and "all in their aggregatetak[ing] their purport from the setting in which they areused."NLRB v. Federbush Co., 121 F. 2d 954, 957 (CA26 Because the placement of quotation marks is crucial in these cases, thequotations in the text from the 1916 and 1913 Acts appear in italics so asnot to introduce quotation marks absent from the Statutes at Large.

Over and over we have stressed that "[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence ormember of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the wholelaw, and to its object and policy." United States v. Heirs ofBoisdore', 8 How. 113, 122 (1849) (quoted in more than a dozencases, most recently Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 35(1990)); see also King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,221 (1991). No more than isolated words or sentences ispunctuation alone a reliable guide for discovery of a statute'smeaning. Statutory construction "is a holistic endeavor,"United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood ForestAssociates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988), and, at a minimum,must account for a statute's full text, language as well aspunctuation, structure, and subject matter.Here, though the deployment of quotation marks in the1916 Act points in one direction, all of the other evidencefrom the statute points the other way. It points so certainly,in our view, as to allow only the conclusion that the punctuation marks were misplaced and that the 1916 Act put section92 not in Rev. Stat. $ 5202 but in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.7The first thing to notice, we think, is the 1916 Act's structure. The Act begins by stating [t]hat the Act entitled7 Contrary to respondents' argument, the Marshall Field doctrine doesnot preclude us from asking whether the statute means something otherthan what the punctuation dictates. The Marshall Field doctrine, indeed, is irrelevant to this case. In Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143U. S. 649, 672 (1892), the Court stated that a law consists of the "enrolledbill," signed in open session by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, see also 1 U. S. C. $ 106, but thereis no doubt in these cases that the 1916 Act as printed in the Statutes atLarge is identical to the enrolled bill. The Marshall Field doctrine concerns " `the nature of the evidence' the Court [may] consider in determining whether a bill had actually passed Congress," United States v. MunozFlores, 495 U. S. 385, 391, n. 4 (1990) (quoting Marshall Field, supra, at670); it places no limits on the evidence a court may consider in determining the meaning of a bill that has passed Congress.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT456 UNITED STATES NAT.

Of the seven phrases, only the third doesnot in terms refer to a section of the Federal Reserve Act.Congress, to be sure, was free to take a detour from its workon the Federal Reserve Act to revise the Revised Statutes.But if Congress had taken that turn, one would expect sometextual indication of the point where once its work on Rev.Stat. $ 5202 was done it returned to revision of the FederalReserve Act. None of the directory phrases that follow thephrase mentioning Rev. Stat. $ 5202, however, refers back tothe Federal Reserve Act. The failure of the fourth phrase,for example, to say something like "subsection (e) of sectionfourteen of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is herebyamended" suggests that the Congress never veered from itsoriginal course, that the object of the 1916 Act was singlemindedly to revise sections of the Federal Reserve Act, andthat amending the Revised Statutes was beyond the 1916law's scope.Further evidence that the 1916 Act amended only the Federal Reserve Act comes from the 1916 Act's title: An Act Toamend certain sections of the Act entitled "Federal reserveAct," approved December twenty-third, nineteen hundredand thirteen. During this era the titles of statutes that revised pre-existing laws appear to have typically mentionedeach of the laws they revised. See, e. g., Act of Sept. 26,1918, ch. 177, 40 Stat. 967 ("An Act to amend and reenactsections four, eleven, sixteen, nineteen, and twenty-two ofthe Act approved December twenty-third, nineteen hundredand thirteen, and known as the Federal reserve Act, and sections fifty-two hundred and eight and fifty-two hundred andnine, Revised Statutes"). Cf. ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 ("Federal508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT458 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the CourtReserve Act"). Absent a comprehensive review it is impos-sible to know the extent of exceptions to this general rule, ifany, and we would not cast aside the 1916 Act's punctuationbased solely on the Act's title. Nevertheless, the omissionof the Revised Statutes from the 1916 Act's title does providesupporting evidence for the inference from the Act's struc-ture, that the Act did not amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. Cf.INSv. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S.183, 189 (1991) (titles within a statute "can aid in resolvingan ambiguity in the legislation's text").One must ask, however, why the 1916 Act stated thatSection fifty-two hundred and two of the Revised Statutes of theUnited States is hereby amended so as to read as follows, 39Stat. 753, if it did not amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. The answeremerges from comparing the 1916 Act with the statute thatall agree it did amend, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, andnoticing that the identical directory phrase appeared in $ 13of the 1913 Act, which did amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. As enacted in 1913, $ 13 contained several paragraphs grantingpowers to Federal Reserve banks; it then included a paragraph amending Rev. Stat. $ 5202 (by adding a fifth exceptionto the indebtedness limit for "[l]iabilities incurred under theprovisions of the Federal Reserve Act"), a paragraph thatbegan Section fifty-two hundred and two of the Revised Statutes of the United States is hereby amended so as to read asfollows. 38 Stat. 264. The 1916 Act, in the portion following the phrase introducing a revision of $ 13 of the 1913 Act,proceeded in the same manner. It contained several paragraphs granting powers to Federal Reserve banks, paragraphs that are somewhat revised versions of the ones thatappeared in the 1913 Act, followed by the phrase introducingan amendment to Rev. Stat. $ 5202 and then the language ofRev. Stat. $ 5202 as it appeared in the 1913 Act. The similarity of the language of the 1916 and 1913 Acts suggeststhat, in order to amend $ 13 in 1916, Congress restated the1913 version of $ 13 in its entirety, revising the portion it508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT459Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)Opinion of the Courtintended to change and leaving the rest unaltered, includingthe portion that had amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202.9In defending the Court of Appeals's contrary conclusionthat the 1916 Act amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202, respondentsargue that any other reading would render meaningless thelanguage in the 1916 Act that purports to amend that sectionof the Revised Statutes. But the 1916 Congress would havehad good reason to carry forward that portion of the 1913Act containing Rev. Stat. $ 5202, even though in 1916 it didnot intend to amend it any further. The 1916 Act revised$ 13 of the 1913 Act by completely restating it with a mixtureof old and new language (providing that $ 13 is amended "toread as follows," 39 Stat. 752), and a failure to restate Rev.Stat. $ 5202 with its 1913 amendment could have been takento indicate its repeal.The final and decisive evidence that the 1916 Act placedsection 92 in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act rather thanRev. Stat. $ 5202 is provided by the language and subjectmatter of section 92 and the paragraphs surrounding it, para-graphs within the same opening and closing quotation marks.In the paragraph preceding section 92, the 1916 Act grantedthe Federal Reserve Board authority to regulate thediscount and rediscount and the purchase and sale byany Federal reserve bank of any bills receivable and ofdomestic and foreign bills of exchange, and of accept-ances authorized bythis Act . . . .39 Stat. 753 (emphasis added). "[T]his Act" must mean theFederal Reserve Act, since it was $ 13 of the Federal Re9 A comparison of the layout of the two Acts supplies further supportfor the conclusion that the 1916 Act restated the 1913 Act in full, and didnot newly amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. With one exception, a paragraphbreak separates each of the introductory phrases in the 1916 Act from thetext that follows within quotation marks. The exception is the phrasementioning Rev. Stat. $ 5202, the text within quotation marks followingon the same line after only a space. That, significantly, is precisely thelayout of the amendment to Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in $ 13 of the 1913 Act.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT460 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the Courtserve Act that granted banks the authority to discount andrediscount. Use of "this Act" in the discount-and-rediscountparagraph is powerful proof that the 1916 Act placed thatparagraph in the Act to which it necessarily refers, the Federal Reserve Act. That is crucial because section 92 travelstogether with the paragraphs that surround it; neither thelanguage nor, certainly, the punctuation of the 1916 Act justifies separating them. Because the 1916 Act placed the para-graph preceding section 92 in $ 13 of the Federal ReserveAct, it follows that the 1916 Act placed section 92 there too.We are not persuaded by respondents' argument that theterm "this Act" in the discount-and-rediscount paragraph isan antecedent reference to "the Federal reserve Act," whichis mentioned in the prior paragraph (in the fifth exceptionclause of Rev. Stat. $ 5202). 39 Stat. 753; see also 38 Stat.264 (1913 Act). If respondents are right, then the 1916 Actmay be read as placing the discount-and-rediscount paragraph (and section 92, which necessarily accompanies it) inRev. Stat. $ 5202. But while the antecedent interpretationis arguable as construing "this Act" in the discount-andrediscount paragraph, that reading cannot attach to the otheruses of "this Act" in the 1916 Act, see 39 Stat. 752, 753, 754,since none is within the vicinity of a reference to the FederalReserve Act. Presumptively, " `identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the samemeaning,' " Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries,Inc., ante, at 159 (quoting Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932)), and since nothingrebuts that presumption here, we are of the view that eachuse of "this Act" in the 1916 Act refers to the Act in whichthe language is contained. Rather than aiding respondents,then, the single full reference to "the Federal reserve Act"in the portion of the 1916 Act that amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202cuts against them. The fact that it was not repeated in thenext paragraph confirms that the statute's quotation of Rev.Stat. $ 5202 had ended.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT461Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)Opinion of the CourtFinally, the subject matter of the discount-and-rediscountparagraph (located, again, within the same opening and closing quotation marks as section 92) confirms that the 1916 Actplaced section 92 in the Federal Reserve Act. The discountand-rediscount paragraph subjects certain powers of FederalReserve banks to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.The logic of locating this provision in the Federal ReserveAct is obvious, whereas there would have been no reasonfor Congress to place it in Rev. Stat. $ 5202, which narrowlyaddressed the indebtedness of national banks, or even in theNational Bank Act (from which Rev. Stat. $ 5202 derived),which concerned not public Federal Reserve banks or theFederal Reserve Board, but private national banks. Simi-larly, the paragraph following section 92, which authorizesFederal Reserve banks to acquire foreign drafts or bills ofexchange from member banks and subjects transactions involving foreign acceptances to Federal Reserve Board regu-lations, fits far more comfortably with $ 13 of the FederalReserve Act than with Rev. Stat. $ 5202. While we do notdisagree with respondents insofar as they assert that Congress could have placed section 92, granting powers of insurance agency to some national banks (and without mentioningFederal Reserve banks or the Federal Reserve Board), inRev. Stat. $ 5202, Congress could also reasonably have dealtwith the insurance provision as part of the Federal ReserveAct, which Congress had before it for amendment in 1916.There is no need to break that tie, however, because there isno way around the conclusion that the 1916 Act placed sec-tion 92 in the same statutory location as it must have placedits neighbors, in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.1010 Respondents point out that it would not have been absurd for Congress to have amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1916 Act.We agree, and of course there is no dispute that Congress three yearsearlier amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1913 Act. Bothdrafting choices strike us as odd, though neither would be without plausible reason. The 1913 Congress might well have thought it convenient to508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT462 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENTINS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.Opinion of the CourtAgainst the overwhelming evidence from the structure,language, and subject matter of the 1916 Act there standsonly the evidence from the Act's punctuation, too weak totrump the rest. In these unusual cases, we are convincedthat the placement of the quotation marks in the 1916 Actwas a simple scrivener's error, a mistake made by someoneunfamiliar with the law's object and design. Courts, wehave said, should "disregard the punctuation, or repunctuate, if need be, to render the true meaning of the statute."Hammock v. Loan & Trust Co., 105 U. S. 77, 84-85 (1882)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The truemeaning of the 1916 Act is clear beyond question, and sowe repunctuate. The 1916 Act should be read as if closingquotation marks do not appear at the end of the paragraphbefore the phrase Section fifty-two hundred and two ofthe Revised Statutes of the United States is hereby amendedso as to read as follows, 39 Stat. 753, and as if the openingquotation marks that immediately follow that phrase insteadprecede it. Accordingly, the 1916 Act placed within $ 13of the Federal Reserve Act each of the paragraphs betweenthe phrases that introduce the amendments to $$ 13 and 14of the Federal Reserve Act, including the paragraph thatwas later codified as 12 U. S. C. $ 92. Because the 1918 Actdid not amend the Federal Reserve Act, it did not repealadd the exception from Rev. Stat. $ 5202's indebtedness limit for "[l]iabilities incurred under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act" immediately after the language in the Federal Reserve Act that could result inthe liabilities of concern, language that authorized national banks to acceptcertain drafts and bills of exchange. 38 Stat. 264. And the 1916 Congress could conceivably have found it similarly convenient to amend Rev.Stat. $ 5202, which appeared in the Act it was amending at the time. Thepoint of our analysis, however, is not that Congress could not possiblyhave amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1916 Act, but that thebest reading of the Act, despite the punctuation marks, is that Congressdid something else.508us2$89M 02-13-97 20:20:44 PAGES OPINPGT463Cite as: 508 U.
