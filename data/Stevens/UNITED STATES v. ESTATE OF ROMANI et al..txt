The federal priority statute, 31 U. S. C. $ 3713(a), providesthat a claim of the United States Government "shall be paidfirst" when a decedent's estate cannot pay all of its debts.1The question presented is whether that statute requires thata federal tax claim be given preference over a judgmentcreditor's perfected lien on real property even though sucha preference is not authorized by the Federal Tax Lien Actof 1966, 26 U.

The judgment was recorded in the clerk's officeand therefore, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, it becamea lien on all of the defendant's real property in CambriaCounty. Thereafter, the Internal Revenue Service filed aseries of notices of tax liens on Mr. Romani's property. Theclaims for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties described inthose notices amounted to approximately $490,000.When Mr. Romani died on January 13, 1992, his entire estate consisted of real estate worth only $53,001. Becausethe property was encumbered by both the judgment lien andthe federal tax liens, the estate's administrator sought permission from the Court of Common Pleas to transfer theproperty to the judgment creditor, Romani Industries, in lieuof execution. The Federal Government acknowledged thatits tax liens were not valid as against the earlier judgmentlien; but, giving new meaning to Franklin's aphorism that "inthis world nothing can be said to be certain, except deathand taxes," 2 it opposed the transfer on the ground that thepriority statute ($ 3713) gave it the right to "be paid first."The Court of Common Pleas overruled the Government'sobjection and authorized the conveyance. The SuperiorCourt of Pennsylvania affirmed, and the Supreme Court ofthe State also affirmed. 547 Pa. 41, 688 A. 2d 703 (1997).That court first determined that there was a "plain inconsistency" between $ 3713, which appears to give the UnitedStates "absolute priority" over all competing claims, and theTax Lien Act of 1966, which provides that the federal taxlien "shall not be valid" against judgment lien creditors untila prescribed notice has been given. Id., at 45, 688 A. 2d,2 Letter of Nov. 13, 1789, to Jean Baptiste Le Roy, in 10 Writings ofBenjamin Franklin 69 (A. Smyth ed. 1907). As is often the case, the original meaning of the aphorism is clarified somewhat by its context: "Ournew Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promisespermanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, exceptdeath and taxes."

We granted certiorari,521 U.

It is therefore appropriate to comment on the Pennsylvania lien statuteand the Federal Tax Lien Act before considering the applicability of the priority statute to property encumbered by anantecedent judgment creditor's lien.The Pennsylvania statute expressly provides that a judg-ment shall create a lien against real property when it is recorded in the county where the property is located. 42 Pa.Cons. Stat. $ 4303(a) (1995). After the judgment has beenrecorded, the judgment creditor has the same right to noticeof a tax sale as a mortgagee.4 The recording in one countydoes not, of course, create a lien on property located else-where. In this case, however, it is undisputed that the judgment creditor acquired a valid lien on the real property in4 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has elaborated:"We must now decide whether judgment creditors are also entitled topersonal or general notice by the [County Tax Claim] Bureau as a matterof due process of law."Judgment liens are a product of centuries of statutes which authorizea judgment creditor to seize and sell the land of debtors at a judicial saleto satisfy their debts out of the proceeds of the sale. The judgment represents a binding judicial determination of the rights and duties betweenthe parties, and establishes their debtor-creditor relationship for all theworld to notice when the judgment is recorded in a Prothonotary's Office.When entered of record, the judgment also operates as a lien upon all realproperty of the debtor in that county."

RomaniIndustries' lien was "perfected in the sense that there isnothing more to be done to have a choate lien--when theidentity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, andthe amount of the lien are established." United States v.City of New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84 (1954); see also Illinoisex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U. S. 362, 375 (1946).The Federal Government's right to a lien on a delinquenttaxpayer's property has been a part of our law at least since1865.5 Originally the lien applied, without exception, to allproperty of the taxpayer immediately upon the neglect orfailure to pay the tax upon demand.6 An unrecorded taxlien against a delinquent taxpayer's property was valid evenagainst a bona fide purchaser who had no notice of the lien.United States v. Snyder, 149 U. S. 210, 213-215 (1893). In1913, Congress amended the statute to provide that the fed5 The post-Civil War Reconstruction Congress imposed a tax of threecents per pound on "the producer, owner, or holder" of cotton and a lienon the cotton until the tax was paid. Act of July 13, 1866, $ 1, 14 Stat. 98.The same statute also imposed a general lien on all of a delinquent taxpayer's property, see $ 9, 14 Stat. 107, which was nearly identical to a provision in the revenue Act of Mar. 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 470-471, quoted in n. 6,infra.6 The 1865 revenue Act contained the following sentence: "And if anyperson, bank, association, company, or corporation, liable to pay any duty,shall neglect or refuse to pay the same after demand, the amount shall bea lien in favor of the United States from the time it was due until paid,with the interests, penalties, and costs that may accrue in addition thereto,upon all property and rights to property; and the collector, after demand,may levy or by warrant may authorize a deputy collector to levy upon allproperty and rights to property belonging to such person, bank, association, company, or corporation, or on which the said lien exists, for thepayment of the sum due as aforesaid, with interest and penalty for nonpayment, and also of such further sum as shall be sufficient for the fees,costs, and expenses of such levy." 13 Stat. 470-471.

Act of June 29, 1939, $ 401, 53 Stat.882-883. The Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 again broad-ened that protection to encompass a variety of additionalsecured transactions, and also included detailed provisionsprotecting certain secured interests even when a notice ofthe federal lien previously has been filed. 80 Stat. 1125-1132, as amended, 26 U. S. C. $ 6323.In sum, each time Congress revisited the federal tax lien,it ameliorated its original harsh impact on other securedcreditors of the delinquent taxpayer.7 In this case, it isagreed that by the terms of $ 6323(a), the Federal Government's liens are not valid as against the lien created by theearlier recording of Romani Industries' judgment.IIIThe text of the priority statute on which the Governmentplaces its entire reliance is virtually unchanged since itsenactment in 1797.8 As we pointed out in United States v.7 For a more thorough description of the early history and of Congress'reactions to this Court's tax lien decisions, see Kennedy, The RelativePriority of the Federal Government: The Pernicious Career of the Inchoate and General Lien, 63 Yale L.

S. 517 (1998)Opinion of the CourtMoore, 423 U. S. 77 (1975), not only were there earlier ver-sions of the statute,9 but "its roots reach back even furtherinto the English common law," id., at 80. The sovereignprerogative that was exercised by the English Crown and bymany of the States as "an inherent incident of sovereignty,"ibid., applied only to unsecured claims. As Justice Brandeisnoted in Marshall v. New York, 254 U. S. 380, 384 (1920),the common-law priority "[did] not obtain over a specific liencreated by the debtor before the sovereign undertakes toenforce its right." Moreover, the statute itself does not cre-ate a lien in favor of the United States.10 Given this background, respondent argues that the statute should be read asbe first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall be deemed toextend, as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient propertyto pay all his debts, shall make a voluntary assignment thereof, or in whichthe estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor, shallbe attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall be committed." Compare $ 3466 of the Revised Statutes withthe present statute quoted in n. 1, supra.It has long been settled that the federal priority covers the Government's claims for unpaid taxes. Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 499-502 (1926); Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611, 625-626, andn. 24 (1948).9 "The earliest priority statute was enacted in the Act of July 31, 1789,1 Stat. 29, which dealt with bonds posted by importers in lieu of paymentof duties for release of imported goods. It provided that the `debt due tothe United States' for such duties shall be discharged first `in all cases ofinsolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administratorsshall be insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased . . . .' $ 21,1 Stat. 42.

S., at 81.10 "In construing the statutes on this subject, it has been stated by thecourt, on great deliberation, that the priority to which the United Statesare entitled, does not partake of the character of a lien on the property ofpublic debtors. This distinction is always to be recollected." UnitedStates v. Hooe, 3 Cranch 73, 90 (1805).523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANIOpinion of the Courtgiving the United States a preference over other unsecuredcreditors but not over secured creditors.11There are dicta in our earlier cases that support this con-tention as well as dicta that tend to refute it. Perhaps thestrongest support is found in Justice Story's statement:"What then is the nature of the priority, thus limitedand established in favour of the United States? Is it aright, which supersedes and overrules the assignment ofthe debtor, as to any property which the United Statesmay afterwards elect to take in execution, so as to pre-vent such property from passing by virtue of such assignment to the assignees? Or, is it a mere right ofprior payment, out of the general funds of the debtor, inthe hands of the assignees? We are of opinion that itclearly falls, within the latter description. The language employed is that which naturally would be em-ployed to express such an intent; and it must be strainedfrom its ordinary import, to speak any other." Conardv.Atlantic Ins. Co. of N. Y., 1 Pet. 386, 439 (1828).Justice Story's opinion that the language employed in thestatute "must be strained" to give it any other meaning isentitled to special respect because he was more familiar with18th-century usage than judges who view the statute from a20th-century perspective.We cannot, however, ignore the Court's earlier judgmentin Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat., at 426, or the more recentdicta in United States v. Key, 397 U. S., at 324-325. In Thelusson, the Court held that the priority statute gave theUnited States a preference over the claim of a judgmentcreditor who had a general lien on the debtor's real property.11 Although this argument was not presented to the state courts, respondent may defend the judgment on a ground not previously raised.Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468-469, n. 12 (1983). We will rarelyconsider such an argument, however. Ibid.; see also Matsushita Elec.Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.

S. 517 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe Court's brief opinion 12 is subject to the interpretationthat the statutory priority always accords the Governmenta preference over judgment creditors. For two reasons, wedo not accept that reading of the opinion.First, as a factual matter, in 1817 when the case was decided, there was no procedure for recording a judgment andthereby creating a choate lien on a specific parcel of realestate. See generally 2 L. Dembitz, A Treatise on LandTitles in the United States $ 127, pp. 948-952 (1895). Notwithstanding the judgment, a bona fide purchaser couldhave acquired the debtor's property free from any claimsof the judgment creditor. See Semple v. Burd, 7 Serg. &Rawle 286, 291 (Pa. 1821) ("The prevailing object of the Legislature, has uniformly been, to support the security of ajudgment creditor, by confirming his lien, except when itinterferes with the circulation of property by embarrassinga fair purchaser"). That is not the case with respect to12 The relevant portion of the opinion reads, in full, as follows:"These [statutory] expressions are as general as any which could havebeen used, and exclude all debts due to individuals, whatever may be theirdignity. . . . The law makes no exception in favour of prior judgment creditors; and no reason has been, or we think can be, shown to warrant thiscourt in making one.". . . The United States are to be first satisfied; but then it must be outof the debtor's estate. If, therefore, before the right of preference hasaccrued to the United States, the debtor has made a bona fide conveyanceof his estate to a third person, or has mortgaged the same to secure adebt; or if his property has been seized under a fi. fa., the property isdevested out of the debtor, and cannot be made liable to the United States.A judgment gives to the judgment creditor a lien on the debtor's lands,and a preference over all subsequent judgment creditors. But the act ofcongress defeats this preference in favour of the United States, in thecases specified in the 65th section of the act of 1799." Thelusson v. Smith,2 Wheat. 396, 425-426 (1817).In the later Conard case, Justice Story apologized for Thelusson: "Thereasons for that opinion are not, owing to accidental circumstances, asfully given as they are usually given in this Court." Conard v. AtlanticIns. Co. of N. Y., 1 Pet. 386, 442 (1828).523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANIOpinion of the CourtRomani Industries' choate lien on the property in CambriaCounty.Second, and of greater importance, in his opinion for theCourt in the Conard case, which was joined by Justice Washington, the author of Thelusson,13 Justice Story explainedwhy that holding was fully consistent with his interpretationof the text of the priority statute:"The real ground of the decision, was, that the judgmentcreditor had never perfected his title, by any executionand levy on the Sedgely estate; that he had acquired notitle to the proceeds as his property, and that if the proceeds were to be deemed general funds of the debtor,the priority of the United States to payment had attached against all other creditors; and that a mere po-tential lien on land, did not carry a legal title to theproceeds of a sale, made under an adverse execution.This is the manner in which this case has been understood, by the Judges who concurred in the decision; andit is obvious, that it established no such proposition, asthat a specific and perfected lien, can be displaced by themere priority of the United States; since that priorityis not of itself equivalent to a lien." Conard, 1 Pet.,at 444.14The Government also relies upon dicta from our opinion inUnited States v. Key, 397 U. S., at 324-325, which quotedfrom our earlier opinion in United States v. Emory, 314 U. S.,at 433: "Only the plainest inconsistency would warrant our13 Justice Washington's opinion for this Court in Thelusson affirmed, andwas essentially the same as, his own opinion delivered in the Circuit Courtas a Circuit Justice. 2 Wheat., at 426, n. h.14 Relying on this and several other cases, in 1857 the Attorney Generalof the United States issued an opinion concluding that Thelusson "hasbeen distinctly overruled" and that the priority of the United States underthis statute "will not reach back over any lien, whether it be general orspecific." 9 Op. Atty. Gen. 28, 29. See also Kennedy 908-911 (advancingthis same interpretation of the early priority Act decisions).523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN529Cite as: 523 U. S. 517 (1998)Opinion of the Courtfinding an implied exception to the operation of so clear acommand as that of [$ 3713]." Because bothKey and Emorywere cases in which the competing claims were unsecured,the statutory command was perfectly clear even under Justice Story's construction of the statute. The statementsmade in that context, of course, shed no light on the clarityof the command when the United States relies on the statuteas a basis for claiming a preference over a secured creditor.Indeed, theKey opinion itself made this specific point: "Thiscase does not raise the question, never decided by this Court,whether $ 3466 grants the Government priority over theprior specific liens of secured creditors. See United Statesv. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U. S. 361, 365-366 (1953)."397 U. S., at 332, n. 11.The Key opinion is only one of many in which the Courthas noted that despite the age of the statute, and despite thefact that it has been the subject of a great deal of litigation,the question whether it has any application to antecedentperfected liens has never been answered definitively. SeeUnited States v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351, 358, n. 8 (1964) (citing cases). In his dissent in United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., 345 U. S. 361 (1953), Justice Frankfurter referredto the Court's reluctance to decide the issue "not only todaybut for almost a century and a half." 345 U. S., at 367.The Government's priority as against specific, perfectedsecurity interests is, if possible, even less settled with regardto real property. The Court has sometimes concluded thata competing creditor who has not "divested" the debtor of"either title or possession" has only a "general, unperfectedlien" that is defeated by the Government's priority. E. g.,id., at 366. Assuming the validity of this "title or possession" test for deciding whether a lien on personal propertyis sufficiently choate for purposes of the priority statute (aquestion of federal law, see Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U. S., at 371), we are not aware of any decisionssince Thelusson applying that theory to claims for real prop523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN530 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANIOpinion of the Courterty, or of any reason to require a lienor or mortgagee toacquire possession in order to perfect an interest in realestate.Given the fact that this basic question of interpretationremains unresolved, it does not seem appropriate to view theissue in this case as whether the Tax Lien Act of 1966 hasimplicitly amended or repealed the priority statute. In-stead, we think the proper inquiry is how best to harmonizethe impact of the two statutes on the Government's powerto collect delinquent taxes.IVIn his dissent from a particularly harsh application of thepriority statute, Justice Jackson emphasized the importanceof considering other relevant federal policies. Joined bythree other Justices, he wrote:"This decision announces an unnecessarily ruthless in-terpretation of a statute that at its best is an arbitraryone. The statute by which the Federal Governmentgives its own claims against an insolvent priority overclaims in favor of a state government must be appliedby courts, not because federal claims are more meritorious or equitable, but only because that Government hasmore power. But the priority statute is an assertion offederal supremacy as against any contrary state policy.It is not a limitation on the Federal Government itself,not an assertion that the priority policy shall prevailover all other federal policies. Its generalities shouldnot lightly be construed to frustrate a specific policyembodied in a later federal statute."Massachusetts v.United States, 333 U. S. 611, 635 (1948).On several prior occasions the Court had followed this ap-proach and concluded that a specific policy embodied in alater federal statute should control our construction of thepriority statute, even though it had not been expressly523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 523 U. S. 517 (1998)Opinion of the Courtamended. Thus, in Cook County Nat. Bank v. UnitedStates, 107 U. S. 445, 448-451 (1883), the Court concludedthat the priority statute did not apply to federal claimsagainst national banks because the National Bank Act comprehensively regulated banks' obligations and the distribu-tion of insolvent banks' assets. And inUnited States v.Guaranty Trust Co. of N. Y., 280 U. S. 478, 485 (1930), wedetermined that the Transportation Act of 1920 had effec-tively superseded the priority statute with respect to federalclaims against the railroads arising under that Act.The bankruptcy law provides an additional context inwhich another federal statute was given effect despite thepriority statute's literal, unconditional text. The early fed-eral bankruptcy statutes had accorded to " `all debts due tothe United States, and all taxes and assessments under thelaws thereof ' " a preference that was "coextensive" with thatestablished by the priority statute. Guarantee Title &Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., 224 U. S. 152, 158(1912) (quoting the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, Rev. Stat.$ 5101). As such, the priority Act and the bankruptcy laws"were to be regarded as in pari materia, and both wereunqualified; . . . as neither contained any qualification, nonecould be interpolated." 224 U. S., at 158. The BankruptcyAct of 1898, however, subordinated the priority of the Fed-eral Government's claims (except for taxes due) to certainother kinds of debts. This Court resolved the tension be-tween the new bankruptcy provisions and the priority statute by applying the former and thus treating the Govern-ment like any other general creditor.Id., at 158-160; Davisv. Pringle, 268 U. S. 315, 317-319 (1925).1515 Congress amended the priority statute in 1978 to make it expresslyinapplicable to Title 11 bankruptcy cases. Pub. L. 95-598, $ 322(b), 92Stat. 2679, codified in 31 U. S. C. $ 3713(a)(2). The differences betweenthe bankruptcy laws and the priority statute have been the subject ofcriticism: "[A]s a result of the continuing discrepancies between the bankruptcy and insolvency rules, some creditors have had a distinct incentive523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANIOpinion of the CourtThere are sound reasons for treating the Tax Lien Act of1966 as the governing statute when the Government is claiming a preference in the insolvent estate of a delinquent tax-payer. As was the case with the National Bank Act, theTransportation Act of 1920, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,the Tax Lien Act is the later statute, the more specific statute, and its provisions are comprehensive, reflecting an obvi-ous attempt to accommodate the strong policy objections tothe enforcement of secret liens. It represents Congress' de-tailed judgment as to when the Government's claims for unpaid taxes should yield to many different sorts of interests(including, for instance, judgment liens, mechanic's liens, andattorney's liens) in many different types of property (includ-ing, for example, real property, securities, and motor vehicles). See 26 U. S. C. $ 6323. Indeed, given our unambigu-ous determination that the federal interest in the collectionof taxes is paramount to its interest in enforcing otherclaims, see United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S.,at 733-735, it would be anomalous to conclude that Congressintended the priority statute to impose greater burdens onthe citizen than those specifically crafted for tax collectionpurposes.Even before the 1966 amendments to the Tax Lien Act,this Court assumed that the more recent and specific provisions of that Act would apply were they to conflict with theolder priority statute. In theGilbert Associates case, whichconcerned the relative priority of the Federal Governmentand a New Hampshire town to funds of an insolvent tax-payer, the Court first considered whether the town couldqualify as a "judgment creditor" entitled to preference underthe Tax Lien Act. 345 U. S., at 363-364. Only after deciding that question in the negative did the Court conclude thatto throw into bankruptcy a debtor whose case might have been handled,with less expense and less burden on the federal courts, in another formof proceeding."

S. 517 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe United States obtained preference by operation of thepriority statute.Id., at 365-366. The Government wouldnow portray Gilbert Associates as a deviation from twoother relatively recent opinions in which the Court held thatthe priority statute was not trumped by provisions of otherstatutes: United States v. Emory, 314 U. S., at 429-433 (theNational Housing Act), andUnited States v. Key, 397 U. S.,at 324-333 (Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act). In each ofthose cases, however, there was no "plain inconsistency" between the commands of the priority statute and the otherfederal Act, nor was there reason to believe that applicationof the priority statute would frustrate Congress' intent.Id., at 329. The same cannot be said in the present suit.The Government emphasizes that when Congressamended the Tax Lien Act in 1966, it declined to enact theAmerican Bar Association's proposal to modify the federalpriority statute, and Congress again failed to enact a similarproposal in 1970. Both proposals would have expressly provided that the Government's priority in insolvency does notdisplace valid liens and security interests, and thereforewould have harmonized the priority statute with the TaxLien Act. See Hearings on H. R. 11256 and 11290 beforethe House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong., 2dSess., 197 (1966) (hereinafter Hearings); S. 2197, 92d Cong.,1st Sess. (1971). But both proposals also would have significantly changed the priority statute in many other respects to follow the priority scheme created by the bankruptcy laws. See Hearings, at 85, 198; Plumb 10, n. 53,33-37. The earlier proposal may have failed because itswide-ranging subject matter was beyond the House Waysand Means Committee's jurisdiction. Id., at 8. The failureof the 1970 proposal in the Senate Judiciary Committee--explained by no reports or hearings--might merely reflectdisagreement with the broad changes to the priority statute,or an assumption that the proposal was not needed because,as Justice Story had believed, the priority statute does not523US2 Unit: $U56 [04-29-00 18:24:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 UNITED STATES v. ESTATE OF ROMANIOpinion of the Courtapply to prior perfected security interests, or any number ofother views. Thus, the Committees' failures to report theproposals to the entire Congress do not necessarily indicatethat any legislator thought that the priority statute shouldsupersede the Tax Lien Act in the adjudication of federal taxclaims. They provide no support for the hypothesis thatboth Houses of Congress silently endorsed that position.The actual measures taken by Congress provide a superiorinsight regarding its intent. As we have noted, the 1966amendments to the Tax Lien Act bespeak a strong condem-nation of secret liens, which unfairly defeat the expectationsof innocent creditors and frustrate "the needs of our citizensfor certainty and convenience in the legal rules governingtheir commercial dealings." 112 Cong. Rec. 22227 (1966)(remarks of Rep. Byrnes); cf. United States v. Speers, 382U. S. 266, 275 (1965) (referring to the "general policy againstsecret liens"). These policy concerns shed light on how Con-gress would want the conflicting statutory provisions to beharmonized:"Liens may be a dry-as-dust part of the law, but they arenot without significance in an industrial and commercialcommunity where construction and credit are thought tohave importance. One does not readily impute to Con-gress the intention that many common commercial liensshould be congenitally unstable." E. Brown, The Su-preme Court, 1957 Term--Foreword: Process of Law, 72Harv. L. Rev. 77, 87 (1958) (footnote omitted).In sum, nothing in the text or the long history of interpreting the federal priority statute justifies the conclusion thatit authorizes the equivalent of a secret lien as a substitutefor the expressly authorized tax lien that Congress has said"shall not be valid" in a case of this kind.The judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court isaffirmed.
