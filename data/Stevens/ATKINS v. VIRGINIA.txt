Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's re-quirements for criminal responsibility should be tried andpunished when they commit crimes. Because of their disa-bilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of theirimpulses, however, they do not act with the level of moralculpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminalconduct.

Lynaugh, 492 U. S.302 (1989), the American public, legislators, scholars, andjudges have deliberated over the question whether the deathpenalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal. The consensus reflected in those deliberations informsour answer to the question presented by this case: whethersuch executions are "cruel and unusual punishments" prohib-ited by the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.IPetitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduc-tion, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced todeath. At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, At-kins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on hisperson, drove him to an automated teller machine in hispickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal ofadditional cash, then took him to an isolated location wherehe was shot eight times and killed.Jones and Atkins both testified in the guilt phase of Atkins' trial.1 Each confirmed most of the details in the oth-er's account of the incident, with the important exceptionthat each stated that the other had actually shot and killedNesbitt. Jones' testimony, which was both more coherentand credible than Atkins', was obviously credited by the juryand was sufficient to establish Atkins' guilt.2 At the penalty1 Initially, both Jones and Atkins were indicted for capital murder. Theprosecution ultimately permitted Jones to plead guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for his testimony against Atkins. As a result of the plea,Jones became ineligible to receive the death penalty.2 Highly damaging to the credibility of Atkins' testimony was its substantial inconsistency with the statement he gave to the police upon hisarrest. Jones, in contrast, had declined to make an initial statement tothe authorities.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN308 ATKINS v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtphase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: futuredangerousness and "vileness of the offense." To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins' prior felonyconvictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlierrobberies and assaults. To prove the second aggravator, theprosecution relied upon the trial record, including picturesof the deceased's body and the autopsy report.In the penalty phase, the defense relied on one witness,Dr. Evan Nelson, a forensic psychologist who had evaluatedAtkins before trial and concluded that he was "mildly mentally retarded." 3 His conclusion was based on interviewswith people who knew Atkins,4 a review of school and court3 The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) definesmental retardation as follows: "Mental retardation refers to substantiallimitations in present functioning. It is characterized by significantlysubaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with relatedlimitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas:communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, selfdirection, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.Mental retardation manifests before age 18." Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).The American Psychiatric Association's definition is similar: "The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage generalintellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significantlimitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the followingskill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonalskills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academicskills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B). The onset mustoccur before age 18 years (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has manydifferent etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the centralnervous system." Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000). "Mild" mental retardation is typically used todescribe people with an IQ level of 50-55 to approximately 70. Id., at42-43.4 The doctor interviewed Atkins, members of his family, and deputiesat the jail where he had been incarcerated for the preceding 18 months.Dr. Nelson also reviewed the statements that Atkins had given to thepolice and the investigative reports concerning this case.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN309Cite as: 536 U.

E. 2d 445 (1999). At the resentencing, Dr. Nelsonagain testified. The State presented an expert rebuttal wit-ness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion thatAtkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of "aver-age intelligence, at least," and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.6 App. 476. The jury again sen-tenced Atkins to death.5 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test(WAIS-III), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning. AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra. TheWAIS-III is scored by adding together the number of points earned ondifferent subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this rawscore into a scaled score. The test measures an intelligence range from45 to 155. The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a personreceiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitivefunctioning. A. Kaufman & E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAIS-IIIAssessment 60 (1999). It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent ofthe population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typicallyconsidered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of themental retardation definition. 2 Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds. 7th ed. 2000).At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: "[Atkins'] full scale IQis 59. Compared to the population at large, that means less than onepercentile. . . . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing. It's aboutone percent of the population." App. 274. According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins' IQ score "would automatically qualify for Social Security disabilityincome." Id., at 280. Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capitaldefendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individualwho met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310. He testifiedthat, in his opinion, Atkins' limited intellect had been a consistent featurethroughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an "aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score." Id., at 308.6 Dr. Samenow's testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins,a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.

VIRGINIAOpinion of the CourtThe Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition ofthe death penalty. 260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318(2000). Atkins did not argue before the Virginia SupremeCourt that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend "thathe is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced todeath." Id., at 386, 534 S. E. 2d, at 318. The majority ofthe state court rejected this contention, relying on our holding in Penry. 260 Va., at 387, 534 S. E. 2d, at 319. Thecourt was "not willing to commute Atkins' sentence of deathto life imprisonment merely because of his IQ score." Id.,at 390, 534 S. E. 2d, at 321.Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented. They re-jected Dr. Samenow's opinion that Atkins possesses averageintelligence as "incredulous as a matter of law," and con-cluded that "the imposition of the sentence of death upon acriminal defendant who has the mental age of a child be-tween the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive."Id., at 394, 395-396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323-324. In their opinion, "it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retardedare not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.By definition, such individuals have substantial limitationsnot shared by the general population. A moral and civilizedsociety diminishes itself if its system of justice does not af-ford recognition and consideration of those limitations in ameaningful way." Id., at 397, 534 S. E. 2d, at 325.Because of the gravity of the concerns expressed by thedissenters, and in light of the dramatic shift in the state leg-islative landscape that has occurred in the past 13 years, wegranted certiorari to revisit the issue that we first addressedin thePenry case. 533 U. S. 976 (2001).529. Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins' "academic performance [that was]by and large terrible" to the fact that he "is a person who chose to payattention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly becausehe did not want to do what he was required to do." Id., at 480-481.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN311Cite as: 536 U. S. 304 (2002)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits "[e]xcessive"sanctions. It provides: "Excessive bail shall not be re-quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusualpunishments inflicted." In Weems v. United States, 217U. S. 349 (1910), we held that a punishment of 12 years jailedin irons at hard and painful labor for the crime of falsifyingrecords was excessive. We explained "that it is a preceptof justice that punishment for crime should be graduated andproportioned to [the] offense."Id., at 367. We have repeatedly applied this proportionality precept in later casesinterpreting the Eighth Amendment. SeeHarmelin v.Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 997-998 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also id., at1009-1011 (White, J., dissenting).7 Thus, even though "imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punish-ment which is either cruel or unusual," it may not be imposedas a penalty for "the `status' of narcotic addiction," Robinsonv.California, 370 U. S. 660, 666-667 (1962), because such asanction would be excessive. As Justice Stewart explainedinRobinson: "Even one day in prison would be a cruel andunusual punishment for the `crime' of having a commoncold." Id., at 667.A claim that punishment is excessive is judged not by thestandards that prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over the "Bloody Assizes" or when the Bill of Rightswas adopted, but rather by those that currently prevail. AsChief Justice Warren explained in his opinion in Trop v.Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958): "The basic concept underlyingthe Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity ofman. . . . The Amendment must draw its meaning from the7 Thus, we have read the text of the Amendment to prohibit all excessivepunishments, as well as cruel and unusual punishments that may or maynot be excessive.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN312 ATKINS v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of amaturing society." Id., at 100-101.Proportionality review under those evolving standardsshould be informed by " `objective factors to the maximumpossible extent,' " see Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000 (quotingRummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 274-275 (1980)). We havepinpointed that the "clearest and most reliable objective evi-dence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted bythe country's legislatures." Penry, 492 U. S., at 331. Rely-ing in part on such legislative evidence, we have held thatdeath is an impermissibly excessive punishment for the rapeof an adult woman,Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 593-596(1977), or for a defendant who neither took life, attempted totake life, nor intended to take life, Enmund v. Florida, 458U. S. 782, 789-793 (1982). In Coker, we focused primarilyon the then-recent legislation that had been enacted in re-sponse to our decision 10 years earlier in Furman v. Georgia,408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), to support the conclusionthat the "current judgment," though "not wholly unanimous," weighed very heavily on the side of rejecting capitalpunishment as a "suitable penalty for raping an adultwoman." Coker, 433 U. S., at 596. The "current legisla-tive judgment" relevant to our decision inEnmund was lessclear than in Coker but "nevertheless weigh[ed] on the sideof rejecting capital punishment for the crime at issue."Enmund, 458 U. S., at 793.We also acknowledged in Coker that the objective evi-dence, though of great importance, did not "wholly determine" the controversy, "for the Constitution contemplatesthat in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear onthe question of the acceptability of the death penalty underthe Eighth Amendment." 433 U. S., at 597. For example,in Enmund, we concluded by expressing our own judgmentabout the issue:"For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmund'scriminalculpability must be limited to his participation536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN313Cite as: 536 U. S. 304 (2002)Opinion of the Courtin the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored tohis personal responsibility and moral guilt. PuttingEnmund to death to avenge two killings that he did notcommit and had no intention of committing or causingdoes not measurably contribute to the retributive end ofensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts. Thisis the judgment of most of the legislatures that haverecently addressed the matter, and we have no reasonto disagree with that judgment for purposes of construing and applying the Eighth Amendment." 458 U. S.,at 801 (emphasis added).Thus, in cases involving a consensus, our own judgment is"brought to bear," Coker, 433 U. S., at 597, by askingwhether there is reason to disagree with the judgmentreached by the citizenry and its legislators.Guided by our approach in these cases, we shall first re-view the judgment of legislatures that have addressed thesuitability of imposing the death penalty on the mentally re-tarded and then consider reasons for agreeing or disagreeingwith their judgment. IIIThe parties have not called our attention to any state leg-islative consideration of the suitability of imposing the deathpenalty on mentally retarded offenders prior to 1986. Inthat year, the public reaction to the execution of a mentallyretarded murderer in Georgia 8 apparently led to the enact8 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation whenhe was 14 years old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia inJune 1986. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stayfollowing public protests over his execution. A psychologist selected bythe State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65,which is consistent with mental retardation. Nevertheless, the boardlifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day. The boardconcluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, waspermissible. See Montgomery, Bowden's Execution Stirs Protest, AtlantaJournal, Oct. 13, 1986, p. A1.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN314 ATKINS v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtment of the first state statute prohibiting such executions.9In 1988, when Congress enacted legislation reinstating thefederal death penalty, it expressly provided that a "sentenceof death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded." 10 In 1989, Maryland enacted a similar pro-hibition.11 It was in that year that we decided Penry, andconcluded that those two state enactments, "even whenadded to the 14 States that have rejected capital punishmentcompletely, do not provide sufficient evidence at present of anational consensus." 492 U. S., at 334.Much has changed since then. Responding to the nationalattention received by the Bowden execution and our decisionin Penry, state legislatures across the country began to ad-dress the issue. In 1990, Kentucky and Tennessee enactedstatutes similar to those in Georgia and Maryland, as didNew Mexico in 1991, and Arkansas, Colorado, Washington,Indiana, and Kansas in 1993 and 1994.12 In 1995, when NewYork reinstated its death penalty, it emulated the FederalGovernment by expressly exempting the mentally re-tarded.13 Nebraska followed suit in 1998.14 There appear9 Ga.

In his veto statement,the Texas Governor did not express dissatisfaction with the principle ofcategorically excluding the mentally retarded from the death penalty. Infact, he stated: "We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today."See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236. Instead, his motivation to vetothe bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: "My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill. HouseBill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are askedto make the same determination based on two different sets of facts. . . .Also of grave concern is the fact that the provision that sets up this legallyflawed process never received a public hearing during the legislativeprocess."

Furthermore, a commission on capitalpunishment in Illinois has recently recommended that Illinois adopt a statute prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded offenders. Report ofthe Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment 156 (Apr. 2002).18 A comparison to Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), in whichwe held that there was no national consensus prohibiting the execution ofjuvenile offenders over age 15, is telling. Although we decided Stanfordon the same day as Penry, apparently only two state legislatures haveraised the threshold age for imposition of the death penalty. Mont. CodeAnn. $ 45-5-102 (1999); Ind.

VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtcomplete absence of States passing legislation reinstatingthe power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offend-ers as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted thatthe legislatures that have addressed the issue have votedoverwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.19 Moreover,even in those States that allow the execution of mentallyretarded offenders, the practice is uncommon. Some States,for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue toauthorize executions, but none have been carried out in dec-ades. Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barringthe execution of the mentally retarded in those States. Andit appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard tothe mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided Penry.20The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it isfair to say that a national consensus has developed againstit.2119 App. D to Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.20 Those States are Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina,and Virginia.

For example,several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender. See Brief for American Psychological Association et al.as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae. In addition,representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the UnitedStates, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, havefiled an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views aboutthe death penalty differ, they all "share a conviction that the executionof persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified."

S. 304 (2002)Opinion of the CourtTo the extent there is serious disagreement about the exe-cution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determiningwhich offenders are in fact retarded. In this case, for in-stance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkinssuffers from mental retardation. Not all people who claimto be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall withinthe range of mentally retarded offenders about whom thereis a national consensus. As was our approach inFordv. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), with regard to insanity,"we leave to the State[s] the task of developing appropriateways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their]execution of sentences." Id., at 405, 416-417.22IVThis consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judg-ment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardationand the penological purposes served by the death penalty.Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mentalretardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.over, within the world community, the imposition of the death penaltyfor crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelminglydisapproved. Brief for European Union as Amicus Curiae 4. Finally,polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even thosewho support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded iswrong.

A1; App. B to Brief forAAMR et al. as Amici Curiae (appending approximately 20 state andnational polls on the issue). Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who haveaddressed the issue. See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 830, 831,n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of "respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and bythe leading members of the Western European community").22 The statutory definitions of mental retardation are not identical, butgenerally conform to the clinical definitions set forth in n. 3, supra.536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN318 ATKINS v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the CourtAs discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, butalso significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifestbefore age 18. Mentally retarded persons frequently knowthe difference between right and wrong and are competentto stand trial. Because of their impairments, however, bydefinition they have diminished capacities to understand andprocess information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions ofothers.23 There is no evidence that they are more likely toengage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather thanpursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settingsthey are followers rather than leaders.24 Their deficienciesdo not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, butthey do diminish their personal culpability.In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislativeconsensus that the mentally retarded should be categoricallyexcluded from execution. First, there is a serious questionas to whether either justification that we have recognized as23 J. McGee & F.

S. 304 (2002)Opinion of the Courta basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retardedoffenders.Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 183 (1976) ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), identified"retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospectiveoffenders" as the social purposes served by the death pen-alty. Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person "measurably contributes to one or bothof these goals, it `is nothing more than the purposeless andneedless imposition of pain and suffering,' and hence an unconstitutional punishment." Enmund, 458 U. S., at 798.With respect to retribution--the interest in seeing thatthe offender gets his "just deserts"--the severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpabilityof the offender. Since Gregg, our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes. For example, inGodfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), we set aside a deathsentence because the petitioner's crimes did not reflect "aconsciousness materially more `depraved' than that of anyperson guilty of murder." Id., at 433. If the culpability ofthe average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpabilityof the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit thatform of retribution. Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.With respect to deterrence--the interest in preventingcapital crimes by prospective offenders--"it seems likelythat `capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only whenmurder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,' " Enmund, 458 U. S., at 799. Exempting the mentally retardedfrom that punishment will not affect the "cold calculus thatprecedes the decision" of other potential murderers. Gregg,428 U. S., at 186. Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN320 ATKINS v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtoffenders. The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing ispredicated upon the notion that the increased severity of thepunishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying outmurderous conduct. Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morallyculpable--for example, the diminished ability to understandand process information, to learn from experience, to engagein logical reasoning, or to control impulses--that also makeit less likely that they can process the information of thepossibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, controltheir conduct based upon that information. Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenderswho are not mentally retarded. Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threatof execution. Thus, executing the mentally retarded willnot measurably further the goal of deterrence.The reduced capacity of mentally retarded offenders provides a second justification for a categorical rule making suchoffenders ineligible for the death penalty. The risk "thatthe death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors whichmay call for a less severe penalty," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.586, 605 (1978), is enhanced, not only by the possibility offalse confessions,25 but also by the lesser ability of mentallyretarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or moreaggravating factors. Mentally retarded defendants may beless able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and25 See Everington & Fulero 212-213. Despite the heavy burden thatthe prosecution must shoulder in capital cases, we cannot ignore the factthat in recent years a disturbing number of inmates on death row havebeen exonerated. These exonerations have included at least one mentallyretarded person who unwittingly confessed to a crime that he did notcommit.

As Penry demonstrated, moreover, reliance onmental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edgedsword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravatingfactor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.492 U. S., at 323-325. Mentally retarded defendants in theaggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution.Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reasonto disagree with the judgment of "the legislatures that haverecently addressed the matter" and concluded that death isnot a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent orthe retributive purpose of the death penalty. Construingand applying the Eighth Amendment in the light of our"evolving standards of decency," we therefore conclude thatsuch punishment is excessive and that the Constitution"places a substantive restriction on the State's power to takethe life" of a mentally retarded offender. Ford, 477 U. S.,at 405.The judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
