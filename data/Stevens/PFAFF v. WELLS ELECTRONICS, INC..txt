In response to this request, he prepared detailed engineering drawings that described the design, the dimensions, and the materials to be used in makingthe socket. Pfaff sent those drawings to a manufacturer inFebruary or March 1981.Prior to March 17, 1981, Pfaff showed a sketch of his concept to representatives of Texas Instruments. On April 8,1981, they provided Pfaff with a written confirmation of apreviously placed oral purchase order for 30,100 of his newsockets for a total price of $91,155. In accord with hisnormal practice, Pfaff did not make and test a prototypeof the new device before offering to sell it in commercialquantities.3The manufacturer took several months to develop the customized tooling necessary to produce the device, and Pfaffdid not fill the order until July 1981.

Wells prevailed onthe basis of a finding of no infringement.5 When respondent began to market a modified device, petitioner broughtthis suit, alleging that the modifications infringed six of theclaims in the '377 patent.After a full evidentiary hearing before a Special Master,6the District Court held that two of those claims (1 and 6)were invalid because they had been anticipated in the priorart.

WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.Opinion of the Courtyear before the patent application was filed on April 19, 1982,the court concluded that those claims were invalid under$ 102(b). That conclusion rested on the court's view that aslong as the invention was "substantially complete at the timeof sale," the 1-year period began to run, even though theinvention had not yet been reduced to practice. Id., at 1434.The other two claims (11 and 19) described a feature thathad not been included in Pfaff 's initial design, but the Courtof Appeals concluded as a matter of law that the additionalfeature was not itself patentable because it was an obviousaddition to the prior art.7 Given the court's $ 102(b) holding,the prior art included Pfaff 's first four claims.Because other courts have held or assumed that an invention cannot be "on sale" within the meaning of $ 102(b) unlessand until it has been reduced to practice, see, e. g., TimelyProducts Corp. v. Arron, 523 F. 2d 288, 299-302 (CA2 1975);Dart Industries, Inc. v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 489F. 2d 1359, 1365, n. 11 (CA7 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.

S. 1003 (1998).IIThe primary meaning of the word "invention" in the Patent Act unquestionably refers to the inventor's conceptionrather than to a physical embodiment of that idea. The statute does not contain any express requirement that an invention must be reduced to practice before it can be patented.7 Title 35 U. S. C. $ 103 provides: "A patent may not be obtained thoughthe invention is not identically disclosed or described . . . if the differencesbetween the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art aresuch that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at thetime the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the artto which said subject matter pertains."525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 525 U. S. 55 (1998)Opinion of the CourtNeither the statutory definition of the term in $ 100 8 nor thebasic conditions for obtaining a patent set forth in $ 1019make any mention of "reduction to practice." The statute'sonly specific reference to that term is found in $ 102(g), whichsets forth the standard for resolving priority contests be-tween two competing claimants to a patent. That subsection provides:"In determining priority of invention there shall be con-sidered not only the respective dates of conception andreduction to practice of the invention, but also the rea-sonable diligence of one who was first to conceive andlast to reduce to practice, from a time prior to concep-tion by the other."Thus, assuming diligence on the part of the applicant, it isnormally the first inventor to conceive, rather than the firstto reduce to practice, who establishes the right to the patent.It is well settled that an invention may be patented beforeit is reduced to practice. In 1888, this Court upheld a patentissued to Alexander Graham Bell even though he had filedhis application before constructing a working telephone.Chief Justice Waite's reasoning in that case merits quotingat length:"It is quite true that when Bell applied for his patenthe had never actually transmitted telegraphically spoken words so that they could be distinctly heard andunderstood at the receiving end of his line, but in hisspecification he did describe accurately and with ad-mirable clearness his process, that is to say, the exact8 Title 35 U.

The particular instrument which hehad, and which he used in his experiments, did not,under the circumstances in which it was tried, repro-duce the words spoken, so that they could be clearlyunderstood, but the proof is abundant and of the mostconvincing character, that other instruments, carefullyconstructed and made exactly in accordance with thespecification, without any additions whatever, have operated and will operate successfully.

The Telephone Cases, 126 U. S. 1, 535-536(1888).10When we apply the reasoning of The Telephone Cases tothe facts of the case before us today, it is evident that Pfaff10 This Court has also held a patent invalid because the invention hadpreviously been disclosed in a prior patent application, although that application did not claim the invention and the first invention apparentlyhad not been reduced to practice. Alexander Milburn Co. v. DavisBournonville Co., 270 U. S. 390, 401-402 (1926).525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 525 U. S. 55 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcould have obtained a patent on his novel socket when heaccepted the purchase order from Texas Instruments for30,100 units. At that time he provided the manufacturerwith a description and drawings that had "sufficient clearness and precision to enable those skilled in the matter" toproduce the device. Id., at 536. The parties agree that thesockets manufactured to fill that order embody Pfaff 's conception as set forth in claims 1, 6, 7, and 10 of the '377 patent.We can find no basis in the text of $ 102(b) or in the facts ofthis case for concluding that Pfaff 's invention was not "onsale" within the meaning of the statute until after it hadbeen reduced to practice.IIIPfaff nevertheless argues that longstanding precedent,buttressed by the strong interest in providing inventors witha clear standard identifying the onset of the 1-year period,justifies a special interpretation of the word "invention" asused in $ 102(b). We are persuaded that this nontextualargument should be rejected.As we have often explained, most recently in BonitoBoats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151(1989), the patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in returnfor an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time. Thebalance between the interest in motivating innovation andenlightenment by rewarding invention with patent protection on the one hand, and the interest in avoiding monopoliesthat unnecessarily stifle competition on the other, has beena feature of the federal patent laws since their inception.As this Court explained in 1871:"Letters patent are not to be regarded as monopolies . . .but as public franchises granted to the inventors of newand useful improvements for the purpose of securing tothem, as such inventors, for the limited term therein525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 PFAFF v. WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.Opinion of the Courtmentioned, the exclusive right and liberty to make anduse and vend to others to be used their own inventions,as tending to promote the progress of science and theuseful arts, and as matter of compensation to the inventors for their labor, toil, and expense in making theinventions, and reducing the same to practice for thepublic benefit, as contemplated by the Constitution andsanctioned by the laws of Congress." Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533-534.Consistent with these ends, $ 102 of the Patent Act servesas a limiting provision, both excluding ideas that are in thepublic domain from patent protection and confining the du-ration of the monopoly to the statutory term. See,e. g.,Frantz Mfg. Co. v. Phenix Mfg. Co., 457 F. 2d 314, 320 (CA71972).We originally held that an inventor loses his right to apatent if he puts his invention into public use before filinga patent application. "His voluntary act or acquiescencein the public sale and use is an abandonment of his right."Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 24 (1829) (Story, J.). A similar reluctance to allow an inventor to remove existing knowledge from public use undergirds the on-sale bar.Nevertheless, an inventor who seeks to perfect his discovery may conduct extensive testing without losing his rightto obtain a patent for his invention--even if such testingoccurs in the public eye. The law has long recognized thedistinction between inventions put to experimental use andproducts sold commercially. In 1878, we explained why patentability may turn on an inventor's use of his product."It is sometimes said that an inventor acquires an undueadvantage over the public by delaying to take out a patent, inasmuch as he thereby preserves the monopoly tohimself for a longer period than is allowed by the policyof the law; but this cannot be said with justice when the525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 525 U. S. 55 (1998)Opinion of the Courtdelay is occasioned by a bona fide effort to bring hisinvention to perfection, or to ascertain whether it willanswer the purpose intended. His monopoly only continues for the allotted period, in any event; and it is theinterest of the public, as well as himself, that the invention should be perfect and properly tested, beforea patent is granted for it. Any attempt to use it for aprofit, and not by way of experiment, for a longer period than two years before the application, would deprive the inventor of his right to a patent." Elizabethv. Pavement Co., 97 U. S. 126, 137 (emphasis added).The patent laws therefore seek both to protect the public'sright to retain knowledge already in the public domain andthe inventor's right to control whether and when he maypatent his invention. The Patent Act of 1836, 5 Stat. 117,was the first statute that expressly included an on-sale barto the issuance of a patent. Like the earlier holding in Pennock, that provision precluded patentability if the inventionhad been placed on sale at any time before the patent application was filed. In 1839, Congress ameliorated that requirement by enacting a 2-year grace period in which theinventor could file an application. 5 Stat. 353.In Andrews v. Hovey, 123 U. S. 267, 274 (1887), we notedthat the purpose of that amendment was "to fix a period oflimitation which should be certain"; it required the inventorto make sure that a patent application was filed "within twoyears from the completion of his invention," ibid. In 1939,Congress reduced the grace period from two years to oneyear. 53 Stat. 1212.Petitioner correctly argues that these provisions identifyan interest in providing inventors with a definite standardfor determining when a patent application must be filed. Arule that makes the timeliness of an application depend onthe date when an invention is "substantially complete" se525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 PFAFF v. WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.Opinion of the Courtriously undermines the interest in certainty.11 Moreover,such a rule finds no support in the text of the statute. Thus,petitioner's argument calls into question the standard ap-plied by the Court of Appeals, but it does not persuade usthat it is necessary to engraft a reduction to practice elementinto the meaning of the term "invention" as used in $ 102(b).The word "invention" must refer to a concept that is com-plete, rather than merely one that is "substantially complete." It is true that reduction to practice ordinarily pro-vides the best evidence that an invention is complete. Butjust because reduction to practice is sufficient evidence ofcompletion, it does not follow that proof of reduction to practice is necessary in every case. Indeed, both the facts ofThe Telephone Cases and the facts of this case demonstratethat one can prove that an invention is complete and readyfor patenting before it has actually been reduced topractice.1211 The Federal Circuit has developed a multifactor, "totality of the circumstances" test to determine the trigger for the on-sale bar. See, e. g.,Micro Chemical, Inc. v. Great Plains Chemical Co., 103 F. 3d 1538, 1544(1997) (stating that, in determining whether an invention is on sale forpurposes of $ 102(b), " `all of the circumstances surrounding the sale oroffer to sell, including the stage of development of the invention and thenature of the invention, must be considered and weighed against the policies underlying section 102(b)' "); see also UMC Electronics Co. v. UnitedStates, 816 F. 2d 647, 656 (1987) (stating the on-sale bar "does not lenditself to formulation into a set of precise requirements"). As the FederalCircuit itself has noted, this test "has been criticized as unnecessarilyvague." Seal-Flex, Inc. v. Athletic Track & Court Construction, 98 F. 3d1318, 1323, n. 2 (1996).12 Several of this Court's early decisions stating that an invention is notcomplete until it has been reduced to practice are best understood as indicating that the invention's reduction to practice demonstrated that theconcept was no longer in an experimental phase. See, e. g., Seymour v.Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 552 (1871) ("Crude and imperfect experiments arenot sufficient to confer a right to a patent; but in order to constitute aninvention, the party must have proceeded so far as to have reduced hisidea to practice, and embodied it in some distinct form"); Clark Thread525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 525 U. S. 55 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe conclude, therefore, that the on-sale bar applies whentwo conditions are satisfied before the critical date.First, the product must be the subject of a commercialoffer for sale. An inventor can both understand and controlthe timing of the first commercial marketing of his invention.The experimental use doctrine, for example, has not generated concerns about indefiniteness,13 and we perceive noreason why unmanageable uncertainty should attend a rulethat measures the application of the on-sale bar of $ 102(b)against the date when an invention that is ready for patenting is first marketed commercially. In this case the acceptance of the purchase order prior to April 8, 1981, makes itclear that such an offer had been made, and there is no question that the sale was commercial rather than experimentalin character.Second, the invention must be ready for patenting. Thatcondition may be satisfied in at least two ways: by proof ofreduction to practice before the critical date; or by proofthat prior to the critical date the inventor had prepareddrawings or other descriptions of the invention that weresufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art toCo. v. Willimantic Linen Co., 140 U. S. 481, 489 (1891) (describing howinventor continued to alter his thread winding machine until July 1858,when "he put it in visible form in the shape of a machine. . . .

S., at382-383 (stating that an invention did not need to be subsequently commercialized to constitute prior art after the inventor had finished hisexperimentation. "It was the fact that it would work with great activityas an accelerator that was the discovery, and that was all, and the necessary reduction to use is shown by instances making clear that it did sowork, and was a completed discovery").13 See, e. g., Rooklidge & Jensen, Common Sense, Simplicity and Experimental Use Negation of the Public Use and On Sale Bars to Patentability,29 John Marshall L. Rev. 1, 29 (1995) (stating that "whether a particularactivity is experimental is often clear").525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 PFAFF v. WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.Opinion of the Courtpractice the invention.14 In this case the second conditionof the on-sale bar is satisfied because the drawings Pfaff sentto the manufacturer before the critical date fully disclosedthe invention.The evidence in this case thus fulfills the two essentialconditions of the on-sale bar. As succinctly stated byLearned Hand:"[I]t is a condition upon an inventor's right to a patentthat he shall not exploit his discovery competitivelyafter it is ready for patenting; he must content himselfwith either secrecy, or legal monopoly." MetallizingEngineering Co. v. Kenyon Bearing & Auto Parts Co.,153 F. 2d 516, 520 (CA2 1946).The judgment of the Court of Appeals finds support notonly in the text of the statute but also in the basic policiesunderlying the statutory scheme, including $ 102(b). WhenPfaff accepted the purchase order for his new sockets priorto April 8, 1981, his invention was ready for patenting. Thefact that the manufacturer was able to produce the socketusing his detailed drawings and specifications demonstratesthis fact. Furthermore, those sockets contained all the elements of the invention claimed in the '377 patent. There-fore, Pfaff 's '377 patent is invalid because the invention had14 The Solicitor General has argued that the rule governing the on-salebar should be phrased somewhat differently. In his opinion, "if the saleor offer in question embodies the invention for which a patent is latersought, a sale or offer to sell that is primarily for commercial purposesand that occurs more than one year before the application renders theinvention unpatentable. Seal-Flex, Inc. v. Athletic Track and CourtConstr., 98 F. 3d 1318, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Bryson, J., concurring in partand concurring in the result)." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is true that evidence satisfying this test might be sufficient to prove that the invention was ready forpatenting at the time of the sale if it is clear that no aspect of the inventionwas developed after the critical date. However, the possibility of additional development after the offer for sale in these circumstances counselsagainst adoption of the rule proposed by the Solicitor General.525US1 Unit: $$U3 [10-23-00 11:16:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 525 U.

Argued October 7, 1998--Decided November 16, 1998Petitioner Wright, a longshoreman, was subject to a collective-bargainingagreement (CBA) and a Longshore Seniority Plan, both of which contained an arbitration clause. When respondents refused to employ himfollowing his settlement of a claim for permanent disability benefits forjob-related injuries, Wright filed this suit, alleging discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The District Court dismissed the case without prejudice because Wright hadfailed to pursue the arbitration procedure provided by the CBA. TheFourth Circuit affirmed.Held: The CBA's general arbitration clause does not require Wright to usethe arbitration procedure for alleged violation of the ADA. Pp. 75-82.(a) The Fourth Circuit's conclusions that the CBA arbitration clauseencompassed a statutory claim under the ADA and was enforceablebring into focus the tension between two lines of this Court's case law.Compare, e. g., Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, 49-51,with, e. g., Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26.However, it is unnecessary to resolve the question of the validity of aunion-negotiated waiver of employees' statutory rights to a federalforum, since it is apparent, on the facts and arguments presented here,that no such waiver has occurred. Pp. 75-77.(b) Petitioner's ADA claim is not subject to the presumption of arbitrability this Court has found in $ 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947. That presumption does not extend beyond the reachof the principal rationale that justifies it, i. e., that arbitrators are in abetter position than courts to interpret the terms of a CBA. See, e. g.,AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643,650. The dispute here ultimately concerns not the application or interpretation of any CBA, but the meaning of a federal statute, the ADA.Although ordinary textual analysis of a CBA may show that mattersbeyond the interpretation and application of contract terms are subjectto arbitration, they will not be presumed to be so. Pp. 77-79.(c) In order for a union to waive employees' rights to a federal judicialforum for statutory antidiscrimination claims, the agreement to arbitrate such claims must be clear and unmistakable. Cf., e. g., Metropoli525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 525 U. S. 70 (1998)Syllabustan Edison Co. v. NLRB, 460 U. S. 693, 708. The CBA's arbitrationclause is very general, providing only for arbitration of "[m]atters underdispute," and the remainder of the contract contains no explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements. For similar reasons, there is no clear and unmistakable waiver in the Longshore Seniority Plan. This Court does not reach the question whether such a waiverwould be enforceable.

S. C. $ 12101 et seq.IIn 1970, petitioner Ceasar Wright began working as alongshoreman in Charleston, South Carolina. He was amember of Local 1422 of the International Longshoremen'sAssociation, AFL-CIO (Union), which uses a hiring hall tosupply workers to several stevedore companies representedby the South Carolina Stevedores Association (SCSA).Clause 15(B) of the CBA between the Union and the SCSAprovides in part as follows: "Matters under dispute whichcannot be promptly settled between the Local and an individ-ual Employer shall, no later than 48 hours after such discussion, be referred in writing covering the entire grievance toa Port Grievance Committee . . . ."

S. 70 (1998)Opinion of the Courtagreement within five days of receiving the complaint, thenthe dispute must be referred to a District Grievance Committee, which is also evenly divided between the two sides.The CBA provides that a majority decision of the DistrictGrievance Committee "shall be final and binding." Id., at44a. If the District Grievance Committee cannot reach amajority decision within 72 hours after meeting, then thecommittee must employ a professional arbitrator.Clause 15(F) of the CBA provides as follows:"The Union agrees that this Agreement is intended tocover all matters affecting wages, hours, and otherterms and conditions of employment and that during theterm of this Agreement the Employers will not be required to negotiate on any further matters affectingthese or other subjects not specifically set forth in thisAgreement. Anything not contained in this Agreementshall not be construed as being part of this Agreement.All past port practices being observed may be reducedto writing in each port." Id., at 45a-46a.Finally, Clause 17 of the CBA states: "It is the intention andpurpose of all parties hereto that no provision or part of thisAgreement shall be violative of any Federal or State Law."Id., at 47a.Wright was also subject to the Longshore Seniority Plan,which contained its own grievance provision, reading as follows: "Any dispute concerning or arising out of the termsand/or conditions of this Agreement, or dispute involving theinterpretation or application of this Agreement, or disputearising out of any rule adopted for its implementation, shallbe referred to the Seniority Board." Id., at 48a. The Seniority Board is equally divided between labor and management representatives. If the board reaches agreement bymajority vote, then that determination is final and binding.If the board cannot resolve the dispute, then the Union and525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 WRIGHT v. UNIVERSAL MARITIME SERVICE CORP.Opinion of the Courtthe SCSA each choose a person, and this "Committee of two"makes a final determination.On February 18, 1992, while Wright was working for re-spondent Stevens Shipping and Terminal Company (Stevens), he injured his right heel and his back. He soughtcompensation from Stevens for permanent disability underthe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., and ulti-mately settled the claim for $250,000 and $10,000 in attorney's fees. Wright was also awarded Social Security disabil-ity benefits.In January 1995, Wright returned to the Union hiring halland asked to be referred for work. (At some point he obtained a written note from his doctor approving such activity.) Between January 2 and January 11, Wright worked forfour stevedoring companies, none of which complained abouthis performance. When, however, the stevedoring companies realized that Wright had previously settled a claim forpermanent disability, they informed the Union that theywould not accept Wright for employment, because a personcertified as permanently disabled (which they regardedWright to be) is not qualified to perform longshore workunder the CBA. The Union responded that the employershad misconstrued the CBA, suggested that the ADA entitledWright to return to work if he could perform his duties, andasserted that refusing Wright employment would constitutea "lock-out" in violation of the CBA.When Wright found out that the stevedoring companieswould no longer accept him for employment, he contactedthe Union to ask how he could get back to work. Wrightclaims that instead of suggesting the filing of a grievance,the Union told him to obtain counsel and file a claim underthe ADA. Wright hired an attorney and eventually filedcharges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the South Carolina StateHuman Affairs Commission, alleging that the stevedoring525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN75Cite as: 525 U. S. 70 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcompanies and the SCSA had violated the ADA by refusinghim work. In October 1995, Wright received a right-to-sueletter from the EEOC.In January 1996, Wright filed a complaint against theSCSA and six individual stevedoring companies in theUnited States District Court for the District of South Carolina. Respondents' answer asserted various affirmative de-fenses, including Wright's failure to exhaust his remediesunder the CBA and the Seniority Plan. After discovery, re-spondents moved for summary judgment and Wright movedfor partial summary judgment with respect to some ofrespondents' defenses. A Magistrate Judge recommendedthat the District Court dismiss the case without prejudicebecause Wright had failed to pursue the grievance procedureprovided by the CBA. The District Court adopted thereport and recommendation and subsequently rejectedWright's motion for reconsideration. The United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, see No.96-2850 (July 29, 1997), judgt. order reported at 121 F. 3d702, relying upon its earlier decision inAustin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., 78 F. 3d 875, cert. denied,519 U. S. 980 (1996), which in turn had relied upon our deci-sion in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S.20 (1991). We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1146 (1998).IIIn this case, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the generalarbitration provision in the CBA governing Wright's employment was sufficiently broad to encompass a statutory claimarising under the ADA, and that such a provision was enforceable. The latter conclusion brings into question twolines of our case law. The first is represented by Alexanderv. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), which held thatan employee does not forfeit his right to a judicial forum forclaimed discriminatory discharge in violation of Title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN76 WRIGHT v. UNIVERSAL MARITIME SERVICE CORP.Opinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., if "he first pursues his grievance tofinal arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of acollective-bargaining agreement." 415 U. S., at 49. In rejecting the argument that the doctrine of election of remedies barred the Title VII lawsuit, we reasoned that a grievance is designed to vindicate a "contractual right" under aCBA, while a lawsuit under Title VII asserts "independentstatutory rights accorded by Congress." Id., at 49-50.The statutory cause of action was not waived by the union'sagreement to the arbitration provision of the CBA, since"there can be no prospective waiver of an employee's rightsunder Title VII." Id., at 51. We have followed the holdingof Gardner-Denver in deciding the effect of CBA arbitrationupon employee claims under other statutes. See McDonaldv. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284 (1984) (claim under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983); Barrentine v. Arkansas-BestFreight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728 (1981) (claim under FairLabor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U. S. C. $ 201 et seq.).The second line of cases implicated here is represented byGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., supra, which heldthat a claim brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., could be subject to compulsory arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision in a securities registration form. Relying upon the federal policy favoring arbitration embodied in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9U. S. C. $ 1 et seq., we said that "statutory claims may be thesubject of an arbitration agreement, enforceable pursuant tothe FAA." 500 U. S., at 26 (citing Rodriguez de Quijas v.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989);Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S.220 (1987); Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614 (1985)).There is obviously some tension between these two lines ofcases. Whereas Gardner-Denver stated that "an employee's525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN77Cite as: 525 U. S. 70 (1998)Opinion of the Courtrights under Title VII are not susceptible of prospectivewaiver," 415 U. S., at 51-52, Gilmer held that the right to afederal judicial forum for an ADEA claim could be waived.Petitioner and the United States as amicus would have usreconcile the lines of authority by maintaining that federalforum rights cannot be waived in union-negotiated CBAseven if they can be waived in individually executed contracts--a distinction that assuredly finds support in the textof Gilmer, see 500 U. S., at 26, 35. Respondents and theiramici, on the other hand, contend that the real differencebetween Gardner-Denver and Gilmer is the radical change,over two decades, in the Court's receptivity to arbitration,leading Gilmer to affirm that "questions of arbitrability mustbe addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policyfavoring arbitration," 500 U. S., at 26 (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted); Gilmer, they argue, has sufficiently undermined Gardner-Denver that a union can waiveemployees' rights to a judicial forum. Although, as will appear, we find Gardner-Denver and Gilmer relevant for various purposes to the case before us, we find it unnecessary toresolve the question of the validity of a union-negotiatedwaiver, since it is apparent to us, on the facts and argumentspresented here, that no such waiver has occurred.IIIIn asserting the existence of an agreement to arbitratethe ADA claim, respondents rely upon the presumption ofarbitrability this Court has found in $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29U. S. C. $ 185.1 See generally Steelworkers v. Enterprise1 We have also discerned a presumption of arbitrability under the FAA,9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985). Petitioner argued that the FAA525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN78 WRIGHT v. UNIVERSAL MARITIME SERVICE CORP.Opinion of the CourtWheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593 (1960); Steelworkers v.American Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564 (1960); Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574 (1960). In collectivebargaining agreements, we have said, "there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that `[a]n order to arbitratethe particular grievance should not be denied unless it maybe said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause isnot susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserteddispute.' " AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. CommunicationsWorkers, 475 U. S. 643, 650 (1986) (quoting Warrior & Gulf,supra, at 582-583).That presumption, however, does not extend beyond thereach of the principal rationale that justifies it, which is thatarbitrators are in a better position than courts to interpretthe terms of a CBA. See AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650;Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 581-582. This rationale findssupport in the very text of the LMRA, which announces that"[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the partiesis declared to be the desirable method for settlement ofgrievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective-bargaining agreement." 29U. S. C. $ 173(d) (emphasis added). The dispute in the present case, however, ultimately concerns not the application ordoes not apply to this case, see Brief for Petitioner 43-44, and assertedthat respondents "have not argued at any stage of this case that theF. A. A. applies," id., at 43. Respondents did not dispute the latter assertion, nor did they argue the applicability of the FAA before us; rather,they contended that it makes no difference whether the FAA applies, sincethe FAA presumption and the LMRA presumption are the same, see Brieffor Respondents 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. Finally, the Fourth Circuit,while it cited an FAA case, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. MercuryConstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983), did not explicitly rely upon theFAA--presumably because it has held elsewhere that the FAA does notapply to CBAs, see Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., 78F. 3d 875, 879 (CA4), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 980 (1996). In these circumstances, we decline to consider the applicability of the FAA to the present case.525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN79Cite as: 525 U. S. 70 (1998)Opinion of the Courtinterpretation of any CBA, but the meaning of a federal stat-ute. The cause of action Wright asserts arises not out ofcontract, but out of the ADA, and is distinct from any rightconferred by the collective-bargaining agreement. See Gilmer, supra, at 34; Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 737; GardnerDenver, supra, at 49-50. To be sure, respondents arguethat Wright is not qualified for his position as the CBA requires, but even if that were true he would still prevail ifthe refusal to hire violated the ADA.Nor is the statutory (as opposed to contractual) focus ofthe claim altered by the fact that Clause 17 of the CBA recites it to be "the intention and purpose of all parties heretothat no provision or part of this Agreement shall be violativeof any Federal or State Law." App. 47a. As we discussbelow in Part IV, this does not incorporate the ADA by reference. Even if it did so, however--thereby creating a con-tractual right that is coextensive with the federal statutoryright--the ultimate question for the arbitrator would be notwhat the parties have agreed to, but what federal law requires; and that is not a question which should be presumedto be included within the arbitration requirement. Application of that principle is unaffected by the fact that the CBAin this case, unlike the one in Gardner-Denver, does not expressly limit the arbitrator to interpreting and applying thecontract. The presumption only extends that far, whetheror not the text of the agreement is similarly limited. It maywell be that ordinary textual analysis of a CBA will showthat matters which go beyond the interpretation and applica-tion of contract terms are subject to arbitration; but theywill not be presumed to be so.IVNot only is petitioner's statutory claim not subject to apresumption of arbitrability; we think any CBA requirementto arbitrate it must be particularly clear. In MetropolitanEdison Co. v. NLRB, 460 U. S. 693 (1983), we stated that a525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN80 WRIGHT v. UNIVERSAL MARITIME SERVICE CORP.Opinion of the Courtunion could waive its officers' statutory right under $ 8(a)(3)of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 158(a)(3),to be free of antiunion discrimination, but we held that sucha waiver must be clear and unmistakable. "[W]e will notinfer from a general contractual provision that the partiesintended to waive a statutorily protected right unless theundertaking is `explicitly stated.' More succinctly, thewaiver must be clear and unmistakable." 460 U. S., at 708;see also Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 125 (1994) (dictum); Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399,409, n. 9 (1988) (dictum); cf. Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB,350 U. S. 270, 283 (1956).We think the same standard applicable to a unionnegotiated waiver of employees' statutory right to a judicialforum for claims of employment discrimination. Althoughthat is not a substantive right, see Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 26,and whether or not Gardner-Denver's seemingly absoluteprohibition of union waiver of employees' federal forumrights survives Gilmer, Gardner-Denver at least stands forthe proposition that the right to a federal judicial forum isof sufficient importance to be protected against less-thanexplicit union waiver in a CBA. The CBA in this case doesnot meet that standard. Its arbitration clause is very general, providing for arbitration of "[m]atters under dispute,"App. 43a--which could be understood to mean matters indispute under the contract. And the remainder of the contract contains no explicit incorporation of statutory antidiscrimination requirements. (Indeed, it does not even contain, as did the CBAs in Austin and Gardner-Denver, its ownspecific antidiscrimination provision.) The Fourth Circuitrelied upon the fact that the equivalently broad arbitrationclause in Gilmer--applying to "any dispute, claim or controversy"--was held to embrace federal statutory claims. ButGilmer involved an individual's waiver of his own rights,rather than a union's waiver of the rights of represented em525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN81Cite as: 525 U. S. 70 (1998)Opinion of the Courtployees--and hence the "clear and unmistakable" standardwas not applicable.Respondents rely upon Clause 15(F) of the CBA, whichstates that "this Agreement is intended to cover all mattersaffecting wages, hours, and other terms and conditions ofemployment." App. 45a-46a. But even if this could, in isolation, be considered a clear and unmistakable incorporationof employment-discrimination laws (which is doubtful), itis surely deprived of that effect by the provision, later inthe same paragraph, that "[a]nything not contained inthis Agreement shall not be construed as being part ofthis Agreement." Id., at 46a. Respondents also rely uponClause 17 of the CBA, which states that "[i]t is the intentionand purpose of all parties hereto that no provision or part ofthis Agreement shall be violative of any Federal or StateLaw." Id., at 47a. They argue that this requires the arbitrator to "apply legal definitions derived from the ADA" indetermining whether Wright is "qualified" for employmentwithin the meaning of the CBA. Brief for Respondents 39.Perhaps so, but that is not the same as making compliancewith the ADA a contractual commitment that would be subject to the arbitration clause. This becomes crystal clearwhen one contrasts Clause 17 with the provision of the CBAwhich states that "[t]he requirements of the Occupations[sic] Safety and Health Administration shall be binding onboth Parties." App. 46a. (Under respondents' interpretation of Clause 17, this OSHA provision would be superfluous.) Clause 17 seems to us nothing more than a recitationof the canon of construction which would in any event havebeen applied to the CBA--that an agreement should be interpreted in such fashion as to preserve, rather than destroy,its validity (ut res magis valeat quam pereat).Finally, we do not find a clear and unmistakable waiverin the Longshore Seniority Plan. Like the CBA itself, theplan contains no antidiscrimination provision; and it specifi525US1 Unit: $$U4 [10-23-00 11:19:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN82 WRIGHT v. UNIVERSAL MARITIME SERVICE CORP.Opinion of the Courtcally limits its grievance procedure to disputes related tothe agreement.2* * *We hold that the collective-bargaining agreement in thiscase does not contain a clear and unmistakable waiver of thecovered employees' rights to a judicial forum for federalclaims of employment discrimination. We do not reach thequestion whether such a waiver would be enforceable. Thejudgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case isremanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
