A Massachusetts pricing order imposes an assessment onall fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers.About two-thirds of that milk is produced out of State. Theentire assessment, however, is distributed to Massachusettsdairy farmers. The question presented is whether the pric-ing order unconstitutionally discriminates against interstatecommerce. We hold that it does.IPetitioner West Lynn Creamery, Inc., is a milk dealer li-censed to do business in Massachusetts. It purchases rawmilk, which it processes, packages, and sells to wholesalers,retailers, and other milk dealers. About 97% of the rawmilk it purchases is produced by out-of-state farmers. Peti-tioner LeComte's Dairy, Inc., is also a licensed Massachusettsmilk dealer. It purchases all of its milk from West Lynn anddistributes it to retail outlets in Massachusetts.Since 1937, the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, 50Stat. 246, as amended, 7 U. S.

S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courtpaid to producers of raw milk by issuing marketing ordersfor particular geographic areas.1 While the Federal Government sets minimum prices based on local conditions,those prices have not been so high as to prevent substantial competition among producers in different States. In the1980's and early 1990's, Massachusetts dairy farmers beganto lose market share to lower cost producers in neighboringStates. In response, the Governor of Massachusetts appointed a Special Commission to study the dairy industry.The commission found that many producers had sold theirdairy farms during the past decade and that if prices paidto farmers for their milk were not significantly increased, amajority of the remaining farmers in Massachusetts wouldbe "forced out of business within the year." App. 13. OnJanuary 28, 1992, relying on the commission's report, theCommissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Food andAgriculture (respondent) declared a State of Emergency.1 The minimum price is a "blend price" that is determined, in part, bythe ultimate use of the raw milk. See 7 CFR $ 1001.1 et seq. (1993). Rawmilk used to produce fluid milk products has the highest price and is characterized in the federal order as "Class I" milk. Milk used for other products, such as eggnog, sour cream, and hard cheese, bears a lower price andis characterized as "Class II" and "Class III" milk. Each dealer is required to file a monthly report of its raw milk purchases and the use towhich that milk is put. In computing the monthly blend price, the Federal Market Administrator calculates the weighted average price of thevarious classes of milk. If Class I milk predominates in the dealer reports, the blend price is high; if other classes predominate, the blend priceis lower. Although all of the farmers are paid the same minimum blendprice regardless of the use to which their milk is put, dealers who sellmore than an average amount of Class I products pay a higher per unitprice than those with relatively lower Class I sales. The federal marketing order thus provides a uniform blend price for sellers of raw milk whileimposing nonuniform payment obligations on the dealers purchasing thatmilk. The federal order does not prohibit the payment of prices higherthan the established minima. Like the federal order, the Massachusettsorder requires dealers to make payments into a fund that is disbursed tofarmers on a monthly basis. The assessments, however, are only on ClassI sales and the distributions are only to Massachusetts farmers.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT190 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the CourtIn his declaration he noted that the average federal blendprice2 had declined from $14.67 per hundred pounds (cwt)of raw milk in 1990 to $12.64/cwt in 1991, while costs of pro-duction for Massachusetts farmers had risen to an estimatedaverage of $15.50/cwt. Id., at 27. He concluded:"Regionally, the industry is in serious trouble and ulti-mately, a federal solution will be required. In themeantime, we must act on the state level to preserveour local industry, maintain reasonable minimum pricesfor the dairy farmers, thereby ensure a continuous andadequate supply of fresh milk for our market, and protect the public health." Id., at 31.Promptly after his declaration of emergency, respondent is-sued the pricing order that is challenged in this proceeding.3The order requires every "dealer" 4 in Massachusetts tomake a monthly "premium payment" into the "Massachusetts Dairy Equalization Fund." The amount of those pay-ments is computed in two steps. First, the monthly "orderpremium" is determined by subtracting the federal blendprice for that month from $15 and dividing the difference bythree; thus if the federal price is $12/cwt, the order premiumis $1/cwt.5 Second, the premium is multiplied by the amount2 For an explanation of the term "blend price," see the previous footnote.3 The order was first issued on February 18, 1992, and amended onFebruary 26, 1992. App. 32-40; Brief for Respondent 4-5. Only theamended order is at issue in this case.4 A "dealer" is defined as "any person who is engaged within the Commonwealth in the business of receiving, purchasing, pasteurizing, bottling,processing, distributing, or otherwise handling milk, purchases or receivesmilk for sale as the consignee or agent of a producer, and shall include aproducer-dealer, dealer-retailer, and sub-dealer."

The commissioner appears to have set the order premium at onlya third of the difference between the federal price and $15 because Massachusetts farmers produce only about one-third of the milk sold as fluidmilk in the State.

Starting in July 1992, however, petitioners refused tomake the premium payments, and respondent commenced li-cense revocation proceedings. Petitioners then filed an action in state court seeking an injunction against enforcementof the order on the ground that it violated the CommerceClause of the Federal Constitution. The state court deniedrelief and respondent conditionally revoked their licenses.The parties agreed to an expedited appellate procedure,and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts transferred the cases to its own docket. It affirmed, because itconcluded that "the pricing order does not discriminate on itsface, is evenhanded in its application, and only incidentallyone-third of the milk, an assessment of one-third the difference between$15 and the federal minimum price generates enough revenue to give Massachusetts dairy farmers the entire difference between $15 and the federalminimum price without leaving any surplus. By paying Massachusettsdairy farmers the entire difference between $15 and the federal minimumprice, the order premium allows Massachusetts farmers whose cost of production is $15/cwt to sell their milk without loss at the federal minimumprice.6 For an explanation of the term "Class I," see n. 1, supra.7 A "producer" is defined as "any person producing milk from dairycattle." App. 33.8 The disbursement is subject to two qualifications. First, any farmerwho produced more than 200,000 pounds of milk is considered to haveproduced only 200,000 pounds. Second, no producer may receive payments that make its net price per cwt (including both the federal minimumprice and payments from the Equalization Fund) higher than $15/cwt. Ifthese limitations lead to a surplus in the Dairy Equalization Fund, thesurplus is returned to the dealers. Id., at 36-38.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT192 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v.

The court notedthat the "pricing order was designed to aid only Massachusetts producers." Id., at 16, 611 N. E. 2d, at 244. It con-ceded that "[c]ommon sense" indicated that the plan has an"adverse impact on interstate commerce" and that "[t]hefund distribution scheme does burden out-of-State producers." Id., at 17, 611 N. E. 2d, at 244. Nevertheless, thecourt asserted that "the burden is incidental given the purpose and design of the program." Id., at 18, 611 N. E. 2d,at 244. Because it found that the "local benefits" providedto the Commonwealth's dairy industry "outweigh any inci-dental burden on interstate commerce," it sustained the constitutionality of the pricing order. Id., at 19, 611 N. E. 2d,at 245. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 811 (1993), andnow reverse. IIThe Commerce Clause vests Congress with ample powerto enact legislation providing for the regulation of pricespaid to farmers for their products. United States v. Darby,312 U. S. 100 (1941); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942);Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal SugarCo., 334 U. S. 219 (1948). An affirmative exercise of thatpower led to the promulgation of the federal order settingminimum milk prices. The Commerce Clause also limitsthe power of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to adoptregulations that discriminate against interstate commerce."This `negative' aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibitseconomic protectionism--that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdeningout-of-state competitors. . . . Thus, state statutes that clearlydiscriminate against interstate commerce are routinelystruck down . . . unless the discrimination is demonstrablyjustified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protection512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT193Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courtism . . . ." New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S.269, 273-274 (1988).9The paradigmatic example of a law discriminating againstinterstate commerce is the protective tariff or customs duty,which taxes goods imported from other States, but does nottax similar products produced in State. A tariff is an attractive measure because it simultaneously raises revenue andbenefits local producers by burdening their out-of-state competitors. Nevertheless, it violates the principle of the unitary national market by handicapping out-of-state competitors, thus artificially encouraging in-state production evenwhen the same goods could be produced at lower cost inother States.Because of their distorting effects on the geography ofproduction, tariffs have long been recognized as violative ofthe Commerce Clause. In fact, tariffs against the productsof other States are so patently unconstitutional that ourcases reveal not a single attempt by any State to enact one.Instead, the cases are filled with state laws that aspire toreap some of the benefits of tariffs by other means. InBaldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935), theState of New York attempted to protect its dairy farmersfrom the adverse effects of Vermont competition by establishing a single minimum price for all milk, whetherproduced in New York or elsewhere. This Court did nothesitate, however, to strike it down. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Cardozo reasoned:9 The "negative" aspect of the Commerce Clause was considered themore important by the "father of the Constitution," James Madison. Inone of his letters, Madison wrote that the Commerce Clause "grew out ofthe abuse of the power by the importing States in taxing the nonimporting, and was intended as a negative and preventive provisionagainst injustice among the States themselves, rather than as a power tobe used for the positive purposes of the General Government." 3 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 478 (1911).512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT194 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the Court"Neither the power to tax nor the police power may beused by the state of destination with the aim and effectof establishing an economic barrier against competitionwith the products of another state or the labor of itsresidents. Restrictions so contrived are an unreason-able clog upon the mobility of commerce. They set upwhat is equivalent to a rampart of customs duties de-signed to neutralize advantages belonging to the placeof origin." Id., at 527.Thus, because the minimum price regulation had the sameeffect as a tariff or customs duty--neutralizing the advantage possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers--it washeld unconstitutional. Similarly, in Bacchus Imports, Ltd.v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), this Court invalidated a lawwhich advantaged local production by granting a tax exemption to certain liquors produced in Hawaii. Other cases ofthis kind are legion.Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275 (1876);Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434 (1880); Toomer v. Witsell,334 U. S. 385 (1948); Polar Ice Cream & Creamery Co. v.Andrews, 375 U. S. 361 (1964); Chemical Waste Management,Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992); see also Hunt v. Washing-ton State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 351(1977) (invalidating statute, because it "has the effect ofstripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive and economic advantages it has earned").Under these cases, Massachusetts' pricing order is clearlyunconstitutional. Its avowed purpose and its undisputed ef-fect are to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairy farmersto compete with lower cost dairy farmers in other States.The "premium payments" are effectively a tax which makesmilk produced out of State more expensive. Although thetax also applies to milk produced in Massachusetts, its effecton Massachusetts producers is entirely (indeed more than)offset by the subsidy provided exclusively to Massachusettsdairy farmers. Like an ordinary tariff, the tax is thus effec-tively imposed only on out-of-state products. The pricing512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT195Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courtorder thus allows Massachusetts dairy farmers who produceat higher cost to sell at or below the price charged by lowercost out-of-state producers.10 If there were no federal mini-mum prices for milk, out-of-state producers might still beable to retain their market share by lowering their prices.Nevertheless, out-of-staters' ability to remain competitive bylowering their prices would not immunize a discriminatorymeasure.New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S., at275.11 In this case, because the Federal Government sets10 A numerical example may make this effect clearer. Suppose the federal minimum price is $12/cwt, that out-of-state producers can sell milkprofitably at that price, but that in-state producers need a price of $15/cwtin order to break even. Under the pricing order, the tax or "order premium" will be $1/cwt (one-third the difference between the $15/cwt targetprice and the $12/cwt federal minimum price). Assuming the tax generates sufficient funds (which will be the case as long as two-thirds of themilk is produced out of State, which appears to be the case), the Massachusetts farmers will receive a subsidy of $3/cwt. This subsidy will allowthem to lower their prices from $15/cwt to $12/cwt while still breakingeven. Selling at $12/cwt, Massachusetts dairy farmers will now be ableto compete with out-of-state producers. The net effect of the tax andsubsidy, like that of a tariff, is to raise the after-tax price paid by thedealers. If exactly two-thirds of the milk sold in Massachusetts isproduced out of State, net prices will rise by $1/cwt. If out-of-state farmers produce more than two-thirds of the raw milk, the Dairy EqualizationFund will have a surplus, which will be refunded to the milk dealers.This refund will mitigate the price increase, although it will have no effecton the ability of the program to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairyfarmers to compete with lower cost out-of-staters.11 In New Energy, 486 U. S., at 275, we noted: "It is true that in [GreatAtlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U. S. 366 (1976),] and Sporhase[v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941 (1982),] the effect of a State'srefusal to accept the offered reciprocity was total elimination of all transport of the subject product into or out of the offering State; whereas inthe present case the only effect of refusal is that the out-of-state productis placed at a substantial commercial disadvantage through discriminatorytax treatment. That makes no difference for purposes of CommerceClause analysis. In the leading case of Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,294 U. S. 511 (1935), the New York law excluding out-of-state milk did notimpose an absolute ban, but rather allowed importation and sale so long512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT196 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the Courtminimum prices, out-of-state producers may not even havethe option of reducing prices in order to retain market share.The Massachusetts pricing order thus will almost certainly"cause local goods to constitute a larger share, and goodswith an out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, ofthe total sales in the market."12 Exxon Corp. v. Governorof Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 126, n. 16 (1978). In fact, thiseffect was the motive behind the promulgation of the pricingorder. This effect renders the program unconstitutional, be-cause it, like a tariff, "neutraliz[es] advantages belonging tothe place of origin." Baldwin, 294 U. S., at 527.In some ways, the Massachusetts pricing order is mostsimilar to the law at issue in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263 (1984). Both involve a broad-based tax on asingle kind of good and special provisions for in-state producas the initial purchase from the dairy farmer was made at or above theNew York State-mandated price. In other words, just as the appellanthere, in order to sell its product in Ohio, only has to cut its profits byreducing its sales price below the market price sufficiently to compensatethe Ohio purchaser-retailer for the forgone tax credit, so also the milkwholesaler-distributor in Baldwin, in order to sell its product in NewYork, only had to cut its profits by increasing its purchase price above themarket price sufficiently to meet the New York-prescribed premium. Weviewed the New York law as `an economic barrier against competition'that was `equivalent to a rampart of customs duties.' Id., at 527."12 That is not to say that the Massachusetts dairy industry may not continue to shrink and that the market share of Massachusetts dairy producers may not continue its fall. It may be the case that Massachusetts producers' costs are so high that, even with the pricing order, many of themwill be unable to compete. Nevertheless, the pricing order will certainlyallow more Massachusetts dairy farmers to remain in business than wouldhave had the pricing order not been imposed. For Commerce Clausepurposes, it does not matter whether the challenged regulation actuallyincreases the market share of local producers or whether it merely mitigates a projected decline. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S.263, 272 (1984) ("[W]e perceive no principle of Commerce Clause jurisprudence supporting a distinction between thriving and strugglingenterprises . . ."); Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S., at 523.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT197Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courters. Bacchus involved a 20% excise tax on all liquor sales,coupled with an exemption for fruit wine manufactured inHawaii and for okolehao, a brandy distilled from the root ofa shrub indigenous to Hawaii. The Court held that Hawaii'slaw was unconstitutional because it "had both the purposeand effect of discriminating in favor of local products."Id.,at 273. See also I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, 208U. S. 113 (1908) (invalidating property tax exemption favor-ing local manufacturers). By granting a tax exemption forlocal products, Hawaii in effect created a protective tariff.Goods produced out of State were taxed, but those producedin State were subject to no net tax. It is obvious that theresult inBacchus would have been the same if instead ofexempting certain Hawaiian liquors from tax, Hawaii hadrebated the amount of tax collected from the sale of thoseliquors. See New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S.269 (1988) (discriminatory tax credit). And if a discrimina-tory tax rebate is unconstitutional, Massachusetts' pricingorder is surely invalid; for Massachusetts not only rebates todomestic milk producers the tax paid on the sale of Massachusetts milk, but also the tax paid on the sale of milkproduced elsewhere.13 The additional rebate of the tax paidon the sale of milk produced elsewhere in no way reducesthe danger to the national market posed by tariff-like barriers, but instead exacerbates the danger by giving domesticproducers an additional tool with which to shore up theircompetitive position.1413 Indeed, it is this aspect of the pricing order which allows it to giveMassachusetts farmers a benefit three times as valuable per cwt as thetax (order premium) imposed. See n. 5, supra.14 One might attempt to distinguish Bacchus by noting that the rebatein this case goes not to the entity which pays the tax (milk dealers) but tothe dairy farmers themselves. Rebating the taxes directly to producersrather than to the dealers, however, merely reinforces the conclusion thatthe pricing order will favor local producers. If the taxes were refundedonly to the dealers, there might be no impact on interstate commerce,512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT198 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the CourtIIIRespondent advances four arguments against the conclu-sion that its pricing order imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce: (A) Because each component ofthe program--a local subsidy and a nondiscriminatory tax--is valid, the combination of the two is equally valid; (B) Thedealers who pay the order premiums (the tax) are not competitors of the farmers who receive disbursements from theDairy Equalization Fund, so the pricing order is not discriminatory; (C) The pricing order is not protectionist, becausethe costs of the program are borne only by Massachusettsdealers and consumers, and the benefits are distributed ex-clusively to Massachusetts farmers; and (D) The order's incidental burden on commerce is justified by the local benefitof saving the dairy industry from collapse. We discuss eachof these arguments in turn.ARespondent's principal argument is that, because "themilk order achieves its goals through lawful means," theorder as a whole is constitutional. Brief for Respondent 20.He argues that the payments to Massachusetts dairy farmersfrom the Dairy Equalization Fund are valid, because subsid-ies are constitutional exercises of state power, and that theorder premium which provides money for the fund is valid,because it is a nondiscriminatory tax. Therefore the pricingorder is constitutional, because it is merely the combinationof two independently lawful regulations. In effect, respond-ent argues, if the State may impose a valid tax on dealers,it is free to use the proceeds of the tax as it chooses; andbecause the dealers might not use the funds to increase the price or quantity of milk purchased from Massachusetts dairy farmers. The refund tothe dealers might, therefore, result in no advantage to in-state producers.On the other hand, by refunding moneys directly to the dairy farmers, thepricing order ensures that Massachusetts producers will benefit.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courtif it may independently subsidize its farmers, it is free tofinance the subsidy by means of any legitimate tax.Even granting respondent's assertion that both compo-nents of the pricing order would be constitutional standingalone,15 the pricing order nevertheless must fall. A puresubsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes noburden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business. The pricing order in this case, however, is fundedprincipally from taxes on the sale of milk produced in otherStates.16 By so funding the subsidy, respondent not only as-sists local farmers, but burdens interstate commerce. Thepricing order thus violates the cardinal principle that a Statemay not "benefit in-state economic interests by burdeningout-of-state competitors." New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S., at 273-274; see also Bacchus Imports, Ltd.v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 272; Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S., at 443.More fundamentally, respondent errs in assuming that theconstitutionality of the pricing order follows logically fromthe constitutionality of its component parts. By conjoining15 We have never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies,and we need not do so now. We have, however, noted that "[d]irect subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily run afoul" of the negativeCommerce Clause. New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278(1988); see also Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 815(1976) (Stevens, J., concurring). In addition, it is undisputed that Statesmay try to attract business by creating an environment conducive to economic activity, as by maintaining good roads, sound public education, orlow taxes. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 67 (1982) (Brennan, J., concurring); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 271; Metropolitan LifeIns. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 876-878 (1985).16 It is undisputed that an overwhelming majority of the milk sold inMassachusetts is produced elsewhere. Thus, even though the tax is applied evenhandedly to milk produced in State and out of State, most of thetax collected comes from taxes on milk from other States. In addition,the tax on in-state milk, unlike that imposed on out-of-state milk, does notimpose any burden on in-state producers, because in-state dairy farmerscan be confident that the taxes paid on their milk will be returned to themvia the Dairy Equalization Fund.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT200 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the Courta tax and a subsidy, Massachusetts has created a programmore dangerous to interstate commerce than either partalone. Nondiscriminatory measures, like the evenhandedtax at issue here, are generally upheld, in spite of any adverse effects on interstate commerce, in part because "[t]heexistence of major in-state interests adversely affected . . .is a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse." Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 473, n. 17(1981); see also Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434U. S. 429, 444, n. 18 (1978) (special deference to state highwayregulations because "their burden usually falls on local economic interests as well as other States' economic interests,thus insuring that a State's own political processes will serveas a check against unduly burdensome regulations"); SouthCarolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303U. S. 177, 187 (1938); Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 266(1989).17 However, when a nondiscriminatory tax is coupledwith a subsidy to one of the groups hurt by the tax, a State'spolitical processes can no longer be relied upon to preventlegislative abuse, because one of the in-state interests whichwould otherwise lobby against the tax has been mollified bythe subsidy. So, in this case, one would ordinarily have expected at least three groups to lobby against the order premium, which, as a tax, raises the price (and hence lowersdemand) for milk: dairy farmers, milk dealers, and consumers. But because the tax was coupled with a subsidy, oneof the most powerful of these groups, Massachusetts dairy17 The same principle is recognized in the conceptually similar field ofintergovernmental taxation, where nondiscrimination also plays a centralrole in setting the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible.

It is the entire program--not just thecontributions to the fund or the distributions from thatfund--that simultaneously burdens interstate commerce anddiscriminates in favor of local producers. The choice ofconstitutional means--nondiscriminatory tax and local sub-sidy--cannot guarantee the constitutionality of the programas a whole. New York's minimum price order also used con-stitutional means--a State's power to regulate prices--butwas held unconstitutional because of its deleterious effects.Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935). Simi-larly, the law held unconstitutional inBacchus Imports, Ltd.v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), involved the exercise of Hawaii'sundisputed power to tax and to grant tax exemptions.Our Commerce Clause jurisprudence is not so rigid as tobe controlled by the form by which a State erects barriersto commerce. Rather our cases have eschewed formalismfor a sensitive, case-by-case analysis of purposes and effects.As the Court declared over 50 years ago: "The commerceclause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. In each case it is our duty to determine whether thestatute under attack, whatever its name may be, will inits practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce." Best & Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U. S. 454, 455-456 (1940); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756 (1981);18 As the Governor's Special Commission Relative to the Establishmentof a Dairy Stabilization Fund realized, consumers would be unlikely toorganize effectively to oppose the pricing order. The commission's reportremarked, "the estimated two cent increase per quart of milk would notbe noticed by the consuming public," App. 18, because the price of milkvaries so often and for so many reasons that consumers would be unlikelyto feel the price increases or to attribute them to the pricing order.512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT202 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v.

BRespondent also argues that since the Massachusetts milkdealers who pay the order premiums are not competitors ofthe Massachusetts farmers, the pricing order imposes no dis-criminatory burden on commerce. Brief for Respondent 28-29. This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. Is it possi-ble to doubt that if Massachusetts imposed a higher sales taxon milk produced in Maine than milk produced in Massachu-setts that the tax would be struck down, in spite of the factthat the sales tax was imposed on consumers, and consumersdo not compete with dairy farmers? For over 150 years, ourcases have rightly concluded that the imposition of a differ-ential burden on any part of the stream of commerce--fromwholesaler to retailer to consumer--is invalid, because a bur-den placed at any point will result in a disadvantage to theout-of-state producer. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419,444, 448 (1827) ("So, a tax on the occupation of an importeris, in like manner, a tax on importation. It must add to theprice of the article, and be paid by the consumer, or by the512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the Courtimporter himself, in like manner as a direct duty on the arti-cle itself would be made." "The distinction between a taxon the thing imported, and on the person of the importer,can have no influence on this part of the subject. It is tooobvious for controversy, that they interfere equally with thepower to regulate commerce");I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v.Memphis, 208 U. S. 113 (1908) (differential burden on intermediate stage manufacturer); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263 (1984) (differential burden on wholesaler); Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344, 350 (1881) (differential burdenon sales agent); New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486U. S., at 273-274 (differential burden on retailer).CRespondent also argues that "the operation of the Orderdisproves any claim of protectionism," because"only in-stateconsumers feel the effect of any retail price increase . . .[and] [t]he dealers themselves . . . have a substantial in-statepresence." Brief for Respondent 17 (emphasis in original).This argument, if accepted, would undermine almost everydiscriminatory tax case. State taxes are ordinarily paid byin-state businesses and consumers, yet if they discriminateagainst out-of-state products, they are unconstitutional.The idea that a discriminatory tax does not interfere withinterstate commerce "merely because the burden of the taxwas borne by consumers" in the taxing State was thoroughlyrepudiated in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at272. The cost of a tariff is also borne primarily by localconsumers, yet a tariff is the paradigmatic CommerceClause violation.More fundamentally, respondent ignores the fact thatMassachusetts dairy farmers are part of an integrated inter-state market. As notedsupra, at 194-196, the purposeand effect of the pricing order are to divert market shareto Massachusetts dairy farmers. This diversion necessarilyinjures the dairy farmers in neighboring States. Further512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT204 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALYOpinion of the Courtmore, the Massachusetts order regulates a portion of thesame interstate market in milk that is more broadly regulated by a federal milk marketing order which covers most ofNew England. 7 CFR $ 1001.2 (1993). The Massachusettsproducers who deliver milk to dealers in that regulated mar-ket are participants in the same interstate milk market asthe out-of-state producers who sell in the same market andare guaranteed the same minimum blend price by the federalorder. The fact that the Massachusetts order imposes as-sessments only on Massachusetts sales and distributes themonly to Massachusetts producers does not exclude either theassessments or the payments from the interstate market.To the extent that those assessments affect the relative vol-ume of Class I milk products sold in the marketing area ascompared to other classes of milk products, they necessarilyaffect the blend price payable even to out-of-state producerswho sell only in non-Massachusetts markets.19 The obviousimpact of the order on out-of-state production demonstratesthat it is simply wrong to assume that the pricing order bur-dens only Massachusetts consumers and dealers.DFinally, respondent argues that any incidental burden oninterstate commerce "is outweighed by the `local benefits' ofpreserving the Massachusetts dairy industry." 20 Brief for19 On the way changing the demand for Class I milk products changesthe blend price for producers in the entire area covered by the marketingorder, see n. 1, supra.20 Among the "local benefits" that respondent identifies is "protectingunique open space and related benefits." Brief for Respondent 40. Asthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized by relegating the"open space" point to a single footnote, West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Commissioner of Dept. of Food and Agriculture, 415 Mass. 8, 10, n. 6, 611N. E. 2d 239, 240, n. 6 (1993), the argument that environmental benefitswere central and the enhancement of the market share of Massachusettsdairy farmers merely "incidental" turns the pricing order on its head. Inaddition, even if environmental preservation were the central purpose of512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 512 U. S. 186 (1994)Opinion of the CourtRespondent 42. In a closely related argument, respondenturges that "the purpose of the order, to save an industryfrom collapse, is not protectionist." Id., at 16. If we wereto accept these arguments, we would make a virtue of thevice that the rule against discrimination condemns. Preser-vation of local industry by protecting it from the rigors ofinterstate competition is the hallmark of the economic pro-tectionism that the Commerce Clause prohibits. InBac-chus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 272, we explicitlyrejected any distinction "between thriving and strugglingenterprises." Whether a State is attempting to " `enhancethriving and substantial business enterprises' " or to " `subsidize . . . financially troubled' " ones is irrelevant to CommerceClause analysis.Ibid. With his characteristic eloquence,Justice Cardozo responded to an argument that respondentechoes today:"The argument is pressed upon us, however, that theend to be served by the Milk Control Act is somethingmore than the economic welfare of the farmers or of anyother class or classes. The end to be served is the maintenance of a regular and adequate supply of pure andwholesome milk, the supply being put in jeopardy whenthe pricing order, that would not be sufficient to uphold a discriminatoryregulation. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626-627(1978). Finally, the suggestion that the collapse of the dairy industry endangers open space is not self-evident. Dairy farms are enclosed byfences, and the decline of farming may well lead to less, rather than more,intensive land use. As one scholar noted: "Many people assume that . . .land lost from agriculture is now in urban uses. It is true that someagricultural land has been urbanized, especially since World War II, butthe major portion of the land moving out of agriculture over the years hasbeen abandoned to natural forest growth."

MacConnell,Agricultural Land Use Change in Massachusetts 1951-1971, p. 5 (ResearchBulletin No. 640, Jan. 1977); see also Department of Agriculture, A.Daugherty, Major Uses of Land in the United States: 1987, pp. 4, 13 (Agricultural Economic Rep.
