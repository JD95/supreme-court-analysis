(1988 ed. andSupp. III) (Act), suspends various civil liabilities of personsin military service. At issue in this case is the provision in$ 525 that the "period of military service shall not be includedin computing any period . . . provided by any law for theredemption of real property sold or forfeited to enforce anyobligation, tax, or assessment." 1 The question presented is*Lawrence M.

Hewas on active duty continuously from 1966 until the time oftrial. In 1973, he purchased a parcel of vacant land in thetown of Danforth, Maine. He paid taxes on the property for10 years, but failed to pay the 1984, 1985, and 1986 local realestate taxes.2 In 1986, following the Maine statutory procedures that authorize it to acquire tax-delinquent real estate,the town sold the property.3In 1987, petitioner brought suit in the Maine DistrictCourt against the town and the two purchasers. He claimedthat $ 525 of the Act tolled the redemption period while hewas in military service, and federal law therefore preventedthe town from acquiring good title to the property eventhough the State's statutory procedures had been followed.The trial court rejected the claim. In an unreported opin-ion, it noted that some courts had construed $ 525 literally,but it elected to follow a line of decisions that refused to tollthe redemption period unless the taxpayer could show thatforfeited to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment." 50 U. S. C. App.$ 525 (1988 ed., Supp. III).2 He testified that he did not receive tax bills for those years and thathis letters asking for tax bills were not answered by the town.3 Under Maine law a taxing authority has a lien against real estate untilproperly assessed taxes are paid. If taxes remain unpaid for 30 daysafter a notice of lien and demand for payment has been sent to the owner,the tax collector may record a tax lien certificate to create a tax lienmortgage. The taxpayer then has an 18-month period of redemption inwhich he may recover his property by paying the overdue taxes plus interest and costs. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $$ 552, 942, 943 (1990). Itis stipulated that the required procedures were followed in this case andthat the town's title was perfected, unless petitioner's objection based on$ 525 requires a different result.507us2$51I 11-26-96 17:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT514 CONROY v. ANISKOFFOpinion of the Court"military service resulted in hardship excusing timely legalaction."4 It agreed with those courts that it would be"absurd and illogical" to toll limitations periods for careerservice personnel who had not been "handicapped by theirmilitary status." 5 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine af-firmed by an equally divided court.6 We granted certiorarito resolve the conflict in the interpretation of $ 525. 505U. S. 1203 (1992).IIThe statutory command in $ 525 is unambiguous, unequivo-cal, and unlimited. It states that the period of militaryservice "shall not be included" in the computation of "anyperiod now or hereafter provided by any law for the redemption of real property . . . ." Respondents do not dispute theplain meaning of this text. Rather, they argue that when$ 525 is read in the context of the entire statute, it implicitlyconditions its protection on a demonstration of hardship orprejudice resulting from military service. They make threepoints in support of this argument: that the history of theAct reveals an intent to provide protection only to thosewhose lives have been temporarily disrupted by militaryservice; that other provisions of the Act are expressly condi-tioned on a showing of prejudice; and that a literal interpretation produces illogical and absurd results. Neither sepa-rately nor in combination do these points justify a departurefrom the unambiguous statutory text.Respondents correctly describe the immediate cause forthe statute's enactment in 1940, the year before our entryinto World War II. Congress stated its purpose to "expedite the national defense under the emergent conditionswhich are threatening the peace and security of the United4 Pet. for Cert. 33. The court particularly relied on Pannell v. Continental Can Co., 554 F. 2d 216 (CA5 1977); Bailey v. Barranca, 83 N. M.90, 488 P. 2d 725 (1971); King v. Zagorski, 207 So. 2d 61 (Fla.

App. $ 510. That purpose undoubtedly contemplated the special hardship that military dutyimposed on those suddenly drafted into service by the national emergency.7 Neither that emergency, nor a particularlegislative interest in easing sudden transfers from civilianto military status, however, justifies the conclusion thatCongress did not intend all members of the Armed Forces,including career personnel, to receive the Act's protections.Indeed, because Congress extended the life of the Act indefinitely in 1948,8 well after the end of World War II, thecomplete legislative history confirms a congressional intentto protect all military personnel on active duty, just as thestatutory language provides.Respondents also correctly remind us to "follow the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole, see Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989), since the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context."King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Butas in King, the context of this statute actually supports theconclusion that Congress meant what $ 525 says. Severalprovisions of the statute condition the protection they offeron a showing that military service adversely affected theability to assert or protect a legal right. To choose one ofmany examples, $ 532(2) authorizes a stay of enforcement ofsecured obligations unless "the ability of the defendant tocomply with the terms of the obligation is not materially7 Respondents emphasize that the statement of purposes refers to the" `temporary suspension of legal proceedings and transactions.'

ANISKOFFOpinion of the Courtaffected by reason of his military service." 9 The compre-hensive character of the entire statute indicates that Congress included a prejudice requirement whenever it consid-ered it appropriate to do so, and that its omission of any suchrequirement in $ 525 was deliberate.Finally, both the history of this carefully reticulated statute, and our history of interpreting it, refute any argumentthat a literal construction of $ 525 is so absurd or illogicalthat Congress could not have intended it. In many respectsthe 1940 Act was a reenactment of World War I legislationthat had, in turn, been modeled after legislation that severalStates adopted during the Civil War. SeeBoone v. Lightner, 319 U. S. 561, 565-569 (1943). The Court had empha-sized the comprehensive character and carefully segregatedarrangement of the various provisions of the World War Istatute in Ebert v. Poston, 266 U. S. 548, 554 (1925), and ithad considered the consequences of requiring a showing ofprejudice when it construed the World War II statute inBoone, supra. Since we presume that Congress was famil-iar with those cases,10 we also assume that Congress considered the decision in Ebert to interpret and apply each provi-sion of the Act separately when it temporarily reestablishedthe law as a whole in 1940, and then considered Boone's anal-ysis of a prejudice requirement when it permanently extended the Act in 1948.Legislative history confirms that assumption. Since theenactment of the 1918 Act, Congress has expressed its un-derstanding that absolute exemptions might save time or9 Similar qualifications appear in $ 520(4) (applying to the reopening ofjudgments against an absent service member); $$ 521 and 523 (providingfor stays of legal proceedings, attachments, and garnishments); $ 526 (regulating interest rates on obligations incurred prior to military service);$ 530(3) (covering eviction and distress proceedings); $ 531(3) (involvingthe termination of installment contracts); $ 535(1) (involving the assignment of insurance coverage); and $ 535(2) (limiting the right to enforceliens for the storage of personal property).10 See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-697 (1979).507us2$51I 11-26-96 17:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT517Cite as: 507 U.

By distinguishing sharply between the two typesof protections, Congress unquestionably contemplated theways that either type of protection would affect both mili-tary debtors and their civilian creditors.The long and consistent history and the structure of thislegislation therefore lead us to conclude that--just as thelanguage of $ 525 suggests--Congress made a deliberate pol-icy judgment placing a higher value on firmly protecting theservice member's redemption rights than on occasionallyburdening the tax collection process. Given the limitednumber of situations in which this precisely structured stat-ute offers such absolute protection, we cannot say that Con11 The House Report on the suspension of suits in the 1918 Act, for example, provided in part:"The lesson of the stay laws of the Civil War teaches that an arbitraryand rigid protection against suits is as much a mistaken kindness to thesoldier as it is unnecessary. A total suspension for the period of the warof all rights against a soldier defeats its own purpose. In time of warcredit is of even more importance than in time of peace, and if there werea total prohibition upon enforcing obligations against one in military service, the credit of a soldier and his family would be utterly cut off. No onecould be found who would extend them credit." H. R. Rep. No. 181, 65thCong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1917).And Congressman Webb, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,stated:"Manifestly, if this Congress should undertake to pass an arbitrary staylaw providing that no creditor should ever sue or bring proceedingsagainst any soldier while in the military service of his country, that wouldupset business very largely in many parts of the country. In the nextplace, it would be unfair to the creditor as well as to the soldier. It woulddisturb the soldier's credit probably in many cases and would deny theright of the creditor to his just debts from a person who was amply ableto pay and whose military service did not in the least impair his ability tomeet the obligation." 55 Cong.
