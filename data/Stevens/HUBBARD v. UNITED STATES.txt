Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that, because a federal court is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within $ 1001's meaning, the statute does not apply to false statements made in judicial proceedings.Pp. 699-708, 715.(a) A straightforward interpretation of $ 1001's text, with special emphasis on the words "department or agency," leads inexorably to theconclusion that there is no need for any judicial function exception because the statute's reach simply does not extend to courts. Under botha commonsense reading and the terms of 18 U. S. C. $ 6--which appliesto all of Title 18 and defines "agency" to include, inter alia, any federal"department, independent establishment, commission, administration,authority, board or bureau"--it seems incontrovertible that "agency"does not refer to a court. Moreover, although $ 6 defines "department"to mean an "executive departmen[t] . . . unless the context shows thatsuch term was intended to describe the . . . legislative . . . or judicialbranches," there is nothing in $ 1001's text, or in any related legislation,that even suggests--let alone "shows"--that something other than acomponent of the Executive Branch was intended in this instance.Pp. 699-702.514us3$56Z 06-11-98 18:04:52 PAGES OPINPGT696 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESSyllabus(b) The Bramblett Court erred by giving insufficient weight to theplain language of $$ 6 and 1001 and, instead, broadly interpreting "department" in $ 1001 to refer to the Executive, Legislative, and JudicialBranches. Rather than attempting to reconcile its interpretation withthe usual meaning of "department," that Court relied on a review of theevolution of $ 1001 and a related statute as providing a "context" for theconclusion that "Congress could not have intended to leave frauds suchas [Bramblett's] without penalty." 348 U. S., at 509. Although a statute's historical evolution should not be discounted, such an analysis normally provides less guidance to meaning than the final text. Here, astraightforward reading suggests a meaning of "department" that isfully consistent with $ 6's presumptive definition. Moreover, the statutory history chronicled in Bramblett is at best inconclusive and doesnot supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrant departure from thatdefinition. Pp. 702-708.(c) Bramblett is hereby overruled. P. 715.Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg and JusticeBreyer, concluded in Parts IV and V:1. A review of pertinent lower court decisions demonstrates that thejudicial function exception is an obvious attempt to impose limits onBramblett's expansive reading of $ 1001 and that the exception has asubstantial and longstanding following. Pp. 708-711.2. The doctrine of stare decisis does not require this Court to acceptBramblett's erroneous interpretation of $ 1001. Reconsideration of thatcase is permitted here (1) because of a highly unusual intervening development of the law--the judicial function exception--which is fairly characterized as a competing legal doctrine that can lay a legitimate claimto respect as a settled body of law, and (2) because of the absence ofsignificant reliance interests in adhering to Bramblett on the part ofprosecutors and Congress. Pp. 711-715.Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy, agreed that UnitedStates v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503, should be overruled, but concludedthat the doctrine of stare decisis may be ignored in this case not becausethe judicial function exception represents an intervening developmentof the law, but because of the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett'smistaken reading of $ 1001 poses a risk that the threat of criminalprosecution under $ 1001's capacious provisions will deter vigorousrepresentation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries controlthe machinery of $ 1001 prosecution. That problem can be judiciallyavoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner thatis irrational or by importing exceptions, such as the judicial functionexception, that have no basis in law.

Bramblett, 348U. S. 503 (1955), the District Court instructed the jury thata bankruptcy court is a "department . . . of the UnitedStates" within the meaning of $ 1001. The jury convicted petitioner on all three $ 1001 counts, and the DistrictCourt sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months'imprisonment.On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,petitioner argued that his convictions under $ 1001 werebarred by the so-called "judicial function" exception.

That conclusioncreated a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.2 513 U. S. 959 (1994). We now reverse.IISection 1001 criminalizes false statements and similar misconduct occurring "in any matter within the jurisdiction ofany department or agency of the United States." In ordinary parlance, federal courts are not described as "departments" or "agencies" of the Government. As noted by theSixth Circuit, it would be strange indeed to refer to a courtas an "agency." See 16 F. 3d, at 698, n. 4 ("[T]he U. S. Courtof Appeals [is not] the Appellate Adjudication Agency").And while we have occasionally spoken of the three branchesof our Government, including the Judiciary, as "department[s]," e. g., Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 500 (1867),that locution is not an ordinary one. Far more common isthe use of "department" to refer to a component of the Executive Branch.2 The judicial function exception has been recognized in the followingcases: United States v. Masterpol, 940 F. 2d 760, 764-766 (CA2 1991);United States v. Holmes, 840 F. 2d 246, 248 (CA4), cert. denied, 488 U. S.831 (1988); United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAs an initial matter, therefore, one might be tempted toconclude that $ 1001 does not apply to falsehoods made during federal-court proceedings. This commonsense readingis bolstered by the statutory definitions of "department" and"agency" set forth at 18 U. S. C. $ 6. First adopted in 1948,and applicable to all of Title 18, the definitions create a pre-sumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of the terms atissue:"The term `department' means one of the executivedepartments enumerated in section 1 [now $ 101] ofTitle 5, unless the context shows that such term wasintended to describe the executive, legislative, or judi-cial branches of the government."The term `agency' includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietaryinterest, unless the context shows that such term wasintended to be used in a more limited sense."Under $ 6, it seems incontrovertible that "agency" does notrefer to a court.3 "Department," on the other hand, mightbe interpreted under $ 6 to describe the Judicial Branch,but only if the "context" of $ 1001 "shows" that Congressintended the word to be used in the unusual sense employed in Mississippi v. Johnson. We believe that $ 6 permits such an interpretation only if the context in $ 1001 isfairly powerful. "Shows" is a strong word; among its definitions is "[t]o make apparent or clear by evidence, testimonyor reasoning; to prove; demonstrate." Webster's New International Dictionary 2324 (2d ed. 1949). Cf. Rowland v.California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council,506 U.YS. 194, 200-201 (1993) (discussing similar provision3 We express no opinion as to whether any other entity within the Judicial Branch might be an "agency" within the meaning of $ 6.514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT701Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of the Courtrequiring adherence to presumptive definition unless context"indicate[d]" a different meaning).4In Rowland, we explained the proper method of analyzinga statutory term's "context" to determine when a presumptive definition must yield. Such an analysis, we explained,requires a court to examine "the text of the Act of Congresssurrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other relatedcongressional Acts . . . ."Id., at 199; see also id., at 212-213(Thomas, J., dissenting); Monell v. New York City Dept. ofSocial Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 689-690, n. 53 (1978). Reviewof other materials is not warranted. "If Congress hadmeant to point further afield, as to legislative history, forexample, it would have been natural to use a more spaciousphrase, like `evidence of congressional intent,' in place of`context.' "Rowland, 506 U. S., at 200.In the case of $ 1001, there is nothing in the text of thestatute, or in any related legislation, that even suggests--letalone "shows"--that the normal definition of "department"was not intended. Accordingly, a straightforward interpre-tation of the text of $ 1001, with special emphasis on thewords "department or agency," would seem to lead inexora-bly to the conclusion that there is no need for any judicialfunction exception because the reach of the statute simplydoes not extend to courts. Our task, however, is complicated by the fact that the Court interpreted "department"broadly 40 years ago inBramblett. We must, therefore,4 Congress' use of the word "shows" is unsurprising in view of the factthat 18 U. S. C. $ 6 provides statutory definitions exclusively for criminalstatutes. We have often emphasized the need for clarity in the definitionof criminal statutes, to provide "fair warning . . . in language that thecommon world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certainline is passed." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931). Seealso United States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979); Lanzetta v. NewJersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Adhering to the statutory definition ofa particular term is fully consistent with this objective. Cf. Rowland, 506U. S., at 199 (construing 1 U. S. C. $ 1, which is generally applicable to anyAct of Congress).514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT702 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtturn our attention to that case before deciding the fate of thejudicial function exception.IIIDefendant Bramblett was a former Member of Congresswho had falsely represented to the Disbursing Office of theHouse of Representatives that a particular person was enti-tled to compensation as his official clerk. He argued that hecould not be convicted under $ 1001 because his falsehoodwas directed to an office within the Legislative Branch. 348U. S., at 504. The Court rejected this argument, concludingthat the word "department," as used in $ 1001, "was meantto describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches ofthe Government."Id., at 509. Although Bramblett in-volved Congress, not the courts, the text and reasoning inthe Court's opinion amalgamated all three branches of theGovernment. Thus,Bramblett is highly relevant here eventhough its narrow holding only extended $ 1001 to false statements made within the Legislative Branch.We think Bramblett must be acknowledged as a seriouslyflawed decision. Significantly, the Bramblett Court made noattempt to reconcile its interpretation with the usual meaning of "department." It relied instead on a review of theevolution of $ 1001 and its statutory cousin, the false claimsstatute presently codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287, as providing a"context" for the conclusion that "Congress could not haveintended to leave frauds such as [Bramblett's] without pen-alty." 348 U. S., at 509. We are convinced that the Courterred by giving insufficient weight to the plain language of$$ 6 and 1001.5 Although the historical evolution of a stat5 In addition, it is debatable at best whether the Court was correct inasserting that, but for its expansive interpretation of $ 1001, Bramblett'sfraud would necessarily have gone unpunished. In discussing the evolution of $ 1001, the Court noted that the false claims statute, originallyenacted in 1863 and by 1955 codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287, "clearly coversthe presentation of false claims against any component of the Government514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT703Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of the Courtute--based on decisions by the entire Congress--should notbe discounted for the reasons that may undermine confidencein the significance of excerpts from congressional debatesand committee reports,6 a historical analysis normally provides less guidance to a statute's meaning than its final text.In the ordinary case, absent any "indication that doing sowould frustrate Congress's clear intention or yield patent ab-surdity, our obligation is to apply the statute as Congresswrote it." BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S.531, 570 (1994) (Souter, J., dissenting).As noted above, a straightforward reading of the statutesuggests a meaning of "department" that is fully consistentwith the definition set forth in $ 6. Seesupra, at 699-702.Similarly unremarkable is the language of the original Actof Congress adopting what is now $ 1001. That piece of leg-islation--the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 996 (1934 Act)--to any officer of the Government." United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S.503, 505 (1955). In an earlier decision, it had interpreted "claim" in thefalse claims statute broadly, explaining that the word referred to "a claimfor money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government's own liability to the claimant."United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 345-346 (1926). Bramblett couldthus seemingly have been charged with violating $ 287, or at least aidingand abetting in a violation of that statute, since his misrepresentationwas intended to procure Government compensation. See SupplementalMemorandum for the United States in United States v. Bramblett, O. T.1954, No. 159 (arguing that Bramblett's conviction could be affirmed because his conduct violated all the elements of $ 287). In today's decision,we do not disturb the scope of $ 287 as construed in either Cohn orBramblett.Bramblett's fraud also was arguably directed at an "agency" within themeaning of $ 1001. The Court recognized this contention, noting "it mightbe argued, as the Government does, that the [Disbursing Office] is an`authority' within the $ 6 definition of `agency.' " 348 U. S., at 509. TheCourt refused, however, to rest its decision on that more narrow interpretation. Ibid.6 See, e. g., Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U. S. 174, 191-192 (1988)(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); but cf. Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 845 (1992).514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT704 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtamended what was then $ 35 of the Criminal Code to provide,in pertinent part:"[W]hoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or con-ceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraud-ulent statements or representations, or make or use orcause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher,roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition,knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitiousstatement or entry,in any matter within the jurisdic-tion of any department or agency of the United Statesor of any corporation in which the United States ofAmerica is a stockholder . . . [shall be punished]." (Emphasis added.)This language conveys no different message regarding "de-partment" than the current version of $ 1001.What, then, of the earlier statutory history chronicled inBramblett? We believe it is at best inconclusive, and thatit does not supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrantdeparture from the presumptive definition in 18 U. S. C. $ 6.The earliest statutory progenitor of $ 1001 was the originalfalse claims statute, adopted as the Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67,12 Stat. 696 (1863 Act). That enactment made it a criminaloffense for any person, whether a civilian or a member of themilitary services, to"present or cause to be presented for payment or ap-proval to or by any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States, any claim upon oragainst the Government of the United States, or anydepartment or officer thereof, knowing such claim to befalse, fictitious, or fraudulent."77 In Bramblett, the Court incorrectly stated that the 1863 Act only penalized misconduct by members of the military. In fact, $ 3 of the Actestablished criminal and civil penalties for false claims and other misdeeds514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT705Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe 1863 Act also proscribed false statements, but the scopeof that provision was far narrower than that of modern-day$ 1001; the Act prohibited only those false statements made"for the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of [a false] claim." 12 Stat. 696. TheCourt explained in Bramblett that the false claims provisionin the 1863 Act "clearly cover[ed] the presentation of falseclaims against any component of the Government to any officer of the Government," 348 U. S., at 505, and it assertedsimilar breadth for the false statement portion of the Act,ibid.The false statements provision in the 1863 Act remainedessentially unchanged for 55 years.8 In 1918, Congressamended the statute to provide as follows:"[W]hoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding toobtain the payment or approval of [a false] claim, or forthe purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the UnitedStates, or any department thereof, or any corporationin which the United States of America is a stockholder,shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal orcover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact,or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulentstatements or representations, or make or use or causeto be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll,account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitiousstatement or entry [shall be punished]." Act of Oct. 23,committed by "any person not in the military or naval forces of the UnitedStates." 12 Stat. 698.8 In 1873, the statute was codified and minor changes were made. SeeRev. Stat. $ 5438. The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30, 1908,35 Stat. 555, and the statute was recodified as $ 35 of the Criminal Codein the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1095.514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT706 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015-1016 (1918 Act) (emphasisadded).The scope of this new provision is unclear. Although itcould be read to create criminal liability for governmentwide false statements, its principal purpose seems to havebeen to prohibit false statements made to defraud Government corporations, which flourished during World War I.Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513U. S. 374, 386-391 (1995) (tracing history of Government cor-porations). In one important respect, moreover, the statuteremained relatively narrow: It was limited to false state-ments intended to bilk the Government out of money orproperty. See United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339 (1926).Given the continuing focus on financial frauds against theGovernment, the 1918 Act did not alter the fundamentalcharacter of the original false claims statute.The 1934 Act, which created the statute we now know as$ 1001, did work such a change. Congress excised from thestatute the references to financial frauds, thereby severingthe historical link with the false claims portion of the statute,and inserted the requirement that the false statement bemade "in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States." This addition, criti-cal for present purposes, is subject to two competing inferences. On one hand, it can be read to impose new words oflimitation--whose ordinary meaning connotes the ExecutiveBranch--in an altogether reformulated statute. On theother hand, it can be viewed as stripping away the financialfraud requirement while not disturbing the pre-existingbreadth the statute had enjoyed from its association with thefalse claims statute.The Bramblett Court embraced the latter inference, finding no indication in any legislative history that the amend-ment was intended to narrow the scope of the statute. Wethink this interpretation, though not completely implausible,is nevertheless unsound. The differences between the 1934514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT707Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of the CourtAct and its predecessors are too dramatic to evidence a con-gressional intent to carry forward any features of the oldprovision. Moreover, our comments, over the years, regard-ing the 1934 legislation--including those contained inBramblett itself--contradict the notion that such a "carry forward" occurred.We have repeatedly recognized that the 1934 Act waspassed at the behest of "the Secretary of the Interior to aidthe enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforce-ment of regulations . . . with respect to the transportation of`hot oil.' " United States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S. 86, 93-94(1941); see alsoUnited States v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 72(1984) (the 1934 Act was "needed to increase the protectionof federal agencies from the variety of deceptive practicesplaguing the New Deal administration");id., at 80 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (the statute was prompted by problemsarising from "the advent of the New Deal programs in the1930's"). Indeed, the Bramblett Court itself acknowledgedthe connection between the 1934 Act and the proliferation offraud in the newly formed Executive agencies:"The 1934 revision was largely the product of the urging of the Secretary of the Interior. The Senate Re-port, S. Rep. No. 1202, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., indicates thatits purpose was to broaden the statute so as to reach notonly false papers presented in connection with a claimagainst the Government, but also nonmonetary fraudssuch as those involved in the `hot-oil' shipments." 348U. S., at 507.None of our opinions refers to any indication that Congresseven considered whether the 1934 Act might apply outsidethe Executive Branch, much less that it affirmatively understood the new enactment to create broad liability for falsehoods in the federal courts. In light of this vacuum, it wouldbe curious indeed if Congress truly intended the 1934 Act to514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT708 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.work a dramatic alteration in the law governing misconductin the court system or the Legislature. The unlikelihoodof such a scenario only strengthens our conclusion that theBramblett Court erred in its interpretation of $ 1001's statutory history.PuttingBramblett's historical misapprehensions to oneside, however, we believe the Bramblett Court committed afar more basic error in its underlying approach to statutoryconstruction. Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plainlanguage of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. InBramblett, the Court's method of analysis resulted in a deci-sion that is at war with the text of not one, but two differentActs of Congress.Whether the doctrine of stare decisis nevertheless requires that we accept Bramblett's erroneous interpretationof $ 1001 is a question best answered after reviewing thebody of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judi-cial function exception.IVAlthough other federal courts have refrained from directlycriticizingBramblett's approach to statutory construction, itis fair to say that they have greeted the decision with something less than a warm embrace. The judicial function ex-ception, an obvious attempt to impose limits onBramblett'sexpansive reading of $ 1001, is a prime example. As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception isalmost as deeply rooted as Bramblett itself.The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven yearsafter Bramblett was decided. In Morgan v. United States,309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), thedefendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fidemember of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating $ 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity,514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT709Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of Stevens, J.and nonadmission to the bar. After first acknowledgingthat, but for Bramblett, it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend $ 1001 to apply to thecourts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. But thecourt was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of $ 1001.Noting that the statute prohibits "concealment" and "covering up" of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods,the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within thebounds of responsible advocacy.9 The court concluded itsopinion with this significant comment:"We are certain that neither Congress nor the SupremeCourt intended the statute to include traditional trialtactics within the statutory terms `conceals or coversup.' We hold only, on the authority of the SupremeCourt construction, that the statute does apply to thetype of action with which appellant was charged, actionwhich essentially involved the `administrative' or `housekeeping' functions, not the `judicial' machinery of thecourt." 309 F. 2d, at 237.Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit reversed a conviction several years later "because$ 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documentsas evidence in a criminal proceeding." United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam). The courtexplained that the judicial function exception suggested inMorgan was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, withits two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined. 381 F. 2d, at 175.9 " `Does a defendant "cover up . . . a material fact" when he pleads notguilty?' `Does an attorney "cover up" when he moves to exclude hearsaytestimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalfof a client he knows to be guilty?'

UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.Once planted, the judicial function exception began toflower in a number of other Circuits. The Ninth Circuitsummarized the state of the law in 1985:"[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisionssince 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decidedthat section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch. In these twenty-threeyears, there has been no response on the part ofCongress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that noexception exists." United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relyingin part on the congressional acquiescence to which the NinthCircuit had adverted in Mayer. The Second Circuit wrote:"No court, to our knowledge, whether due to its acceptance of the exception or to prosecutorial reticence,has ever sustained a section 1001 conviction for falsestatements made by a defendant to a court acting in itsjudicial capacity. The exception was first articulatednearly thirty years ago and `. . . [i]t therefore seems toolate in the day to hold that no exception exists.' Mayer,775 F. 2d at 1390." United States v. Masterpol, 940F. 2d 760, 766.1010 Some 17 years before Masterpol, the Second Circuit restricted theapplication of $ 1001 in a slightly different manner. In United States v.D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a $ 1001 convictionarising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civillawsuit. Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history,the court concluded that $ 1001 did not apply "where the Government isinvolved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved."

S. 695 (1995)Opinion of Stevens, J.Although not all of the courts of appeals have endorsedthe judicial function exception, it is nevertheless clear thatthe doctrine has a substantial following. See n. 2, supra.Moreover, as both the Ninth and the Second Circuits observed, Congress has not seen fit to repudiate, limit, or refinethe exception despite its somewhat murky borders and itsobvious tension with the text of the statute as construed inBramblett. On the other hand, it is also true that Congresshas not seen fit to overturn the holding in Bramblett, despitethe fact that the opinions endorsing the judicial function ex-ception evidence a good deal of respectful skepticism aboutthe correctness of that decision.VWith the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn tothe difficultstare decisis question that this case presents.It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier cases. As Justice Cardozo reminded us:"The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in everycase, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on thesecure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gonebefore him." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process149 (1921). Adherence to precedent also serves an indis-pensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.Stare decisis is "a basic self-governing principle within theJudicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive anddifficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudentialsystem that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' "Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989)(quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888)(A. Hamilton)). See also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) ( joint opinionofO'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Respect forprecedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction,where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation514US3 Unit: $U56 [01-06-00 07:03:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN712 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S.720, 736 (1977).11In this case, these considerations point in two conflictingdirections. On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of $ 1001 adopted in Bramblett; on the other, theyargue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut backon the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.For if the word "department" encompasses the Judiciary, asBramblett stated, 348 U. S., at 509, the judicial functionexception cannot be squared with the text of the statute.A court is a court--and is part of the Judicial Branch--whether it is functioning in a housekeeping or judicial capacity. Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preservedthe thrust of the judicial function exception--i. e., if we in-terpreted 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 so that it did not reach conductoccurring in federal-court proceedings. Again, althoughBramblett involved a false representation to an office withinthe Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all threebranches together in one and the same breath. See 384U. S., at 509 ("department" in $ 1001 "was meant to describethe executive, legislative and judicial branches of theGovernment").11 See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S., at 172-173(stare decisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, forhere, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislativepower is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we havedone"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S.409, 424 (1986) (noting "the strong presumption of continued validity thatadheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute"); Runyon v. McCrary,427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn "aline of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectlydecided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932)(Brandeis, J., dissenting) ("Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, becausein most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law besettled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true, even wherethe error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be hadby legislation") (citation omitted).514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT713Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of Stevens, J.We think the text of $ 1001 forecloses any argument thatwe should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception. We are, however, persuaded thatthe clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of Bramblett.12 Although such a reconsideration is appropriate onlyin the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permitsit because of a highly unusual "intervening development ofthe law," seePatterson, 491 U. S., at 173, and because ofthe absence of significant reliance interests in adhering toBramblett.The "intervening development" is, of course, the judicialfunction exception. In a virtually unbroken line of cases,respected federal judges have interpreted $ 1001 so narrowlythat it has had only a limited application within the JudicialBranch. See nn. 2 and 10,supra. This interpretation hasroots both deep and broad in the lower courts. Althoughthe judicial function exception has not been adopted by thisCourt, our review ofBramblett supports the conclusion thatthe cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect theintent of Congress. It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a "competing legal doctrin[e]," Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173, that can lay a legitimate claim torespect as a settled body of law. OverrulingBramblettwould preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, tothat extent, promote stability in the law.1312 Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closelyto Bramblett, we find no merit in the Government's suggestion that areconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in thequestion on which we granted certiorari. See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995).13 The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will "induce" federaljudges on the courts of appeals to "ignore" precedents from this Courtand thereby invite chaos in the judicial system. Post, at 721. We wouldhave thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents. Indeed, the dissent's dire prediction is at odds with its own observation that "no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT714 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens"have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in thisinstance overruling the decision would dislodge settledrights and expectations or require an extensive legislativeresponse." Hilton v. South Carolina Public RailwaysComm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); see also Casey, 505 U. S.,at 854-856 ( joint opinion ofO'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Here, however, the reliance interests at stake inadhering to Bramblett are notably modest. In view of theextensive array of statutes that already exist to penalizefalse statements within the Judicial Branch, see, e. g., 18U. S. C. $ 1621 (perjury); $ 1623 (false declarations beforegrand jury or court); $ 1503 (obstruction of justice); $ 287(false claims against the United States), we doubt that prose-cutors have relied on $ 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct.14 But weneed not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point.The United States Attorneys' Manual states quite plainlythat "[p]rosecutions should not be brought under 18 U. S. C.$ 1001 for false statements submitted in federal court pro-ceedings"; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under theperjury or obstruction of justice statutes. U. S. Dept. ofof a higher court," see post, at 720. In concluding that the cases adoptingthe judicial function exception are faithful to the intent of the Legislaturethat adopted $ 1001, we have obviously exercised our own independentjudgment. Thus, far from "subvert[ing] the very principle on which ahierarchical court system is built," post, at 719, our decision merely reflects our assessment of the statutory construction issue this case presents, while serving what the dissent acknowledges to be one of the central purposes of stare decisis: promoting "stability and certainty in thelaw," post, at 720.14 The perjury and false claims statutes also cover the LegislativeBranch, as does 18 U. S. C. $ 1505 (obstruction of justice). The existenceof overlaps with other statutes does not itself militate in favor of overruling Bramblett; Congress may, and often does, enact separate criminal statutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same conduct. See UnitedStates v. Batchelder, 442 U. S., at 123-124; United States v. Gilliland, 312U. S. 86, 95 (1941). The overlaps here simply demonstrate that prosecutors cannot be said to have any significant reliance interest in Bramblett.514us3$56I 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT715Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)Opinion of the CourtJustice, United States Attorneys' Manual || 9-69.267 (1992).Clearer evidence of nonreliance can scarcely be imagined.15Similarly unimpressive is the notion of congressional reli-ance onBramblett. The longstanding judicial function exception has, to a large extent, negated the actual applicationof $ 1001 within the Judiciary. It is unlikely that Congresshas relied on what has, for many years, been an unfulfilledpromise.In sum, although thestare decisis issue in this case is difficult, we conclude that there are sound reasons to correctBramblett's erroneous construction of $ 1001. Although wecould respect prior decisions by endorsing the judicial func-tion exception or by adhering toBramblett while repudiating that exception, we believe coherence and stability in thelaw will best be served in this case by taking a differentcourse. Limiting the coverage of $ 1001 to the area plainlymarked by its text will, as a practical matter, preserve theinterpretation of $ 1001 that has prevailed for over 30 yearsand will best serve the administration of justice in the future.VIBramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federalcourt is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within themeaning of $ 1001. The Court of Appeals' decision is therefore reversed to the extent that it upheld petitioner's convic-tions under $ 1001.
