Michael Manso gave his employer a false excuse for beinglate to work and repeated that falsehood while testifyingunder oath before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).

S. 317 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcertiorari to consider whether Manso's misconduct shouldhave precluded the Board from granting him that relief.IManso worked as a casual dockworker at petitioner ABFFreight System, Inc.'s (ABF's) trucking terminal in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from the summer of 1987 to August1989. He was fired three times. The first time, Manso was1 of 12 employees discharged in June 1988 in a dispute overa contractual provision relating to so-called "preferentialcasual" dockworkers.1 The grievance Manso's union filedeventually secured his reinstatement; Manso also filed anunfair labor practice charge against ABF over the incident.Manso's return to work was short lived. Three supervisors warned him of likely retaliation from top management--alerting him, for example, that ABF was "gunning" forhim, App. 96, and that "the higher echelon was after [him],"id., at 96-97. See also ABF Freight System, Inc., 304N. L. R. B. 585, 592, 597 (1991). Within six weeks ABF dis-charged Manso for a second time on pretextual grounds--ostensibly for failing to respond to a call to work made undera stringent verification procedure ABF had recently imposedupon preferential casuals.2 Once again, a grievance panelordered Manso reinstated.1 ABF at this time had three dockworker classifications: those on theregular seniority list, nonpreferential casuals, and preferential casuals.ABF Freight System, Inc., 304 N. L. R. B. 585, 589, n. 10 (1991). A supplemental labor agreement ABF negotiated with the union in April 1988created the preferential casual dockworker classification with certain seniority rights. Id., at 585-586.2 The policy required preferential casuals--though not other dockworkers--to be available by phone prior to a shift in case a foreman neededthem to work. A worker who did not respond risked disciplinary action for failing to "protect his shift"; two such failures authorized ABFto discharge the worker. Id., at 597. ABF issued a written warning toManso on May 6, 1989, after he failed to respond to such a call. On June19, a supervisor again asked a regular dockworker to summon Manso towork just prior to 6 a.m. for the 8:30 a.m. shift. When Manso did not510us2$18I 06-23-97 18:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT320 ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the CourtManso's third discharge came less than two months later.On August 11, 1989, Manso arrived four minutes late for the5 a.m. shift. At the time, ABF had no policy regarding lateness. After Manso was late to work, however, ABF decidedto discharge preferential casuals--though not other employees--who were late twice without good cause. Six dayslater Manso triggered the policy's first application when hearrived at work nearly an hour late for the same shift.Manso telephoned at 5:25 a.m. to explain that he was havingcar trouble on the highway, and repeated that excuse whenhe arrived. ABF conducted a prompt investigation, ascertained that he was lying,3 and fired him for tardiness underits new policy on lateness.Manso filed a second unfair labor practice charge. In thehearing before the ALJ, Manso repeated his story about thecar trouble that preceded his third discharge. The ALJcredited most of his testimony about events surrounding hisdismissals, but expressly concluded that Manso lied when hetold ABF that car trouble made him late to work. Id., at600. Accordingly, although the ALJ decided that ABF hadillegally discharged Manso the second time because he was aanswer, the employee who had dialed his number asked to dial it again,fearing he had misdialed. The supervisor denied permission and insteadhad the employee sign a form verifying that Manso had not responded.Manso was then discharged. The ALJ found that the special call policydiscriminated against preferential casual dockworkers as a class, id., at598, 600; both the ALJ and the Board concluded that it was discriminatorily applied to Manso, id., at 600, 589, n. 11.3 Manso told ABF management that his car had overheated on the highway, that he had to phone his wife to pick him up and take him to work.Manso also said a deputy sheriff stopped him for speeding in his ensuingrush. A plant manager who looked for Manso's overheated car on thehighway found nothing, however, and the officer who Manso said issuedhim a warning for speeding told ABF officials--and later the ALJ--thatManso had been alone in the car.510us2$18I 06-23-97 18:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 510 U. S. 317 (1994)Opinion of the Courtparty to the earlier union grievance,4 the ALJ denied Mansorelief for the third discharge based on his finding that ABFhad dismissed Manso for cause. Ibid.The Board affirmed the ALJ's finding that Manso's seconddischarge was unlawful, but reversed with respect to thethird discharge.Id., at 591. Acknowledging that Mansolied to his employer and that ABF presumably could havedischarged him for that dishonesty, id., at 590, n. 13, theBoard nevertheless emphasized that ABF did not in fact discharge him for lying and that the ALJ's conclusion to thecontrary was "a plainly erroneous factual statement of[ABF]'s asserted reasons." 5 Instead, Manso's lie "estab-lished only that he did not have a legitimate excuse for theAugust 17 lateness." Id., at 589. The Board focused pri-marily on ABF's retroactive application of its lateness policyto include Manso's first time late to work, holding that ABFhad "seized upon" Manso's tardiness "as a pretext to discharge him again and for the same unlawful reasons it dis-charged him on June 19."6 In addition, though the Boarddeemed Manso's discharge unlawful even assuming the valid-ity of ABF's general disciplinary treatment of preferentialcasuals, it observed that ABF's disciplinary approach andlack of uniform rules for all dockworkers "raise[d] morequestions than they resolve[d]." Id., at 590. The Boardordered ABF to reinstate Manso with backpay.Id., at 591.4 Specifically, the ALJ held that the dismissal violated $$ 8(a)(1), (3), and(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29U. S. C. $$ 158(a)(1), (3), and (4).5 304 N. L. R. B., at 590. The Board found that the record in this caseunequivocally established that ABF did not treat Manso's dishonesty "inand of itself as an independent basis for discharge or any other disciplinaryaction." Ibid.6 Id., at 591. The Board also noted that the supervisors' threats of retaliation and the earlier unlawful discharge under the verification policyprovided "strong evidence" of unlawful motivation regarding Manso's thirddischarge. Id., at 590.510us2$18I 06-23-97 18:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT322 ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order. Mierav. NLRB, 982 F. 2d 441 (CA10 1992). Its review of the record revealed "abundant evidence of antiunion animus inABF's conduct towards Manso," id., at 446, including "ampleevidence" that Manso's third discharge was not for cause,ibid. The court regarded as important the testimony in therecord confirming that Manso would not have been discharged under ABF's new tardiness policy had he provideda legitimate excuse. Ibid. The court also rejected ABF'sargument that awarding reinstatement and backpay to anemployee who lied to his employer and to the ALJ violatedpublic policy.7 Noting that "Manso's original misrepresenta-tion was made to his employer in an attempt to avoid beingfired under a policy the application of which the Board foundto be the result of antiunion animus," the court reasoned thatthe Board had wide discretion to ascertain what remedy bestfurthered the policies of the National Labor Relations Act(Act). Id., at 447. IIThe question we granted certiorari to review is a narrowone.8 We assume that the Board correctly found that ABFdischarged Manso unlawfully in August 1989. We also as-sume, more importantly, that the Board did not abuse itsdiscretion in ordering reinstatement even though Manso7 ABF's public policy argument relies on several decisions refusing toenforce reinstatement orders where the employee had engaged in seriousmisconduct. See, e. g., Precision Window Mfg. v. NLRB, 963 F. 2d 1105,1110 (CA8 1992) (employee lied about extent of union activities and threatened to kill supervisor); NLRB v. Magnusen, 523 F. 2d 643, 646 (CA91975) (employee padded time card and lied about it under oath); NLRB v.Commonwealth Foods, Inc., 506 F. 2d 1065, 1068 (CA4 1974) (employeesengaged in theft from employer); NLRB v. Breitling, 378 F. 2d 663, 664(CA10 1967) (employee confessed to stealing from employer).8 We limited our grant of certiorari to the third question in the petition:"Does an employee forfeit the remedy of reinstatement with backpay afterthe Administrative Law Judge finds that he purposefully testified falselyduring the administrative hearing?"

We areconcerned only with the ramifications of Manso's false testimony under oath in a formal proceeding before the ALJ.We recognize that the Board might have decided that suchmisconduct disqualified Manso from profiting from the proceeding, or it might even have adopted a flat rule precludingreinstatement when a former employee so testifies. As thecase comes to us, however, the issue is not whether theBoardmight adopt such a rule, but whether it must do so.False testimony in a formal proceeding is intolerable. Wemust neither reward nor condone such a "flagrant affront" tothe truth-seeking function of adversary proceedings. SeeUnited States v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1976).See also United States v. Knox, 396 U. S. 77 (1969); Brysonv. United States, 396 U. S. 64 (1969); Dennis v. United States,384 U. S. 855 (1966); Kay v. United States, 303 U. S. 1 (1938);United States v. Kapp, 302 U. S. 214 (1937); Glickstein v.United States, 222 U. S. 139, 141-142 (1911). If knowinglyexploited by a criminal prosecutor, such wrongdoing is so"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of justice" thatit can vitiate a judgment even after it has become final.Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935). In any proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, deliberate falsehoods "well may affect the dearest concerns of the partiesbefore a tribunal," United States v. Norris, 300 U. S. 564,574 (1937), and may put the factfinder and parties "to thedisadvantage, hindrance, and delay of ultimately extractingthe truth by cross examination, by extraneous investigationor other collateral means." Ibid. Perjury should be severely sanctioned in appropriate cases.ABF submits that the false testimony of a former employee who was the victim of an unfair labor practice shouldalways preclude him from winning reinstatement with backpay. That contention, though not inconsistent with our appraisal of his misconduct, raises countervailing concerns.Most important is Congress' decision to delegate to the510us2$18I 06-23-97 18:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT324 ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the CourtBoard the primary responsibility for making remedial deci-sions that best effectuate the policies of the Act when it hassubstantiated an unfair labor practice. The Act expresslyauthorizes the Board "to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, aswill effectuate the policies of [the Act]." 29 U. S. C. $ 160(c).Only in cases of discharge for cause does the statute restrictthe Board's authority to order reinstatement.9 This is notsuch a case.When Congress expressly delegates to an administrativeagency the authority to make specific policy determinations,courts must give the agency's decision controlling weight un-less it is "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to thestatute." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984). Because thiscase involves that kind of express delegation, the Board'sviews merit the greatest deference. This has been our con-sistent appraisal of the Board's remedial authority throughout its long history of administering the Act.10 As we ex-plained over a half century ago:"Because the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly amatter for administrative competence, courts must notenter the allowable area of the Board's discretion andmust guard against the danger of sliding unconsciouslyfrom the narrow confines of law into the more spaciousdomain of policy."Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313U. S. 177, 194 (1941).9 "No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the paymentto him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged forcause." 29 U. S. C. $ 160(c).10 See Virginia Elec. & Power Co. v. NLRB, 319 U. S. 533, 539-540(1943). We stated in Virginia Electric that such administrative determinations should stand "unless it can be shown that the order is a patentattempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act." Id., at 540.510us2$18I 06-23-97 18:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT325Cite as: 510 U. S. 317 (1994)Kennedy, J., concurringNotwithstanding our concern about the seriousness ofManso's ill-advised decision to repeat under oath his falseexcuse for tardiness, we cannot say that the Board's remedialorder in this case was an abuse of its broad discretion or thatit was obligated to adopt a rigid rule that would forecloserelief in all comparable cases. Nor can we fault the Board'sconclusions that Manso's reason for being late to work wasultimately irrelevant to whether antiunion animus actuallymotivated his discharge and that ordering effective relief ina case of this character promotes a vital public interest.Notably, the ALJ refused to credit the testimony of several ABF witnesses, see, e. g., 304 N. L. R. B., at 598, and theBoard affirmed those credibility findings,id., at 585. Theunfairness of sanctioning Manso while indirectly rewardingthose witnesses' lack of candor is obvious. Moreover, therule ABF advocates might force the Board to divert its attention from its primary mission and devote unnecessarytime and energy to resolving collateral disputes about credibility. Its decision to rely on "other civil and criminal remedies" for false testimony, cf. St. Mary's Honor Center v.Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 521 (1993), rather than a categoricalexception to the familiar remedy of reinstatement is wellwithin its broad discretion.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
