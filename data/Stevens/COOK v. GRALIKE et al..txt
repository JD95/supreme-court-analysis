In U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779(1995), we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for theUnited States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in theHouse of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. Weheld that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt toimpose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitu-tion rather than a permissible exercise of the State's powerto regulate the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elec-tions for Senators and Representatives" within the meaningof Article I, $ 4, cl. 1.In response to that decision, the voters of Missouriadopted in 1996 an amendment to Article VIII 1 of their StateConstitution designed to lead to the adoption of a specified"Congressional Term Limits Amendment" to the FederalConstitution. At issue in this case is the constitutionality ofArticle VIII.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Nebraska by Don Stenberg, Attorney General, and L. Steven Grasz, DeputyAttorney General; for the Initiative and Referendum Institute by PatrickT. O'Brien and John M. Boehm; for Missouri Term Limits by Stephen J.Safranek; and for U. S.

Meyer; andfor the League of Women Voters of the United States et al. by Louis R.Cohen and Jonathan J. Frankel.Kris W. Kobach, pro se, filed a brief as amicus curiae.1 We shall follow the parties' practice of referring to the amendment as"Article VIII" even though it merely added new $$ 15 through 22 to thepre-existing article.531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN514 COOK v.

GRALIKEOpinion of the CourtRespondent Don Gralike was a nonincumbent candidatefor election in 1998 to the United States House of Representatives from Missouri's Third Congressional District. Amonth after Article VIII was amended, Gralike broughtsuit 6 in the United States District Court for the WesternDistrict of Missouri to enjoin petitioner, the Secretary ofState of Missouri, from implementing the Article, which thecomplaint alleges violates several provisions of the FederalConstitution.The District Court decided the case on the pleadings,granting Gralike's motion for summary judgment. Thecourt first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifica-tions Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution becauseit "has the sole purpose of creating additional qualificationsfor Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress." 996 F. Supp. 917,920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905-909 (1998). The courtfurther held that Article VIII places an impermissible bur-den on the candidates' First Amendment right to speakfreely on the issue of term limits by "punish[ing] candidatesfor speaking out against term limits" through putting "nega-tive words next to their names on the ballot," and by "us[ing]the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coercecandidates into taking a position on the term limits issue."996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920. Lastly, thecourt found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject them-selves into the amending process authorized by Article V ofthe Federal Constitution. In doing so, the court endorsedthe reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions simified, $ 20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in theSupreme Court of Missouri, $ 21; and severance of "any portion, clause, orphrase" of Article VIII that is declared invalid, $ 22.6 Although Gralike intended to run for Congress when he filed suit,under Missouri law he could not formally file a declaration for candidacyuntil February 1998.

Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.7 Accordingly,the court permanently enjoined petitioner from enforcing$$ 15 through 19 of Article VIII.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitaffirmed.8 Like the District Court, it found that ArticleVIII "threatens a penalty that is serious enough to compelcandidates to speak--the potential political damage of theballot labels"; "seeks to impose an additional qualification forcandidacy for Congress and does so in a manner which ishighly likely to handicap term limit opponents and other labeled candidates"; and "coerce[s] legislators into proposingor ratifying a particular constitutional amendment" in violation of Article V. 191 F. 3d 911, 918, 924, 925 (1999). TheCourt of Appeals also observed that, contrary to the Speechor Debate Clause in Art. I, $ 6, cl. 1, of the Federal Constitution, Article VIII "establishes a regime in which a stateofficer--the secretary of state--is permitted to judge andpunish Members of Congress for their legislative actions orpositions." 191 F. 3d, at 922.97 See League of Women Voters of Me. v. Gwadosky, 966 F. Supp. 52(Me. 1997); Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S. W. 2d 119 (1996).8 While the appeal was pending, respondent Gralike withdrew from the1998 election and respondent Harmon, a nonincumbent candidate in the2000 Republican congressional primary in the Seventh District of Missouri, intervened as an appellee. In view of Harmon's participation, thereis no contention that this case is moot. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S.724, 737, n. 8 (1974).9 Although Judge Hansen, dissenting in part, thought that $$ 17 through19 should be severed, leaving the rest of Article VIII intact, the majoritydeclined to do so. 191 F. 3d, at 926, n. 12.

S. 1065 (2000).IIArticle VIII furthers the State's interest in adding aterm limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in twoways. It encourages Missouri's congressional delegation tosupport such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorableballot designation when running for reelection. And it en-courages the election of representatives who favor such anamendment. Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exer-cise of the "right of the people to instruct" their representatives reserved by the Tenth Amendment,11 and that it is apermissible regulation of the "manner" of electing federallegislators within the authority delegated to the States bythe Elections Clause, Art.

S. 510 (2001)Opinion of the Courtappropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kindbetween powers reserved to the States and those delegatedto the States by the Constitution.As we discussed at length in U. S. Term Limits, the Constitution "draws a basic distinction between the powers ofthe newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States." 514 U. S., at801. On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, "it was neither necessary nor proper to define the pow-ers retained by the States. These powers proceed, not fromthe people of America, but from the people of the severalStates; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution,what they were before, except so far as they may beabridged by that instrument."Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4Wheat. 122, 193 (1819). The text of the Tenth Amendmentdelineates this principle:"The powers not delegated to the United States bythe Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, arereserved to the States respectively, or to the people."On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, "the statescan exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively springout of the existence of the national government, which theconstitution did not delegate to them." 1 Commentaries onthe Constitution of the United States $ 627 (3d ed. 1858)(hereinafter Story). Simply put, "[n]o state can say, that ithas reserved, what it never possessed." Ibid.III*To be persuasive, petitioner's argument that Article VIIIis a valid exercise of the State's reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to over-come three hurdles. First, the historical precedents on*Justice Souter does not join this Part of the Court's opinion.531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN520 COOK v. GRALIKEOpinion of the Courtwhich she relies for the proposition that the States have sucha reserved power are distinguishable. Second, there iscountervailing historical evidence. Third, and of decisivesignificance, the means employed to issue the instructions,ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unlessArticle VIII is a permissible exercise of the State's power toregulate the manner of holding elections for Senators andRepresentatives. Only a brief comment on the first twopoints is necessary.Petitioner relies heavily on the part instructions played inthe Second Continental Congress, the Constitutional Con-vention, the early Congress, the selection of United StatesSenators before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment,and the ratification of certain federal constitutional amendments.13 However, unlike Article VIII, none of petitioner'sexamples was coupled with an express legal sanction for disobedience.14 At best, as an amicus curiae for petitionerpoints out, and as petitioner herself acknowledges, such historical instructions at one point in the early Republic mayhave had "de facto binding force" because it might have been"political suicide" not to follow them.15 This evidence fallsshort of demonstrating that either the people or the States13 Brief for Petitioner 10-17.14 For example, the Provincial Congress of North Carolina passed thefollowing instruction on April 12, 1776: "Resolved, That the Delegates forthis Colony in the Continental Congress be empowered to concur with theDelegates of the other Colonies in declaring Independency, and formingforeign alliances, reserving to this Colony the sole and exclusive right offorming a Constitution and Laws for this Colony . . . ." 5 American Archives 860 (P. Force ed. 1844).15 Brief for Professor Kris W. Kobach as Amicus Curiae 5, 13; see Brieffor Petitioner 14, n. 13. But see 1 Annals of Cong. 744 (1789) (remarks ofRep. Wadsworth) ("I have known, myself, that [instructions] have beendisobeyed, and yet the representative was not brought to account for it;on the contrary, he was caressed and re-elected, while those who haveobeyed them, contrary to their private sentiments, have ever after beendespised for it").531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN521Cite as: 531 U. S. 510 (2001)Opinion of the Courthad a right to give legally binding, i. e., nonadvisory, instructions to their representatives that the Tenth Amendment reserved, much less that such a right would apply to federalrepresentatives. See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,514 U. S., at 802 (Tenth Amendment "could only `reserve'that which existed before"); cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4Wheat. 316, 430 (1819) (rejecting argument that States hadreserved power to tax corporations chartered by Congressbecause an "original right to tax" such federal entities"never existed").Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that theFirst Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of thepeople "to instruct their representatives" into what wouldbecome the First Amendment. 1 Annals of Cong. 732(1789). The fact that the proposal was made suggests thatits proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it wasrejected by a vote of 41 to 10, id., at 747, suggests that weshould give weight to the views of those who opposed theproposal. It was their view that binding instructions wouldundermine an essential attribute of Congress by evisceratingthe deliberative nature of that National Assembly. See,e. g., id., at 735 (remarks of Rep. Sherman) ("[W]hen the people have chosen a representative, it is his duty to meet othersfrom the different parts of the Union, and consult, and agreewith them to such acts as are for the general benefit of thewhole community. If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a manwould have to do, would be to produce his instructions, andlay them on the table, and let them speak for him"). As aresult, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia,concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would"run the risk of losing the whole system." Id., at 739; seealso id., at 735 (remarks of Rep. Clymer) (proposed right togive binding instructions was "a most dangerous principle,utterly destructive of all ideas of an independent and deliber531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 COOK v. GRALIKEOpinion of the Courtative body, which are essential requisites in the Legislaturesof free Governments").16In any event, even assuming the existence of the reservedright that petitioner asserts (and that Article VIII fallswithin its ambit), the question remains whether the Statemay use ballots for congressional elections as a means of giving its instructions binding force.IVThe federal offices at stake "aris[e] from the Constitutionitself."U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S., at805. Because any state authority to regulate election tothose offices could not precede their very creation by theConstitution, such power "had to be delegated to, rather thanreserved by, the States." Id., at 804. Cf. 1 Story $ 627 ("Itis no original prerogative of state power to appoint a representative, a senator, or president for the union"). Throughthe Elections Clause, the Constitution delegated to theStates the power to regulate the "Times, Places and Mannerof holding Elections for Senators and Representatives," subject to a grant of authority to Congress to "make or altersuch Regulations." Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1; seeUnited States v.Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 315 (1941). No other constitutional16 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly shouldbe bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, isa matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the FederalUnion was established. For instance, in his classic speech to the electorsof Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:"To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is aweighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always torejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member isbound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, thoughcontrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, theseare things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise froma fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution."The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 531 U. S. 510 (2001)Opinion of the Courtprovision gives the States authority over congressional elec-tions, and no such authority could be reserved under theTenth Amendment. By process of elimination, the Statesmay regulate the incidents of such elections, including balloting, only within the exclusive delegation of power under theElections Clause.With respect to the Elections Clause, petitioner arguesthat Article VIII "merely regulates the manner in whichelections are held by disclosing information about congres-sional candidates."17 As such, petitioner concludes, ArticleVIII is a valid exercise of Missouri's delegated power.We disagree. To be sure, the Elections Clause grants tothe States "broad power" to prescribe the procedural mecha-nisms for holding congressional elections.Tashjian v. Re-publican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 217 (1986); see alsoSmiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366 (1932) ("It cannot bedoubted that these comprehensive words embrace authorityto provide a complete code for congressional elections").Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority. As we made clear in U. S. Term Limits, "the Fram-ers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authorityto issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of powerto dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class ofcandidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints."514 U. S., at 833-834. Article VIII is not a procedural regulation. It does not regulate the time of elections; it doesnot regulate the place of elections; nor, we believe, does itregulate the manner of elections.18 As to the last point,Article VIII bears no relation to the "manner" of electionsas we understand it, for in our commonsense view that termencompasses matters like "notices, registration, supervisionof voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and cor17 Brief for Petitioner 28; see also id., at 38.18 Petitioner once shared our belief, when, in deposition testimony beforethe District Court, she admitted that Article VIII does not regulate thetime, place, or manner of elections.

GRALIKEOpinion of the Courtrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors andcanvassers, and making and publication of election returns."Smiley, 285 U. S., at 366; see also U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v.Thornton, 514 U. S., at 833. In short, Article VIII is notamong "the numerous requirements as to procedure andsafeguards which experience shows are necessary in orderto enforce the fundamental right involved," Smiley, 285U. S., at 366, ensuring that elections are "fair and honest,"and that "some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic process," Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724,730 (1974).Rather, Article VIII is plainly designed to favor candidates who are willing to support the particular form of aterm limits amendment set forth in its text and to disfavorthose who either oppose term limits entirely or would prefera different proposal. Cf. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S.780, 788, n. 9 (1983) ("We have upheld generally applicableand evenhanded [ballot access] restrictions that protectthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself ").As noted, the state provision does not just "instruct" eachmember of Missouri's congressional delegation to promote incertain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment. It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliance--the printing of the statement "DISREGARDEDVOTERS' INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS" by thecandidate's name on all primary and general election ballots.Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge tofollow the instruction receives the ballot designation "DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS."In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as "pejorative," "negative," "derogatory,"" `intentionally intimidating,' " "particularly harmful," "politically damaging," "a serious sanction," "a penalty," and "official denunciation." 191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996F. Supp., at 908; see id., at 910, 916. The general counsel to531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 531 U. S. 510 (2001)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner's office, no less, has denominated the labels as "theScarlet Letter." App. 34-35. We agree with the sense ofthese descriptions. They convey the substantial politicalrisk the ballot labels impose on current and prospective congressional members who, for one reason or another, fail tocomply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII for passing its term limits amendment. Although petitioner nowclaims that the labels "merely" inform Missouri voters abouta candidate's compliance with Article VIII, she has acknowl-edged under oath that the ballot designations would handicap candidates for the United States Congress. Id., at 66.To us, that is exactly the intended effect of Article VIII.Indeed, it seems clear that the adverse labels handicapcandidates "at the most crucial stage in the election process--the instant before the vote is cast." Anderson v. Martin, 375 U. S. 399, 402 (1964). At the same time, "by direct-ing the citizen's attention to the single consideration" of thecandidates' fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that theissue "is an important--perhaps paramount--considerationin the citizen's choice, which may decisively influence the citi-zen to cast his ballot" against candidates branded as unfaithful. Ibid. While the precise damage the labels may exacton candidates is disputed between the parties, the labelssurely place their targets at a political disadvantage to un-marked candidates for congressional office.19 Thus, far from19 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by otherStates, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations. For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution;7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to"ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to votefor language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment"and thereby avoid "the scarlet letter provision." 143 Cong. Rec. H494(Feb. 12, 1997). However, because each of the state initiatives provided531US2 Unit: $U27 [04-12-02 20:31:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 COOK v. GRALIKEOpinion of the Courtregulating the procedural mechanisms of elections, ArticleVIII attempts to "dictate electoral outcomes." U. S. TermLimits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S., at 833-834. Such "regu-lation" of congressional elections simply is not authorized bythe Elections Clause.20a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differingversions proposed by congressional members from other States, eventhough they were supportive of term limits generally. See, e. g., id., atH486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) ("I will vote against the bill of thegentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to termlimits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the termlimit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas");id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) ("Last Congress I supported theMcCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiativepassed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to opposeany term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limitconditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State").As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, "[e]very State's Members get to vote on their State's term limits so they make them feel betterand they do not get the scarlet letter." Id., at H487. Consequently, themost popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress. Id., at H511. As for the Missouri version, it suffered a353-to-72 defeat. Id., at H497.20 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the ElectionsClause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to "each State bythe Legislature thereof " and Article VIII is the product of referendum.Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 12-13,n. 8. Of course, "[w]herever the term `legislature' is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view."Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366 (1932). Nevertheless, we need notdelve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text,that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also reliedin part on First Amendment cases upholding "time, place, and manner"regulations of speech.
