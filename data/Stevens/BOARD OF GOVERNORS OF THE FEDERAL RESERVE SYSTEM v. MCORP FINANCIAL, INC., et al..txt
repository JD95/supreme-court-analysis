MCorp, a bank holding company, filed voluntary bank-ruptcy petitions in March 1989. It then initiated an adversary proceeding against the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System (Board) seeking to enjoin theprosecution of two administrative proceedings, one chargingMCorp with a violation of the Board's "source of strength"regulation 1 and the other alleging a violation of $ 23A of theFederal Reserve Act, as added, 48 Stat. 183, and amended.2The District Court enjoined both proceedings, and the Boardappealed. The Court of Appeals held that the DistrictCourt had no jurisdiction to enjoin the $ 23A proceeding, butthat, under the doctrine set forth inLeedom v. Kyne, 358U. S. 184 (1958), the District Court had jurisdiction to reviewthe validity of the "source of strength" regulation. TheCourt of Appeals then ruled that the Board had exceededits statutory authority in promulgating that regulation. 900F. 2d 852 (CA5 1990). We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 904(1991), to review the entire action but, because we concludethat the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin eitherregulatory proceeding, we do not reach the merits ofMCorp's challenge to the regulation.IIn 1984, the Board promulgated a regulation requiringevery bank holding company to "serve as a source of financial1 The "source of strength" regulation provides in relevant part:"A bank holding company shall serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and shall not con[d]uct its operationsin an unsafe or unsound manner." 12 CFR $ 225.4(a)(1) (1991).2 Section 23A sets forth restrictions on bank holding companies' corporate practices, including restrictions on transactions between subsidiarybanks and nonbank affiliates.

The Board also issued three temporary cease-and-desist orders.5 The first forbids MCorp todeclare or pay any dividends without the prior approvalof the Board. App. 65-67. The second forbids MCorp todissipate any of its nonbank assets without the priorapproval of the Board. Id., at 68-70. The third directsMCorp to use "all of its assets to provide capital support toits Subsidiary Banks in need of additional capital." Id., at85. By agreement, enforcement of the third order was suspended while MCorp sought financial assistance from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).6In March 1989, the FDIC denied MCorp's request for as-sistance. Thereafter, creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against MCorp in the Southern District ofNew York, and the Comptroller of the Currency determinedthat 20 of MCorp's subsidiary banks were insolvent and, ac-cordingly, appointed the FDIC as receiver of those banks.MCorp then filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions in the3 See n. 1, supra. In 1987, the Board clarified its policy and stated thata "bank holding company's failure to assist a troubled or failing subsidiarybank . . . would generally be viewed as an unsafe and unsound bankingpractice or a violation of [12 CFR $ 225.4(a)(1)] or both." 52 Fed. Reg.15707-15708.4 The term "MCorp" refers to the corporation and to two of its whollyowned subsidiaries, MCorp Financial, Inc., and MCorp Management.5 MCorp timely challenged these orders in the District Court for theNorthern District of Texas, pursuant to 12 U. S. C. $ 1818(c)(2). The District Court stayed MCorp's challenge pending resolution of this proceeding. Brief for MCorp et al. 3.6 The current status of this order is unclear. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-25,41-42. We address only MCorp's effort to enjoin the Board's administrative proceedings and express no opinion on the continuing vitality or validity of any of the temporary cease-and-desist orders.502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT36 BOARD OF GOVERNORS, FRS v. MCORP FINANCIAL, INC.Opinion of the CourtSouthern District of Texas and all bankruptcy proceedingswere later consolidated in that forum.At the end of March, the Board commenced a secondadministrative proceeding against MCorp alleging that ithad violated $ 23A of the Federal Reserve Act by causingtwo of its subsidiary banks to extend unsecured credit ofapproximately $63.7 million to an affiliate. For convenience,we shall refer to that proceeding as the "$ 23A proceeding"and to the earlier proceeding as the "source of strengthproceeding."In May 1989, MCorp initiated this litigation by filing acomplaint in the Bankruptcy Court against the Board seeking a declaration that both administrative proceedings hadbeen automatically stayed pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code;in the alternative, MCorp prayed for an injunction againstthe further prosecution of those proceedings without theprior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. On the Board'smotion, the District Court transferred that adversary proceeding to its own docket.In June 1989, the District Court ruled that it had jurisdiction to enjoin the Board from prosecuting both administrative proceedings against MCorp and entered a preliminaryinjunction halting those proceedings. The injunction restrained the Board from exercising "its authority over bankholding companies . . . to attempt to effect, directly or indirectly, a reorganization of the MCorp group [of companies]except through participation in the bankruptcy proceedings." In re MCorp, 101 B. R. 483, 491. The Boardappealed.Although the District Court did not differentiate betweenthe two Board proceedings, the Court of Appeals held thatthe $ 23A proceeding could go forward but that the source ofstrength proceeding should be enjoined. The court reasoned that the plain language of the judicial review provisions of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT37Cite as: 502 U.

C. $ 1818 et seq.(1988 ed. and Supp. II), particularly $ 1818(i)(1), deprived theDistrict Court of jurisdiction to enjoin either proceeding, butthat our decision in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U. S. 184 (1958),nevertheless authorized an injunction against an administrative proceeding conducted without statutory authorization.The Court of Appeals ruled that the Board's promulgationand enforcement of its source of strength regulation exceeded its statutory authority. Accordingly, the court vacated the District Court injunction barring the $ 23A proceeding, but remanded the case with instructions to enjointhe Board from enforcing its source of strength regulation.Both parties petitioned for certiorari.The Board's petition challenges the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Leedom v. Kyne, as well as its invalidation ofthe source of strength regulation. MCorp's petition challenges the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the relationship between the provisions governing judicial review ofBoard proceedings and those governing bankruptcy proceedings. We first address the latter challenge.IIA series of federal statutes gives the Board substantialregulatory power over bank holding companies and establishes a comprehensive scheme of judicial review of Boardactions. See FISA; the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956(BHCA), 12 U. S. C. $ 1841 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II);and the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983, 12U. S. C. $ 3901 et seq. In this litigation, the most relevant ofthese is FISA.77 Although the several "Notices of Charges and of Hearing" issued bythe Board against MCorp relied on FISA and the BHCA, e. g., App. 57,72, the parties have focused only on the former. We note, however, thatthe BHCA includes a preclusion provision that is similar to $ 1818(i)(1) inFISA. See 12 U. S. C. $ 1844(e)(2).502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT38 BOARD OF GOVERNORS, FRS v.

C.$$ 1818(a)-(b) (1988 ed., Supp. II), and to issue temporarycease-and-desist orders that are effective upon service ona bank holding company. $ 1818(c). In addition, FISA establishes a tripartite regime of judicial review. First,$ 1818(c)(2) provides that, within 10 days after service ofa temporary order, a bank holding company may seek aninjunction in district court restraining enforcement of theorder pending completion of the related administrative proceeding. Second, $ 1818(h) authorizes court of appeals review of final Board orders on the application of an aggrievedparty.8 Finally, $ 1818(i)(1) provides that the Board mayapply to district court for enforcement of any effective andoutstanding notice or order.None of these provisions controls this litigation: The actionbefore us is not a challenge to a temporary Board order, nora petition for review of a final Board order, nor an enforcement action initiated by the Board. Instead, FISA's preclusion provision appears to speak directly to the jurisdictionalquestion at issue in this litigation:8 The statute characterizes such review of final Board orders as "exclusive" and provides:"(2) Any party to any proceeding under paragraph (1) may obtain a review . . . by the filing in the court of appeals of the United States for thecircuit in which the home office of the depository institution is located, orin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the agency be modified, terminated, or setaside. . . . Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall except as provided in the lastsentence of said paragraph (1) be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate,or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the agency." 12 U. S. C.$ 1818(h)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. II).The referenced exception concerns actions taken by the agency with permission of the court.502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT39Cite as: 502 U.

Ibid.Notwithstanding this plain, preclusive language, MCorp ar-gues that the District Court's injunction against the prosecution of the Board proceedings was authorized either by theautomatic stay provision in the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C.$ 362, or by the provision of the Judicial Code authorizingdistrict courts in bankruptcy proceedings to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over certain civil proceedings, 28 U. S. C.$ 1334(b). We find no merit in either argument.The filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an auto-matic stay of several categories of judicial and administrativeproceedings.9 The Board's planned actions against MCorpconstitute the "continuation . . . [of] administrative . . . proceeding[s]" and would appear to be stayed by 11 U. S. C.$ 362(a)(1). However, the Board's actions also fall squarely9 The automatic stay provision provides in relevant part:"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filedunder section 301, 302, or 303 of this title, or an application filed undersection 5(a)(3) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.

MCORP FINANCIAL, INC.Opinion of the Courtwithin $ 362(b)(4), which expressly provides that the auto-matic stay will not reach proceedings to enforce a "governmental unit's police or regulatory power." 10MCorp contends that in order for $ 362(b)(4) to obtain, acourt must first determine whether the proposed exercise ofpolice or regulatory power is legitimate and that, therefore,in this litigation the lower courts did have the authority toexamine the legitimacy of the Board's actions and to enjointhose actions. We disagree. MCorp's broad reading of thestay provisions would require bankruptcy courts to scruti-nize the validity of every administrative or enforcement action brought against a bankrupt entity. Such a reading isproblematic, both because it conflicts with the broad discretion Congress has expressly granted many administrativeentities and because it is inconsistent with the limited authority Congress has vested in bankruptcy courts. Wetherefore reject MCorp's reading of $ 362(b)(4).MCorp also argues that it is protected by $$ 362(a)(3) and362(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. Those provisions stay"any act" to obtain possession of, or to exercise control over,property of the estate, or to recover claims against thedebtor that arose prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. MCorp contends that the ultimate objective of thesource of strength proceeding is to exercise control of corpo-rate assets and that the $ 23A proceeding seeks enforcementof a prepetition claim.We reject these characterizations of the ongoing administrative proceedings.

S. 32 (1991)Opinion of the Courtits intent to determine whether MCorp has violated specified statutory and regulatory provisions. It is possible, ofcourse, that the Board proceedings, like many other enforcement actions, may conclude with the entry of an order thatwill affect the Bankruptcy Court's control over the propertyof the estate, but that possibility cannot be sufficient to justify the operation of the stay against an enforcement proceeding that is expressly exempted by $ 362(b)(4). To adoptsuch a characterization of enforcement proceedings would beto render subsection (b)(4)'s exception almost meaningless.If and when the Board's proceedings culminate in a finalorder, and if and when judicial proceedings are commencedto enforce such an order, then it may well be proper for theBankruptcy Court to exercise its concurrent jurisdictionunder 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b). We are not persuaded, however,that the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Codehave any application to ongoing, nonfinal administrativeproceedings.11MCorp's final argument rests on 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b).That section authorizes a district court to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over certain bankruptcy-related civil proceedings that would otherwise be subject to the exclusivejurisdiction of another court.12 MCorp's reliance is misplaced. Section 1334(b) concerns the allocation of jurisdiction between bankruptcy courts and other "courts," and, of11 The Board suggests that the automatic stay provisions of $ 362 do notthemselves confer jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court, and thus that thefiling of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay only wherethe bankruptcy court's jurisdiction has not already been precluded by astatute like $ 1818(i)(1). We need not address this question in light of ourdetermination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Board's ongoing administrative proceedings.12 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b) provides:"(b) Notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district courtshall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedingsarising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11."502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT42 BOARD OF GOVERNORS, FRS v. MCORP FINANCIAL, INC.Opinion of the Courtcourse, an administrative agency such as the Board is nota "court." Moreover, contrary to MCorp's contention, theprosecution of the Board proceedings, prior to the entry ofa final order and prior to the commencement of any enforcement action, seems unlikely to impair the BankruptcyCourt's exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the estateprotected by 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(d).13 In sum, we agree withthe Court of Appeals that the specific preclusive language in12 U. S. C. $ 1818(i)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. II) is not qualified orsuperseded by the general provisions governing bankruptcyproceedings on which MCorp relies.IIIAlthough the Court of Appeals found that $ 1818(i)(1) precluded judicial review of many Board actions, it exercisedjurisdiction in this litigation based on its reading of Leedomv. Kyne, 358 U. S. 184 (1958). Kyne involved an action inDistrict Court challenging a determination by the NationalLabor Relations Board (NLRB) that a unit including bothprofessional and nonprofessional employees was appropriatefor collective-bargaining purposes--a determination in directconflict with a provision of the National Labor RelationsAct.14 The Act, however, did not expressly authorize anyjudicial review of such a determination. Relying on Switchmen v. National Mediation Bd., 320 U. S. 297 (1943), theNLRB argued that the statutory provisions establishing review of final Board orders in the courts of appeals indicateda congressional intent to bar review of any NLRB action13 That subsection provides:"(d) The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or ispending shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, whereverlocated, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate."14 See 29 U.

S. 32 (1991)Opinion of the Courtin the District Court.15 The Court rejected that argument,emphasizing the presumption that Congress normally intends the federal courts to enforce and protect the rightsthat Congress has created. Concluding that the Act did notbar the District Court's jurisdiction, we stated: "This Courtcannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicialprotection of rights it confers against agency action taken inexcess of delegated powers." 358 U. S., at 190.In this litigation, the Court of Appeals interpreted ouropinion inKyne as authorizing judicial review of any agencyaction that is alleged to have exceeded the agency's statutoryauthority. Kyne, however, differs from this litigation in twocritical ways. First, central to our decision inKyne was thefact that the Board's interpretation of the Act would whollydeprive the union of a meaningful and adequate means ofvindicating its statutory rights."Here, differently from the Switchmen's case, `absenceof jurisdiction of the federal courts' would mean `a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress' has givenprofessional employees, for there is no other means,within their control . . . to protect and enforce thatright."Ibid.The cases before us today are entirely different from Kynebecause FISA expressly provides MCorp with a meaningfuland adequate opportunity for judicial review of the validityof the source of strength regulation. If and when the Board15 In Switchmen v. National Mediation Bd., 320 U. S., at 306, the Courthad reasoned:"When Congress in $ 3 and in $ 9 provided for judicial review of two typesof orders or awards and in $ 2 of the same Act omitted any such provisionas respects a third type, it drew a plain line of distinction. And the inference is strong from the history of the Act that that distinction was notinadvertent. The language of the Act read in light of that history supports the view that Congress gave administrative action under $ 2, Nintha finality which it denied administrative action under the other sections ofthe Act."502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT44 BOARD OF GOVERNORS, FRS v. MCORP FINANCIAL, INC.Opinion of the Courtfinds that MCorp has violated that regulation, MCorp willhave, in the Court of Appeals, an unquestioned right to review of both the regulation and its application.The second, and related, factor distinguishing this litigation from Kyne is the clarity of the congressional preclusionof review in FISA. InKyne, the NLRB contended that astatutory provision that provided for judicial review implied,by its silence, a preclusion of review of the contested de-termination. By contrast, in FISA Congress has spokenclearly and directly: "[N]o court shall have jurisdiction toaffect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any [Board] notice or order under this section."12 U. S. C. $ 1818(i)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).In this way as well, this litigation differs from Kyne.16Viewed in this way, Kyne stands for the familiar proposition that "only upon a showing of `clear and convincingevidence' of a contrary legislative intent should the courtsrestrict access to judicial review." Abbott Laboratories v.Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967). As we have explained,however, in this case the statute provides us with clear andconvincing evidence that Congress intended to deny the Dis-trict Court jurisdiction to review and enjoin the Board's ongoing administrative proceedings.IVThe Court of Appeals therefore erred when it held that ithad jurisdiction to consider the merits of MCorp's challengeto the source of strength regulation. In No. 90-913, the16 The other cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals--Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667 (1986); Breen v. Selective Service Local Bd. No. 16, 396 U.

In each of thosecases, the Court recognized that an unduly narrow construction of thegoverning statute would severely prejudice the party seeking review, andconstrued the statute to allow judicial review not expressly provided.502us1$$5Z 08-21-96 15:22:11 PAGES OPINPGT45Cite as: 502 U.
