certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-458. Argued January 13, 2004--Decided March 2, 2004
Enacted "to protect . . . the interests of participants in employee benefit

plans and their beneficiaries," 29 U. S. C. $ 1001(b), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) comprises four titles. Relevant here, Title I, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq., mandates minimum participation, vesting, and funding schedules for covered pension plans, and
establishes fiduciary conduct standards for plan administrators. Title
II, codified in 26 U. S. C., amended various Internal Revenue Code
(IRC) provisions pertaining to qualification of pension plans for special
tax treatment, in order, inter alia, to conform to Title I's standards.
Title III, 29 U. S. C. $ 1201 et seq., contains provisions designed to coordinate enforcement efforts of different federal departments. Title IV,
29 U. S. C. $ 1301 et seq., created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and an insurance program to protect employees against the loss
of "nonforfeitable" benefits upon termination of pension plans lacking
sufficient funds to pay benefits in full. This case concerns Title I's
definition and coverage provisions, though those provisions, indicating
who may participate in an ERISA-sheltered plan, inform each of
ERISA's four titles. Title I defines "employee benefit plan" as "an employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or . . .
both," $ 1002(3); "participant" to encompass "any employee . . . eligible
to receive a benefit . . . from an employee benefit plan," $ 1002(7); "employee" as "any individual employed by an employer," $ 1002(6); and

PLAN v. HENDON

Syllabus

"employer" to include "any person acting . . . as an employer, or . . . in
the interest of an employer," $ 1002(5).

Yates was sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation
that maintained a profit sharing plan (Plan). From the Plan's inception,
at least one person other than Yates or his wife was a Plan participant.
The Plan qualified for favorable tax treatment under IRC $ 401. As
required by the IRC, 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a)(13), and ERISA, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1056(d), the Plan contained an antialienation provision. Entitled
"Spendthrift Clause," the provision stated, in relevant part: "Except for
. . . loans to Participants as [expressly provided for in the Plan], no
benefit or interest available hereunder will be subject to assignment or
alienation." In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 from another
of his corporation's pension plans (which later merged into the Plan),
but failed to make any of the required monthly payments. In November 1996, however, Yates paid off the loan in full with the proceeds
of the sale of his house. Three weeks later, Yates's creditors filed an
involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Respondent Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint
against petitioners (the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee), asking the
Bankruptcy Court to avoid the loan repayment. Granting Hendon summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court first determined that the repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U. S. C. $ 547(b).
That finding was not challenged on appeal. The Bankruptcy Court
then held that the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee, could not rely on the
Plan's antialienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the
loan repayment for the bankruptcy estate. That holding was dictated
by Sixth Circuit precedent, under which a self-employed owner of a
pension plan's corporate sponsor could not "participate" as an "employee" under ERISA and therefore could not use ERISA's provisions
to enforce the restriction on transfer of his beneficial interest in the
plan. The District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same
ground. The Sixth Circuit's determination that Yates was not a "participant" in the Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether,
had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have
been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustee's reach.

Held: The working owner of a business (here, the sole shareholder and

president of a professional corporation) may qualify as a "participant"
in a pension plan covered by ERISA. If the plan covers one or more
employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the
working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants. Such a working owner, in common with other employees, quali541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
fies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed
by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies. Pp. 12-24.

(a) Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants.
Because ERISA's definitions of "employee" and, in turn, "participant"
are uninformative, the Court looks to other ERISA provisions for instruction. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323.
ERISA's multiple textual indications that Congress intended working
owners to qualify as plan participants provide, in combination, "specific
guidance," ibid., so there is no cause in this case to resort to common
law. ERISA's enactment in 1974 did not change the existing backdrop
of IRC provisions permitting corporate shareholders, partners, and sole
proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans. Rather, Congress' objective was to harmonize ERISA with these longstanding tax
provisions. Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly
contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit
plans. Most notably, Title I frees certain plans in which working owners likely participate from all of ERISA's fiduciary responsibility requirements. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1101(a) and 26 U. S. C. $$ 414(q)(1)(A) and
416(i)(1)(B)(i). Title I also contains more limited exemptions from
ERISA's fiduciary responsibility requirements for plans that ordinarily
include working owners as participants. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1103(a) and
(b)(3)(A) and 26 U. S. C. $$ 401(c)(1) and (2)(A)(i), 1402(a) and (c). Further, Title I contains exemptions from ERISA's prohibited transaction
exemptions, which, like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, indicate
that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans. See 29
U. S. C. $$ 1108(b)(1)(B) and (d)(1) and 26 U. S. C. $ 401(c)(3). Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not
qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place.
Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative. For example, Title
IV does not apply to plans "established and maintained exclusively for
substantial owners," 29 U. S. C. $ 1321(b)(9) (emphasis added), a category
that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten
percent or greater ownership interest, $ 1322(b)(5)(A). But Title IV
does cover plans in which substantial owners participate along with
other employees. See $ 1322(b)(5)(B). Particularly instructive, Title
IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by
several lower courts: Under ERISA, a working owner may wear two
hats, i. e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at
the same time, the employer who established the plan. See $ 1301(b)(1)
and 26 U. S. C. $ 401(c)(4). Congress' aim to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans is advanced by the Court's reading of ERISA's text.
The working employer's opportunity personally to participate and gain
ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to the creation of plans that will

benefit employer and nonowner employees alike. Treating the working
owner as a participant in an ERISA-sheltered plan also avoids the
anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes:
federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner. Excepting working owners from
ERISA's coverage is hardly consistent with the statutory goal of "uniform national treatment of pension benefits," Patterson v. Shumate, 504
U. S. 753, 765, and would generate administrative difficulties. A 1999
Department of Labor advisory opinion (hereinafter Advisory Opinion
99-04A) accords with the Court's comprehension of Title I's definition
and coverage provisions. Concluding that working owners may qualify
as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the Department's opinion reflects a "body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and
litigants may properly resort for guidance." Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,
323 U. S. 134, 140. Pp. 12-18.

(b) This Court rejects the lower courts' position that a working owner
may rank only as an "employer" and not also as an "employee" for purposes of ERISA-sheltered plan participation. The Sixth Circuit's leading decision in point relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a
portion of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR $ 2510.3-3, which
states: "[T]he term `employee benefit plan' [as used in Title I] shall not
include any plan . . . under which no employees are participants"; "[f]or
purposes of this section," "[a]n individual and his or her spouse shall
not be deemed to be employees with respect to a . . . business" they
own. (Emphasis added.) In common with other Courts of Appeals
that have held working owners do not qualify as participants in ERISAgoverned plans, the Sixth Circuit apparently understood the regulation
to provide a generally applicable definition of "employee," controlling
for all Title I purposes. The Labor Department's Advisory Opinion 99-
04A, however, interprets the regulation to mean that the statutory term
"employee benefit plan" does not include a plan whose only participants
are the owner and his or her spouse, but does include a plan that covers
as participants one or more common-law employees, in addition to the
self-employed individuals. This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth
Circuit, merits the Judiciary's respectful consideration. Cf. Clackamas
Gastroenterology Associates, P. C. v. Wells, 538 U. S. 440, 448-449.
Moreover, the Department's regulation itself reveals the definitional
prescription's limited scope. The prescription describes "employees"
only "[f]or purposes of this section," i. e., the section defining "employee
benefit plans." 29 CFR $ 2510.3-3. Accordingly, the regulation addresses only what plans qualify as "employee benefit plans" under
ERISA's Title I. Plans that cover only sole owners or partners and
their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside Title I's domain,

5Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)
Syllabus
while plans that cover working owners and their nonowner employees
fall entirely within ERISA's compass. The Sixth Circuit's leading decision also mistakenly relied on ERISA's "anti-inurement" provision, 29
U. S. C. $ 1103(c)(1), which states that plan assets shall not inure to the
benefit of employers. Correctly read, that provision does not preclude
Title I coverage of working owners as plan participants. It demands
only that plan assets be held to supply benefits to plan participants.
Its purpose is to apply the law of trusts to discourage abuses such as
self-dealing, imprudent investment, and misappropriation of plan assets,
by employers and others. Those concerns are not implicated by paying
benefits to working owners who participate on an equal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protected plans. This Court expresses no
opinion as to whether Yates himself, in his handling of loan repayments,
engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurement provision, an
issue not yet reached by the courts below. Pp. 18-23.

(c) Given the undisputed fact that Yates failed to honor his loan's periodic repayment requirements, these questions should be addressed on
remand: (1) Did the November 1996 close-to-bankruptcy repayments,
despite the prior defaults, become a portion of Yates's interest in the
Plan that is excluded from his bankruptcy estate and (2) if so, were the
repayments beyond the reach of the Bankruptcy Trustee's power to
avoid and recover preferential transfers? P. 24.

PLAN v. HENDON

Opinion of the Court

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents a question on which federal courts have
divided: Does the working owner of a business (here, thesole shareholder and president of a professional corporation)

qualify as a "participant" in a pension plan covered by theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA
or Act), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq.The answer, we hold, is yes: If the plan covers one or more
employees other than the business owner and his or herspouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms
with other plan participants. Such a working owner, in
common with other employees, qualifies for the protectionsERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the

rights and remedies ERISA specifies. In so ruling, we reject the position, taken by the lower courts in this case, that
a business owner may rank only as an "employer" and not
also as an "employee" for purposes of ERISA-sheltered
plan participation.

PLAN v. HENDON

Opinion of the Court

From the Profit Sharing Plan's inception, at least one personother than Yates or his wife was a participant.

Ibid.; App.
269a. The Profit Sharing Plan qualified for favorable taxtreatment under $ 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

287 F. 3d, at 524; App. 71a-73a. As required by both theIRC, 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a)(13), and Title I of ERISA, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1056(d), the Plan contained an antialienation provision.
That provision, entitled "Spendthrift Clause," stated in rele-vant part: "Except for . . . loans to Participants as [expressly

provided for in the Plan], no benefit or interest availablehereunder will be subject to assignment or alienation, either
voluntarily or involuntarily." App. 252a.

In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 at 11 percent
interest from the Raymond B. Yates, M. D., P. C. Money Purchase Pension Plan (Money Purchase Pension Plan), which
later merged into the Profit Sharing Plan. Id., at 268a-269a.
The terms of the loan agreement required Yates to make
monthly payments of $433.85 over the five-year period of the
loan. Id., at 269a. Yates failed to make any monthly payment. 287 F. 3d, at 524. In June 1992, coinciding with the
Money Purchase Pension Plan-Profit Sharing Plan merger,
Yates renewed the loan for five years. App. 269a. Again,
he made no monthly payments. In fact, Yates repaid nothing until November 1996. 287 F. 3d, at 524. That month,
he used the proceeds from the sale of his house to make
two payments totaling $50,467.46, which paid off in full the
principal and interest due on the loan. Ibid. Yates maintained that, after the repayment, his interest in the Profit
Sharing Plan amounted to about $87,000. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 39a.

Three weeks after Yates repaid the loan to the Profit Sharing Plan, on December 2, 1996, Yates's creditors filed an
involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code. Id., at 12a; accord App. 300a. In August 1998, respondent William T. Hendon, the Bankruptcy
Trustee, filed a complaint, pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $$ 547(b)

asked the Bankruptcy Court to "avoi[d] the . . . preferentialtransfer by [Yates] to [the Profit Sharing Plan] in the amount

The Bankruptcy Court first determined that the loan re-payment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U. S. C.

not been transferred before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings." Begier v. IRS, 496 U. S. 53, 58 (1990).

owner of the professional corporation that sponsor[ed] thepension plan," the Bankruptcy Court stated, Yates could not

"participate as an employee under ERISA and . . . [thereforecould not] use its provisions to enforce the restriction on the
transfer of his beneficial interest in the Defendant Plan."
Id., at 43a-44a. In so ruling, the Bankruptcy Court relied
on Circuit precedent, including SEC v. Johnston, 143 F. 3d
260 (CA6 1998), and Fugarino v. Hartford Life & Accident
Ins. Co., 969 F. 2d 178 (CA6 1992).

The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's judg-ment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a-35a. Acknowledging that

other Courts of Appeals had reached a different conclusion,
id., at 19a, the District Court observed that it was bound by
Sixth Circuit precedent. According to the controlling SixthCircuit decisions, neither a sole proprietor,

Fugarino, 969
F. 2d, at 186, nor a sole owner of a corporation, Agrawal v.
Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 205 F. 3d 297, 302 (2000), qualifies
as a "participant" in an ERISA-sheltered employee benefitplan. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-21a. Applying Circuit

precedent, the District Court concluded:

"The fact Dr. Yates was not qualified to participate in
an ERISA protected plan means none of the money hecontributed to the Plan as an `employee' was ever a part

of an ERISA plan. The $50,467.46 he returned to the
Plan was not protected by ERISA, because none of themoney he had in the Plan was protected by ERISA."

Id., at 20a.
The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment.287 F. 3d 521. The Court of Appeals adhered to its "published caselaw [holding] that `a sole proprietor or sole shareholder of a business must be considered an employer and not
an employee . . . for purposes of ERISA.' " Id., at 525 (quoting Fugarino, 969 F. 2d, at 186). "[T]he spendthrift clause
in the Yates profit sharing/pension plan," the appeals court
accordingly ruled, "[was] not enforceable by Dr. Yates under

ERISA." 287 F. 3d, at 526. The Sixth Circuit's determina-tion that Yates was not a "participant" in the Profit Sharing

Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether,had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment
would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustee'sreach. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a.

We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 957 (2003), in view ofthe division of opinion among the Circuits on the question

ERISA's definitions of "employee," and, in turn, "partici-pant," are uninformative. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.

Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323 (1992) ("ERISA's nominal defini-tion of `employee' as `any individual employed by an employer' is completely circular and explains nothing." (citationomitted)). We therefore look to other provisions of the Act
for instruction. See ibid. ERISA's text contains multipleindications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants. Because these indications combineto provide "specific guidance," ibid., there is no cause in this
case to resort to common law.3Congress enacted ERISA against a backdrop of IRC provisions that permitted corporate shareholders, partners, andsole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-20. Workingshareholders have been eligible to participate in such plans
since 1942. See Revenue Act of 1942, ch. 619, $ 165(a)(4), 56Stat. 862 (a pension plan shall be tax exempt if,

inter alia,"the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not

that treating working owners as "beneficiaries" of an ERISA-qualified
plan is not an acceptable solution. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 9 (The beneficiary approach "has no logical stopping point, because
it would allow a plan to cover anyone it chooses, including independent
contractors excluded by [Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S.

resolve it.

Opinion of the Court
employees"). Two decades later, still prior to ERISA'sadoption, Congress permitted partners and sole proprietors

to establish tax-favored pension plans, commonly known as"H. R. 10" or "Keogh" plans. Self-Employed Individuals
Tax Retirement Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 809; Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 19. Thus, by 1962, working owners of all kinds could contribute to tax-qualified retirementplans.

ERISA's enactment in 1974 did not change that situation.4Rather, Congress' objective was to harmonize ERISA with
longstanding tax provisions. Title I of ERISA and relatedIRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of
working owners in covered benefit plans. Id., at 14-16.Most notably, several Title I provisions partially exempt certain plans in which working owners likely participate fromotherwise mandatory ERISA provisions. Exemptions of
this order would be unnecessary if working owners couldnot qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the
first place.To illustrate, Title I frees the following plans from the
Act's fiduciary responsibility requirements:

"(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by anemployer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of managementor highly compensated employees; or

"(2) any agreement described in section 736 of [theIRC], which provides payments to a retired partner or
deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor ininterest." 29 U. S. C. $ 1101(a).

The IRC defines the term "highly compensated employee"to include "any employee who . . . was a 5-percent owner at
any time during the year or the preceding year." 26 U. S. C.

4 A particular employee benefit plan may be covered by one title of
ERISA, but not by another. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 9.

PLAN v. HENDON

Opinion of the Court

$ 414(q)(1)(A). A "5-percent owner," the IRC further speci-fies, is "any person who owns . . . more than 5 percent of the

outstanding stock of the corporation or stock possessingmore than 5 percent of the total combined voting power of
all stock of the corporation" if the employer is a corporation,or "any person who owns more than 5 percent of the capital
or profits interest in the employer" if the employer is not

a corporation. $ 416(i)(1)(B)(i). Under these definitions,some working owners would fit the description "highly compensated employees." Similarly, agreements that makepayments to retired partners, or to deceased partners' successors in interest, surely involve plans in which working
partners participate.

Title I also contains more limited exemptions from
ERISA's fiduciary responsibility requirements. These exemptions, too, cover plans that ordinarily include working
owners as participants. To illustrate, assets of an employee
benefit plan typically must be held in trust. See 29 U. S. C.

$ 1103(a). That requirement, however, does not apply, inter
alia, "to a plan . . . some or all of the participants of which
are employees described in section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC]."

$ 1103(b)(3)(A). IRC $ 401(c)(1)(A) defines an "employee" to
include "a self-employed individual"; and IRC $$ 401(c)(1)(B)
and (2)(A)(i), in turn, define "a self-employed individual" to
cover an individual with "earned income" from "a trade or
business in which personal services of the taxpayer are a
material income-producing factor." This definition no doubt
encompasses working sole proprietors and partners. 26
U. S. C. $$ 1402(a) and (c).

Title I also contains exemptions from ERISA's prohibited
transaction provisions. Like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, these exemptions indicate that working owners
may participate in ERISA-qualified plans. For example, although Title I generally bars transactions between a plan
and a party in interest, 29 U. S. C. $ 1106, the Act permits,
among other exceptions, loans to plan participants if certain

Opinion of the Court
conditions are satisfied, $ 1108(b)(1). One condition is that
loans must not be "made available to highly compensated
employees . . . in an amount greater than the amount made
available to other employees." $ 1108(b)(1)(B). As just observed, see supra, at 13-14, some working owners, including
shareholder-employees, qualify as "highly compensated employees." Title I goes on to exclude "owner-employees," as
defined in the IRC, from the participant loan exemption.

$ 1108(d)(1). Under the IRC's definition, owner-employees
include partners "who ow[n] more than 10 percent of either
the capital interest or the profits interest in [a] partnership"
and sole proprietors, but not shareholder-employees. 26
U. S. C. $ 401(c)(3). In sum, Title I's provisions involving
loans to plan participants, by explicit inclusion or exclusion,
assume that working owners--shareholder-employees, partners, and sole proprietors--may participate in ERISAqualified benefit plans.

Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative. Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 17, and n. 8. Title IV
does not apply to plans "established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners," 29 U. S. C. $ 1321(b)(9)
(emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or
greater ownership interest, $ 1322(b)(5)(A). But Title IV
does cover plans in which substantial owners participate
along with other employees. See $ 1322(b)(5)(B). In addition, Title IV does not cover plans established by "professional service employer[s]" with 25 or fewer active participants. $ 1321(b)(13). Yates's medical practice was set up as
a professional service employer. See $ 1321(c)(2)(A) (a "professional service employer" is "any proprietorship, partnership, corporation . . . owned or controlled by professional
individuals . . . the principal business of which is the performance of professional services"). But significantly larger
plans--plans covering more than 25 employees--established

Opinion of the Court

by a professional service employer would presumably qualifyfor protection.

Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amendedby Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower
courts: Under ERISA, a working owner may have dual sta-tus, i. e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in a
plan and, at the same time, the employer (or owner ormember of the employer) who established the plan. Both
Title IV and the IRC describe the "employer" of a sole pro-prietor or partner. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1301(b)(1) ("An individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated tradeor business is treated as his own employer, and a partnership
is treated as the employer of each partner who is an em-ployee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC].");
26 U. S. C. $ 401(c)(4) ("An individual who owns the entireinterest in an unincorporated trade or business shall be
treated as his own employer. A partnership shall be treatedas the employer of each partner who is an employee within
the meaning of [$ 401(c)(1)]."). These descriptions expresslyanticipate that a working owner can wear two hats, as an
employer and employee. Cf. Clackamas GastroenterologyAssociates, P. C. v. Wells, 538 U. S. 440, 453 (2003) (

Ginsburg, J., dissenting) ("Clackamas readily acknowledges thatthe physician-shareholders are `employees' for ERISA

purposes.").In sum, because the statute's text is adequately informative, we need not look outside ERISA itself to conclude withsecurity that Congress intended working owners to qualify
as plan participants.5Congress' aim is advanced by our reading of the text.
The working employer's opportunity personally to partici5 We do not suggest that each provision described supra, at 13-15 and
this page, in isolation, would compel the Court's reading. But cf. post, at
25-26 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). In combination, however,
the provisions supply "specific guidance" adequate to obviate any need to
expound on common law. See Darden, 503 U. S., at 323.

Opinion of the Court
pate and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to thecreation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowner

employees alike. See Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 21-22. Treating working owners as participants not
only furthers ERISA's purpose to promote and facilitate em-ployee benefit plans. Recognizing the working owner as an
ERISA-sheltered plan participant also avoids the anomalythat the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes:
federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner. See,

e. g., Agrawal,205 F. 3d, at 302 (because sole shareholder does not rank as

a plan participant under ERISA, his state-law claims againstinsurer are not preempted). ERISA's goal, this Court has
emphasized, is "uniform national treatment of pension bene-fits." Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753, 765 (1992). Excepting working owners from the federal Act's coveragewould generate administrative difficulties and is hardly consistent with a national uniformity goal. Cf. Madonia, 11F. 3d, at 450 ("Disallowing shareholders . . . from being plan
`participants' would result in disparate treatment of corpo-rate employees' claims, thereby frustrating the statutory
purpose of ensuring similar treatment for all claims relatingto employee benefit plans.").

We note finally that a 1999 Department of Labor advisoryopinion accords with our comprehension of Title I's definition
and coverage provisions. Pension and Welfare BenefitsAdmin., U. S. Dept. of Labor, Advisory Opinion 99-04A, 26
BNA Pension and Benefits Rep. 559 (hereinafter AdvisoryOpinion 99-04A). Confirming that working owners may
qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the De-partment's opinion concludes:

"In our view, the statutory provisions of ERISA,taken as a whole, reveal a clear Congressional design to
include `working owners' within the definition of `partici-pant' for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Congress could
not have intended that a pension plan operated so as to

satisfy the complex tax qualification rules applicable tobenefits provided to `owner-employees' under the provisions of Title II of ERISA, and with respect to whichan employer faithfully makes the premium payments required to protect the benefits payable under the plan tosuch individuals under Title IV of ERISA, would somehow transgress against the limitations of the definitionscontained in Title I of ERISA. Such a result would
cause an intolerable conflict between the separate titlesof ERISA, leading to the sort of `absurd results' that the
Supreme Court warned against in Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318 (1992)." Id., at560-561 (footnote omitted).

This agency view on the qualification of a self-employed indi-vidual for plan participation reflects a "body of experience
and informed judgment to which courts and litigants mayproperly resort for guidance." Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U. S. 134, 140 (1944). B

The Sixth Circuit's leading decision in point--its 1992 de-termination in Fugarino--relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR$ 2510.3-3. The Fugarino court read the Department's regulation to rule out classification of a working owner as anemployee of the business he owns. Entitled "Employee benefit plan," the regulation complements $ 3(3) of ERISA, 29U. S. C. $ 1002(3), which defines "employee benefit plan," see
supra, at 7; the regulation provides, in relevant part:

"(b) Plans without employees. For purposes of titleI of the Act and this chapter, the term `employee benefit

plan' shall not include any plan, fund or program, otherthan an apprenticeship or other training program, under
which no employees are participants covered under theplan, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. For
example, a so-called `Keogh' or `H. R. 10' plan under

19Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
which only partners or only a sole proprietor are participants covered under the plan will not be covered under
title I. However, a Keogh plan under which one or
more common law employees, in addition to the selfemployed individuals, are participants covered under
the plan, will be covered under title I. . . .

"(c) Employees. For purposes of this section:

"(1) An individual and his or her spouse shall not be
deemed to be employees with respect to a trade or business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
wholly owned by the individual or by the individual and
his or her spouse, and

"(2) A partner in a partnership and his or her spouse
shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to
the partnership." 29 CFR $ 2510.3-3 (2003) (emphasis
added and deleted).

In common with other Courts of Appeals that have held
working owners do not qualify as participants in ERISAgoverned employee benefit plans, the Sixth Circuit apparently understood the regulation to provide a generally applicable definition of the term "employee," controlling for all
Title I purposes. Fugarino, 969 F. 2d, at 185-186 ("As a
result of [the] regulatio[n], a plan whose sole beneficiaries are
the company's owners cannot qualify as a plan under ERISA.
Further, an employer cannot ordinarily be an employee or
participant under ERISA." (citation omitted)). See also
Kwatcher, 879 F. 2d, at 961 ("By its terms, the regulation
unambiguously debars a sole shareholder . . . from `employee'
status, notwithstanding that he may work for the corporation he owns, shoulder to shoulder with eligible (non-owner)
employees."); Giardono, 867 F. 2d, at 412 ("[This] regulatio[n]
exclude[s] from the definition of an employee any individual
who wholly owns a trade or business, whether incorporated
or unincorporated.").

the regulation: "Th[e] limiting definition of employee [in$ 2510.3-3(c)] addresses the threshold issue of whether an

ERISA plan exists. It is not consistent with the purpose ofERISA to apply this limiting definition of employee to the
statutory definitions of participant and beneficiary." 205
F. 3d, at 303. The Circuit, however, did not overrule itsearlier interpretation. See 287 F. 3d, at 525 (case below)

("[T]he three judge panel before which this appeal is cur-rently pending has no authority to overrule

Fugarino.");
Agrawal, 205 F. 3d, at 302 ("the decision in the present caseis preordained by the

Fugarino holding").
The Department of Labor's 1999 advisory opinion, see
supra, at 17, interprets the "Employee benefit plan" regulation as follows:

"In its regulation at 29 C. F. R. 2510.3-3, the Department clarified that the term `employee benefit plan' asdefined in section 3(3) of Title I does not include a plan

the only participants of which are `[a]n individual andhis or her spouse . . . with respect to a trade of business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which iswholly owned by the individual or by the individual and
his or her spouse' or `[a] partner in a partnership and
his or her spouse.' The regulation further specifies,however, that a plan that covers as participants `one or

more common law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals' will be included in the definition
of `employee benefit plan' under section 3(3). The conclusion of this opinion, that such `self-employed individuals' are themselves `participants' in the covered
plan, is fully consistent with that regulation." Advisory Opinion 99-04A, at 561, n. 7 (emphasis added).

This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth Circuit, see Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 26, merits the Judicia541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ry's respectful consideration. Cf. Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. C., 538 U. S., at 449 (Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission guidelines under the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 are persuasive).

The Department's regulation itself reveals the definitional
prescription's limited scope. The prescription describes
"employees" only "[f]or purposes of this section," supra, at
19 (emphasis deleted), i. e., the section defining "employee
benefit plans." Accordingly, the regulation addresses only
what plans qualify as "employee benefit plans" under Title I
of ERISA. Plans that cover only sole owners or partners
and their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside Title
I's domain.6 Plans covering working owners and their nonowner employees, on the other hand, fall entirely within
ERISA's compass.7 See Vega, 188 F. 3d, at 294 ("We . . .
interpret the regulatio[n] to define employee only for purposes of determining the existence of an ERISA plan."); Ma6 Courts agree that if a benefit plan covers only working owners, it is
not covered by Title I. See, e. g., Slamen v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,
166 F. 3d 1102, 1105 (CA11 1999) (sole shareholder is not a participant
where disability plan covered only him); In re Watson, 161 F. 3d 593, 597
(CA9 1998) (sole shareholder is not a participant where retirement plan
covered only him); SEC v. Johnston, 143 F. 3d 260, 262-263 (CA6 1998)
(owner is not a participant where pension plan covered only owner and
"perhaps" his wife); Schwartz v. Gordon, 761 F. 2d 864, 867 (CA2 1985)
(self-employed individual is not a participant where he is the only contributor to a Keogh plan). Such a plan, however, could qualify for favorable
tax treatment. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 9.

7 Section 2510.3-3's preamble supports this interpretation. The preamble states, in relevant part:
"According to the comments [concerning proposed $ 2510.3-3], a definition
of `employee' excluding self-employed individuals might raise problems
under section 404(a)(1) with respect to disbursements to self-employed
individuals from `Keogh' or `H. R. 10' plans covering both self-employed
individuals and `common law' employees. Therefore, the definition of
`employee' formerly appearing in proposed $ 2510.3-6 has been inserted
into $ 2510.3-3 and restricted in scope to that section." 40 Fed. Reg.
34528 (1975) (emphasis added).

PLAN v. HENDON

Opinion of the Court

donia, 11 F. 3d, at 449-450 ("[T]he regulation does not govern the issue of whether someone is a `participant' in an
ERISA plan, once the existence of that plan has been established. This makes perfect sense: once a plan has been established, it would be anomalous to have those persons benefitting from it governed by two disparate sets of legal
obligations.").

Also in common with other Courts of Appeals that have
denied participant status to working owners, the Sixth Circuit's leading decision mistakenly relied, in addition, on
ERISA's "anti-inurement" provision, 29 U. S. C. $ 1103(c)(1),
which prohibits plan assets from inuring to the benefit of
employers. See Fugarino, 969 F. 2d, at 186 ("A fundamental
requirement of ERISA is that `the assets of a plan shall
never inure to the benefit of any employer . . . .' "); Kwatcher,
879 F. 2d, at 960 ("Once a person has been found to fit within
the `employer' integument, [$ 1103(c)(1)] prohibits payments
to him from a qualified plan."); Giardono, 867 F. 2d, at 411
("It is a fundamental requirement of ERISA that `. . . the
assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any
employer . . . .' ").

Correctly read, however, the anti-inurement provision
does not preclude Title I coverage of working owners as plan
participants. It states that, with enumerated exceptions,
"the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any
employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the
plan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1103(c)(1). The provision demands only
that plan assets be held for supplying benefits to plan participants. Like the Department of Labor regulation, see supra,
at 18-19, the anti-inurement provision does not address the
discrete question whether working owners, along with nonowner employees, may be participants in ERISA-sheltered
plans. As the Fifth Circuit observed in Vega:

23Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
"Th[e] [anti-inurement] provision refers to the congres-sional determination that funds contributed by the employer (and, obviously, by the [nonowner] employees . . .)must never revert to the employer; it does not relate to
plan benefits being paid with funds or assets of the planto cover a legitimate pension or health benefit claim by
an employee who happens to be a stockholder or eventhe sole shareholder of a corporation." 188 F. 3d, at
293, n. 5.
ERISA's anti-inurement provision is based on the anal-ogous exclusive benefit provision in the IRC, 26 U. S. C.

$ 401(a)(2), which has never been understood to bar tax-qualified plan participation by working owners. See H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, pp. 302-303 (1974); Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 29. The purpose of the antiinurement provision, in common with ERISA's other fiduci-ary responsibility provisions, is to apply the law of trusts to
discourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent invest-ment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers and
others. See, e. g., Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Doe, 76 F. 3d206, 209 (CA8 1996). Those concerns are not implicated by
paying benefits to working owners who participate on anequal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protected
plans.In sum, the anti-inurement provision, like the Department
of Labor regulation, establishes no categorical barrier toworking owner participation in ERISA plans. Whether
Yates himself, in his handling of loan repayments, see supra,at 8, engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurement
provision is an issue not yet reached by the courts below,one on which we express no opinion.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
The Court uses a sledgehammer to kill a gnat--though itmay be a sledgehammer prescribed by United States v. Mead

Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001). I dissented from that case, seeid., at 257, and remain of the view that authoritative interpretations of law by the implementing agency, if reasonable,are entitled to respect. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).In the present case the Solicitor General of the United
States, in a brief signed by the Acting Solicitor of Labor, hasput forward as the "considered view of the agency charged
by Congress with the administration and enforcement ofTitle I of ERISA," an interpretation of the relevant terms
of that Act which would allow working owners (includingsole owners, such as Dr. Yates) to be plan participants under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA). Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 26.There is no doubt that this position is the official view of the

Department of Labor, and that it has not been contrived forthis litigation. The Solicitor General's brief relies upon a
Department of Labor advisory opinion, issued more than fiveyears ago, which concluded that "the statutory provisions of
ERISA, taken as a whole, reveal a clear Congressional de-sign to include `working owners' within the definition of `par541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Welfare Benefits Admin., U. S. Dept. of Labor, Advisory
Opinion 99-04A (Feb. 4, 1999), 26 BNA Pension and Benefits
Rep. 559, 560 (1999).

The Department's interpretive conclusion is certainly reasonable (the Court's lengthy analysis says that it is inevitable); it is therefore binding upon us. See Barnhart v.
Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). I would reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit on that basis. The Court's approach, which denies many agency interpretations their conclusive effect and thrusts the courts into authoritative
judicial interpretation, deprives administrative agencies of
two of their principal virtues: (1) the power to resolve statutory questions promptly, and with nationwide effect, and
(2) the power (within the reasonable bounds of the text) to
change the application of ambiguous laws as time and experience dictate. The Court's approach invites lengthy litigation in all the circuits--the product of which (when finally
announced by this Court) is a rule of law that only Congress
can change.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed. The Court persuasively addresses the Court of Appeals' many errors in this case. See
ante, at 18-23. I do not, however, find convincing the
Court's reliance on textual "indications," ante, at 12. The
text of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA) is certainly consistent with the Court's interpretation of the word "employee" to include so-called "working owners." * Ibid. However, the various Title I exemptions relied upon so heavily by the Court, see ante, at 13-15,

*The Court does not clearly define who exactly makes up this class of
"working owners," even though members of this class are now considered
categorically to fall under ERISA's definition of "employee."

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment

are equally consistent with an interpretation of "employee"that would not include all "working owners."

As an example, the Court places weight on the exceptionto the exemption from 29 U. S. C. $ 1106, which bars loans
made to parties in interest that are " `made available tohighly compensated employees . . . in an amount greater than
the amount made available to other employees.' " Ante, at15 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 1108(b)(1)(B)). The Court notes
that "some working owners . . . qualify as `highly compen-sated employees.' "

Ante, at 15. That may be true, butthere are surely numerous "highly compensated employees"

who would both be "employees" under the usual, common-law meaning of that term (and hence "employees" under
ERISA, see Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S.318 (1992)), and would also not be considered "working owners" as the Court uses the term. It is entirely possible,then, that Congress was merely attempting to exclude these
individuals from $ 1106, rather than assuming that all "work-ing owners" were "employees." Hence, the existence of this
exception tells us nothing about whether Congress "intendedworking owners" to be "employees" under ERISA.

Ante,at 12.

Since the text is inconclusive, we must turn to thecommon-law understanding of the term "employee." Darden, supra, at 322-323. On remand, then, I would directthe Court of Appeals to address whether the common-law
understanding of the term "employee," as used in ERISA,includes Dr. Yates. I would be surprised if it did not, see
In re Baker, 114 F. 3d 636, 639 (CA7 1997) (corporation's sep-arate legal existence from shareholder must be respected);
Madonia v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, 11 F. 3d444, 448-449 (CA4 1993) (same), but this is a matter best
resolved, in the first instance, by the court below.

Syllabus

BALDWIN v. REESE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-964. Argued December 8, 2003--Decided March 2, 2004
Before seeking federal habeas relief, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1), giving the State the " `opportunity to . . . correct' alleged violations of its prisoners' federal
rights," Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364, 365, which means he must
"fairly present" his claim in each appropriate state court to alert that
court to the claim's federal nature. After respondent Reese appealed
his state convictions and sentences and the lower state courts denied
him collateral relief, the Oregon Supreme Court denied him discretionary review. His subsequent federal habeas petition raised, inter alia,
a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim.
The Federal District Court held that Reese had not "fairly presented"
this claim to the state courts because his state appeals court brief had
not indicated that he was complaining about a federal law violation.
The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the "fair presentation" requirement
satisfied because the State Supreme Court justices had had the opportunity to read the lower court decision before deciding whether to grant
discretionary review. And, had they read that opinion, they would
have, or should have, realized that his claim rested upon federal law.

Held: A state prisoner ordinarily does not "fairly present" a federal claim

to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, a brief, or
similar papers to find material that will alert it to the presence of such
a claim. Pp. 30-34.

(a) Assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the
State Supreme Court to the federal nature of his claim, Reese failed to
meet the "fair presentation" standard. To say that a petitioner "fairly
presents" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that
claim only by reading the lower court opinions is to say that those
judges must read those opinions--for otherwise they would forfeit the
State's opportunity to decide the claim in the first instance. Federal
habeas law does not impose such a requirement. That requirement
would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices, since they do not necessarily read lower court opinions in every
case. And it would impose a serious burden upon those judges with
discretionary review powers, whose heavy workloads would be significantly increased if they had to read through lower court opinions or
briefs in every instance. Finally, the requirement is unnecessary to

avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners
who may eventually seek federal habeas. A litigant can easily indicate
his claim's federal law basis in a petition or brief, for example, by citing
to the federal source of law on which he relies or simply labeling the
claim "federal." Pp. 30-32.

(b) This Court is not wrong to assume that Reese's petition by itself
failed to alert the State Supreme Court to his claim's federal nature.
He must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" refers to a federal claim, cite any
case that might have alerted the court to his claim's alleged federal
nature, or even contain a factual description supporting his claim.
Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless "fairly presents" a federal
"ineffective assistance" claim because (1) "ineffective" is a term of art
in Oregon that refers only to federal law claims, and (2) the state-law
standards for adjudicating state and federal "inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance" claims are identical. This Court rejects his first
argument because he has not demonstrated that state law uses "ineffective assistance" as referring only to a federal-law, rather than a similar
state-law, claim. However, Reese's second argument was not addressed
by, or presented to, the Ninth Circuit, and first appeared here in Reese's
merits brief. Because the issue is complex and lower court consideration would help in its resolution, the Court, without expressing any
view on the issue's merits, exercises its Rule 15.2 discretion and deems
the argument waived. Pp. 32-34.

ment is in violation of [Oregon state law]." Id., at 48.It said that his trial counsel's conduct violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution. Ibid. But it did notsay that his separate appellate "ineffective assistance" claim
violated federal law. The Oregon Supreme Court deniedreview.

Reese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus,raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim
that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent himduring one of his direct state-court appeals. The Federal
District Court held that Reese had not "fairly presented" hisfederal "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" claim to
the higher state courts because his brief in the state appealscourt had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law.A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District
Court. 282 F. 3d 1184 (2002). Although the majority ap-parently believed that Reese's petition itself did not alert the
Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate"ineffective assistance" claim, it did not find that fact determinative. Id., at 1193-1194. Rather, it found that Reesehad satisfied the "fair presentation" requirement because the
justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had "the opportu-nity to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to
be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionaryreview." Id., at 1194 (emphasis added). Had they read the
opinion of the lower state trial court, the majority added,the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese's
claim rested upon federal law. Ibid.We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth
Circuit has correctly interpreted the "fair presentation"requirement.

II
We begin by assuming that Reese's petition by itself didnot properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal

nature of Reese's claim. On that assumption, Reese failed

31Cite as: 541 U. S. 27 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
to meet the "fair presentation" standard, and the Ninth Cir-cuit was wrong to hold the contrary.

We recognize that the justices of the Oregon SupremeCourt did have an "opportunity" to read the lower court
opinions in Reese's case. That opportunity means that thejudges

could have read them. But to say that a petitioner
"fairly presents" a federal claim when an appellate judge can
discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions inthe case is to say that those judges

must read the lower
court opinions--for otherwise they would forfeit the State'sopportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.

In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such
a requirement.

For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate
judges to alter their ordinary review practices. Appellate
judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but
they do not necessarily do so in every case. Sometimes an
appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of
the briefs alone. That is particularly so where the question
at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court
decision. In such instances, the nature of the issue may
matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court
decision. And the nature of the issue alone may lead the
court to decide not to hear the case. Indeed, the Oregon
Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review. And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7)
(2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to
identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short
statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, "including appropriate authorities."

For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would
impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate
courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.
Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be signifi541US1 Unit: $U28 [05-08-06 13:17:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
32 BALDWIN v. REESE

Opinion of the Court
cantly increased if their judges had to read through lowercourt opinions or briefs in every instance. See National

Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics2002, pp. 106-110 (Table 2) (for example, in 2001, Oregon
appellate courts received a total of 5,341 appeals, includ-ing 908 petitions for discretionary review to its Supreme
Court; California appellate courts received 32,273, including8,860 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Louisiana appellate courts received 13,117, including 3,230 discretion-ary Supreme Court petitions; Illinois appellate courts received 12,411, including 2,325 discretionary Supreme Courtpetitions).

Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary toavoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state
prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus. A liti-gant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the
federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition orbrief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim
the federal source of law on which he relies or a case decidingsuch a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the
claim "federal."For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut theconsiderations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote. We consequently hold that or-dinarily a state prisoner does not "fairly present" a claim to
a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or abrief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the
presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such asa lower court opinion in the case, that does so.

Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assumethat his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme

Court to the federal nature of his "ineffective assistance ofappellate counsel" claim. We do not agree.

Opinion of the Court
Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly
say that the words "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" refer to a federal claim. The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims
but not in respect to this one. The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the
alleged federal nature of the claim. And the petition does
not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.
Cf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 163 (1996); Duncan,
513 U. S., at 366.

Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless "fairly presents" a federal "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel"
claim for two reasons. First, he says that the word "ineffective" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law
claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in
Oregon are solely referred to as "inadequate assistance"
claims. And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have
known, from his use of the word "ineffective," that his claim
was federal.

Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law
uses the words "ineffective assistance" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim. See,
e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P.
2d 1207, 1210, 1211 (2000) (using "ineffective assistance" to
refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution), rev'd in part,
333 Ore. 350, 39 P. 3d 851 (2002). Indeed, Reese's own petition uses both phrases--"ineffective assistance" and "inadequate assistance"--at different points to refer to what is
apparently a single claim.

Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal "inadequate/ineffective appellate
assistance" claims are identical. He adds that, where that
identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim's federal
nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily "fairly present" the corresponding federal claim.

34 BALDWIN v. REESE

Stevens, J., dissenting
However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument,and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads

us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration ofthe argument in that court. Indeed, the argument first
made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on themerits. Under this Court's Rule 15.2, "a nonjurisdictional
argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to
a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived."
Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument falls squarelywithin the rule. The complex nature of Reese's claim and

its broad implications suggest that its consideration by thelower courts would help in its resolution. Hence, without
expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exerciseour Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived
in this Court. See, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc.,525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999)

(per curiam); South Central
Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999);
cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002).

For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
It is appropriate to disregard this Court's Rule 15.2 and
permit respondents to defend a judgment on grounds not
raised in the brief in opposition when the omitted issue
is "predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question
presented." Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). I would do so in this case.
Respondent satisfactorily demonstrates that there is no
significant difference between an ineffective-assistance-ofappellate-counsel claim predicated on the Oregon Constitution and one based on federal law. Brief for Respondent

CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON
certiorari to the supreme court of washington
No. 02-9410. Argued November 10, 2003--Decided March 8, 2004
Petitioner was tried for assault and attempted murder. The State sought

to introduce a recorded statement that petitioner's wife Sylvia had made
during police interrogation, as evidence that the stabbing was not in
self-defense. Sylvia did not testify at trial because of Washington's
marital privilege. Petitioner argued that admitting the evidence would
violate his Sixth Amendment right to be "confronted with the witnesses
against him." Under Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, that right does not
bar admission of an unavailable witness's statement against a criminal
defendant if the statement bears "adequate `indicia of reliability,' " a
test met when the evidence either falls within a "firmly rooted hearsay
exception" or bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness."
Id., at 66. The trial court admitted the statement on the latter ground.
The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction, deeming the statement
reliable because it was nearly identical to, i. e., interlocked with, petitioner's own statement to the police, in that both were ambiguous as to
whether the victim had drawn a weapon before petitioner assaulted him.

Held: The State's use of Sylvia's statement violated the Confrontation

Clause because, where testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is confrontation. Pp. 42-69.

(a) The Confrontation Clause's text does not alone resolve this case,
so this Court turns to the Clause's historical background. That history
supports two principles. First, the principal evil at which the Clause
was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, particularly
the use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused. The
Clause's primary object is testimonial hearsay, and interrogations by
law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class. Second, the
Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of
a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify
and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.
English authorities and early state cases indicate that this was the common law at the time of the founding. And the "right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him," Amdt. 6, is most naturally read
as a reference to the common-law right of confrontation, admitting only
those exceptions established at the time of the founding. See Mattox
v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243. Pp. 42-56.

Syllabus
(b) This Court's decisions have generally remained faithful to the
Confrontation Clause's original meaning. See, e. g., Mattox, supra.
Pp. 57-59.

(c) However, the same cannot be said of the rationales of this Court's
more recent decisions. See Roberts, supra, at 66. The Roberts test
departs from historical principles because it admits statements consisting of ex parte testimony upon a mere reliability finding. Pp. 60-61.

(d) The Confrontation Clause commands that reliability be assessed
in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.
Roberts allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability, thus replacing
the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a
wholly foreign one. Pp. 61-62.

(e) Roberts' framework is unpredictable. Whether a statement is
deemed reliable depends on which factors a judge considers and how
much weight he accords each of them. However, the unpardonable vice
of the Roberts test is its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial
statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.
Pp. 62-65.

(f) The instant case is a self-contained demonstration of Roberts'
unpredictable and inconsistent application. It also reveals Roberts' failure to interpret the Constitution in a way that secures its intended
constraint on judicial discretion. The Constitution prescribes the procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials,
and this Court, no less than the state courts, lacks authority to replace
it with one of its own devising. Pp. 65-68.

Opinion of the Court
Assistant Attorney General Wray, Sri Srinivasan, and JoelM. Gershowitz.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Michael Crawford stabbed a man who allegedlytried to rape his wife, Sylvia. At his trial, the State played

for the jury Sylvia's tape-recorded statement to the policedescribing the stabbing, even though he had no opportunity
for cross-examination. The Washington Supreme Court up-held petitioner's conviction after determining that Sylvia's
statement was reliable. The question presented is whetherthis procedure complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shallenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses
against him." I

On August 5, 1999, Kenneth Lee was stabbed at his apart-ment. Police arrested petitioner later that night. After
giving petitioner and his wife Miranda warnings, detectivesinterrogated each of them twice. Petitioner eventually confessed that he and Sylvia had gone in search of Lee becausehe was upset over an earlier incident in which Lee had tried
to rape her. The two had found Lee at his apartment, anda fight ensued in which Lee was stabbed in the torso and
petitioner's hand was cut.Petitioner gave the following account of the fight:

"Q. Okay. Did you ever see anything in [Lee's] hands?
"A. I think so, but I'm not positive.
"Q. Okay, when you think so, what do you mean by that?

Sylvia generally corroborated petitioner's story about theevents leading up to the fight, but her account of the fight
itself was arguably different--particularly with respect towhether Lee had drawn a weapon before petitioner assaulted him:

40 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
"A. (pausing) um um (no)." Id., at 137 (punctuationadded).

The State charged petitioner with assault and attemptedmurder. At trial, he claimed self-defense. Sylvia did not
testify because of the state marital privilege, which gener-ally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouse's
consent. See Wash. Rev. Code $ 5.60.060(1) (1994). InWashington, this privilege does not extend to a spouse's outof-court statements admissible under a hearsay exception,see State v. Burden, 120 Wash. 2d 371, 377, 841 P. 2d 758,
761 (1992), so the State sought to introduce Sylvia's tape-recorded statements to the police as evidence that the stabbing was not in self-defense. Noting that Sylvia had ad-mitted she led petitioner to Lee's apartment and thus had
facilitated the assault, the State invoked the hearsay excep-tion for statements against penal interest, Wash. Rule Evid.
804(b)(3) (2003).Petitioner countered that, state law notwithstanding, admitting the evidence would violate his federal constitutionalright to be "confronted with the witnesses against him."
Amdt. 6. According to our description of that right in Ohiov.

Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), it does not bar admission ofan unavailable witness's statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bears "adequate `indicia of reliability.' "
Id., at 66. To meet that test, evidence must either fallwithin a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bear "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Ibid. The trialcourt here admitted the statement on the latter ground, offering several reasons why it was trustworthy: Sylvia wasnot shifting blame but rather corroborating her husband's
story that he acted in self-defense or "justified reprisal"; shehad direct knowledge as an eyewitness; she was describing
recent events; and she was being questioned by a "neutral"law enforcement officer. App. 76-77. The prosecution
played the tape for the jury and relied on it in closing, ar-guing that it was "damning evidence" that "completely

Opinion of the Court
refutes [petitioner's] claim of self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21,1999). The jury convicted petitioner of assault.

The Washington Court of Appeals reversed. It applieda nine-factor test to determine whether Sylvia's statement
bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and notedseveral reasons why it did not: The statement contradicted
one she had previously given; it was made in response tospecific questions; and at one point she admitted she had shut
her eyes during the stabbing. The court considered and re-jected the State's argument that Sylvia's statement was reliable because it coincided with petitioner's to such a degreethat the two "interlocked." The court determined that,
although the two statements agreed about the events leadingup to the stabbing, they differed on the issue crucial to petitioner's self-defense claim: "[Petitioner's] version assertsthat Lee may have had something in his hand when he
stabbed him; but Sylvia's version has Lee grabbing for some-thing only after he has been stabbed." App. 32.

The Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction,unanimously concluding that, although Sylvia's statement did
not fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, it bore guar-antees of trustworthiness: " `[W]hen a codefendant's confession is virtually identical [to, i. e., interlocks with,] that of adefendant, it may be deemed reliable.' " 147 Wash. 2d 424,
437, 54 P. 3d 656, 663 (2002) (quoting State v. Rice, 120 Wash.2d 549, 570, 844 P. 2d 416, 427 (1993)). The court explained:

"Although the Court of Appeals concluded that thestatements were contradictory, upon closer inspection
they appear to overlap. . . .
"[B]oth of the Crawfords' statements indicate that Leewas possibly grabbing for a weapon, but they are

equally unsure when this event may have taken place.They are also equally unsure how Michael received the
cut on his hand, leading the court to question when,if ever, Lee possessed a weapon. In this respect they
overlap. . . .

Opinion of the Court
"[N]either Michael nor Sylvia clearly stated that Leehad a weapon in hand from which Michael was simply

defending himself. And it is this omission by both thatinterlocks the statements and makes Sylvia's statement
reliable." 147 Wash. 2d, at 438-439, 54 P. 3d, at 664(internal quotation marks omitted).

We granted certiorari to determine whether the State'suse of Sylvia's statement violated the Confrontation Clause.
539 U. S. 914 (2003). II

The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause providesthat, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses againsthim." We have held that this bedrock procedural guarantee
applies to both federal and state prosecutions. Pointer v.Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965). As noted above, Roberts
says that an unavailable witness's out-of-court statementmay be admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability--i. e., falls within a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" orbears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448
U. S., at 66. Petitioner argues that this test strays from theoriginal meaning of the Confrontation Clause and urges us
to reconsider it. A

The Constitution's text does not alone resolve this case.One could plausibly read "witnesses against" a defendant to

1 The court rejected the State's argument that guarantees of trustworthiness were unnecessary since petitioner waived his confrontation rights
by invoking the marital privilege. It reasoned that "forcing the defendant to choose between the marital privilege and confronting his spouse
presents an untenable Hobson's choice." 147 Wash. 2d, at 432, 54 P. 3d,
at 660. The State has not challenged this holding here. The State also
has not challenged the Court of Appeals' conclusion (not reached by the
State Supreme Court) that the confrontation violation, if it occurred, was
not harmless. We express no opinion on these matters.

mean those who actually testify at trial, cf. Woodsidesv.

State, 3 Miss. 655, 664-665 (1837), those whose statements are offered at trial, see 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1397,p. 104 (2d ed. 1923) (hereinafter Wigmore), or something inbetween, see infra, at 52-53. We must therefore turn tothe historical background of the Clause to understand its
meaning.

The right to confront one's accusers is a concept that datesback to Roman times. See

Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, 1015
(1988); Herrmann & Speer, Facing the Accuser: Ancient andMedieval Precursors of the Confrontation Clause, 34 Va. J.

Int'l L. 481 (1994). The founding generation's immediate
source of the concept, however, was the common law. English common law has long differed from continental civil law
in regard to the manner in which witnesses give testimony
in criminal trials. The common-law tradition is one of live
testimony in court subject to adversarial testing, while the
civil law condones examination in private by judicial officers.
See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England
373-374 (1768).

Nonetheless, England at times adopted elements of the
civil-law practice. Justices of the peace or other officials examined suspects and witnesses before trial. These examinations were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that "occasioned frequent demands by the
prisoner to have his `accusers,' i. e. the witnesses against
him, brought before him face to face." 1 J. Stephen, History
of the Criminal Law of England 326 (1883). In some cases,
these demands were refused. See 9 W. Holdsworth, History
of English Law 216-217, 228 (3d ed. 1944); e. g., Raleigh's
Case, 2 How. St. Tr. 1, 15-16, 24 (1603); Throckmorton's Case,
1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875-876 (1554); cf. Lilburn's Case, 3 How.
St. Tr. 1315, 1318-1322, 1329 (Star Chamber 1637).

Pretrial examinations became routine under two statutes
passed during the reign of Queen Mary in the 16th century,
1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554), and 2 & 3 id., c. 10 (1555).

44 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
These Marian bail and committal statutes required justicesof the peace to examine suspects and witnesses in felony

cases and to certify the results to the court. It is doubtfulthat the original purpose of the examinations was to produce
evidence admissible at trial. See J. Langbein, ProsecutingCrime in the Renaissance 21-34 (1974). Whatever the original purpose, however, they came to be used as evidence in
some cases, see 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 284 (1736),resulting in an adoption of continental procedure. See 4

Holdsworth, supra, at 528-530.The most notorious instances of civil-law examination occurred in the great political trials of the 16th and 17th centuries. One such was the 1603 trial of Sir Walter Raleigh for
treason. Lord Cobham, Raleigh's alleged accomplice, had
implicated him in an examination before the Privy Council
and in a letter. At Raleigh's trial, these were read to the
jury. Raleigh argued that Cobham had lied to save himself:
"Cobham is absolutely in the King's mercy; to excuse me
cannot avail him; by accusing me he may hope for favour."
1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Suspecting that
Cobham would recant, Raleigh demanded that the judges
call him to appear, arguing that "[t]he Proof of the Common
Law is by witness and jury: let Cobham be here, let him
speak it. Call my accuser before my face . . . ." 2 How.
St. Tr., at 15-16. The judges refused, id., at 24, and, despite
Raleigh's protestations that he was being tried "by the Spanish Inquisition," id., at 15, the jury convicted, and Raleigh
was sentenced to death.

One of Raleigh's trial judges later lamented that " `the justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as
by the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh.' " 1 Jardine,
supra, at 520. Through a series of statutory and judicial
reforms, English law developed a right of confrontation that
limited these abuses. For example, treason statutes required witnesses to confront the accused "face to face" at his
arraignment. E. g., 13 Car. 2, c. 1, $ 5 (1661); see 1 Hale,

45Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
supra, at 306. Courts, meanwhile, developed relativelystrict rules of unavailability, admitting examinations only if

the witness was demonstrably unable to testify in person.See

Lord Morley's Case, 6 How. St. Tr. 769, 770-771 (H. L.
1666); 2 Hale, supra, at 284; 1 Stephen, supra, at 358. Sev-eral authorities also stated that a suspect's confession could

be admitted only against himself, and not against others he
implicated. See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 46,$ 3, pp. 603-604 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787); 1 Hale,

supra, at 585,
n. (k); 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791);cf.

Tong's Case, Kel. J. 17, 18, 84 Eng. Rep. 1061, 1062 (1662)
(treason). But see King v. Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng.
Rep. 108, 109 (1739).

One recurring question was whether the admissibility of
an unavailable witness's pretrial examination depended on
whether the defendant had had an opportunity to crossexamine him. In 1696, the Court of King's Bench answered
this question in the affirmative, in the widely reported misdemeanor libel case of King v. Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 87 Eng.
Rep. 584. The court ruled that, even though a witness was
dead, his examination was not admissible where "the defendant not being present when [it was] taken before the mayor
. . . had lost the benefit of a cross-examination." Id., at 165,
87 Eng. Rep., at 585. The question was also debated at
length during the infamous proceedings against Sir John
Fenwick on a bill of attainder. Fenwick's counsel objected
to admitting the examination of a witness who had been spirited away, on the ground that Fenwick had had no opportunity to cross-examine. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr.
537, 591-592 (H. C. 1696) (Powys) ("[T]hat which they would
offer is something that Mr. Goodman hath sworn when he
was examined . . . ; sir J. F. not being present or privy, and
no opportunity given to cross-examine the person; and I conceive that cannot be offered as evidence . . ."); id., at 592
(Shower) ("[N]o deposition of a person can be read, though
beyond sea, unless in cases where the party it is to be read

Opinion of the Court
against was privy to the examination, and might have cross-examined him . . . . [O]ur constitution is, that the person

shall see his accuser"). The examination was nonethelessadmitted on a closely divided vote after several of those
present opined that the common-law rules of procedure didnot apply to parliamentary attainder proceedings--one
speaker even admitting that the evidence would normally be
inadmissible. See id., at 603-604 (Williamson); id., at 604-605 (Chancellor of the Exchequer);

id., at 607; 3 Wigmore

$ 1364, at 22-23, n. 54. Fenwick was condemned, but theproceedings "must have burned into the general consciousness the vital importance of the rule securing the right of
cross-examination." Id., $ 1364, at 22; cf. Carmell v. Texas,
529 U. S. 513, 526-530 (2000).

Paine had settled the rule requiring a prior opportunity
for cross-examination as a matter of common law, but some
doubts remained over whether the Marian statutes prescribed an exception to it in felony cases. The statutes did
not identify the circumstances under which examinations
were admissible, see 1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554); 2 & 3 id.,
c. 10 (1555), and some inferred that no prior opportunity for
cross-examination was required. See Westbeer, supra, at 12,
168 Eng. Rep., at 109; compare Fenwick's Case, 13 How.
St. Tr., at 596 (Sloane), with id., at 602 (Musgrave). Many
who expressed this view acknowledged that it meant the
statutes were in derogation of the common law. See King
v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 710, 100 Eng. Rep. 815, 817 (K. B.
1790) (Grose, J.) (dicta); id., at 722-723, 100 Eng. Rep.,
at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.) (same); compare 1 Gilbert, Evidence, at 215 (admissible only "by Force `of the Statute' "),
with id., at 65. Nevertheless, by 1791 (the year the Sixth
Amendment was ratified), courts were applying the crossexamination rule even to examinations by justices of the
peace in felony cases. See King v. Dingler, 2 Leach 561,
562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791); King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353 (1789);

Controversial examination practices were also used in theColonies. Early in the 18th century, for example, the Virginia Council protested against the Governor for having"privately issued several commissions to examine witnesses
against particular men ex parte," complaining that "the per-son accused is not admitted to be confronted with, or defend
himself against his defamers." A Memorial Concerning theMaladministrations of His Excellency Francis Nicholson,
reprinted in 9 English Historical Documents 253, 257 (D.Douglas ed. 1955). A decade before the Revolution, England gave jurisdiction over Stamp Act offenses to the admi-ralty courts, which followed civil-law rather than common2 There is some question whether the requirement of a prior opportunity
for cross-examination applied as well to statements taken by a coroner,
which were also authorized by the Marian statutes. See 3 Wigmore

several early American authorities flatly rejected any special status for
coroner statements. See Houser, supra, at 436; Campbell, supra, at 130;

Similarly, a prominent Antifederalist writing under the pseud-onym Federal Farmer criticized the use of "written evidence" while objecting to the omission of a vicinage right:"Nothing can be more essential than the cross examining [of]
witnesses, and generally before the triers of the facts in
question. . . . [W]ritten evidence . . . [is] almost useless; itmust be frequently taken ex parte, and but very seldom

leads to the proper discovery of truth." R. Lee, Letter IVby the Federal Farmer (Oct. 15, 1787), reprinted in 1
Schwartz, supra, at 469, 473. The First Congress responded
by including the Confrontation Clause in the proposal that
became the Sixth Amendment.

Early state decisions shed light upon the original understanding of the common-law right. State v. Webb, 2 N. C.
103 (Super. L. & Eq. 1794) (per curiam), decided a mere
three years after the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, held
that depositions could be read against an accused only if they
were taken in his presence. Rejecting a broader reading of
the English authorities, the court held: "[I]t is a rule of the
common law, founded on natural justice, that no man shall be
prejudiced by evidence which he had not the liberty to cross
examine." Id., at 104.

Similarly, in State v. Campbell, 30 S. C. L. 124 (App. L.
1844), South Carolina's highest law court excluded a deposition taken by a coroner in the absence of the accused. It
held: "[I]f we are to decide the question by the established
rules of the common law, there could not be a dissenting
voice. For, notwithstanding the death of the witness, and
whatever the respectability of the court taking the depositions, the solemnity of the occasion and the weight of the
testimony, such depositions are ex parte, and, therefore,
utterly incompetent." Id., at 125. The court said that one
of the "indispensable conditions" implicitly guaranteed by
the State Constitution was that "prosecutions be carried on

to the conviction of the accused, by witnesses confronted byhim, and subjected to his personal examination." Ibid.

Many other decisions are to the same effect. Some earlycases went so far as to hold that prior testimony was inadmissible in criminal cases even if the accused had a previousopportunity to cross-examine. See Finn v. Commonwealth,
26 Va. 701, 708 (1827); State v. Atkins, 1 Tenn. 229 (Super.L. & Eq. 1807)

(per curiam). Most courts rejected thatview, but only after reaffirming that admissibility depended

on a prior opportunity for cross-examination. See UnitedStates v. Macomb, 26 F. Cas. 1132, 1133 (No. 15,702) (CC Ill.
1851); State v. Houser, 26 Mo. 431, 435-436 (1858); Kendrickv. State, 29 Tenn. 479, 485-488 (1850); Bostick v. State, 22

III
This history supports two inferences about the meaning ofthe Sixth Amendment.

A
First, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clausewas directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure,

and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidenceagainst the accused. It was these practices that the Crown
deployed in notorious treason cases like Raleigh's; that theMarian statutes invited; that English law's assertion of a
right to confrontation was meant to prohibit; and that thefounding-era rhetoric decried. The Sixth Amendment must
be interpreted with this focus in mind.Accordingly, we once again reject the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-courttestimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements

introduced at trial depends upon "the law of Evidence forthe time being." 3 Wigmore $ 1397, at 101; accord,

Dutton
v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 94 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring inresult). Leaving the regulation of out-of-court statements

to the law of evidence would render the ConfrontationClause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices. Raleigh was, after all, perfectly free to confront those who read Cobham's confession in court.This focus also suggests that not all hearsay implicates the

Sixth Amendment's core concerns. An off-hand, overheardremark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules, but it bears little resemblance to the civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clause
targeted. On the other hand, ex parte examinations might
sometimes be admissible under modern hearsay rules, but
the Framers certainly would not have condoned them.

The text of the Confrontation Clause reflects this focus.
It applies to "witnesses" against the accused--in other
words, those who "bear testimony." 2 N. Webster, An
American Dicti onary of the English Language (1828).
"Testimony," in turn, is typically "[a] solemn declaration
or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact." Ibid. An accuser who makes a formal
statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense
that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance
does not. The constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects an
especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court
statement.

Various formulations of this core class of "testimonial"
statements exist: "ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent--that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was
unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that
declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially," Brief for Petitioner 23; "extrajudicial statements . . .

contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affi-davits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions," White

v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 365 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined by
Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);"statements that were made under circumstances which

would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe thatthe statement would be available for use at a later trial,"
Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyerset al. as Amici Curiae 3. These formulations all share a
common nucleus and then define the Clause's coverage atvarious levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the
precise articulation, some statements qualify under anydefinition--for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing.Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.Police interrogations bear a striking resemblance to examinations by justices of the peace in England. The statementsare not

sworn testimony, but the absence of oath was notdispositive. Cobham's examination was unsworn, see 1

Jardine, Criminal Trials, at 430, yet Raleigh's trial has longbeen thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation, see,
e. g., Campbell, 30 S. C. L., at 130. Under the Marian stat-utes, witnesses were typically put on oath, but suspects were
not. See 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 52. Yet Hawkinsand others went out of their way to caution that such unsworn confessions were not admissible against anyone butthe confessor. See supra, at 45.

3

3 These sources--especially Raleigh's trial--refute The Chief Justice's assertion, post, at 71 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the
right of confrontation was not particularly concerned with unsworn testimonial statements. But even if, as he claims, a general bar on unsworn
hearsay made application of the Confrontation Clause to unsworn testimonial statements a moot point, that would merely change our focus from
direct evidence of original meaning of the Sixth Amendment to reasonable
inference. We find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn ex

53Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
That interrogators are police officers rather than magis-trates does not change the picture either. Justices of the

peace conducting examinations under the Marian statuteswere not magistrates as we understand that office today, but
had an essentially investigative and prosecutorial function.See 1 Stephen, Criminal Law of England, at 221; Langbein,
Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance, at 34-45. Englanddid not have a professional police force until the 19th century,
see 1 Stephen, supra, at 194-200, so it is not surprising thatother government officers performed the investigative functions now associated primarily with the police. The involve-ment of government officers in the production of testimonial
evidence presents the same risk, whether the officers arepolice or justices of the peace.

In sum, even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely con-cerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object,
and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarelywithin that class.

4

B
The historical record also supports a second proposition:that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testiparte affidavit perfectly OK. (The claim that unsworn testimony was
self-regulating because jurors would disbelieve it, cf. post, at 69-70, n. 1,
is belied by the very existence of a general bar on unsworn testimony.)
Any attempt to determine the application of a constitutional provision to
a phenomenon that did not exist at the time of its adoption (here, allegedly,
admissible unsworn testimony) involves some degree of estimation--what
The Chief Justice calls use of a "proxy," post, at 71--but that is hardly
a reason not to make the estimation as accurate as possible. Even if, as
The Chief Justice mistakenly asserts, there were no direct evidence of
how the Sixth Amendment originally applied to unsworn testimony, there
is no doubt what its application would have been.

4 We use the term "interrogation" in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense. Cf. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300-301 (1980).
Just as various definitions of "testimonial" exist, one can imagine various
definitions of "interrogation," and we need not select among them in this
case. Sylvia's recorded statement, knowingly given in response to structured police questioning, qualifies under any conceivable definition.

54 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
monial statements of a witness who did not appear at trialunless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had

had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text ofthe Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developedby the courts. Rather, the "right . . . to be confronted with
the witnesses against him," Amdt. 6, is most naturally readas a reference to the right of confrontation at common law,
admitting only those exceptions established at the time ofthe founding. See

Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237,243 (1895); cf. Houser, 26 Mo., at 433-435. As the English

authorities above reveal, the common law in 1791 conditionedadmissibility of an absent witness's examination on unavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examine. The SixthAmendment therefore incorporates those limitations. The
numerous early state decisions applying the same test con-firm that these principles were received as part of the common law in this country.5

5 The Chief Justice claims that English law's treatment of testimonial
statements was inconsistent at the time of the framing, post, at 72-73, but
the examples he cites relate to examinations under the Marian statutes.
As we have explained, to the extent Marian examinations were admissible,
it was only because the statutes derogated from the common law. See
supra, at 46-47. Moreover, by 1791 even the statutory-derogation view
had been rejected with respect to justice-of-the-peace examinations--explicitly in King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353
(1789), and King v. Dingler, 2 Leach 561, 562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383,
383-384 (1791), and by implication in King v. Radbourne, 1 Leach 457,
459-461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 331-332 (1787).

None of The Chief Justice's citations proves otherwise. King v.
Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng. Rep. 108 (1739), was decided a half century
earlier and cannot be taken as an accurate statement of the law in 1791
given the directly contrary holdings of Woodcock and Dingler. Hale's
treatise is older still, and far more ambiguous on this point, see 1 M. Hale,
Pleas of the Crown 585-586 (1736); some who espoused the requirement
of a prior opportunity for cross-examination thought it entirely consistent
with Hale's views. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 602 (H. C.
1696) (Musgrave). The only timely authority The Chief Justice cites is
King v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815 (K. B. 1790), but even that
decision provides no substantial support. Eriswell was not a criminal

Opinion of the Court
We do not read the historical sources to say that a prioropportunity to cross-examine was merely a sufficient, rather

than a necessary, condition for admissibility of testimonialstatements. They suggest that this requirement was discase at all, but a Crown suit against the inhabitants of a town to charge
them with care of an insane pauper. Id., at 707-708, 100 Eng. Rep., at
815-816. It is relevant only because the judges discuss the Marian statutes in dicta. One of them, Buller, J., defended admission of the pauper's
statement of residence on the basis of authorities that purportedly held ex
parte Marian examinations admissible. Id., at 713-714, 100 Eng. Rep., at
819. As evidence writers were quick to point out, however, his authorities said no such thing. See Peake, Evidence, at 64, n. (m) ("Mr. J. Buller
is reported to have said that it was so settled in 1 Lev. 180, and Kel. 55;
certainly nothing of the kind appears in those books"); 2 T. Starkie, Evidence 487-488, n. (c) (1826) ("Buller, J. . . . refers to Radbourne's case . . . ;
but in that case the deposition was taken in the hearing of the prisoner,
and of course the question did not arise" (citation omitted)). Two other
judges, Grose, J., and Kenyon, C. J., responded to Buller's argument by
distinguishing Marian examinations as a statutory exception to the
common-law rule, but the context and tenor of their remarks suggest they
merely assumed the accuracy of Buller's premise without independent
consideration, at least with respect to examinations by justices of the
peace. See 3 T. R., at 710, 100 Eng. Rep., at 817 (Grose, J.); id., at 722-723,
100 Eng. Rep., at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.). In fact, the case reporter specifically notes in a footnote that their assumption was erroneous. See id.,
at 710, n. (c), 100 Eng. Rep., at 817, n. (c). Notably, Buller's position on
pauper examinations was resoundingly rejected only a decade later in
King v. Ferry Frystone, 2 East 54, 55, 102 Eng. Rep. 289 (K. B. 1801)
("The point . . . has been since considered to be so clear against the admissibility of the evidence . . . that it was abandoned by the counsel . . .
without argument"), further suggesting that his views on evidence were
not mainstream at the time of the framing.

In short, none of The Chief Justice's sources shows that the law in
1791 was unsettled even as to examinations by justices of the peace under
the Marian statutes. More importantly, however, even if the statutory
rule in 1791 were in doubt, the numerous early state-court decisions make
abundantly clear that the Sixth Amendment incorporated the commonlaw right of confrontation and not any exceptions the Marian statutes
supposedly carved out from it. See supra, at 49-50; see also supra, at 47,
n. 2 (coroner statements). The common-law rule had been settled since
Paine in 1696. See King v. Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 165, 87 Eng. Rep. 584, 585
(K. B.).

Opinion of the Court
positive, and not merely one of several ways to establish re-liability. This is not to deny, as

The Chief Justice notes,that "[t]here were always exceptions to the general rule of

exclusion" of hearsay evidence. Post, at 73. Several hadbecome well established by 1791. See 3 Wigmore $ 1397, at
101; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, n. 5. Butthere is scant evidence that exceptions were invoked to
admit testimonial statements against the accused in a crimi-nal case.

6 Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial--for exam-ple, business records or statements in furtherance of a

conspiracy. We do not infer from these that the Framersthought exceptions would apply even to prior testimony.
Cf. Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 134 (1999) (plurality opin-ion) ("[A]ccomplices' confessions that inculpate a criminal
defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to thehearsay rule").

7

6 The one deviation we have found involves dying declarations. The
existence of that exception as a general rule of criminal hearsay law cannot be disputed. See, e. g., Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243-244
(1895); King v. Reason, 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 24-38 (K. B. 1722); 1 D. Jardine,
Criminal Trials 435 (1832); Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at *318; 1
G. Gilbert, Evidence 211 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); see also F. Heller, The Sixth
Amendment 105 (1951) (asserting that this was the only recognized criminal hearsay exception at common law). Although many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those
that clearly are. See Woodcock, supra, at 501-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-
354; Reason, supra, at 24-38; Peake, supra, at 64; cf. Radbourne, supra,
at 460-462, 168 Eng. Rep., at 332-333. We need not decide in this case
whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations. If this exception must be accepted on historical
grounds, it is sui generis.

7 We cannot agree with The Chief Justice that the fact "[t]hat a statement might be testimonial does nothing to undermine the wisdom of one
of these [hearsay] exceptions." Post, at 74. Involvement of government
officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents
unique potential for prosecutorial abuse--a fact borne out time and again
throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar. This
consideration does not evaporate when testimony happens to fall within

IV
Our case law has been largely consistent with these twoprinciples. Our leading early decision, for example, involved

a deceased witness's pri or trial testimony. Ma tt ox v.
United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895). In allowing the state-ment to be admitted, we relied on the fact that the defendant

had had, at the first trial, an adequate opportunity to con-front the witness: "The substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he hasonce had of seeing the witness face to face, and of subjecting
him to the ordeal of a cross-examination. This, the law says,he shall under no circumstances be deprived of . . . ."

Id.,at 244.

Our later cases conform to Mattox's holding that prior trialor preliminary hearing testimony is admissible only if the
defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine.See Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U. S. 204, 213-216 (1972); California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 165-168 (1970); Pointer v.Texas, 380 U. S., at 406-408; cf. Kirby v. United States, 174
U. S. 47, 55-61 (1899). Even where the defendant had suchan opportunity, we excluded the testimony where the government had not established unavailability of the witness.See Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 722-725 (1968); cf. Motes
v. United States, 178 U. S. 458, 470-471 (1900). We similarly
excluded accomplice confessions where the defendant had noopportunity to cross-examine. See

Roberts v. Russell, 392
U. S. 293, 294-295 (1968) (per curiam); Bruton v. United
States, 391 U. S. 123, 126-128 (1968); Douglas v. Alabama,
380 U. S. 415, 418-420 (1965). In contrast, we consideredreliability factors beyond prior opportunity for crossexamination when the hearsay statement at issue was nottestimonial. See

Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S., at 87-89 (plurality opinion).

58 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
Even our recent cases, in their outcomes, hew closely tothe traditional line. Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S., at 67-70, admitted testimony from a preliminary hearing at which thedefendant had examined the witness. Lilly v. Virginia,
supra, excluded testimonial statements that the defendanthad had no opportunity to test by cross-examination. And
Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 181-184 (1987), ad-mitted statements made unwittingly to a Federal Bureau of
Investigation informant after applying a more general testthat did

not make prior cross-examination an indispensablerequirement.

Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), on which the Staterelies, is not to the contrary. There, we rejected the State's

attempt to admit an accomplice confession. The State hadargued that the confession was admissible because it "interlocked" with the defendant's.

White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), which involved, inter alia, statements of a child victim to an investigating police officer admitted as spontaneous declarations. Id., at 349-351. It is questionable whether testimonial statements would ever have been admissible on that ground in
1791; to the extent the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations
existed at all, it required that the statements be made "immediat[ely] upon
the hurt received, and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contrive
any thing for her own advantage." Thompson v. Trevanion, Skin. 402,
90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K. B. 1693). In any case, the only question presented
in White was whether the Confrontation Clause imposed an unavailability
requirement on the types of hearsay at issue. See 502 U. S., at 348-349.
The holding did not address the question whether certain of the statements, because they were testimonial, had to be excluded even if the
witness was unavailable. We "[took] as a given . . . that the testimony
properly falls within the relevant hearsay exceptions." Id., at 351, n. 4.

admitted." Brief for Respondent 6. But this is merely apossible inference, not an inevitable one, and we do not draw
it here. If Lee had meant authoritatively to announce anexception--previously unknown to this Court's jurisprudence--for interlocking confessions, it would not have doneso in such an oblique manner. Our only precedent on interlocking confessions had addressed the entirely different
question whether a limiting instruction cured prejudice tocodefendants from admitting a defendant's

own confession
against him in a joint trial. See Parker v. Randolph, 442U. S. 62, 69-76 (1979) (plurality opinion), abrogated by

Cruz
v. New York, 481 U. S. 186 (1987).Our cases have thus remained faithful to the Framers' understanding: Testimonial statements of witnesses absentfrom trial have been admitted only where the declarant is
unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prioropportunity to cross-examine.

drawn a distinction" like the one we now draw, citing in particular Mattox
v. United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895), Kirby v. United States, 174 U. S. 47
(1899), and United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807)
(Marshall, C. J.). Post, at 71-72. But nothing in these cases contradicts
our holding in any way. Mattox and Kirby allowed or excluded evidence
depending on whether the defendant had had an opportunity for crossexamination. Mattox, supra, at 242-244; Kirby, supra, at 55-61. That
the two cases did not extrapolate a more general class of evidence to which
that criterion applied does not prevent us from doing so now. As to Burr,
we disagree with The Chief Justice's reading of the case. Although
Chief Justice Marshall made one passing reference to the Confrontation
Clause, the case was fundamentally about the hearsay rules governing
statements in furtherance of a conspiracy. The "principle so truly important" on which "inroad[s]" had been introduced was the "rule of evidence
which rejects mere hearsay testimony." See 25 F. Cas., at 193. Nothing
in the opinion concedes exceptions to the Confrontation Clause's exclusion
of testimonial statements as we use the term. The Chief Justice fails

Opinion of the Court

V
Although the results of our decisions have generally been
faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause,the same cannot be said of our rationales.

Roberts conditions the admissibility of all hearsay evidence on whetherit falls under a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bears

"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448 U. S.,at 66. This test departs from the historical principles identified above in two respects. First, it is too broad: It appliesthe same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of ex parte testimony. This often results in close constitutional scrutiny in cases that are far removed from the
core concerns of the Clause. At the same time, however,
the test is too narrow: It admits statements that do consist of
ex parte testimony upon a mere finding of reliability. This
malleable standard often fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations.

Members of this Court and academics have suggested that
we revise our doctrine to reflect more accurately the original
understanding of the Clause. See, e. g., Lilly, 527 U. S., at
140-143 (Breyer, J., concurring); White, 502 U. S., at 366

to identify a single case (aside from one minor, arguable exception, see
supra, at 58, n. 8), where we have admitted testimonial statements based
on indicia of reliability other than a prior opportunity for crossexamination. If nothing else, the test we announce is an empirically accurate explanation of the results our cases have reached.

Finally, we reiterate that, when the declarant appears for crossexamination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all
on the use of his prior testimonial statements. See California v. Green,
399 U. S. 149, 162 (1970). It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability of
some out-of-court statements " `cannot be replicated, even if the declarant
testifies to the same matters in court.' " Post, at 74 (quoting United
States v. Inadi, 475 U. S. 387, 395 (1986)). The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend
or explain it. (The Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. See Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 414 (1985).)

(Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and con-curring in judgment); A. Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure 125-131 (1997); Friedman, Confrontation: TheSearch for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L. J. 1011 (1998). They
offer two proposals: First, that we apply the ConfrontationClause only to testimonial statements, leaving the remainder
to regulation by hearsay law--thus eliminating the over-breadth referred to above. Second, that we impose an absolute bar to statements that are testimonial, absent a prioropportunity to cross-examine--thus eliminating the excessive narrowness referred to above.In

White, we considered the first proposal and rejected it.502 U. S., at 352-353. Although our analysis in this case

casts doubt on that holding, we need not definitively resolvewhether it survives our decision today, because Sylvia Crawford's statement is testimonial under any definition. Thiscase does, however, squarely implicate the second proposal.

A
Where testimonial statements are involved, we do notthink the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment's

protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much lessto amorphous notions of "reliability." Certainly none of the
authorities discussed above acknowledges any general relia-bility exception to the common-law rule. Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at oddswith the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause's
ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is aprocedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability beassessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of
cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment,not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point
on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliabil-ity can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 ("This open examination of witnesses . . . is

Opinion of the Court
much more conducive to the clearing up of truth"); M. Hale,History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258

(1713) (adversarial testing "beats and bolts out the Truthmuch better").

The Roberts test allows a jury to hear evidence, untestedby the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability. It thus replaces the constitutionallyprescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one. In this respect, it is very different from excep-tions to the Confrontation Clause that make no claim to
be a surrogate means of assessing reliability. For exam-ple, the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept)
extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitablegrounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of
determining reliability. See Reynolds v. United States, 98U. S. 145, 158-159 (1879).

The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliabil-ity determinations that

Roberts authorizes. In the face ofRaleigh's repeated demands for confrontation, the prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applying
Roberts might invoke today: that Cobham's statements wereself-inculpatory, 2 How. St. Tr., at 19, that they were not

made in the heat of passion, id., at 14, and that they werenot "extracted from [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon," id., at 29. It is not plausible that the Framers' onlyobjection to the trial was that Raleigh's judges did not properly weigh these factors before sentencing him to death.Rather, the problem was that the judges refused to allow
Raleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he could cross-examine him and try to expose his accusation as a lie.

Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obvi-ously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a
defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the SixthAmendment prescribes.

B
The legacy of Roberts in other courts vindicates the Fram-ers' wisdom in rejecting a general reliability exception.

Opinion of the Court
The framework is so unpredictable that it fails to pro-vide meaningful protection from even core confrontation

violations.Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept. There are countless factors bearing on whether astatement is reliable; the nine-factor balancing test applied
by the Court of Appeals below is representative. See, e. g.,
People v. Farrell, 34 P. 3d 401, 406-407 (Colo. 2001) (eight-factor test). Whether a statement is deemed reliable depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and howmuch weight he accords each of them. Some courts wind
up attaching the same significance to opposite facts. Forexample, the Colorado Supreme Court held a statement more
reliable because its inculpation of the defendant was "de-tailed,"

id., at 407, while the Fourth Circuit found a statement more reliable because the portion implicating anotherwas "fleeting,"

United States v. Photogrammetric Data
Servs., Inc., 259 F. 3d 229, 245 (2001). The Virginia Courtof Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness was in custody and charged with a crime (thus making
the statement more obviously against her penal interest), see
Nowlin v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 327, 335-338, 579
S. E. 2d 367, 371-372 (2003), while the Wisconsin Court of
Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness
was not in custody and not a suspect, see State v. Bintz, 2002
WI App. 204, || 13, 257 Wis. 2d 177, ||13, 650 N. W. 2d 913,
||13. Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court in one case found
a statement more reliable because it was given "immediately
after" the events at issue, Farrell, supra, at 407, while that
same court, in another case, found a statement more reliable
because two years had elapsed, Stevens v. People, 29 P. 3d
305, 316 (2001).

The unpardonable vice of the Roberts test, however, is not
its unpredictability, but its demonstrated capacity to admit
core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause
plainly meant to exclude. Despite the plurality's speculation
in Lilly, 527 U. S., at 137, that it was "highly unlikely" that

524 (2000) (same).To add insult to injury, some of the courts that admit
untested testimonial statements find reliability in the veryfactors that make the statements testimonial. As noted
earlier, one court relied on the fact that the witness's state-ment was made to police while in custody on pending
charges--the theory being that this made the statementmore clearly against penal interest and thus more reliable.
Nowlin, supra, at 335-338, 579 S. E. 2d, at 371-372. Othercourts routinely rely on the fact that a prior statement is
given under oath in judicial proceedings. E. g., Gallego,
supra, at 168 (plea allocution); Papajohn, supra, at 1120(grand jury testimony). That inculpating statements are

given in a testimonial setting is not an antidote to the con-frontation problem, but rather the trigger that makes the
Clause's demands most urgent. It is not enough to point outthat most of the usual safeguards of the adversary process
attend the statement, when the single safeguard missing isthe one the Confrontation Clause demands.

C
Roberts' failings were on full display in the proceedingsbelow. Sylvia Crawford made her statement while in police

custody, herself a potential suspect in the case. Indeed, shehad been told that whether she would be released "depend[ed] on how the investigation continues." App. 81. Inresponse to often leading questions from police detectives,
she implicated her husband in Lee's stabbing and at leastarguably undermined his self-defense claim. Despite all
this, the trial court admitted her statement, listing sev-eral reasons why it was reliable. In its opinion reversing,
the Court of Appeals listed several other reasons why thestatement was

not reliable. Finally, the State SupremeCourt relied exclusively on the interlocking character of the

541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
66 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
statement and disregarded every other factor the lowercourts had considered. The case is thus a self-contained

demonstration of Roberts' unpredictable and inconsistentapplication.

Each of the courts also made assumptions that cross-examination might well have undermined. The trial court,
for example, stated that Sylvia Crawford's statement was
reliable because she was an eyewitness with direct knowl-edge of the events. But Sylvia at one point told the police

that she had "shut [her] eyes and . . . didn't really watch"part of the fight, and that she was "in shock." App. 134.
The trial court also buttressed its reliability finding by claiming that Sylvia was "being questioned by law enforcement,
and, thus, the [questioner] is . . . neutral to her and not someone who would be inclined to advance her interests and
shade her version of the truth unfavorably toward the defendant." Id., at 77. The Framers would be astounded to
learn that ex parte testimony could be admitted against a
criminal defendant because it was elicited by "neutral" government officers. But even if the court's assessment of the
officer's motives was accurate, it says nothing about Sylvia's
perception of her situation. Only cross-examination could
reveal that.

The State Supreme Court gave dispositive weight to the
interlocking nature of the two statements--that they were
both ambiguous as to when and whether Lee had a weapon.
The court's claim that the two statements were equally ambiguous is hard to accept. Petitioner's statement is ambiguous only in the sense that he had lingering doubts about
his recollection: "A. I could a swore I seen him goin' for
somethin' before, right before everything happened. . . . [B]ut
I'm not positive." Id., at 155. Sylvia's statement, on the
other hand, is truly inscrutable, since the key timing detail
was simply assumed in the leading question she was asked:
"Q. Did Kenny do anything to fight back from this assault?"
Id., at 137 (punctuation added). Moreover, Sylvia specifi541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

67Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
cally said Lee had nothing in his hands after he was stabbed,while petitioner was not asked about that.

The prosecutor obviously did not share the court's viewthat Sylvia's statement was ambiguous--he called it "damning evidence" that "completely refutes [petitioner's] claim ofself-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999). We have no way of
knowing whether the jury agreed with the prosecutor or the
court. Far from obviating the need for cross-examination,the "interlocking" ambiguity of the two statements made it

all the more imperative that they be tested to tease out thetruth.

We readily concede that we could resolve this case by simply reweighing the "reliability factors" under Roberts and
finding that Sylvia Crawford's statement falls short. But
we view this as one of those rare cases in which the result
below is so improbable that it reveals a fundamental failure
on our part to interpret the Constitution in a way that secures its intended constraint on judicial discretion. Moreover, to reverse the Washington Supreme Court's decision
after conducting our own reliability analysis would perpetuate, not avoid, what the Sixth Amendment condemns. The
Constitution prescribes a procedure for determining the
reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than
the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our
own devising.

We have no doubt that the courts below were acting in
utmost good faith when they found reliability. The Framers, however, would not have been content to indulge this
assumption. They knew that judges, like other government
officers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rights
of the people; the likes of the dread Lord Jeffreys were not
yet too distant a memory. They were loath to leave too
much discretion in judicial hands. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6
(criminal jury trial); Amdt. 7 (civil jury trial); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 611-612 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring).

Opinion of the Court
open-ended balancing tests, we do violence to their design.Vague standards are manipulable, and, while that might be

a small concern in run-of-the-mill assault prosecutions likethis one, the Framers had an eye toward politically charged
cases like Raleigh's--great state trials where the impartial-ity of even those at the highest levels of the judiciary might
not be so clear. It is difficult to imagine Roberts' providingany meaningful protection in those circumstances.

* * *
Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly con-sistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law--as does Roberts,and as would an approach that exempted such statements
from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether. Where tes-timonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment
demands what the common law required: unavailability anda prior opportunity for cross-examination. We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definitionof "testimonial."

10 Whatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hear-ing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police

interrogations. These are the modern practices with closestkinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause
was directed.In this case, the State admitted Sylvia's testimonial statement against petitioner, despite the fact that he had noopportunity to cross-examine her. That alone is sufficient
to make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Robertsnotwithstanding, we decline to mine the record in search of
indicia of reliability. Where testimonial statements are at

issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy con-stitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.The judg ment of the Washington Supreme Court is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in the judgment.

I dissent from the Court's decision to overrule Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). I believe that the Court's adop-tion of a new interpretation of the Confrontation Clause is

not backed by sufficiently persuasive reasoning to overrulelong-established precedent. Its decision casts a mantle of
uncertainty over future criminal trials in both federal andstate courts, and is by no means necessary to decide the present case.The Court's distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, contrary to its claim, is no better rootedin history than our current doctrine. Under the common
law, although the courts were far from consistent, out-of-court statements made by someone other than the accused
and not taken under oath, unlike ex parte depositions or af-fidavits, were generally not considered substantive evidence
upon which a conviction could be based.1 See, e. g., King v.

1 Modern scholars have concluded that at the time of the founding the
law had yet to fully develop the exclusionary component of the hearsay
rule and its attendant exceptions, and thus hearsay was still often heard
by the jury. See Gallanis, The Rise of Modern Evidence Law, 84 Iowa
L. Rev. 499, 534-535 (1999); Mosteller, Remaking Confrontation Clause
and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev. 691, 738-746. In many cases, hearsay alone
was generally not considered sufficient to support a conviction; rather,
it was used to corroborate sworn witness testimony. See 5 J. Wigmore,

also J. Langbein, Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 238-239 (2003).
Even when unsworn hearsay was proffered as substantive evidence, however, because of the predominance of the oath in society, juries were
largely skeptical of it. See Landsman, Rise of the Contentious Spirit:

497, 506 (1990) (describing late 17th-century sentiments); Langbein, Criminal Trial before the Lawyers, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263, 291-293 (1978). In
the 18th century, unsworn hearsay was simply held to be of much lesser
value than were sworn affidavits or depositions.

2 Gilbert's noted in 1769:

"Hearsay is no Evidence . . . though a Person Testify what he hath heard
upon Oath, yet the Person who spake it was not upon Oath; and if a Man
had been in Court and said the same Thing and had not sworn it, he had
not been believed in a Court of Justice; for all Credit being derived from
Attestation and Evidence, it can rise no higher than the Fountain from
whence it flows, and if the first Speech was without Oath, an Oath that
there was such a Speech makes it no more than a bare speaking, and so of
no Value in a Court of Justice, where all Things were determined under
the Solemnities of an Oath . . . ."

prohibited an accused from attesting to his statements. 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791). Still, these unsworn confessions were
considered evidence only against the confessor as the Court points out,
see ante, at 52, and in cases of treason, were insufficient to support even
the conviction of the confessor, 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 46,

$ 4, p. 604, n. 3 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787).

Without an oath, one usually did not get to the second stepof whether confrontation was required.

Thus, while I agree that the Framers were mainly con-cerned about sworn affidavits and depositions, it does not
follow that they were similarly concerned about the Court'sbroader category of testimonial statements. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language(1828) (defining "Testimony" as "[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or provingsome fact.

Such affirmation in judicial proceedings, maybe verbal or written, but must be under oath" (emphasis

added)). As far as I can tell, unsworn testimonial state-ments were treated no differently at common law than were
nontestimonial statements, and it seems to me any classifi-cation of statements as testimonial beyond that of sworn
affidavits and depositions will be somewhat arbitrary, merelya proxy for what the Framers might have intended had such
evidence been liberally admitted as substantive evidence likeit is today.

I therefore see no reason why the distinction the Courtdraws is preferable to our precedent. Starting with Chief

Justice Marshall's interpretation as a Circuit Justice in 1807,16 years after the ratification of the Sixth Amendment,
United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 193 (No. 14,694) (CCVa. 1807), continuing with our cases in the late 19th century,
Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243-244 (1895); Kirby

4 The fact that the prosecution introduced an unsworn examination in
1603 at Sir Walter Raleigh's trial, as the Court notes, see ante, at 52, says
little about the Court's distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial
statements. Our precedent indicates that unsworn testimonial statements, as do some nontestimonial statements, raise confrontation concerns
once admitted into evidence, see, e. g., Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116
(1999); Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), and I do not contend otherwise.
My point is not that the Confrontation Clause does not reach these statements, but rather that it is far from clear that courts in the late 18th
century would have treated unsworn statements, even testimonial ones,
the same as sworn statements.

72 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
v. United States, 174 U. S. 47, 54-57 (1899), and through
today, e. g., White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 352-353 (1992),
we have never drawn a distinction between testimonial and
nontestimonial statements. And for that matter, neither
has any other court of which I am aware. I see little value
in trading our precedent for an imprecise approximation at
this late date.

I am also not convinced that the Confrontation Clause categorically requires the exclusion of testimonial statements.
Although many States had their own Confrontation Clauses,
they were of recent vintage and were not interpreted with
any regularity before 1791. State cases that recently followed the ratification of the Sixth Amendment were not uniform; the Court itself cites state cases from the early 19th
century that took a more stringent view of the right to confrontation than does the Court, prohibiting former testimony
even if the witness was subjected to cross-examination. See
ante, at 50 (citing Finn v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. 701, 708
(1827); State v. Atkins, 1 Tenn. 229 (Super. L. & Eq. 1807)
(per curiam)).

Nor was the English law at the time of the framing entirely consistent in its treatment of testimonial evidence.
Generally ex parte affidavits and depositions were excluded
as the Court notes, but even that proposition was not universal. See King v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815
(K. B. 1790) (affirming by an equally divided court the admission of an ex parte examination because the declarant was
unavailable to testify); King v. Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 13, 168
Eng. Rep. 108, 109 (1739) (noting the admission of an ex parte
affidavit); see also 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 585-586
(1736) (noting that statements of "accusers and witnesses"
which were taken under oath could be admitted into evidence
if the declarant was "dead or not able to travel"). Wigmore
notes that sworn examinations of witnesses before justices
of the peace in certain cases would not have been excluded

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
until the end of the 1700's, 5 Wigmore $ 1364, at 26-27, and
sworn statements of witnesses before coroners became
excluded only by statute in the 1800's, see ibid.; id., $ 1374,
at 59. With respect to unsworn testimonial statements,
there is no indication that once the hearsay rule was developed courts ever excluded these statements if they otherwise fell within a firmly rooted exception. See, e. g., Eriswell, supra, at 715-719 (Buller, J.), 720 (Ashhurst, J.), 100
Eng. Rep., at 819-822 (concluding that an ex parte examination was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule
because it was a declaration by a party of his state and condition). Dying declarations are one example. See, e. g.,
Woodcock, supra, at 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-354;
King v. Reason, 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 22-23 (K. B. 1722).

Between 1700 and 1800 the rules regarding the admissibility of out-of-court statements were still being developed.
See n. 1, supra. There were always exceptions to the general rule of exclusion, and it is not clear to me that the Framers categorically wanted to eliminate further ones. It is one
thing to trace the right of confrontation back to the Roman
Empire; it is quite another to conclude that such a right absolutely excludes a large category of evidence. It is an odd
conclusion indeed to think that the Framers created a cutand-dried rule with respect to the admissibility of testimonial statements when the law during their own time was not
fully settled.

To find exceptions to exclusion under the Clause is not to
denigrate it as the Court suggests. Chief Justice Marshall
stated of the Confrontation Clause: "I know of no principle
in the preservation of which all are more concerned. I know
none, by undermining which, life, liberty and property, might
be more endangered. It is therefore incumbent on courts to
be watchful of every inroad on a principle so truly important." Burr, 25 F. Cas., at 193. Yet, he recognized that
such a right was not absolute, acknowledging that exceptions

74 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
to the exclusionary component of the hearsay rule, which he
considered as an "inroad" on the right to confrontation, had
been introduced. See ibid.

Exceptions to confrontation have always been derived
from the experience that some out-of-court statements are
just as reliable as cross-examined in-court testimony due to
the circumstances under which they were made. We have
recognized, for example, that co-conspirator statements simply "cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to
the same matters in court." United States v. Inadi, 475
U. S. 387, 395 (1986). Because the statements are made
while the declarant and the accused are partners in an illegal
enterprise, the statements are unlikely to be false and their
admission "actually furthers the `Confrontation Clause's very
mission' which is to `advance the accuracy of the truthdetermining process in criminal trials.' " Id., at 396 (quoting Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 415 (1985) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). Similar reasons justify the
introduction of spontaneous declarations, see White, 502
U. S., at 356, statements made in the course of procuring
medical services, see ibid., dying declarations, see Kirby,
supra, at 61, and countless other hearsay exceptions. That
a statement might be testimonial does nothing to undermine
the wisdom of one of these exceptions.

Indeed, cross-examination is a tool used to flesh out the
truth, not an empty procedure. See Kentucky v. Stincer,
482 U. S. 730, 737 (1987) ("The right to cross-examination,
protected by the Confrontation Clause, thus is essentially a
`functional' right designed to promote reliability in the
truth-finding functions of a criminal trial"); see also Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) ("The central concern
of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of
the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to
rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding
before the trier of fact"). "[I]n a given instance [cross541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

examination may] be superfluous; it may be sufficiently clear,
in that instance, that the statement offered is free enough
from the risk of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness, so that
the test of cross-examination would be a work of supererogation." 5 Wigmore $ 1420, at 251. In such a case, as we
noted over 100 years ago, "The law in its wisdom declares
that the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed
in order that an incidental benefit may be preserved to the
accused." Mattox, 156 U. S., at 243; see also Salinger v.
United States, 272 U. S. 542, 548 (1926). By creating an immutable category of excluded evidence, the Court adds little
to a trial's truth-finding function and ignores this longstanding guidance.

In choosing the path it does, the Court of course overrules
Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), a case decided nearly a
quarter of a century ago. Stare decisis is not an inexorable
command in the area of constitutional law, see Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991), but by and large, it "is the
preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the
actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process," id., at
827. And in making this appraisal, doubt that the new rule
is indeed the "right" one should surely be weighed in the
balance. Though there are no vested interests involved, unresolved questions for the future of everyday criminal trials
throughout the country surely counsel the same sort of caution. The Court grandly declares that "[w]e leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition
of `testimonial,' " ante, at 68. But the thousands of federal
prosecutors and the tens of thousands of state prosecutors
need answers as to what beyond the specific kinds of "testimony" the Court lists, see ibid., is covered by the new rule.
They need them now, not months or years from now. Rules
of criminal evidence are applied every day in courts through541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
76 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON

out the country, and parties should not be left in the dark inthis manner.

To its credit, the Court's analysis of "testimony" excludesat least some hearsay exceptions, such as business records
and official records. See ante, at 56. To hold otherwisewould require numerous additional witnesses without any
apparent gain in the truth-seeking process. Likewise to theCourt's credit is its implicit recognition that the mistaken
application of its new rule by courts which guess wrong asto the scope of the rule is subject to harmless-error analysis.
See ante, at 42, n. 1.But these are palliatives to what I believe is a mistaken
change of course. It is a change of course not in the leastnecessary to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Washington in this case. The result the Court reaches fol-lows inexorably from

Roberts and its progeny without anyneed for overruling that line of cases. In Idaho v. Wright,

497 U. S. 805, 820-824 (1990), we held that an out-of-courtstatement was not admissible simply because the truthfulness of that statement was corroborated by other evidenceat trial. As the Court notes,

ante, at 66, the Supreme Courtof Washington gave decisive weight to the "interlocking nature of the two statements." No re-weighing of the "relia-bility factors," which is hypothesized by the Court, ante, at
67, is required to reverse the judgment here. A citation toIdaho v. Wright, supra, would suffice. For the reasons
stated, I believe that this would be a far preferable coursefor the Court to take here.

77OCTOBER TERM, 2003
Syllabus

IOWA v. TOVAR
certiorari to the supreme court of iowa
No. 02-1541. Argued January 21, 2004--Decided March 8, 2004
At respondent Tovar's November 1996 arraignment for operating a motor

vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OWI), in response to the trial
court's questions, Tovar affirmed that he wanted to represent himself
and to plead guilty. Conducting the guilty plea colloquy required by
the Iowa Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court explained that, if Tovar
pleaded not guilty, he would be entitled to a speedy and public jury trial
where he would have the right to counsel who could help him select a
jury, question and cross-examine witnesses, present evidence, and make
arguments on his behalf. By pleading guilty, the court cautioned, Tovar
would give up his right to a trial and his rights at that trial to be represented by counsel, to remain silent, to the presumption of innocence,
and to subpoena witnesses and compel their testimony. The court then
informed Tovar of the maximum and minimum penalties for an OWI
conviction, and explained that, before accepting a guilty plea, the court
had to assure itself that Tovar was in fact guilty of the charged offense.
To that end, the court informed Tovar of the two elements of the OWI
charge: The defendant must have (1) operated a motor vehicle in Iowa
(2) while intoxicated. Tovar confirmed, first, that on the date in question, he was operating a motor vehicle in Iowa and, second, that he did
not dispute the result of the intoxilyzer test showing his blood alcohol
level exceeded the legal limit nearly twice over. The court then accepted his guilty plea and, at a hearing the next month, imposed the
minimum sentence of two days in jail and a fine. In 1998, Tovar was
again charged with OWI, this time as a second offense, an aggravated
misdemeanor under Iowa law. Represented by counsel in that proceeding, he pleaded guilty. In 2000, Tovar was charged with third-offense
OWI, a class "D" felony under Iowa law. Again represented by counsel,
Tovar pleaded not guilty to the felony charge. Counsel moved to preclude use of Tovar's first (1996) OWI conviction to enhance his 2000
offense from an aggravated misdemeanor to a third-offense felony.
Tovar maintained that his 1996 waiver of counsel was invalid--not fully
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary--because he was never made aware
by the court of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.
The trial court denied the motion, found Tovar guilty, and sentenced
him on the OWI third-offense charge. The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court of Iowa reversed and remanded for entry
of judgment without consideration of Tovar's first OWI conviction.

78 IOWA v. TOVAR

Syllabus
Holding that the colloquy preceding acceptance of Tovar's 1996 guilty
plea had been constitutionally inadequate, Iowa's high court ruled, as
here at issue, that two warnings not given to Tovar are essential to the
"knowing and intelligent" waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the plea stage: The defendant must be advised specifically that
waiving counsel's assistance in deciding whether to plead guilty
(1) entails the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked and
(2) deprives him of the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on
whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty.

Held: Neither warning ordered by the Iowa Supreme Court is mandated

by the Sixth Amendment. The constitutional requirement is satisfied
when the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the charges
against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of the
range of allowable punishments attendant upon the entry of a guilty
plea. Pp. 87-94.

(a) The Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant facing incarceration
the right to counsel at all "critical stages" of the criminal process, see,
e. g., Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 170, including a plea hearing,
White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (per curiam). Because Tovar received a two-day prison term for his first OWI conviction, he had a right
to counsel both at the plea stage and at trial had he elected to contest
the charge. Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 34, 37. Although an
accused may choose to forgo representation, any waiver of the right to
counsel must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, see Johnson v.
Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464. The information a defendant must possess
in order to make an intelligent election depends on a range of casespecific factors, including his education or sophistication, the complex or
easily grasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding.
See ibid. Although warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial uncounseled must be "rigorous[ly]" conveyed, Patterson v. Illinois, 487
U. S. 285, 298; see Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 835, a less searching or formal colloquy may suffice at earlier stages of the criminal process, 487 U. S., at 299. In Patterson, this Court described a pragmatic
approach to right-to-counsel waivers, one that asks "what purposes a
lawyer can serve at the particular stage of the proceedings in question,
and what assistance [counsel] could provide to an accused at that stage."
Id., at 298. Less rigorous warnings are required pretrial because, at
that stage, "the full dangers and disadvantages of self-representation
. . . are less substantial and more obvious to an accused than they are
at trial." Id., at 299. Pp. 87-90.

(b) The Sixth Amendment does not compel the two admonitions ordered by the Iowa Supreme Court. "[T]he law ordinarily considers a

541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

79Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)
Syllabus
waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully
understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in
general in the circumstances . . . ." United States v. Ruiz, 536 U. S.
622, 629. Even if the defendant lacked a full and complete appreciation
of all of the consequences flowing from his waiver, the State may nevertheless prevail if it shows that the information provided to the defendant
satisfied the constitutional minimum. Patterson, 487 U. S., at 294.
The Iowa high court gave insufficient consideration to this Court's guiding decisions. In prescribing scripted admonitions and holding them
necessary in every guilty plea instance, that court overlooked this
Court's observations that the information a defendant must have to
waive counsel intelligently will depend upon the particular facts and
circumstances in each case, Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464. Moreover, as
Tovar acknowledges, in a collateral attack on an uncounseled conviction,
it is the defendant's burden to prove that he did not competently and
intelligently waive his right to counsel. Tovar has never claimed that
he did not fully understand the 1996 OWI charge or the range of punishment for that crime prior to pleading guilty. He has never "articulate[d] with precision" the additional information counsel could have
provided, given the simplicity of the charge. See Patterson, 487 U. S.,
at 294. Nor does he assert that he was unaware of his right to be
counseled prior to and at his arraignment. Before this Court, he suggests only that he may have been under the mistaken belief that he had
a right to counsel at trial, but not if he was, instead, going to plead
guilty. Given "the particular facts and circumstances surrounding [this]
case," Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464, it is far from clear that warnings of
the kind required by the Iowa Supreme Court would have enlightened
Tovar's decision whether to seek counsel or to represent himself. In a
case so straightforward, the two admonitions at issue might confuse or
mislead a defendant more than they would inform him, i. e., the warnings might be misconstrued to convey that a meritorious defense exists
or that the defendant could plead to a lesser charge, when neither prospect is a realistic one. If a defendant delays his plea in the vain hope
that counsel could uncover a tenable basis for contesting or reducing the
criminal charge, the prompt disposition of the case will be impeded, and
the resources of either the State (if the defendant is indigent) or the
defendant himself (if he is financially ineligible for appointed counsel)
will be wasted. States are free to adopt by statute, rule, or decision
any guides to the acceptance of an uncounseled plea they deem useful,
but the Federal Constitution does not require the two admonitions here
in controversy. Pp. 90-94.

criminal process. Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 170(1985); United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 224 (1967). The

entry of a guilty plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felonycharge, ranks as a "critical stage" at which the right to counsel adheres. Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 34 (1972);White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963) (per curiam).
Waiver of the right to counsel, as of constitutional rights inthe criminal process generally, must be a "knowing, intelligent ac[t] done with sufficient awareness of the relevant cir-cumstances."

Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748(1970). This case concerns the extent to which a trial judge,

before accepting a guilty plea from an uncounseled defend-ant, must elaborate on the right to representation.

Beyond affording the defendant the opportunity to consultwith counsel prior to entry of a plea and to be assisted by
counsel at the plea hearing, must the court, specifically:(1) advise the defendant that "waiving the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty [entails] the risk thata viable defense will be overlooked"; and (2) "admonis[h]"
the defendant "that by waiving his right to an attorney hewill lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion
on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise toplead guilty"? 656 N. W. 2d 112, 121 (Iowa 2003). The
Iowa Supreme Court held both warnings essential to the"knowing and intelligent" waiver of the Sixth Amendment
right to the assistance of counsel. Ibid.We hold that neither warning is mandated by the Sixth
Amendment. The constitutional requirement is satisfiedwhen the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the
charges against him, of his right to be counseled regardinghis plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant
upon the entry of a guilty plea.

Conducting the guilty plea colloquy required by the IowaRules of Criminal Procedure, see Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8

(1992),3 the court explained that, if Tovar pleaded not guilty,he would be entitled to a speedy and public trial by jury,
App. 15, and would have the right to be represented at that
trial by an attorney, who "could help [Tovar] select a jury,question and cross-examine the State's witnesses, present

evidence, if any, in [his] behalf, and make arguments to thejudge and jury on [his] behalf,"

id., at 16. By pleading
guilty, the court cautioned, "not only [would Tovar] give up[his] right to a trial [of any kind on the charge against him],

[he would] give up [his] right to be represented by an attor-ney at that trial."

Ibid. The court further advised Tovar
that, if he entered a guilty plea, he would relinquish the rightto remain silent at trial, the right to the presumption of innocence, and the right to subpoena witnesses and compel their
testimony. Id., at 16-19.

Turning to the particular offense with which Tovar had
been charged, the court informed him that an OWI conviction carried a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000
fine, and a minimum penalty of two days in jail and a $500
fine. Id., at 20. Tovar affirmed that he understood his exposure to those penalties. Ibid. The court next explained
that, before accepting a guilty plea, the court had to assure
itself that Tovar was in fact guilty of the charged offense.
Id., at 21-22. To that end, the court informed Tovar that
the OWI charge had only two elements: first, on the date in
question, Tovar was operating a motor vehicle in the State
of Iowa; second, when he did so, he was intoxicated. Id.,
at 23. Tovar confirmed that he had been driving in Ames,
Iowa, on the night he was apprehended and that he did not
dispute the results of the intoxilyzer test administered by

the police that night, which showed that his blood alcohol
level exceeded the legal limit nearly twice over. Id., at
23-24.

After the plea colloquy, the court asked Tovar if he still
wished to plead guilty, and Tovar affirmed that he did. Id.,
at 27-28. The court then accepted Tovar's plea, observing
that there was "a factual basis" for it, and that Tovar had
made the plea "voluntarily, with a full understanding of [his]
rights, [and] . . . of the consequences of [pleading guilty]."
Id., at 28.

On December 30, 1996, Tovar appeared for sentencing on
the OWI charge 4 and, simultaneously, for arraignment on a
subsequent charge of driving with a suspended license. Id.,
at 45-46; see Iowa Code $ 321J.21 (1995).5 Noting that
Tovar was again in attendance without counsel, the court
inquired: "Mr. Tovar, did you want to represent yourself at
today's hearing or did you want to take some time to hire an
attorney to represent you?" App. 46.6 Tovar replied that
he would represent himself. Ibid. The court then engaged
in essentially the same plea colloquy on the suspension
charge as it had on the OWI charge the previous month.
Id., at 48-51. After accepting Tovar's guilty plea on the
suspension charge, the court sentenced him on both counts:
For the OWI conviction, the court imposed the minimum sentence of two days in jail and a $500 fine, plus a surcharge and

4 At that stage, it was still open to Tovar to request withdrawal of his
guilty plea on the OWI charge and to substitute a plea of not guilty. See
Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992).

5 In order to appear at the OWI arraignment, Tovar drove to the courthouse despite the suspension of his license; he was apprehended en route
home. App. 50, 53.

6 Prior to asking Tovar whether he wished to hire counsel, the court

noted that Tovar had applied for a court-appointed attorney but that his
application had been denied because he was financially dependent upon his
parents. Id., at 46. Tovar does not here challenge the absence of counsel
at sentencing.

costs; for the suspension conviction, the court imposed a $250
fine, plus a surcharge and costs. Id., at 55.

On March 16, 1998, Tovar was convicted of OWI for a second time. He was represented by counsel in that proceeding, in which he pleaded guilty. Record 60; see App. to Pet.
for Cert. 24, n. 1.

On December 14, 2000, Tovar was again charged with
OWI, this time as a third offense, see Iowa Code $ 321J.2
(1999), and additionally with driving while license barred,
see $ 321.561. Iowa law classifies first-offense OWI as a
serious misdemeanor and second-offense OWI as an aggravated misdemeanor. $$ 321J.2(2)(a)-(b). Third-offense
OWI, and any OWI offenses thereafter, rank as class "D"
felonies. $ 321J.2(2)(c). Represented by an attorney, Tovar
pleaded not guilty to both December 2000 charges. Record
55.

In March 2001, through counsel, Tovar filed a motion for
adjudication of law points; 7 the motion urged that Tovar's
first OWI conviction, in 1996, could not be used to enhance
the December 2000 OWI charge from a second-offense aggravated misdemeanor to a third-offense felony. App. 3-5.8
Significantly, Tovar did not allege that he was unaware at
the November 1996 arraignment of his right to counsel prior
to pleading guilty and at the plea hearing. Instead, he
maintained that his 1996 waiver of counsel was invalid--not
"full knowing, intelligent, and voluntary"--because he "was
never made aware by the court . . . of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation." Id., at 3-4.

7 See Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 10(2) (1992) ("Any defense, objection, or
request which is capable of determination without the trial of the general
issue may be raised before trial by motion."); State v. Wilt, 333 N. W. 2d
457, 460 (Iowa 1983) (approving use of motions for adjudication of law
points under Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 10(2) where material facts
are undisputed).

8 Tovar conceded that the 1998 OWI conviction could be used for enhancement purposes. Record 60.

86 IOWA v. TOVAR

Opinion of the Court
The court denied Tovar's motion in May 2001, explaining:"Where the offense is readily understood by laypersons and

the penalty is not unduly severe, the duty of inquiry whichis imposed upon the court is only that which is required to
assure an awareness of [the] right to counsel and a willing-ness to proceed without counsel in the face of such awareness." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36-37 (brackets in original).Tovar then waived his right to a jury trial and was found
guilty by the court of both the OWI third-offense charge anddriving while license barred.

Id., at 33. Four months afterthat adjudication, Tovar was sentenced. On the OWI thirdoffense charge, he received a 180-day jail term, with all but30 days suspended, three years of probation, and a $2,500 fine
plus surcharges and costs. App. 70-71. For driving whilelicense barred, Tovar received a 30-day jail term, to run concurrently with the OWI sentence, and a suspended $500 fine.Id., at 71.

The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed, App. to Pet. for Cert.23-30, but the Supreme Court of Iowa, by a 4-to-3 vote, reversed and remanded for entry of judgment without consid-eration of Tovar's first OWI conviction, 656 N. W. 2d 112
(2003). Iowa's highest court acknowledged that "the dan-gers of proceeding pro se at a guilty plea proceeding will be
different than the dangers of proceeding pro se at a jurytrial, [therefore] the inquiries made at these proceedings will
also be different." Id., at 119. The court nonetheless heldthat the colloquy preceding acceptance of Tovar's 1996 guilty
plea had been constitutionally inadequate, and instructeddispositively:

"[A] defendant such as Tovar who chooses to plead guiltywithout the assistance of an attorney must be advised
of the usefulness of an attorney and the dangers of self-representation in order to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. . . . [T]he trial judge[must] advise the defendant generally that there are
defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by

laypersons and that the danger in waiving the assistanceof counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk

that a viable defense will be overlooked. The defendantshould be admonished that by waiving his right to an
attorney he will lose the opportunity to obtain an inde-pendent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty. In addition, the courtmust ensure the defendant understands the nature of
the charges against him and the range of allowable pun-ishments."

Id., at 121.9

We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 987 (2003), in view of thedivision of opinion on the requirements the Sixth Amendment imposes for waiver of counsel at a plea hearing, com-pare,

e. g., United States v. Akins, 276 F. 3d 1141, 1146-1147(CA9 2002), with State v. Cashman, 491 N. W. 2d 462, 465-

466 (S. D. 1992), and we now reverse the judgment of theIowa Supreme Court.

II
The Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant who facesincarceration the right to counsel at all "critical stages" of

the criminal process. See, e. g., Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S.,at 170;

United States v. Wade, 388 U. S., at 224. A plea hear-ing qualifies as a "critical stage." White v. Maryland, 373

U. S., at 60. Because Tovar received a two-day prison termfor his 1996 OWI conviction, he had a right to counsel both
at the plea stage and at trial had he elected to contest thecharge.

Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S., at 34, 37.A person accused of crime, however, may choose to forgo

representation. While the Constitution "does not force a

out of line with the pragmatic approach this Court described in Patterson

that, in addition to advice concerning the constitutional rights a guilty
plea relinquishes, Tovar was "made fully aware of the penal consequences
that might befall him if he went forward without counsel and pleaded
guilty." Ibid.

lawyer upon a defendant," Adams v. United States ex rel.
McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942), it does require that any
waiver of the right to counsel be knowing, voluntary, andintelligent, see

Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).
Tovar contends that his waiver of counsel in November 1996,at his first OWI plea hearing, was insufficiently informed,

and therefore constitutionally invalid. In particular, he
asserts that the trial judge did not elaborate on the value,at that stage of the case, of an attorney's advice and the

dangers of self-representation in entering a plea. Brief forRespondent 15.

10

We have described a waiver of counsel as intelligent whenthe defendant "knows what he is doing and his choice is made

with eyes open." Adams, 317 U. S., at 279. We have not,however, prescribed any formula or script to be read to a
defendant who states that he elects to proceed without coun-sel. The information a defendant must possess in order to
make an intelligent election, our decisions indicate, will
depend on a range of case-specific factors, including the defendant's education or sophistication, the complex or easily
grasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding. See Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464.

As to waiver of trial counsel, we have said that before a
defendant may be allowed to proceed pro se, he must be

10 The United States as amicus curiae reads our decision in Scott v.
Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), to hold that a constitutionally defective
waiver of counsel in a misdemeanor prosecution, although warranting
vacation of any term of imprisonment, affords no ground for disturbing
the underlying conviction. Amicus accordingly contends that the Constitution should not preclude use of an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction
to enhance the penalty for a subsequent offense, regardless of the validity
of the prior waiver. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11,
n. 3. The State, however, does not contest the Iowa Supreme Court's
determination that a conviction obtained without an effective waiver of
counsel cannot be used to enhance a subsequent charge. See ibid. We
therefore do not address arguments amicus advances questioning that
premise. See also id., at 29, n. 12.

Opinion of the Court
warned specifically of the hazards ahead. Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), is instructive. The defendant
in Faretta resisted counsel's aid, preferring to represent him-self. The Court held that he had a constitutional right

to self-representation. In recognizing that right, however,we cautioned: "Although a defendant need not himself have
the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently
and intelligently to choose self-representation, he should bemade aware of the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation, so that the record will establish that heknows what he is doing . . . ."

Id., at 835 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

Later, in Pat terson v. Ill ino is, 487 U. S. 285 (1988),
we elaborated on "the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation" to which Faretta referred. "[A]t trial," we
observed, "counsel is required to help even the most gifted
layman adhere to the rules of procedure and evidence, comprehend the subtleties of voir dire, examine and crossexamine witnesses effectively . . . , object to improper prosecution questions, and much more." 487 U. S., at 299, n. 13.
Warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel, we therefore said, must be "rigorous[ly]" conveyed. Id.,
at 298. We clarified, however, that at earlier stages of the
criminal process, a less searching or formal colloquy may suffice. Id., at 299.

Patterson concerned postindictment questioning by police
and prosecutor. At that stage of the case, we held, the
warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436
(1966), adequately informed the defendant not only of his
Fifth Amendment rights, but of his Sixth Amendment right
to counsel as well. 487 U. S., at 293. Miranda warnings,
we said, effectively convey to a defendant his right to have
counsel present during questioning. In addition, they inform him of the "ultimate adverse consequence" of making
uncounseled admissions, i. e., his statements may be used
against him in any ensuing criminal proceeding. 487 U. S.,

541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
90 IOWA v. TOVAR

Opinion of the Court
at 293. The Miranda warnings, we added, "also sufficed . . .
to let [the defendant] know what a lawyer could `do for him,' "
namely, advise him to refrain from making statements that
could prove damaging to his defense. 487 U. S., at 294.

Patterson describes a "pragmatic approach to the waiver
question," one that asks "what purposes a lawyer can serve
at the particular stage of the proceedings in question, and
what assistance he could provide to an accused at that
stage," in order "to determine the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the type of warnings and procedures that should be required before a waiver of that right
will be recognized." Id., at 298. We require less rigorous
warnings pretrial, Patterson explained, not because pretrial
proceedings are "less important" than trial, but because,
at that stage, "the full dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation . . . are less substantial and more obvious to
an accused than they are at trial." Id., at 299 (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).

In Tovar's case, the State maintains that, like the Miranda
warnings we found adequate in Patterson, Iowa's plea colloquy suffices both to advise a defendant of his right to counsel,
and to assure that his guilty plea is informed and voluntary.
Brief for Petitioner 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3. The plea colloquy,
according to the State, "makes plain that an attorney's role
would be to challenge the charge or sentence," and therefore
adequately conveys to the defendant both the utility of counsel and the dangers of self-representation. Brief for Petitioner 25. Tovar, on the other hand, defends the precise
instructions required by the Iowa Supreme Court, see supra,
at 86-87, as essential to a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent
plea stage waiver of counsel. Brief for Respondent 15.

To resolve this case, we need not endorse the State's position that nothing more than the plea colloquy was needed to
safeguard Tovar's right to counsel. Preliminarily, we note
that there were some things more in this case. Tovar first

91Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
indicated that he waived counsel at his initial appearance, see
supra, at 82, affirmed that he wanted to represent himself at
the plea hearing, see supra, at 82, and declined the court's
offer of "time to hire an attorney" at sentencing, when it was
still open to him to request withdrawal of his plea, see supra,
at 84, and n. 4. Further, the State does not contest that a
defendant must be alerted to his right to the assistance of
counsel in entering a plea. See Brief for Petitioner 19 (acknowledging defendant's need to know "retained or appointed counsel can assist" at the plea stage by "work[ing]
on the issues of guilt and sentencing"). Indeed, the Iowa
Supreme Court appeared to assume that Tovar was informed
of his entitlement to counsel's aid or, at least, to have pretermitted that issue. See 656 N. W. 2d, at 117. Accordingly,
the State presents a narrower question: "Does the Sixth
Amendment require a court to give a rigid and detailed
admonishment to a pro se defendant pleading guilty of the
usefulness of an attorney, that an attorney may provide an
independent opinion whether it is wise to plead guilty and
that without an attorney the defendant risks overlooking a
defense?" Pet. for Cert. i.

Training on that question, we turn to, and reiterate, the
particular language the Iowa Supreme Court employed in
announcing the warnings it thought the Sixth Amendment
required: "[T]he trial judge [must] advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may
not be known by laypersons and that the danger in waiving
the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty
is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked," 656
N. W. 2d, at 121; in addition, "[t]he defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney he will
lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on
whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to
plead guilty," ibid. Tovar did not receive such advice, and
the sole question before us is whether the Sixth Amendment

541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
92 IOWA v. TOVAR

Opinion of the Court
compels the two admonitions here in controversy.11 We holdit does not.

This Court recently explained, in reversing a lower courtdetermination that a guilty plea was not voluntary: "[T]he
law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, andsufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in generalin the circumstances--even though the defendant may not
know the specific detailed consequences of invoking it."
United States v. Ruiz, 536 U. S. 622, 629 (2002) (emphasisin original). We similarly observed in Patterson: "If [the

defendant] . . . lacked a full and complete appreciation of allof the consequences flowing from his waiver, it does not defeat the State's showing that the information it provided tohim satisfied the constitutional minimum." 487 U. S., at 294
(internal quotation marks omitted). The Iowa SupremeCourt gave insufficient consideration to these guiding decisions. In prescribing scripted admonitions and holdingthem necessary in every guilty plea instance, we further
note, the Iowa high court overlooked our observations thatthe information a defendant must have to waive counsel intelligently will "depend, in each case, upon the particularfacts and circumstances surrounding that case,"

Johnson, 304U. S., at 464; supra, at 88.

Moreover, as Tovar acknowledges, in a collateral attack onan uncounseled conviction, it is the defendant's burden to
prove that he did not competently and intelligently waive hisright to the assistance of counsel. See Watts v. State, 257
N. W. 2d 70, 71 (Iowa 1977); Brief for Respondent 5, 26-27.In that light, we note that Tovar has never claimed that he
did not fully understand the charge or the range of punish-ment for the crime prior to pleading guilty. Further, he has

11 The Supreme Court of Iowa also held that "the court must ensure the
defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the
range of allowable punishments." 656 N. W. 2d, at 121. The parties do
not dispute that Tovar was so informed.

93Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
never "articulate[d] with precision" the additional information counsel could have provided, given the simplicity of the
charge. See Patterson, 487 U. S., at 294; supra, at 83. Nor
does he assert that he was unaware of his right to be counseled prior to and at his arraignment. Before this Court, he
suggests only that he "may have been under the mistaken
belief that he had a right to counsel at trial, but not if he
was merely going to plead guilty." Brief for Respondent 16
(emphasis added).12

Given "the particular facts and circumstances surrounding
[this] case," see Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464, it is far from clear
that warnings of the kind required by the Iowa Supreme
Court would have enlightened Tovar's decision whether to
seek counsel or to represent himself. In a case so straightforward, the United States as amicus curiae suggests, the
admonitions at issue might confuse or mislead a defendant
more than they would inform him: The warnings the Iowa
Supreme Court declared mandatory might be misconstrued
as a veiled suggestion that a meritorious defense exists or
that the defendant could plead to a lesser charge, when neither prospect is a realistic one. If a defendant delays his
plea in the vain hope that counsel could uncover a tenable
basis for contesting or reducing the criminal charge, the
prompt disposition of the case will be impeded, and the
resources of either the State (if the defendant is indigent)
or the defendant himself (if he is financially ineligible for
appointed counsel) will be wasted. Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 9, 28-29; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21.

12 The trial court's comment that Tovar appeared without counsel at the
arraignment and the court's inquiry whether Tovar wanted to represent
himself at that hearing, see App. 8-9, hardly lend support to Tovar's suggestion of what he "may have" believed. See also id., at 46 (court's inquiry at sentencing whether Tovar "want[ed] to take some time to hire
an attorney"); Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992) ("[a]t any time before
judgment," defendant may request withdrawal of guilty plea and substitution of not guilty plea).

94 IOWA v. TOVAR

Opinion of the Court
We note, finally, that States are free to adopt by statute,rule, or decision any guides to the acceptance of an uncounseled plea they deem useful. See, e. g., Alaska Rule Crim.Proc. 39(a) (2003); Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.111(d) (2003); Md.
Ct. Rule 4-215 (2002); Minn. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.02 (2003);Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 121, comment (2003). We hold only
that the two admonitions the Iowa Supreme Court orderedare not required by the Federal Constitution.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the SupremeCourt of Iowa is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

v. MICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 02-626. Argued January 14, 2004--Decided March 23, 2004
Congress established the Central and South Florida Flood Control Project

(Project) to address drainage and flood control problems in reclaimed
portions of the Everglades. Five Project elements are at issue here.
The first, the "C-11" canal, collects ground water and rainwater from
an area that includes urban, agricultural, and residential development.
The second Project element, pump station "S-9," moves water from the
canal to the third element, an undeveloped wetland, "WCA-3," which is
a remnant of the original South Florida Everglades. Petitioner, the
Project's day-to-day operator (hereinafter District), impounds the water
there to keep it from flowing into the ocean and to preserve wetlands
habitat. Absent such human intervention, the water would flow back
to the canal and flood the C-11 basin's populated areas. Such flow is
prevented by levees, including the "L-33" and "L-37" levees at issue
here. The combined effect of L-33, L-37, C-11, and S-9 is artificially
to separate the C-11 basin from WCA-3, which would otherwise be a
single wetland. The Project has an environmental impact on wetland
ecosystems. Rain on the western side of L-33 and L-37 falls into
WCA-3's wetland ecosystem, but rain falling on the eastern side
absorbs contaminants, including phosphorous from fertilizers, before
entering the C-11 canal. When that water is pumped across the levees,
the phosphorus alters the WCA-3 ecosystem's balance, stimulating the
growth of algae and plants foreign to the Everglades. Respondents
(hereinafter Tribe) filed suit under the Clean Water Act (Act), which
prohibits "the discharge of any pollutant by any person" unless done in
compliance with the Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1311(a). Under the Act's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), dischargers must
obtain permits limiting the type and quantity of pollutants they can
release into the Nation's waters. $ 1342. The Act defines " `discharge
of a pollutant' " as "any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters
from any point source," $ 1362(12), and defines " `point source' " as "any
discernible, confined and discrete conveyance" "from which pollutants
are or may be discharged," $ 1362(14). The Tribe claims that S-9 requires an NPDES permit because it moves phosphorus-laden water
from C-11 into WCA-3, but the District contends that S-9's operation

96 SOUTH FLA. WATER MANAGEMENT DIST. v.

MICCOSUKEE TRIBE

Syllabus

does not constitute the "discharge of [a] pollutant" under the Act. The
District Court granted the Tribe summary judgment, and the Eleventh
Circuit affirmed. Both rested their holdings on the predicate determination that C-11 and WCA-3 are two distinct water bodies.

Held: The case is remanded for further proceedings regarding the parties'

factual dispute over whether C-11 and WCA-3 are meaningfully distinct water bodies. Pp. 104-112.

(a) Each of three arguments advanced by the District and the Federal
Government as amicus would, if accepted, lead to the conclusion that
S-9 does not require an NPDES permit. P. 104.

(b) The Court rejects the District's initial argument that the NPDES
program covers a point source only when pollutants originate from that
source and not when pollutants originating elsewhere merely pass
through the point source. The definition of a point source as a "conveyance," $ 1362(14), makes plain that the point source need only convey the pollutant to navigable waters. The Act's examples of point
sources--pipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduits--are objects that transport, but do not generate, pollutants. And one of the Act's primary
goals was to impose NPDES permitting requirements on municipal
wastewater treatment plants, which treat and discharge pollutants
added to water by others. Pp. 104-105.

(c) The Government contends that all water bodies that are navigable
waters under the Act should be viewed unitarily for purposes of
NPDES permitting. Because the Act requires NPDES permits only
when a pollutant is added to navigable waters, the Government contends that such permits are not required when water from one navigable
body is discharged, unaltered, into another navigable body. Despite the
relevance of this "unitary waters" approach, neither the District nor
the Government raised it before the Eleventh Circuit or in their briefs
respecting certiorari, and this Court is unaware of any case that has
examined the argument in its present form. Thus, the Court declines
to resolve the argument here. However, because the judgment must
be vacated in any event, the unitary waters argument will be open to
the parties on remand. Pp. 105-109.

(d) The District and the Government believe that the C-11 canal and
WCA-3 impoundment area are not distinct water bodies, but are two
hydrologically indistinguishable parts of a single water body. The
Tribe agrees that, if this is so, pumping water from one into the other
cannot constitute an "addition" of pollutants within the meaning of the
Act, but it disputes the District's factual premise that C-11 and WCA-3
are one. The parties also disagree about how the relationship between
S-9 and WCA-3 should be assessed. This Court does not decide here
whether the District Court's test is adequate for determining whether
C-11 and WCA-3 are distinct, because that court applied its test prema541US1 Unit: $U31 [05-20-06 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

turely. Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, but some factual issues remain unresolved
here. The District Court correctly characterized the flow through S-9
as nonnatural, and it appears that if S-9 were shut down, the water in
the C-11 canal might for a brief time flow east, rather than west. But
the record also suggests that if S-9 were shut down, the area drained
by C-11 would flood, which might mean C-11 would no longer be a
distinct body of navigable water, but instead part of a larger water body
extending over WCA-3 and the C-11 basin. It also might call into
question the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that S-9 is the cause in fact
of phosphorous addition to WCA-3. Nothing in the record suggests
that the District Court considered these issues when it granted summary judgment. If, after further development of the record, that court
concludes that C-11 and WCA-3 are not meaningfully distinct water
bodies, S-9 will not need an NPDES permit. Pp. 109-112.

A
The Central and South Florida Flood Control Project
(Project) consists of a vast array of levees, canals, pumps,and water impoundment areas in the land between south

Florida's coastal hills and the Everglades. Historically, that
land was itself part of the Everglades, and its surface and
ground water flowed south in a uniform and unchanneled
sheet. Starting in the early 1900's, however, the State
began to build canals to drain the wetlands and make them
suitable for cultivation. These canals proved to be a source

Opinion of the Court

of trouble; they lowered the water table, allowing saltwaterto intrude upon coastal wells, and they proved incapable of

controlling flooding. Congress established the Project in1948 to address these problems. It gave the United States
Army Corps of Engineers the task of constructing a compre-hensive network of levees, water storage areas, pumps, and
canal improvements that would serve several simultaneous
purposes, including flood protection, water conservation, anddrainage. These improvements fundamentally altered the

hydrology of the Everglades, changing the natural sheet flowof ground and surface water. The local sponsor and day-today operator of the Project is the South Florida Water Management District (District).

Five discrete elements of the Project are at issue in this
case. One is a canal called "C-11." C-11 collects ground
water and rainwater from a 104-square-mile area in south
central Broward County. App. 110. The area drained by
C-11 includes urban, agricultural, and residential development, and is home to 136,000 people. At the western terminus of C-11 is the second Project element at issue here: a
large pump station known as "S-9." When the water level
in C-11 rises above a set level, S-9 begins operating and
pumps water out of the canal. The water does not travel
far. Sixty feet away, the pump station empties the water
into a large undeveloped wetland area called "WCA-3," the
third element of the Project we consider here. WCA-3 is
the largest of several "water conservation areas" that are
remnants of the original South Florida Everglades. The
District impounds water in these areas to conserve freshwater that might otherwise flow directly to the ocean, and
to preserve wetlands habitat. Id., at 112.

Using pump stations like S-9, the District maintains the
water table in WCA-3 at a level significantly higher than
that in the developed lands drained by the C-11 canal to the
east. Absent human intervention, that water would simply
flow back east, where it would rejoin the waters of the canal

Opinion of the Court
and flood the populated areas of the C-11 basin. That re-turn flow is prevented, or, more accurately, slowed, by levees

that hold back the surface waters of WCA-3. Two of thoselevees, L-33 and L-37, are the final two elements of the Project at issue here. The combined effect of L-33 and L-37,C-11, and S-9 is artificially to separate the C-11 basin from
WCA-3; left to nature, the two areas would be a single wet-land covered in an undifferentiated body of surface and
ground water flowing slowly southward.

B
As the above description illustrates, the Project haswrought large-scale hydrologic and environmental change in

South Florida, some deliberate and some accidental. Itsmost obvious environmental impact has been the conversion
of what were once wetlands into areas suitable for humanuse. But the Project also has affected those areas that
remain wetland ecosystems.Rain on the western side of the L-33 and L-37 levees falls
into the wetland ecosystem of WCA-3. Rain on the easternside of the levees, on the other hand, falls on agricultural,
urban, and residential land. Before it enters the C-11 canal,whether directly as surface runoff or indirectly as ground
water, that rainwater absorbs contaminants produced byhuman activities. The water in C-11 therefore differs
chemically from that in WCA-3. Of particular interesthere, C-11 water contains elevated levels of phosphorous,
which is found in fertilizers used by farmers in the C-11basin. When water from C-11 is pumped across the levees,
the phosphorous it contains alters the balance of WCA-3'secosystem (which is naturally low in phosphorous) and stimulates the growth of algae and plants foreign to the Ever-glades ecosystem.

The phosphorous-related impacts of the Project are wellknown and have received a great deal of attention from state
and federal authorities for more than 20 years. A number

Opinion of the Court

of initiatives are currently under way to reduce these impacts and thereby restore the ecological integrity of the Everglades. Respondents Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the
Friends of the Everglades (hereinafter simply Tribe), impatient with the pace of this progress, brought this Clean
Water Act suit in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. They sought, among other
things, to enjoin the operation of S-9 and, in turn, the conveyance of water from C-11 into WCA-3.

C
Congress enacted the Clean Water Act (Act) in 1972. Its
stated objective was "to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."
86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C. $ 1251. To serve those ends, the Act
prohibits "the discharge of any pollutant by any person" unless done in compliance with some provision of the Act.

$ 1311(a). The provision relevant to this case, $ 1342, establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System,
or NPDES. Generally speaking, the NPDES requires dischargers to obtain permits that place limits on the type and
quantity of pollutants that can be released into the Nation's
waters. The Act defines the phrase " `discharge of a pollutant' " to mean "any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source." $ 1362(12). A " `point
source,' " in turn, is defined as "any discernible, confined and
discrete conveyance," such as a pipe, ditch, channel, or tunnel, "from which pollutants are or may be discharged."

$ 1362(14).

According to the Tribe, the District cannot operate S-9
without an NPDES permit because the pump station moves
phosphorous-laden water from C-11 into WCA-3. The District does not dispute that phosphorous is a pollutant, or that
C-11 and WCA-3 are "navigable waters" within the meaning of the Act. The question, it contends, is whether the

541US1 Unit: $U31 [05-20-06 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

103Cite as: 541 U. S. 95 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
operation of the S-9 pump constitutes the "discharge of [a]pollutant" within the meaning of the Act.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment onthe issue of whether S-9 requires an NPDES permit. The
District Court granted the Tribe's motion, reasoning asfollows:

"In this case an addition of pollutants exists becauseundisputedly water containing pollutants is being discharged through S-9 from C-11 waters into the Ever-glades, both of which are separate bodies of United
States water with . . . different quality levels. They aretwo separate bodies of water because the transfer of
water or its contents from C-11 into the Evergladeswould not occur naturally." App. to Pet. for Cert.
28a-29a.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. It reasoned first that "indetermining whether pollutants are added to navigable waters for purposes of the [Act], the receiving body of water isthe relevant body of navigable water." 280 F. 3d 1364, 1368
(CA11 2002). After concluding that pollutants were indeedbeing added to WCA-3, the court then asked whether that
addition of pollutants was from a "point source," so as totrigger the NPDES permitting requirement. To answer
that question, it explained:

"[F]or an addition of pollutants to be from a pointsource, the relevant inquiry is whether--but for the

point source--the pollutants would have been added tothe receiving body of water. We, therefore, conclude
that an addition from a point source occurs if a pointsource is the cause-in-fact of the release of pollutants
into navigable waters."When a point source changes the natural flow of a
body of water which contains pollutants and causes thatwater to flow into another distinct body of navigable
water into which it would not have otherwise flowed,

MICCOSUKEE TRIBE

Opinion of the Court

that point source is the cause-in-fact of the discharge ofpollutants." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

Because it believed that the water in the C-11 canal wouldnot flow into WCA-3 without the operation of the S-9 pump
station, the Court of Appeals concluded that S-9 was thecause-in-fact of the addition of pollutants to WCA-3. It accordingly affirmed the District Court's grant of summaryjudgment, and held that the S-9 pump station requires
an NPDES permit. We granted certiorari. 539 U. S. 957(2003).

II
The District and the Federal Government, as amicus, ad-vance three separate arguments, any of which would, if accepted, lead to the conclusion that the S-9 pump station doesnot require a point source discharge permit under the
NPDES program. Two of these arguments involve the ap-plication of disputed contentions of law to agreed-upon facts,
while the third involves the application of agreed-upon lawto disputed facts. For reasons explained below, we decline
at this time to resolve all of the parties' legal disagreements,and instead remand for further proceedings regarding their
factual dispute. A

In its opening brief on the merits, the District argued thatthe NPDES program applies to a point source "only when a
pollutant originates from the point source," and not whenpollutants originating elsewhere merely pass through the
point source. Brief for Petitioner 20. This argument mir-rors the question presented in the District's petition for certiorari: "Whether the pumping of water by a state watermanagement agency that adds nothing to the water being
pumped constitutes an `addition' of a pollutant `from' a pointsource triggering the need for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit under the Clean WaterAct." Pet. for Cert. i. Although the Government rejects

105Cite as: 541 U. S. 95 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
the District's legal position, Brief for United States as Ami-cus Curiae 21, it and the Tribe agree with the factual proposition that S-9 does not itself add any pollutants to the waterit conveys into WCA-3.

This initial argument is untenable, and even the Dis-trict appears to have abandoned it in its reply brief. Reply
Brief for Petitioner 2. A point source is, by definition, a"discernible, confined, and discrete

conveyance." $ 1362(14)(emphasis added). That definition makes plain that a point

source need not be the original source of the pollutant; itneed only convey the pollutant to "navigable waters," which
are, in turn, defined as "the waters of the United States."$ 1362(7). Tellingly, the examples of "point sources" listed
by the Act include pipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduits, ob-jects that do not themselves generate pollutants but merely
transport them. $ 1362(14). In addition, one of the Act'sprimary goals was to impose NPDES permitting requirements on municipal wastewater treatment plants. See, e. g.,$ 1311(b)(1)(B) (establishing a compliance schedule for publicly owned treatment works). But under the District's in-terpretation of the Act, the NPDES program would not
cover such plants, because they treat and discharge pollut-ants added to water by others. We therefore reject the District's proposed reading of the definition of " `discharge of apollutant' " contained in $ 1362(12). That definition includes
within its reach point sources that do not themselves gener-ate pollutants.

B
Having answered the precise question on which wegranted certiorari, we turn to a second argument, advanced

primarily by the Government as amicus curiae in meritsbriefing and at oral argument. For purposes of determining
whether there has been "any addition of any pollutant tonavigable waters from any point source," ibid., the Government contends that all the water bodies that fall within theAct's definition of " `navigable waters' " (that is, all "the

541US1 Unit: $U31 [05-20-06 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

MICCOSUKEE TRIBE

Opinion of the Court

waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"$ 1362(7)) should be viewed unitarily for purposes of NPDES

permitting requirements. Because the Act requiresNPDES permits only when there is an addition of a pollutant
"to navigable waters," the Government's approach wouldlead to the conclusion that such permits are not required
when water from one navigable water body is discharged,unaltered, into another navigable water body. That would
be true even if one water body were polluted and the otherpristine, and the two would not otherwise mix. See

CatskillMountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. New York,

273 F. 3d 481, 492 (CA2 2001); Dubois v. United States Dept.of Agriculture, 102 F. 3d 1273 (CA1 1996). Under this "unitary waters" approach, the S-9 pump station would not needan NPDES permit.

1
The "unitary waters" argument focuses on the Act's defi-nition of a pollutant discharge as "any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source." $ 1362(12).The Government contends that the absence of the word
"any" prior to the phrase "navigable waters" in $ 1362(12)signals Congress' understanding that NPDES permits would
not be required for pollution caused by the engineered trans-fer of one "navigable water" into another. It argues that
Congress intended that such pollution instead would be ad-dressed through local nonpoint source pollution programs.
Section 1314(f )(2)(F), which concerns nonpoint sources, di-rects the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to give
States information on the evaluation and control of "pollutionresulting from . . . changes in the movement, flow, or circulation of any navigable waters or ground waters, includingchanges caused by the construction of dams, levees, channels,
causeways, or flow diversion facilities."We note, however, that $ 1314(f)(2)(F) does not explicitly
exempt nonpoint pollution sources from the NPDES pro-gram if they

also fall within the "point source" definition.

107Cite as: 541 U. S. 95 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
And several NPDES provisions might be read to suggesta view contrary to the unitary waters approach. For example, under the Act, a State may set individualized ambi-ent water quality standards by taking into consideration
"the designated uses of the navigable waters involved." 33U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(2)(A). Those water quality standards, in
turn, directly affect local NPDES permits; if standard permit
conditions fail to achieve the water quality goals for a givenwater body, the State must determine the total pollutant

load that the water body can sustain and then allocate thatload among the permit holders who discharge to the water
body. $ 1313(d). This approach suggests that the Act protects individual water bodies as well as the "waters of the
United States" as a whole.

The Government also suggests that we adopt the "unitary
waters" approach out of deference to a longstanding EPA
view that the process of "transporting, impounding, and releasing navigable waters" cannot constitute an " `addition' "
of pollutants to " `the waters of the United States.' " Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 16. But the Government does not identify any administrative documents in
which EPA has espoused that position. Indeed, an amicus
brief filed by several former EPA officials argues that the
agency once reached the opposite conclusion. See Brief for
Former Administrator Carol M. Browner et al. as Amici
Curiae 17 (citing In re Riverside Irrigation Dist., 1975 WL
23864 (Ofc. Gen. Coun., June 27, 1975) (irrigation ditches
that discharge to navigable waters require NPDES permits
even if they themselves qualify as navigable waters)). The
"unitary waters" approach could also conflict with current
NPDES regulations. For example, 40 CFR $ 122.45(g)(4)
(2003) allows an industrial water user to obtain "intake
credit" for pollutants present in water that it withdraws
from navigable waters. When the permit holder discharges
the water after use, it does not have to remove pollutants
that were in the water before it was withdrawn. There is a

541US1 Unit: $U31 [05-20-06 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 SOUTH FLA. WATER MANAGEMENT DIST. v.

MICCOSUKEE TRIBE

Opinion of the Court

caveat, however: EPA extends such credit "only if the discharger demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from
the same body of water into which the discharge is made."
The NPDES program thus appears to address the movement
of pollutants among water bodies, at least at times.

Finally, the Government and numerous amici warn that
affirming the Court of Appeals in this case would have
significant practical consequences. If we read the Act to
require an NPDES permit for every engineered diversion of
one navigable water into another, thousands of new permits
might have to be issued, particularly by western States,
whose water supply networks often rely on engineered
transfers among various natural water bodies. See Brief for
Colorado et al. as Amici Curiae 2-4. Many of those diversions might also require expensive treatment to meet water
quality criteria. It may be that construing the NPDES program to cover such transfers would therefore raise the costs
of water distribution prohibitively, and violate Congress'
specific instruction that "the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its jurisdiction shall not be
superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired" by the Act.

$ 1251(g). On the other hand, it may be that such permitting
authority is necessary to protect water quality, and that the
States or EPA could control regulatory costs by issuing
general permits to point sources associated with water distribution programs. See 40 CFR $$ 122.28, 123.25 (2003).*

*An applicant for an individual NPDES permit must provide information about, among other things, the point source itself, the nature of the
pollutants to be discharged, and any water treatment system that will
be used. General permits greatly reduce that administrative burden by
authorizing discharges from a category of point sources within a specified
geographic area. Once EPA or a state agency issues such a permit, covered entities, in some cases, need take no further action to achieve compliance with the NPDES besides adhering to the permit conditions. See 40
CFR $ 122.28(b)(2)(v) (2003).

Opinion of the Court
Indeed, that is the position of the one State that has inter-preted the Act to cover interbasin water transfers. See

Brief for Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Pro-tection as Amicus Curiae 11-18.

Because WCA-3 and C-11 are both "navigable waters,"adopting the "unitary waters" approach would lead to the

conclusion that the District may operate S-9 without anNPDES permit. But despite its relevance here, neither the
District nor the Government raised the unitary waters ap-proach before the Court of Appeals or in their briefs respecting the petition for certiorari. (The District adopted theposition as its own in its reply brief on the merits.) Indeed,
we are not aware of any reported case that examines theunitary waters argument in precisely the form that the Government now presents it. As a result, we decline to resolveit here. Because we find it necessary to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to a third argu-ment presented by the District, the unitary waters argument
will be open to the parties on remand.

C
In the courts below, as here, the District contended thatthe C-11 canal and WCA-3 impoundment area are not distinct water bodies at all, but instead are two hydrologicallyindistinguishable parts of a single water body. The Government agrees with the District on this point, claiming thatbecause the C-11 canal and WCA-3 "share a unique, intimately related, hydrological association," they "can appropri-ately be viewed, for purposes of Section 402 of the Clean
Water Act, as parts of a single body of water." Brief forUnited States in Opposition 13. The Tribe does not dispute
that if C-11 and WCA-3 are simply two parts of the samewater body, pumping water from one into the other cannot
constitute an "addition" of pollutants. As the Second Cir541US1 Unit: $U31 [05-20-06 18:16:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cuit put it in Trout Unlimited, "[i]f one takes a ladle of soup
from a pot, lifts it above the pot, and pours it back into the
pot, one has not `added' soup or anything else to the pot."
273 F. 3d, at 492. What the Tribe disputes is the accuracy
of the District's factual premise; according to the Tribe, C-11
and WCA-3 are two pots of soup, not one.

The record does contain information supporting the District's view of the facts. Although C-11 and WCA-3 are
divided from one another by the L-33 and L-37 levees, that
line appears to be an uncertain one. Because Everglades
soil is extremely porous, water flows easily between ground
and surface waters, so much so that "[g]round and surface
waters are essentially the same thing." App. 111, 117.
C-11 and WCA-3, of course, share a common underlying
aquifer. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. Moreover, the L-33 and L-37
levees continually leak, allowing water to escape from
WCA-3. This means not only that any boundary between
C-11 and WCA-3 is indistinct, but also that there is some
significant mingling of the two waters; the record reveals
that even without use of the S-9 pump station, water travels
as both seepage and ground water flow between the water
conservation area and the C-11 basin. App. 172; see also
id., at 37 (describing flow between C-11 and WCA-3 as
"cyclical").

The parties also disagree about how the relationship between S-9 and WCA-3 should be assessed. At oral argument, counsel for the Tribe focused on the differing "biological or ecosystem characteristics" of the respective waters,
Tr. of Oral Arg. 43; see also Brief for Respondent Miccosukee
Tribe of Indians 6-7; Brief for Respondent Friends of
the Everglades 18-22, while counsel for the District emphasizes the close hydrological connections between the two.
See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner 47. Despite these disputes,
the District Court granted summary judgment to the Tribe.
It applied a test that neither party defends; it determined

Opinion of the Court
that C-11 and WCA-3 are distinct "because the transfer ofwater or its contents from C-11 into the Everglades would

not occur naturally." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. The Courtof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit endorsed this test. 280
F. 3d, at 1368.We do not decide here whether the District Court's test
is adequate for determining whether C-11 and WCA-3 are
distinct. Instead, we hold only that the District Court ap-plied its test prematurely. Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact.See

Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317 (1986). The record before us leads us to believe that some factual issues
remain unresolved. The District Court certainly was correct to characterize the flow through the S-9 pump station
as a nonnatural one, propelled as it is by diesel-fired motors
against the pull of gravity. And it also appears true that if
S-9 were shut down, the water in the C-11 canal might for
a brief time flow east, rather than west, as it now does. But
the effects of shutting down the pump might extend beyond
that. The limited record before us suggests that if S-9 were
shut down, the area drained by C-11 would flood quite
quickly. See 280 F. 3d, at 1366 ("Without the operation
of the S-9 pump station, the populated western portion of
Broward County would flood within days"). That flooding
might mean that C-11 would no longer be a "distinct body
of navigable water," id., at 1368, but part of a larger water
body extending over WCA-3 and the C-11 basin. It also
might call into question the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion
that S-9 is the cause in fact of phosphorous addition to
WCA-3. Nothing in the record suggests that the District
Court considered these issues when it granted summary
judgment. Indeed, in ordering later emergency relief from
its own injunction against the operation of the S-9 pump
station, the court admitted that it had not previously understood that shutting down S-9 would " `literally ope[n] the
flood gates.' " Id., at 1371.

MICCOSUKEE TRIBE

Opinion of Scalia, J.

We find that further development of the record is neces-sary to resolve the dispute over the validity of the distinction

between C-11 and WCA-3. After reviewing the full record,it is possible that the District Court will conclude that C-11
and WCA-3 are not meaningfully distinct water bodies. Ifit does so, then the S-9 pump station will not need an
NPDES permit. In addition, the Government's broader
"unitary waters" argument is open to the District on remand.Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of

Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is vacated, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join Parts I and II-A of the Court's opinion, which hold
that a point source is not exempt from the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit requirement merely
because it does not itself add pollutants to the water it
pumps. I dissent, however, from its decision to vacate the
judgment below on another ground, Part II-C, ante, and to
invite consideration of yet another legal theory, Part II-B,
ante. Neither of those actions is taken in response to the
question presented. I would affirm the Court of Appeals'
disposition of the question presented without reaching
other issues.

Parts II-B and II-C are problematic for other reasons as
well. In Part II-B, the Court declines to resolve the Government's unitary-waters argument on the ground that it
was not raised or decided below. See ante, at 109. In my
judgment, a fair reading of the opinion and briefs does not
support that contention. See, e. g., 280 F. 3d 1364, 1368, n. 5
(CA11 2002) ("We reject the Water District's argument that
no addition of pollutants can occur unless pollutants are
added from the outside world insofar as the Water District
contends the outside world cannot include another body of

navigable waters" (emphasis added)); Brief for Appellant inNo. 00-15703-CC (CA11), p. 10 ("The S-9 pump station

merely moves navigable waters from one side of the Leveeto another"). That the argument was not phrased in the
same terms or argued with the same clarity does not meanit was not made. I see no point in directing the Court of
Appeals to consider an argument it has already rejected.I also question the Court's holding in Part II-C that summary judgment was precluded by the possibility that, if thepumping station were shut down, flooding in the C-11 basin
might ultimately cause pollutants to flow from C-11 toWCA-3.

Ante, at 111. To my knowledge, that argumenthas not previously been made. Petitioner argued that

WCA-3 and C-11 were historically part of the same ecosys-tem and that they remain hydrologically related, see Brief
for Petitioner 46-49, but that is quite different from arguingthat, absent S-9, pollutants would flow from C-11 to WCA-3
(a journey that, at the moment, is uphill). Nothing in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317 (1986), requires a districtcourt to speculate sua sponte about possibilities even the

parties have not contemplated. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.56(e) (opponent of summary judgment must "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial").I would affirm the judgment below as to the question presented, leaving the Government's unitary-waters theory tobe considered in another case.

UNITED STATES v. GALLETTI et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1389. Argued January 12, 2004--Decided March 23, 2004
"[T]he amount of any tax imposed [by the Internal Revenue Code] shall

be assessed within three years after the return was filed." 26 U. S. C.

$ 6501(a). If a tax is properly so assessed, the statute of limitations
for collecting it is extended by 10 years from the assessment date.

$ 6502(a). Respondents were general partners of a partnership (hereinafter Partnership) that failed to pay significant federal employment
taxes from 1992 to 1995. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) timely
assessed the Partnership, but the taxes were never paid. Respondents
later filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and the IRS then filed
proof of claims against them for the Partnership's unpaid employment
taxes. Respondents objected, arguing that the timely assessment of
the Partnership did not extend the 3-year limitations period against the
general partners, who had not been separately assessed within that period. The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents' objections. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that since respondents are "taxpayers" under $ 7701, which defines "taxpayer" to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax," they
are also "taxpayers" under $$ 6203 and 6501. As such, the court held
that the assessment against the Partnership extended the limitations
period only with respect to the Partnership.

Held: The proper tax assessment against the Partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding
from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the Partnership's debts. Pp. 119-124.

(a) Respondents argue that a valid assessment triggering the 10-year
increase in the limitations period must name them individually, as they
are primarily liable for the tax debt. They claim, first, that they are
the relevant taxpayers under $ 6203, which requires the assessment to
be made by "recording the liability of the taxpayer." Although the
Ninth Circuit correctly concluded that an individual partner can be a
"taxpayer," $ 6203 speaks of the taxpayer's "liability," which indicates
that the relevant taxpayer must be determined. Here, the liability
arose from the Partnership's failure to comply with $ 3402(a)(1)'s requirement that an "employer [paying] wages" deduct and withhold employment taxes. And $ 3403 makes clear that the "employer" that fails

Syllabus
to withhold and submit the requisite employment taxes is the "liable"
taxpayer. In this case, the Partnership is the "employer." Second, respondents claim that they are primarily liable for the tax debt because
California law makes them jointly and severally liable for the Partnership's debts. However, to be primarily liable for this debt, respondents
must show that they are the "employer." And, under California law, a
partnership and its general partners are separate entities. Thus respondents cannot argue that, for all intents and purposes, imposing a
tax directly on the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly
on the general partners, but must instead prove that the tax liability
was imposed both on the Partnership and on respondents as separate
"employers." That respondents are jointly and severally liable for the
Partnership's debts is irrelevant to this determination. Pp. 120-121.

(b) The Code does not require the Government to make separate assessments of a single tax debt against persons or entities secondarily
liable for that debt in order for $ 6502's extended limitations period to
apply to judicial collection actions against those persons or entities. It
is clear that "assessment" refers to little more than the calculation or
recording of a tax liability, see, e. g., $ 6201, and that it is the tax that
is assessed, not the taxpayer, see, e. g., $ 6501. The limitations period
resulting from a proper assessment governs the time extension for enforcing the tax liability. United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489, 495.
Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the
IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against
individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for the taxpayer's debt. The assessment's consequences--the extension of the limitations period for collecting the
debt--attach to the debt without reference to the special circumstances
of the secondarily liable parties. Here, the tax was properly assessed
against the Partnership, thereby extending the limitations period for
collecting the debt. The United States now timely seeks to collect that
debt in judicial proceedings against respondents. Pp. 121-124.

Opinion of the Court
David R. Haberbush argued the cause for respondents.
With him on the brief were Joel Barry Feinberg, A. Lavar
Taylor, and Charles F. Rosen.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code states that,
except as otherwise provided, "the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within 3 years after the
return was filed . . . and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun after
the expiration of such period." 26 U. S. C. $ 6501(a). If a
tax is properly assessed within three years, however, the
statute of limitations for the collection of the tax is extended
by 10 years from the date of assessment. $ 6502(a). We
must decide in this case whether, in order for the United
States to avail itself of the 10-year increase in the statute of
limitations for collection of a tax debt, it must assess the
taxes not only against a partnership that is directly liable for
the debt, but also against each individual partner who might
be jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership. Under California law a partnership maintains a separate identity from its general partners, and the partners are
only secondarily liable for the tax debts of the partnership,
as they are for any debt of the partnership. Because, in this
case, the only relevant "taxpayer" for purposes of $$ 6501-
6502 is the partnership, we hold that the proper assessment
of the tax against the partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations for collection of the tax from the general
partners who are liable for the payment of the partnership's
debts. The Government's timely assessment of the tax
against the partnership was sufficient to extend the statute
of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding,
whether from the partnership itself or from those liable for
its debts.

Opinion of the Court

I
Respondents, Abel Cosmo Galletti, Sarah Galletti, Fran-cesco Briguglio, and Angela Briguglio, were general partners of Marina Cabrillo Company (Partnership). From 1992to 1995, the Partnership failed to pay significant federal employment tax liabilities that it had incurred. Although theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) timely assessed those taxes
against the Partnership in 1994, 1995, and 1996, the Partner-ship never satisfied the debt.

Respondents Abel and Sarah Galletti and respondentsFrancesco and Angela Briguglio filed joint petitions for relief
under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 20,1999, and February 4, 2000, respectively. In the Gallettis'
proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the amount of$395,179.89 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between
January 1994 and July 1995 against the Partnership. In theBriguglios' proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the
amount of $427,402.74. The proof of claim included securedclaims totaling $403,264.06 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between January 1994 and November 1996 againstthe Partnership.

Respondents objected to the claims on the ground thatthey were not proven against the estates. Respondents did
not dispute that under California law they are jointly andseverally liable for the debts of the Partnership. Nor did
they dispute that the IRS had properly assessed the taxes
against the Partnership within the 3-year statute of limita-tions, thereby extending the limitations period for collection

of the taxes by 10 years. Rather, respondents argued thatthe timely assessment of the Partnership extended the statute of limitations only against the Partnership. To extendthe 3-year statute of limitations against the general partners, respondents argued, the IRS had to separately assessthe general partners within the 3-year limitations period.
Because it did not, and because the 3-year limitations period

Opinion of the Court
had expired, respondents argued that the IRS could nolonger collect the debt from them. The Bankruptcy Court

and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents'objections to the claims.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. TheGovernment argued that the Code does not require that the
individual partners be assessed within the 3-year period prescribed by $ 6501 and that the IRS made a valid assessmentof the taxpayer here because the Partnership is the only relevant "taxpayer." The Court of Appeals held that since re-spondents are "taxpayers" under $ 7701(a)(14), which defines
"taxpayer" to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax," they are also "taxpayers" under $$ 6203 and 6501.
As such, the Court of Appeals held that "[t]he assessment
against the Partnership extended the statute of limitations
only with respect to the Partnership." 314 F. 3d 336, 340
(2002).

The Government argued in the alternative that because
respondents conceded that they were liable for the Partnership's employment tax debts as a matter of California
law, the Government had a right to payment, which suffices to prove a valid claim in bankruptcy. See 11 U. S. C.

$ 101(5)(A) (defining "claim" as including a "right to payment,
whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured").
The Court of Appeals rejected this argument because, under
California law, a creditor must obtain a judgment against a
partner before holding that partner liable for the partnership's debt. Cal. Corp. Code Ann. $ 16307(c) (West Supp.
2004). At the time the United States filed its proof of claim,
it had not obtained a separate judgment against respondents,
and the time for obtaining a judgment under the Internal
Revenue Code against respondents had expired.

We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 940 (2003), and now
reverse.

Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides
that "the amount of any tax imposed [by the Code] shall be
assessed within 3 years after the return was filed." 26
U. S. C. $ 6501(a). "The assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary
[of the Treasury] in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary." $ 6203. Within 60 days of the
assessment, the Secretary is required to "give notice to each
person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof." $ 6303(a). If the tax is properly assessed within 3 years, the limitations period for collection of the tax is extended by 10 years from the date of the
assessment. $ 6502.

The dispute in this case centers on whether the United
States can collect the Partnership's unpaid employment
taxes from respondents in a judicial proceeding occurring
more than three years after the tax return was filed but
within the 10-year extension to the 3-year limitations period
that attached when the tax was timely assessed against the
Partnership.1 Respondents insist that a valid assessment
(that is, one that would trigger the 10-year increase in the
statute of limitations) must name them individually. This is
so, according to respondents, because they are primarily liable for the tax debt, both because they are "the [relevant]
taxpayer[s]" under $ 6203 and because they are jointly and

1 Because the Government is attempting to enforce the Partnership's tax
liabilities against respondents in a judicial proceeding, we do not address
whether an assessment only against the Partnership is sufficient for the
IRS to commence administrative collection of the Partnership's tax debts
by lien or levy against respondents' property.

We also decline to address whether an assessment against the partnership suffices to trigger liability against the partners for interest and penalties without separate notice and demand to them.

Opinion of the Court
severally liable for the tax debts of the Partnership.2 Wereject both arguments in turn.

A
Respondents argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, thateach partner is primarily liable for the debt and must be

individually assessed because each partner is a separate"taxpayer" under 26 U. S. C. $ 6203. The statutory definition of "taxpayer" includes "any person subject to any inter-nal revenue tax," and "person" includes both "an individual"
and a "partnership," $$ 7701(a)(14), (a)(1). The Court of Ap-peals observed that although the Partnership is a "taxpayer," each individual partner is also a separate "taxpayer."As such, the Court of Appeals interpreted $ 6203's requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury record "the liabilityof the taxpayer" to require a separate assessment against
each of the general partners.Although the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that
an individual partner can be a "taxpayer," the inquiry doesnot end there. Section 6203 speaks of "

the liability of thetaxpayer" (emphasis added), which indicates that the relevant taxpayer must be determined. The liability in thiscase arose from the Partnership's failure to comply with

$ 3402(a)(1) of the Code, which requires "every employer

2 Respondents argue that even if we were to hold that the partners are
secondarily liable, the IRS would still be barred from collecting the taxes.
Respondents contend that if partners are not "taxpayers" under $ 6203,
then their liability arises only under state law, and the state 3-year statute
of limitations therefore applies. Brief for Respondents 30-34. Respondents have forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in the courts below.
Indeed, the closest respondents have come to arguing that the state limitations period applies was in the Court of Appeals, when respondents argued that "under California law, any collections suit filed against a partner
to collect a partnership debt is subject to the statute limitation provision
which applies to the underlying debt of the partnership." Appellee's
Opening Brief in Nos. 01-55953, 01-55954 (CA9), p. 14. This argument, of
course, is contrary to respondents' position in this Court.

Opinion of the Court
making payment of wages" to deduct and withhold employ-ment taxes. Moreover, "[t]he employer shall be liable for

the payment of the tax required to be deducted and with-held." $ 3403. When an employer fails to withhold and
submit the requisite amount of employment taxes, $ 3403makes clear that the liable taxpayer is the employer. In this
case, the "employer" was the Partnership.3

B
Respondents also argue that they are primarily liable forthe Partnership's tax debt because, under California law,

general partners are jointly and severally liable for the debtsof their partnership, Cal. Corp. Code Ann. $ 16306 (West
Supp. 2004). Brief for Respondents 8-16. As our prior dis-cussion demonstrates, however, respondents cannot show
that they are primarily liable for the payment of the Partner-ship's employment taxes unless they can show that they are
the "employer." However, under California's partnershipprinciples, a partnership and its general partners are separate entities. See $ 16201. Thus respondents cannot arguethat, for all intents and purposes, imposing a tax directly on
the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly onthe general partners. Respondents must instead prove that
the tax liability was imposed both on the Partnership andrespondents as separate "employers." The fact that respondents are jointly and severally liable for the debts of thePartnership is irrelevant to this determination.

III
We now turn to the question whether the Governmentmust make separate assessments of a single tax debt against

persons or entities secondarily liable for that debt in order

3 Our decision is consistent with this Court's holding in United States v.
Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 532-536 (1995), where we interpreted "taxpayer"
under 26 U. S. C. $ 6511 more broadly. Here, it is clear that we must interpret "the taxpayer" under $ 6203 with reference to the underlying liability.

122 UNITED STATES v. GALLETTI

Opinion of the Court
for $ 6502's extended statute of limitations to apply to thosepersons or entities.

4 We hold that the Code contains no such

requirement. Respondents' argument that they must beseparately assessed turns on a mistaken understanding of

the function and nature of an assessment as identical to theinitiation of a formal collection action against any person or
entity who might be liable for payment of a debt. In itsnumerous uses throughout the Code, it is clear that the term
"assessment" refers to little more than the calculation or re-cording of a tax liability. See,

e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 6201 (assess-ment authority); $ 6203 (method of assessment); $ 6204 (supplemental assessments); 26 CFR $ 601.103 (2003). See alsoBlack's Law Dictionary 111 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "assessment" as the "[d]etermination of the [tax] rate or amount ofsomething, such as a tax or damages"). "The Federal tax
system is basically one of self-assessment," whereby eachtaxpayer computes the tax due and then files the appropriate
form of return along with the requisite payment. 26 CFR$ 601.103(a) (2003). In most cases, the Secretary accepts the
self-assessment and simply records the liability of the tax-payer. Where the taxpayer fails to file the form of return
or miscalculates the tax due, as in this case, the Secretarycan assess "all taxes (including interest, additional amounts,
additions to the tax, and assessable penalties)," 26 U. S. C.$ 6201(a), by "recording the liability of the taxpayer in the
office of the Secretary," $ 6203. In other words, where theSecretary rejects the self-assessment of the taxpayer or discovers that the taxpayer has failed to file a return, the Secre-tary calculates the proper amount of liability and records it
in the Government's books.To be sure, the assessment of a tax triggers certain consequences. After the amount of liability has been establishedand recorded, the IRS can employ administrative enforcement methods to collect the tax. $$ 6321-6327, 6331-6334.

4 We use the term "secondary liability" to mean liability that is derived
from the original or primary liability.

Opinion of the Court
The assessment of a tax liability also extends the period dur-ing which the Government can collect the tax. But the fact

that the act of assessment has consequences does not changethe function of the assessment: to calculate and record a
tax liability.Under a proper understanding of the function and nature
of an assessment, it is clear that it is the tax that is assessed,
not the taxpayer. See $ 6501(a) ("the amount of any tax . . .shall be assessed"); $ 6502(a) ("[w]here the assessment of any

tax"). And in United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489 (1930),the Court, interpreting a predecessor to $ 6502, held that the
limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs "the extent of time for the enforcement of the tax liability," id., at 495. In other words, the Court held that the
statute of limitations attached to the debt as a whole. The
basis of the liability in Updike was a tax imposed on the
corporation, and the Court held that the same limitations
period applied in a suit to collect the tax from the corporation as in a suit to collect the tax from the derivatively liable transferee. Id., at 494-496. See also United States v.
Wright, 57 F. 3d 561, 563 (CA7 1995) (holding that, based on
Updike's principle of "all-for-one, one-for-all," the statute of
limitations governs the debt as a whole).

Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the
Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately
assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who
are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law,
liable for payment of the taxpayer's debt. The consequences of the assessment--in this case the extension of the
statute of limitations for collection of the debt--attach to the
tax debt without reference to the special circumstances of
the secondarily liable parties.

In this case, the tax was properly assessed against the
Partnership, thereby extending the statute of limitations for
collection of the debt. The United States now timely seeks
to collect that debt in judicial proceedings against respond541US1 Unit: $U32 [05-08-06 20:36:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ents.5 We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court ofAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

5 The Court of Appeals also held that the claims were barred by California partnership law, which requires a creditor first to obtain a judgment
against a partnership before holding the partners liable for the partnership's debt. 314 F. 3d 336, 344 (CA9 2002). When respondents filed for
bankruptcy, an automatic stay barred the Government from bringing suit
outside the Bankruptcy Court to enforce respondents' secondary liability.

be a "judgment against a partner." Cal. Corp. Code Ann. $ 16307(c) (West

NIXON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI v.MISSOURI MUNICIPAL LEAGUE

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 02-1238. Argued January 12, 2004--Decided March 24, 2004*
After Missouri enacted a statute forbidding its "political subdivision[s to]

provide or offer for sale . . . a telecommunications service or . . . facility,"
the municipal respondents, including municipally owned utilities, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an order declaring the statute unlawful under 47 U. S. C. $ 253, which authorizes
preemption of state and local laws and regulations "that prohibit or have
the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity" to provide telecommunications services. Relying on its earlier order resolving a challenge to
a comparable Texas law and the affirming opinion of the District of
Columbia Circuit, the FCC refused to declare the Missouri statute preempted, concluding that "any entity" in $ 253(a) does not include state
political subdivisions, but applies only to independent entities subject to
state regulation. The FCC also adverted to the principle of Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, that Congress needs to be clear before it constrains traditional state authority to order its government. The Eighth
Circuit panel unanimously reversed, explaining that $ 253(a)'s word "entity," especially when modified by "any," manifested sufficiently clear
congressional attention to governmental entities to get past Gregory.

Held: The class of entities contemplated by $ 253 does not include the

State's own subdivisions, so as to affect the power of States and localities to restrict their own (or their political inferiors') delivery of telecommunications services. Pp. 131-141.

(a) Two considerations fall short of supporting the municipal respondents. First, they argue that fencing governmental entities out of the
telecommunications business flouts the public interest in promoting competition. It does not follow, however, that preempting state or local
barriers to governmental entry into the market would be an effective
way to draw municipalities into the business, and in any event the issue
here does not turn on the merits of municipal telecommunications serv*Together with No. 02-1386, Federal Communications Commission

ices. Second, concentrating on the undefined statutory phrase "any entity" does not produce a persuasive answer here. While an "entity" can
be either public or private, there is no convention of omitting the modifiers "public and private" when both are meant to be covered. Nor is
coverage of public entities reliably signaled by speaking of "any" entity;
"any" can and does mean different things depending upon the setting.
To get at Congress's understanding requires a broader frame of reference, and in this litigation it helps to ask how Congress could have envisioned the preemption clause actually working if the FCC applied it at
the municipal respondents' urging. See, e. g., New Jersey Realty Title
Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals of N. J., 338 U. S. 665, 673. The
strange and indeterminate results of using federal preemption to free
public entities from state or local limitations is the key to understanding
that Congress used "any entity" with a limited reference to any private
entity. Pp. 131-133.

(b) The municipal respondents' position holds sufficient promise of futility and uncertainty to keep this Court from accepting it. Pp. 133-141.

(1) In familiar instances of regulatory preemption under the Supremacy Clause, a federal measure preempting state regulation of economic conduct by a private party simply leaves that party free to do
anything it chooses consistent with the prevailing federal law. See,
e. g., Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 540-553. But no
such simple result would follow from federal preemption meant to unshackle local governments from entrepreneurial limitations. Such a
government's capacity to enter an economic market turns not only on
the effect of straightforward economic regulation below the national
level (including outright bans), but on the authority and potential will
of state or local governments to support entry into the market. Preempting a ban on government utilities would not accomplish much if the
government could not point to some law authorizing it to run a utility
in the first place. And preemption would make no difference to anyone
if the state regulator were left with control over funding needed for any
utility operation and declined to pay for it. In other words, when a
government regulates itself (or the subdivision through which it acts)
there is no clear distinction between the regulator and the entity regulated. Legal limits on what the government itself (including its subdivisions) may do will often be indistinguishable from choices that
express what the government wishes to do with the authority and resources it can command. Thus, preempting state or local governmental
self-regulation (or regulation of political inferiors) would work so differently from preempting regulation of private players that it is highly
unlikely that Congress intended to set off on such uncertain adventures. Pp. 133-134.

(2) Several hypothetical examples illustrate the implausibility of
the municipal respondents' reading that Congress intended $ 253 to preempt state or local governmental self-regulation. Whether a law prohibiting an entity's "ability" to provide telecommunications under $ 253
means denying the entity a capacity or authority to act in the first place,
or whether it means limiting or cutting back on some preexisting authority to go into the telecommunications business (under a different
law), the hypotheticals demonstrate that $ 253 would not work like a
normal preemptive statute if it applied to a governmental unit. It
would often accomplish nothing, it would treat States differently depending on the formal structures of their laws authorizing municipalities
to function, and it would hold out no promise of a national consistency.
That Congress meant $ 253 to start down such a road in the absence of
any clearer signal than the phrase "ability of any entity" is farfetched.
See, e. g., United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310 U. S.
534, 543. Pp. 134-138.

(3) The practical implication of the dissent's reading of $ 253 to forbid States to withdraw municipalities' preexisting authority expressly
to enter the telecommunications business, but not withdrawals of authority that are competitively neutral in the sense of being couched in
general terms that do not expressly target telecommunications, is to
read out of $ 253 the words "or has the effect of prohibiting." Those
words signal Congress's willingness to preempt laws that produce the
unwanted effect, even if they do not advertise their prohibitory agenda
on their faces. The dissent's reading therefore disregards $ 253's plain
language and entails a policy consequence that Congress could not possibly have intended. Pp. 138-140.

(c) A complementary principle would bring the Court to the same
conclusion even on the assumption that preemption might operate
straightforwardly to provide local choice. Section 253(a) is hardly
forthright enough to pass Gregory: "ability of any entity" is not limited
to one reading, and neither statutory structure nor legislative history
points unequivocally to a commitment by Congress to treat governmental telecommunications providers on par with private firms. The want
of any "unmistakably clear" statement to that effect, 501 U. S., at 460,
would be fatal to respondents' reading. Pp. 140-141.

In 1997, the General Assembly of Missouri enacted thestatute codified as $ 392.410(7) of the State's Revised

Statutes:

"No political subdivision of this state shall provide oroffer for sale, either to the public or to a telecommunications provider, a telecommunications service or telecom-munications facility used to provide a telecommunications service for which a certificate of service authorityis required pursuant to this section."

On July 8, 1998, the municipal respondents, including mu-nicipalities, municipal organizations, and municipally owned
utilities, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission(FCC or Commission) for an order declaring the state statute unlawful and preempted under 47 U. S. C. $ 253:

"No State or local statute or regulation, or other Stateor local legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provideany interstate or intrastate telecommunications service." $ 253(a).
"If, after notice and an opportunity for public comment,the Commission determines that a State or local government has permitted or imposed any statute, regulation,or legal requirement that violates subsection (a) or (b) of

After notice and comment, the FCC refused to declare the
Missouri statute preempted, In re Missouri Municipal
League, 16 FCC Rcd. 1157 (2001), relying on its own earlier
order resolving a challenge to a comparable Texas law, In re
Public Utility Comm'n of Texas, 13 FCC Rcd. 3460 (1997),
as well as the affirming opinion of the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Abilene v.
FCC, 164 F. 3d 49 (1999). The agency concluded that "the
term `any entity' in section 253(a) . . . was not intended to
include political subdivisions of the state, but rather appears
to prohibit restrictions on market entry that apply to independent entities subject to state regulation." 2 16 FCC
Rcd., at 1162. Like the District of Columbia Circuit in Abilene, the FCC also adverted to the principle of Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991), that Congress needs to be
clear before it constrains traditional state authority to order
its government. 16 FCC Rcd., at 1169. But at the same
time the Commission rejected preemption, it also denounced
the policy behind the Missouri statute, id., at 1162-1163, and
the Commission's order carried two appended statements
(one by Chairman William E. Kennard and Commissioner
Gloria Tristani, id., at 1172, and one by Commissioner Susan
Ness, id., at 1173) to the effect that barring municipalities

at 1158. The Commission implied an opposite view, however, regarding
the status, under $ 253, of municipal utilities that had been separately chartered. Ibid. The question whether $ 253 preempts state and municipal
regulation of these types of entities is not before us, and we express no
view as to its proper resolution.

from providing telecommunications substantially disservedthe policy behind the Telecommunications Act.

The municipal respondents appealed to the Eighth Circuit,where a panel unanimously reversed the agency disposition,
299 F. 3d 949 (2002), with the explanation that the plain-vanilla "entity," especially when modified by "any," manifested sufficiently clear congressional attention to govern-mental entities to get past

Gregory. 299 F. 3d, at 953-955.The decision put the Eighth Circuit at odds with the District

of Columbia Circuit's Abilene opinion, and we granted cer-tiorari to resolve the conflict. 539 U. S. 941 (2003). We
now reverse. II

At the outset, it is well to put aside two considerationsthat appear in this litigation but fall short of supporting the
municipal respondents' hopes for prevailing on their gener-ous conception of preemption under $ 253. The first is public policy, on which the respondents have at the least a re-spectable position, that fencing governmental entities out of
the telecommunications business flouts the public interest.There are, of course, arguments on the other side, against
government participation: in a business substantially reg-ulated at the state level, regulation can turn into a public
provider's weapon against private competitors, see, e. g.,Brief for Petitioner Southwestern Bell Telephone, L. P., in
No. 02-1405 et al., pp. 17-18; and (if things turn out bad)government utilities that fail leave the taxpayers with the
bills. Still, the Chairman of the FCC and CommissionerTristani minced no words in saying that participation of municipally owned entities in the telecommunications businesswould "further the goal of the 1996 Act to bring the benefits
of competition to all Americans, particularly those who livein small or rural communities in which municipally-owned
utilities have great competitive potential." 16 FCC Rcd., at1172. Commissioner Ness said much the same, and a number of amicus briefs in this litigation argue the competitive

Amici Curiae 14-18; Brief for Consumer Federation of America as

infra, at 133-138, it does not follow that preempting state or
local barriers to governmental entry into the market wouldbe an effective way to draw municipalities into the business,

and in any event the issue here does not turn on the meritsof municipal telecommunications services.

The second consideration that fails to answer the question
posed in this litigation is the portion of the text that has
received great emphasis. The Eighth Circuit trained its
analysis on the words "any entity," left undefined by the statute, with much weight being placed on the modifier "any."
But concentration on the writing on the page does not
produce a persuasive answer here. While an "entity" can be
either public or private, compare, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 9604(k)(1)
(2000 ed., Supp. I) (defining "eligible entity" as a state
or local government body or its agent) with 26 U. S. C.

$ 269B(c)(1) (defining "entity" as "any corporation, partnership, trust, association, estate, or other form of carrying on
a business or activity"), there is no convention of omitting
the modifiers "public and private" when both are meant to
be covered. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(2) (exposing
States to remedies in antidiscrimination suits comparable to
those available "against any public or private entity other
than a State"). Nor is coverage of public entities reliably
signaled by speaking of "any" entity; "any" can and does
mean different things depending upon the setting. Compare, e. g., United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997)
(suggesting an expansive meaning of the term " `any other
term of imprisonment' " to include state as well as federal
sentences), with Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534
U. S. 533, 542-546 (2002) (implying a narrow interpretation

Opinion of the Court
of the phrase " `any claim asserted' " so as to exclude certain
claims dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds). To get
at Congress's understanding, what is needed is a broader
frame of reference, and in this litigation it helps if we ask
how Congress could have envisioned the preemption clause
actually working if the FCC applied it at the municipal respondents' urging. See, e. g., New Jersey Realty Title Ins.
Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals of N. J., 338 U. S. 665, 673
(1950) (enquiring into "the practical operation and effect" of
a state tax on federal bonds). We think that the strange
and indeterminate results of using federal preemption to free
public entities from state or local limitations is the key
to understanding that Congress used "any entity" with a

limited reference to any private entity when it cast the
preemption net.

III

A

In familiar instances of regulatory preemption under the
Supremacy Clause, a federal measure preempting state regulation in some precinct of economic conduct carried on by
a private person or corporation simply leaves the private
party free to do anything it chooses consistent with the prevailing federal law. If federal law, say, preempts state regulation of cigarette advertising, a cigarette seller is left free
from advertising restrictions imposed by a State, which is
left without the power to control on that matter. See, e. g.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 540-553 (2001).
On the subject covered, state law just drops out.

But no such simple result would follow from federal preemption meant to unshackle local governments from entrepreneurial limitations. The trouble is that a local government's capacity to enter an economic market turns not only
on the effect of straightforward economic regulation below
the national level (including outright bans), but on the authority and potential will of governments at the state or local

Opinion of the Court
level to support entry into the market. Preemption of thestate advertising restriction freed a seller who otherwise

had the legal authority to advertise and the money to doit if that made economic sense. But preempting a ban on
government utilities would not accomplish much if the gov-ernment could not point to some law authorizing it to run a
utility in the first place. And preemption would make nodifference to anyone if the state regulator were left with
control over funding needed for any utility operation and de-clined to pay for it. In other words, when a government
regulates itself (or the subdivision through which it acts)there is no clear distinction between the regulator and the
entity regulated. Legal limits on what may be done by thegovernment itself (including its subdivisions) will often be
indistinguishable from choices that express what the govern-ment wishes to do with the authority and resources it can
command. That is why preempting state or local govern-mental self-regulation (or regulation of political inferiors)
would work so differently from preempting regulation of pri-vate players that we think it highly unlikely that Congress
intended to set off on such uncertain adventures. A fewhypotheticals may bring the point home.

B
Hypotheticals have to rest on some understanding of what$ 253 means when it describes subjects of its preemption as

laws or regulations that prohibit, expressly or in effect, "theability of any entity" to provide telecommunications. The
reference to "ability" complicates things. In customaryusage, we speak simply of prohibiting a natural or legal person from doing something. To speak in terms of prohibitingtheir ability to provide a service may mean something different: it may mean denying the entity a capacity or authorityto act in the first place. But this is not clear, and it is possible that a law prohibiting the ability to provide telecommuni-cations means a law that limits or cuts back on some pre541US1 Unit: $U33 [05-08-06 20:40:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

135Cite as: 541 U. S. 125 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
existing authority (under a different law) to go into the
telecommunications business.

If the scope of law subject to preemption under $ 253 has
the former, broader, meaning, consider how preemption
would apply to a state statute authorizing municipalities to
operate specified utilities, to provide water and electricity
but nothing else.3 The enumeration would certainly have
the effect of prohibiting a municipally owned and operated
electric utility from entering the telecommunications business (as Congress clearly meant private electric companies
to be able to do, see S. Rep. No. 103-367, p. 55 (1994)), and
its implicit prohibition would thus be open to FCC preemption. But what if the FCC did preempt the restriction?
The municipality would be free of the statute, but freedom is
not authority, and in the absence of some further, authorizing
legislation the municipality would still be powerless to enter
the telecommunications business. There is, after all, no argument that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is itself
a source of federal authority granting municipalities local
power that state law does not.

Now assume that $ 253 has the narrower construction (preempting only laws that restrict authority derived from a different legal source). Consider a State with plenary authority itself, under its constitution, to operate any variety of
utility.4 Assume that its statutes authorized a state-run

3 The hypothetical city, in other words, is "general law" rather than
"home rule." See City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 127
(1983) (In contrast to a general law city, a home rule city has state constitutional authority to do whatever is not specifically prohibited by state
legislation).

4 The Court granted certiorari solely to consider whether municipalities

are subsumed under the rubric "any entity," and our holding reaches only
that question. There is, nevertheless, a logical affinity between the question presented and the hypothetical situation in which a State were to
decide, directly or effectively, against its own delivery of telecommunications services.

Opinion of the Court
utility to deliver electric and water services, but drew theline at telecommunications. The restrictive element of that

limited authorization would run afoul of $ 253 as respondentswould construe it. But if, owing to preemption, the state
operating utility authority were suddenly free to providetelecommunications and its administrators were raring to
enter this new field, where would the necessary capital come
from? Surely there is no contention that the Telecommuni-cations Act of 1996 by its own force entails a state agency's

entitlement to unappropriated funds from the state treasury,or to the exercise of state bonding authority.

Or take the application of $ 253 preemption to municipalities empowered by state law to furnish services generally,
but forbidden by a special statute to exercise that power for
the purpose of providing telecommunications services. If
the special statute were preempted, a municipality in that
State would have a real option to enter the telecommunications business if its own legislative arm so chose and funded
the venture. But in a State next door where municipalities
lacked such general authority, a local authority would not be
able to, and the result would be a national crazy quilt. We
will presumably get a crazy quilt, of course, as a consequence
of state and local political choices arrived at in the absence
of any preemption under $ 253, but the crazy quilt of this
hypothetical would result not from free political choices but
from the fortuitous interaction of a federal preemption law
with the forms of municipal authorization law.

Finally, consider the result if a State that previously authorized municipalities to operate a number of utilities including telecommunications changed its law by narrowing
the range of authorization. Assume that a State once authorized municipalities to furnish water, electric, and communications services, but sometime after the passage of $ 253
narrowed the authorization so as to leave municipalities authorized to enter only the water business. The repealing
statute would have a prohibitory effect on the prior ability

Opinion of the Court
to deliver telecommunications service and would be subjectto preemption. But that would mean that a State that once

chose to provide broad municipal authority could not reversecourse. A State next door, however, starting with a legal
system devoid of any authorization for municipal utility oper-ation, would at the least be free to change its own course by
authorizing its municipalities to venture forth. The result,
in other words, would be the federal creation of a one-wayratchet. A State or municipality could give the power, but

it could not take it away later. Private counterparts couldcome and go from the market at will, for after any federal
preemption they would have a free choice to compete or not
to compete in telecommunications; governmental providers
could never leave (or, at least, could not leave by a forthright
choice to change policy), for the law expressing the government's decision to get out would be preempted.

The municipal respondents' answer to the one-way ratchet,
and indeed to a host of the incongruities that would follow
from preempting governmental restriction on the exercise of
its own power, is to rely on $ 253(b), which insulates certain
state actions taken "on a competitively neutral basis." Respondents contend that a State or municipality would be able
to make a competitively neutral change of mind to leave the
telecommunications market after deciding earlier to enter it
or authorize entry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33.

But we think this is not much of an answer. The FCC
has understood $ 253(b) neutrality to require a statute or regulation affecting all types of utilities in like fashion, as a law
removing only governmental entities from telecommunications could not be. See, e. g., In re Federal-State Joint
Board on Universal Service, 15 FCC Rcd. 15168, 15175-
15178, |||| 19-24 (2000) (declaratory ruling). An even more
fundamental weakness in respondents' answer is shown in
briefs filed by amici City of Abilene and Consumer Federation of America. We have no reason to doubt them when
they explain how highly unlikely it is that a state decision to

Opinion of the Court
withdraw would be "neutral" in any sense of the word.There is every reason to expect just the contrary, that legislative choices in this arena would reflect the intent behindthe intense lobbying directed to those choices, manifestly

intended to impede, not enhance, competition. See, e. g.,Chen, Legal Process and Political Economy of Telecommunications Reform, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 835, 866-868 (1997).After all, the notion that the legislative process addressing
governmental utility authority is susceptible to capture bycompetition-averse private utilities is fully consistent with
(and one reason for) the FCC's position that statutes likeMissouri's disserve the policy objects of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Given the unlikely application of $ 253(b)to state or local choices driven by policy, not business failure,
the fair conclusion is that $ 253(a), if read respondents' way,would allow governments to move solely toward authorizing
telecommunications operation, with no alternative to reversecourse deliberately later on.

In sum, $ 253 would not work like a normal preemptivestatute if it applied to a governmental unit. It would often
accomplish nothing, it would treat States differently depend-ing on the formal structures of their laws authorizing municipalities to function, and it would hold out no promise of anational consistency. We think it farfetched that Congress
meant $ 253 to start down such a road in the absence of anyclearer signal than the phrase "ability of any entity." See,
e. g., United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310U. S. 534, 543 (1940) (Court will not construe a statute in a
manner that leads to absurd or futile results).

Justice Stevens contends that in our use of the hypo-thetical examples to illustrate the implausibility of the municipal respondents' reading of $ 253, we read the statutein a way that produces anomalous results unnecessarily,
whereas a simpler interpretation carrying fewer unhappy

Opinion of the Court
consequences is available. The dissent emphasizes the word"ability" in the phrase "prohibit or has the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity" to furnish telecommunications.With its focus on this word, the dissent concludes that "$ 253
prohibits States from withdrawing municipalities' pre-existing authority to enter the telecommunications business,
but does not command that States affirmatively grant either
that authority or the means with which to carry it out."
Post, at 145. Thus, if a State leaves an earlier grant of authority on the books while limiting it with a legislative banon telecommunications, the new statute would be preempted,

and presumably preemption would also defeat a State's attempted withdrawal of municipalities' authority by repealing
the preexisting authorization itself.

But on the very next page, Justice Stevens allows (in
the course of disagreeing about the one-way ratchet) that "[a]
State may withdraw comprehensive authorization in favor of
enumerating specific municipal powers . . . ." Post, at 146.
It turns out, in other words, that withdrawals of preexisting
authority are not (or not inevitably, at any rate) subject to
preemption. The dissent goes on to clarify that it means to
distinguish between withdrawals of authority that are competitively neutral in the sense of being couched in general
terms (and therefore not properly the subject of preemption), and those in which the repealing law expressly targets
telecommunications (and therefore properly preempted).
"[T]he one thing a State may not do," the dissent explains,
"is enact a statute or regulation specifically aimed at preventing municipalities or other entities from providing telecommunications services." Ibid. But the practical implication of that interpretation is to read out of $ 253 the words
"or ha[s] the effect of prohibiting," by which Congress signaled its willingness to preempt laws that produce the unwanted effect, even if they do not advertise their prohibitory
agenda on their faces. Even if $ 253 permitted such a formalistic distinction between implicit and explicit repeals of

Opinion of the Court
authority, the result would be incoherence of policy; whetherthe issue is viewed through the lens of preventing anticompetitive action or the lens of state autonomy from federalinterference, there is no justification for preempting only
those laws that self-consciously interfere with the deliveryof telecommunications services. In short, instead of supplying a more straightforward interpretation of $ 253, the dis-sent ends up reading it in a way that disregards its plain
language and entails a policy consequence that Congresscould not possibly have intended.

IV
The municipal respondents' position holds sufficient prom-ise of futility and uncertainty to keep us from accepting it,

but a complementary principle would bring us to the sameconclusion even on the assumption that preemption could operate straightforwardly to provide local choice, as in someinstances it might. Preemption would, for example, leave a
municipality with a genuine choice to enter the telecommuni-cations business when state law provided general authority
and a newly unfettered municipality wished to fund the ef-fort. But the liberating preemption would come only by interposing federal authority between a State and its munici-pal subdivisions, which our precedents teach, "are created as
convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmentalpowers of the State as may be entrusted to them in its absolute discretion." Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier,501 U. S. 597, 607-608 (1991) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted); Columbus v. Ours Garage &Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 433 (2002). Hence the
need to invoke our working assumption that federal legisla-tion threatening to trench on the States' arrangements for
conducting their own governments should be treated withgreat skepticism, and read in a way that preserves a State's
chosen disposition of its own power, in the absence of theplain statement

Gregory requires. What we have said al541US1 Unit: $U33 [05-08-06 20:40:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
ready is enough to show that $ 253(a) is hardly forthright
enough to pass Gregory: "ability of any entity" is not limited
to one reading, and neither statutory structure nor legislative history points unequivocally to a commitment by Congress to treat governmental telecommunications providers
on par with private firms. The want of any "unmistakably
clear" statement to that effect, 501 U. S., at 460, would be
fatal to respondents' reading.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is, accordingly, reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with much of the Court's analysis in Parts II and
III of its opinion, which demonstrates that reading "any entity" in 47 U. S. C. $ 253(a) to include political subdivisions of
States would have several unhappy consequences. I do not
think, however, that the avoidance of unhappy consequences
is adequate basis for interpreting a text. Cf. ante, at 140
("The municipal respondents' position holds sufficient promise of futility and uncertainty to keep us from accepting it").
I would instead reverse the Court of Appeals on the ground
discussed in Part IV of the Court's opinion: Section 253(a)
simply does not provide the clear statement which would be
required by Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991), for a
statute to limit the power of States to restrict the delivery of
telecommunications services by their political subdivisions.

I would not address the additional question whether the
statute affects the "power of . . . localities to restrict their
own (or their political inferiors') delivery" of telecommunications services, ante, at 129 (emphasis added), an issue considered and apparently answered negatively by the Court.
That question is neither presented by this litigation nor contained within the question on which we granted certiorari.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), Con-gress created "a new telecommunications regime designed

to foster competition in local telephone markets." Verizon
Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U. S. 635,638 (2002). Reasonable minds have differed as to whether

municipalities' participation in telecommunications marketsserves or disserves the statute's procompetitive goals. On
the one hand, some have argued that municipally owned util-ities enjoy unfair competitive advantages that will deter
entry by private firms and impair the normal developmentof healthy, competitive markets.

1 On the other hand, members of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), theregulatory agency charged with implementation of the 1996

Act, have taken the view that municipal entry "would fur-ther the goal of the 1996 Act to bring the benefits of competition to all Americans, particularly those who live in small orrural communities in which municipally-owned utilities have
great competitive potential." 2 The answer to the questionpresented in these cases does not, of course, turn on which
side has the better view in this policy debate. It turns onwhether Congress itself intended to take sides when it
passed the 1996 Act.In $ 253 of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by

$ 101 of the 1996 Act, Congress provided that "[n]o State or

local statute or regulation, or other State or local legal re-quirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the

ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastatetelecommunications service," unless the State or local law is
"competitively neutral" and "necessary to . . . protect thepublic safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of
telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights ofconsumers." 47 U. S. C. $$ 253(a), (b). It is common ground
among the parties that Congress intended to include utilitiesin the category of "entities" protected by $ 253. See,

e. g.,Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners in No. 02-1238 et al.,

p. 16 ("Congress clearly did intend to preempt state lawsthat closed the telecommunications market, including those
that closed the market to electric or other utilities"). Thelegislative history of $ 253 confirms the point: Congress
clearly meant for $ 253 to pre-empt "explicit prohibitions onentry by a utility into telecommunications." S. Rep. No.
104-230, p. 127 (1996).But while petitioners acknowledge the unmistakable clarity of Congress' intent to protect utilities' ability to enterlocal telephone markets, they contend that Congress' intent
to protect the subset of utilities that are owned and operatedby municipalities is somehow less than clear. The assertion
that Congress could have used the term "any entity" to in-clude utilities generally, but not

municipally owned utilities,must rest on one of two assumptions: Either Congress was

unaware that such utilities exist, or it deliberately ignoredtheir existence when drafting $ 253. Both propositions are
manifestly implausible, given the sheer number of public util-ities in the United States.

3 Indeed, elsewhere in the 1996

Act, Congress narrowed the definition of the word "utility,"as used in the Pole Attachments Act, 47 U. S. C. $ 224, to

3 For example, as of 2001, there were more than 2,000 publicly owned
electric utilities in the United States, compared to just over 230 investorowned utilities. Am. Public Power Assn., 2003 Annual Directory & Statistical Report 13.

Stevens, J., dissenting
exclude utilities "owned by . . . any State," including its po-litical subdivisions--a clear indication that Congress was

aware that many utilities are in fact owned by States andtheir political subdivisions. $$ 224(a)(1), (a)(3). Moreover,
the question of municipal participation in local telephonemarkets was clearly brought to Congress' attention. In
hearings on a predecessor bill, Congress heard from a rep-resentative of the American Public Power Association who
described public utilities' unique potential to promote compe-tition, particularly in small cities, towns, and rural communities underserved by private companies. Hearings on S. 1822
before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, andTransportation, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 351-360 (1994) (statement of William J. Ray, General Manager, Glasgow ElectricPlant Board).

4 In short, there is every reason to suppose

that Congress meant precisely what it said: No State or locallaw shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability

of any entity, public or private, from entering the telecommunications market.The question that remains is whether reading the statute

to give effect to Congress' intent necessarily will producethe absurd results that the Court suggests.

Ante, at 134-
138. "As in all cases[,] our task is to interpret the words of[the statute] in light of the purposes Congress sought to

serve." Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 608 (1979). Before nullifying Congress'
evident purpose in an effort to avoid hypothetical absurd re-sults, I would first decide whether the statute can reasonably

be read so as to avoid such absurdities, without casting asidecongressional intent.

4 This testimony prompted the Senate manager of the bill to remark:
"I think the rural electric associations, the municipalities, and the
investor-owned utilities, are all positioned to make a real contribution in
this telecommunications area, and I do think it is important that we make
sure we have got the right language to accomplish what we wish accomplished here." Hearings, at 379 (statement of Sen. Lott).

145Cite as: 541 U. S. 125 (2004)
Stevens, J., dissenting
The Court begins its analysis by asking us to imagine how$ 253 might apply to "a state statute authorizing municipalities to operate specified utilities, to provide water and elec-tricity but nothing else," or to a State's failure to provide
the necessary capital to a state-run utility "raring" to enterthe telecommunications market.

Ante, at 135. Certainly
one might plausibly interpret $ 253, as the Court does, to
forbid States' refusals to provide broader authorization or toprovide necessary capital as impermissible prohibitions on

entry. And as the Court observes, such an interpretationwould undeniably produce absurd results; it would leave covered entities in a kind of legal limbo, armed with a federallaw freedom to enter the market but lacking the state-law
power to do so. But we need not--and in my opinion, should
not--interpret $ 253 in this fashion. We should instead read
the statute's reference to state and local laws that "prohibit
or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity,"

$ 253(a), to enter the telecommunications business to embody
an implicit understanding that the only "entities" covered by

$ 253 are entities otherwise able to enter the business--i. e.,
entities both authorized to provide telecommunications services and capable of providing such services without the
State's direct assistance. In other words, $ 253 prohibits
States from withdrawing municipalities' pre-existing authority to enter the telecommunications business, but does not
command that States affirmatively grant either that authority or the means with which to carry it out.

Of course, the Court asserts that still other absurd results
would follow from application of $ 253 pre-emption to state
laws that withdraw a municipality's pre-existing authority to
enter the telecommunications business. But these results
are, on closer examination, perhaps not so absurd after all.
The Court first contends that reading $ 253 in this manner
will produce a "national crazy quilt" of public telecommunications authority, where the possibility of municipal participation in the telecommunications market turns on the scope of

541US1 Unit: $U33 [05-08-06 20:40:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
146 NIXON v. MISSOURI MUNICIPAL LEAGUE

Stevens, J., dissenting
the authority each State has already granted to its subdivi-sions.

Ante, at 136. But as the Court acknowledges, permitting States such as Missouri to prohibit municipalitiesfrom providing telecommunications services hardly will help

the cause of national consistency. Ibid. That the "crazyquilt" the Court describes is the product of political choices
made by Congress rather than state legislatures, see ibid.,
renders it no more absurd than the "crazy quilt" that willresult from leaving the matter of municipal entry entirely to

individual States' discretion.The Court also contends that applying $ 253 pre-emption
to bar withdrawal of authority to enter the telecommunications market will result in "the federal creation of a one-way
ratchet": "A State or municipality could give the power, but
it could not take it away later." Ante, at 137. But nothing
in $ 253 prohibits States from scaling back municipalities' authority in a general way. A State may withdraw comprehensive authorization in favor of enumerating specific municipal powers, or even abolish municipalities altogether. Such
general withdrawals of authority may very well "have the
effect of prohibiting" municipalities' ability to enter the telecommunications market, see ante, at 139, just as enforcement
of corporate governance and tax laws might "have the effect of prohibiting" other entities' ability to enter. $ 253(a).
But $ 253 clearly does not pre-empt every state law that "has
the effect" of restraining entry. It pre-empts only those
that constitute nonneutral restraints on entry. $ 253(b). A
general redefinition of municipal authority no more constitutes a prohibited nonneutral restraint on entry than enforcement of other laws of general applicability that, practically speaking, may make it more difficult for certain entities
to enter the telecommunications business.

As I read the statute, the one thing a State may not do is
enact a statute or regulation specifically aimed at preventing
municipalities or other entities from providing telecommunications services. This prohibition would certainly apply to

541US1 Unit: $U33 [05-08-06 20:40:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

147Cite as: 541 U. S. 125 (2004)
Stevens, J., dissenting
a law like Missouri's, which "advertise[s] [its] prohibitoryagenda on [its] fac[e]." Ante, at 139. But it would also

apply to a law that accomplished a similar result by othermeans--for example, a law that permitted only private telecommunications carriers to receive federal universal servicesupport or access to unbundled network elements.

5 As the

Court notes, there is little reason to think that legislationthat targets municipalities' ability to provide telecommunications services is " `neutral' in any sense of the word," or thatit is designed to do anything other than impede competition,
rather than enhance it. Ante, at 138. To the extent thatreading $ 253 to forbid such protectionist legislation creates
a "one-way ratchet," it is one perfectly consistent with thegoal of promoting competition in the telecommunications
market, while otherwise preserving States' ability to definethe scope of authority held by their political subdivisions.

6

The Court's concern about hypothetical absurd results isparticularly inappropriate because the pre-emptive effect of

$ 253 is not automatic, but requires the FCC's intervention.$ 253(d). Rather than assume that the FCC will apply the

5 The operative distinction for $ 253 purposes is thus not between implicit and explicit repeals of authority. See ante, at 139-140. It is,
rather, the distinction between laws that generally redefine the scope of
municipal authority and laws that specifically target municipal authority
to enter the telecommunications business, whether by direct prohibition
or indirect barriers to entry.

6 The goal of striking a balance between promoting competition and preserving States' general regulatory authority surely supplies a sufficient
justification for "preempting only those laws that self-consciously interfere
with the delivery of telecommunications services," rather than all generally applicable laws that might have the practical effect of restraining
entry. Ante, at 140. But even if, as the Court asserts, there were "no
justification" for drawing the line at laws that "self-consciously" interfere
with entities' ability to provide telecommunications services, ibid., that
surely would not be a valid reason for refusing to allow the FCC to preempt those that do create such an interference. We generally do not refuse to give effect to a statute simply because it "might have gone farther
than it did." Roschen v. Ward, 279 U. S. 337, 339 (1929).

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. FLORES-MONTANO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1794. Argued February 25, 2004--Decided March 30, 2004
At the international border in southern California, customs officials seized

37 kilograms of marijuana from respondent's gas tank by removing and
disassembling the tank. After respondent was indicted on federal drug
charges, he moved to suppress the drugs recovered from the gas tank,
relying on a Ninth Circuit panel decision holding that a gas tank's removal requires reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment.
The District Court granted the motion, and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed.

Held: The search did not require reasonable suspicion. In the decision

relied on below, the Ninth Circuit panel seized on language from United
States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 538, that used "routine"
as a descriptive term in discussing border searches. The panel took
"routine," fashioned a new balancing test, and extended it to vehicle
searches. But the reasons that might support a suspicion requirement
in the case of highly intrusive searches of persons simply do not carry
over to vehicles. Complex balancing tests to determine what is a "routine" vehicle search, as opposed to a more "intrusive" search of a person,
have no place in border searches of vehicles. The Government's interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its
zenith at the international border. United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S.
606, 616. Congress has always granted the Executive plenary authority
to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable
cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties and
to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country. Montoya
de Hernandez, 473 U. S., at 537. Respondent's assertion that he has a
privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicionless disassembly
of his tank is an invasion of his privacy, is rejected, as the privacy expectation is less at the border than it is in the interior, id., at 538, and
this Court has long recognized that automobiles seeking entry into this
country may be searched, see Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132,
154. And while the Fourth Amendment "protects property as well as
privacy," Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62, the interference with
a motorist's possessory interest in his gas tank is justified by the Government's paramount interest in protecting the border. Thus, the Government's authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Customs officials seized 37 kilograms--a little more than81 pounds--of marijuana from respondent Manuel FloresMontano's gas tank at the international border. The Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, relying on an earlier decision by a divided panel of that court, United States v.Molina-Tarazon, 279 F. 3d 709 (2002), held that the Fourth
Amendment forbade the fuel tank search absent reasonablesuspicion. No. 02-50306, 2003 WL 22410705 (Mar. 14, 2003).
We hold that the search in question did not require reason-able suspicion.

Respondent, driving a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon,attempted to enter the United States at the Otay Mesa Port
of Entry in southern California. A customs inspector con-ducted an inspection of the station wagon, and requested respondent to leave the vehicle. The vehicle was then takento a secondary inspection station.

Opinion of the Court
At the secondary station, a second customs inspector inspected the gas tank by tapping it, and noted that the tank
sounded solid. Subsequently, the inspector requested a mechanic under contract with Customs to come to the border
station to remove the tank. Within 20 to 30 minutes, the
mechanic arrived. He raised the car on a hydraulic lift, loosened the straps and unscrewed the bolts holding the gas tank
to the undercarriage of the vehicle, and then disconnected
some hoses and electrical connections. After the gas tank
was removed, the inspector hammered off bondo (a putty-like
hardening substance that is used to seal openings) from the
top of the gas tank. The inspector opened an access plate
underneath the bondo and found 37 kilograms of marijuana
bricks. The process took 15 to 25 minutes.

A grand jury for the Southern District of California indicted respondent on one count of unlawfully importing marijuana, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 952, and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of

$ 841(a)(1). Relying on Molina-Tarazon, respondent filed a
motion to suppress the marijuana recovered from the gas
tank. In Molina-Tarazon, a divided panel of the Court of
Appeals held, inter alia, that removal of a gas tank requires
reasonable suspicion in order to be consistent with the
Fourth Amendment. 279 F. 3d, at 717.

The Government advised the District Court that it was
not relying on reasonable suspicion as a basis for denying respondent's suppression motion, but that it believed
Molina-Tarazon was wrongly decided. The District Court,
relying on Molina-Tarazon, held that reasonable suspicion
was required to justify the search and, accordingly, granted
respondent's motion to suppress. The Court of Appeals,
citing Molina-Tarazon, summarily affirmed the District
Court's judgment. No. 02-50306, 2003 WL 22410705 (CA9,
Mar. 14, 2003). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 945 (2003),

152 UNITED STATES v. FLORES-MONTANO

Opinion of the Court
In Molina-Tarazon, the Court of Appeals decided a casepresenting similar facts to the one at bar. It asked

"whether [the removal and dismantling of the defendant'sfuel tank] is a `routine' border search for which no suspicion
whatsoever is required." 279 F. 3d, at 711. The Court ofAppeals stated that "[i]n order to conduct a search that goes
beyond the routine, an inspector must have reasonable suspicion," and the "critical factor" in determining whether asearch is "routine" is the "degree of intrusiveness."

Id., at
712-713.The Court of Appeals seized on language from our opinion

in United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531
(1985), in which we used the word "routine" as a descriptive
term in discussing border searches. Id., at 538 ("Routine
searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable
cause, or warrant"); id., at 541, n. 4 ("Because the issues are
not presented today we suggest no view on what level of
suspicion, if any, is required for nonroutine border searches
such as strip, body-cavity, or involuntary x-ray searches").
The Court of Appeals took the term "routine," fashioned a
new balancing test, and extended it to searches of vehicles.
But the reasons that might support a requirement of some
level of suspicion in the case of highly intrusive searches of
the person--dignity and privacy interests of the person
being searched--simply do not carry over to vehicles. Complex balancing tests to determine what is a "routine" search
of a vehicle, as opposed to a more "intrusive" search of a
person, have no place in border searches of vehicles.

The Government's interest in preventing the entry of
unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border. Time and again, we have stated that
"searches made at the border, pursuant to the longstanding
right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country, are
reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the

United States v. Villamonte-Marquez,462 U. S. 579, 584 (1983), and reflects the "impressive historical pedigree" of the Government's power and interest, id., at585. It is axiomatic that the United States, as sovereign,
has the inherent authority to protect, and a paramount inter-est in protecting, its territorial integrity.

That interest in protecting the borders is illustrated in thiscase by the evidence that smugglers frequently attempt to
penetrate our borders with contraband secreted in their au-tomobiles' fuel tank. Over the past 5

1/2 fiscal years, there

have been 18,788 vehicle drug seizures at the southern Cali-fornia ports of entry. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. Of those

154 UNITED STATES v. FLORES-MONTANO

Opinion of the Court
San Ysidro and Otay Mesa at a rate averaging 1 approxi-mately every 10 days. Id., at 16a.

Respondent asserts two main arguments with respect tohis Fourth Amendment interests. First, he urges that he
has a privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicion-less disassembly of his tank is an invasion of his privacy.
But on many occasions, we have noted that the expectationof privacy is less at the border than it is in the interior.
Montoya de Hernandez, supra, at 538. We have long recog-nized that automobiles seeking entry into this country may
be searched. See Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132,154 (1925) ("Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection rea-sonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effectswhich may be lawfully brought in"). It is difficult to imagine how the search of a gas tank, which should be solely arepository for fuel, could be more of an invasion of privacy
than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment.Second, respondent argues that the Fourth Amendment
"protects property as well as privacy," Soldal v. CookCounty, 506 U. S. 56, 62 (1992), and that the disassembly and
reassembly of his gas tank is a significant deprivation of hisproperty interest because it may damage the vehicle. He
does not, and on the record cannot, truly contend that theprocedure of removal, disassembly, and reassembly of the
fuel tank in this case or any other has resulted in seriousdamage to, or destruction of, the property.

2 According to

2 Respondent's reliance on cases involving exploratory drilling searches
is misplaced. See United States v. Rivas, 157 F. 3d 364 (CA5 1998) (drilling into body of trailer required reasonable suspicion); United States v.
Robles, 45 F. 3d 1 (CA1 1995) (drilling into machine part required reasonable suspicion); United States v. Carreon, 872 F. 2d 1436 (CA10 1989) (drilling into camper required reasonable suspicion). We have no reason at
this time to pass on the reasonableness of drilling, but simply note the
obvious factual difference that this case involves the procedure of removal,
disassembly, and reassembly of a fuel tank, rather than potentially de541US1 Unit: $U34 [11-29-04 12:26:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
the Government, for example, in fiscal year 2003, 348 gastank searches conducted along the southern border were

negative (i. e., no contraband was found), the gas tanks werereassembled, and the vehicles continued their entry into the
United States without incident. Brief for United States 31.Respondent cites not a single accident involving the vehicle or motorist in the many thousands of gas tank disassem-blies that have occurred at the border. A gas tank search
involves a brief procedure that can be reversed withoutdamaging the safety or operation of the vehicle. If damage
to a vehicle were to occur, the motorist might be entitledto recovery. See,

e. g., 31 U. S. C. $ 3723; 19 U. S. C. $ 1630.While the interference with a motorist's possessory interest

is not insignificant when the Government removes, disassem-bles, and reassembles his gas tank, it nevertheless is justified
by the Government's paramount interest in protecting theborder.

3

For the reasons stated, we conclude that the Government'sauthority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border

includes the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassem-ble a vehicle's fuel tank. While it may be true that some

structive drilling. We again leave open the question "whether, and under
what circumstances, a border search might be deemed `unreasonable' because of the particularly offensive manner in which it is carried out."
United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 618, n. 13 (1977).

3 Respondent also argued that he has some sort of Fourth Amendment

right not to be subject to delay at the international border and that the
need for the use of specialized labor, as well as the hour actual delay here
and the potential for even greater delay for reassembly are an invasion of
that right. Respondent points to no cases indicating the Fourth Amendment shields entrants from inconvenience or delay at the international
border.

The procedure in this case took about an hour (including the wait for
the mechanic). At oral argument, the Government advised us that, depending on the type of car, a search involving the disassembly and reassembly of a gas tank may take one to two hours. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.
We think it clear that delays of one to two hours at international borders
are to be expected.

v. FAVISH et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-954. Argued December 3, 2003--Decided March 30, 2004
Skeptical about five Government investigations' conclusions that Vincent

Foster, Jr., deputy counsel to President Clinton, committed suicide, respondent Favish filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for,
among other things, 10 death-scene photographs of Foster's body. The
Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) refused the request, invoking
FOIA Exemption 7(C), which excuses from disclosure "records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes" if their production
"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy," 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(7)(C). Favish sued to compel
production. In upholding OIC's exemption claim, the District Court
balanced the Foster family's privacy interest against any public interest
in disclosure, holding that the former could be infringed by disclosure
and that Favish had not shown how disclosure would advance his investigation, especially in light of the exhaustive investigation that had already occurred. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Favish need
not show knowledge of agency misfeasance to support his request, and
remanded the case for the interests to be balanced consistent with its
opinion. On remand, the District Court ordered the release of five of
the photographs. The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the release of four.

Held:

1. FOIA recognizes surviving family members' right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative's death-scene images. Favish's
contention that Exemption 7(C)'s personal privacy right is confined to
the right to control information about oneself is too narrow an interpretation of Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of
Press, 489 U. S. 749, which held that the personal privacy concept must
encompass an individual's control of information about himself, but had
no occasion to consider whether those whose personal data are not in
the requested materials also have a recognized privacy interest under
the exemption. It did explain, however, that Exemption 7(C)'s concept
of privacy is not a limited or cramped notion. The exemption is in
marked contrast to Exemption 6, which requires withholding of personnel and medical files only if disclosure "would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." Exemption 7(C)'s comparative

Syllabus
breadth--it does not include "clearly" and uses "could reasonably be
expected to constitute" instead of "would constitute"--is no drafting
accident, but is the result of specific amendments to an existing statute.
Because law enforcement documents often have information about persons whose link to the official inquiry may be the result of mere happenstance, there is special reason to protect intimate personal data, to
which the public does not have a general right of access in the ordinary
course. The modifier "personal" before "privacy" does not bolster
Favish's view that the family has no privacy interest in a decedent's
pictures. Foster's relatives invoke that interest to secure their own
refuge from a sensation-seeking culture for their own peace of mind and
tranquility, not for the sake of Foster's reputation or some other interest
personal to him. It is proper to conclude that Congress intended to
permit family members to assert their own privacy rights against public
intrusions long deemed impermissible under the common law and cultural traditions. This does not mean that the family is in the same
position as the individual who is the disclosure's subject. However, this
Court has little difficulty in finding in case law and traditions the right
of family members to direct and control disposition of a deceased's body
and to limit attempts to exploit pictures of the deceased's remains for
public purposes. The well-established cultural tradition of acknowledging a family's control over the body and the deceased's death images has
long been recognized at common law. In enacting FOIA and amending
Exemption 7(C) to extend its terms, Congress legislated against this
background and the Attorney General's consistent interpretation of the
exemption. The exemption protects a statutory privacy right that goes
beyond the common law and the Constitution, see id., at 762, n. 13. It
would be anomalous to hold in this case that the statute provides less
protection than does the common law. The statute must also be understood in light of the consequences that would follow from Favish's position. Since FOIA withholding cannot be predicated on the requester's
identity, violent criminals, who often make FOIA requests, would be
able to obtain autopsies, photographs, and records of their deceased victims at the expense of surviving family members' personal privacy.
Pp. 164-171.

2. The Foster family's privacy interest outweighs the public interest
in disclosure. As a general rule, citizens seeking documents subject to
FOIA disclosure are not required to explain why they seek the information. However, when Exemption 7(C)'s privacy concerns are present,
the requester must show that the public interest sought to be advanced
is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information
for its own sake, and that the information is likely to advance that interest. The Court does not in this single decision attempt to define the

Syllabus
reasons that will suffice, or the necessary nexus between the requested
information and the public interest served by disclosure, but there must
be some stability with respect to both the specific category of privacy
interests protected and the specific category of public interests that
could outweigh the privacy claim. Here, the Ninth Circuit correctly
ruled that the family has a privacy interest protected by the statute
and recognized as significant the asserted public interest in uncovering
deficiencies or misfeasance in the Government's investigations into Foster's death, but it erred in defining the showing Favish must make to
establish his public interest claim. By requiring no particular evidence
of some actual misfeasance or other impropriety, that court's holding
leaves Exemption 7(C) with little force or content. Under its rationale,
the invasion of privacy would be extensive, since once disclosed, information belongs to the general public. Thus, where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest

asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in performing their duties, the requester must produce
evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the
alleged Government impropriety might have occurred. When the presumption of legitimacy accorded to the Government's official conduct is
applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it. Given
FOIA's prodisclosure purpose, however, a less stringent standard is
more faithful to the statutory scheme. Only when the FOIA requester
has produced evidence sufficient to warrant a belief by a reasonable
person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred
will there be a counterweight on the FOIA scale for a court to balance
against the cognizable privacy interests in the requested documents.
Favish has produced no evidence to put that balance into play. The
District Court's first order--before it was set aside by the Ninth Circuit
and superseded by the District Court's remand order--followed the correct approach. Pp. 171-175.

Respondent Allan J. Favish argued the cause and filed abrief pro se.*

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to interpret the Freedom of Informa-tion Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. $ 552. FOIA does not apply if

the requested data fall within one or more exemptions. Ex-emption 7(C) excuses from disclosure "records or information
compiled for law enforcement purposes" if their production"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy." $ 552(b)(7)(C).In

Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Free-dom of Press, 489 U. S. 749 (1989), we considered the scope

of Exemption 7(C) and held that release of the document atissue would be a prohibited invasion of the personal privacy
of the person to whom the document referred. The princi-pal document involved was the criminal record, or rap sheet,
of the person who himself objected to the disclosure. Here,the information pertains to an official investigation into the
circumstances surrounding an apparent suicide. The initialquestion is whether the exemption extends to the decedent's
family when the family objects to the release of photographsshowing the condition of the body at the scene of death. If
we find the decedent's family does have a personal privacyinterest recognized by the statute, we must then consider
whether that privacy claim is outweighed by the public inter-est in disclosure.

Opinion of the Court
Washington, D. C. The United States Park Police con-ducted the initial investigation and took color photographs of

the death scene, including 10 pictures of Foster's body. Theinvestigation concluded that Foster committed suicide by
shooting himself with a revolver. Subsequent investiga-tions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, committees of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, and independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr reached thesame conclusion. Despite the unanimous finding of these

five investigations, a citizen interested in the matter, AllanFavish, remained skeptical. Favish is now a respondent in
this proceeding. In an earlier proceeding, Favish was theassociate counsel for Accuracy in Media (AIM), which applied
under FOIA for Foster's death-scene photographs. Afterthe National Park Service, which then maintained custody
of the pictures, resisted disclosure, Favish filed suit on be-half of AIM in the District Court for the District of Columbia
to compel production. The District Court granted sum-mary judgment against AIM. The Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia unanimously affirmed. Accuracy in
Media, Inc. v. National Park Serv., 194 F. 3d 120 (1999).Still convinced that the Government's investigations were

" `grossly incomplete and untrustworthy,' " App. to Pet. for
Cert. 57a, Favish filed the present FOIA request in his own
name, seeking, among other things, 11 pictures, 1 showing
Foster's eyeglasses and 10 depicting various parts of Foster's
body. Like the National Park Service, the Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) refused the request under Exemption 7(C).

Again, Favish sued to compel production, this time in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. As a preliminary matter, the District Court held
that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia did not have collateral estoppel effect on Favish's
California lawsuit brought in his personal capacity. On the
merits, the court granted partial summary judgment to OIC.
With the exception of the picture showing Foster's eye541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
glasses, the court upheld OIC's claim of exemption. Relyingon the so-called

Vaughn index provided by the Government--a narrative description of the withheld photos, see
Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (CADC 1973)--the court held,
first, that Foster's surviving family members enjoy personalprivacy interests that could be infringed by disclosure of the

photographs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. It then found,
with respect to the asserted public interest, that "[Favish]has not sufficiently explained how disclosure of these photographs will advance his investigation into Foster's death."
Id., at 59a. Any purported public interest in disclosure,
moreover, "is lessened because of the exhaustive investiga-tion that has already occurred regarding Foster's death."

Id., at 58a. Balancing the competing interests, the courtconcluded that "the privacy interests of the Foster family
members outweigh the public interest in disclosure." Id.,at 59a.

On the first appeal to the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit, the majority reversed and remanded, over Judge
Pregerson's dissent. 217 F. 3d 1168 (2000). In the majority's view, although evidence or knowledge of misfeasance bythe investigative agency may "enhanc[e] the urgency of the

[FOIA] request," "[n]othing in the statutory command conditions [disclosure] on the requesting party showing that he
has knowledge of misfeasance by the agency." Id., at 1172-
1173. Furthermore, because "Favish, in fact, tenders evidence and argument which, if believed, would justify his
doubts," the FOIA request "is in complete conformity with
the statutory purpose that the public know what its government is up to." Ibid. This was so, the Court of Appeals
held, even in the face of five previous investigations into Foster's death: "Nothing in the statutory command shields an
agency from disclosing its records because other agencies
have engaged in similar investigations. . . . [I]t is a feature
of famous cases that they generate controversy, suspicion,
and the desire to second guess the authorities." Id., at 1173.
As the majority read the statute, there is "a right to look, a

541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
right to speculate and argue again, a right of public scrutiny." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals, however, agreed with the District
Court that the exemption recognizes the Foster family members' right to personal privacy. Although the pictures contain no information about Foster's relatives, the statute's
protection "extends to the memory of the deceased held by
those tied closely to the deceased by blood or love." Ibid.
Nevertheless, the majority held that the District Court erred
in balancing the relevant interests based only on the Vaughn
index. While "the [D]istrict [C]ourt has discretion to decide
a FOIA case on the basis of affidavits, and affidavits are in
some cases sufficient," "the agency affidavits are insufficiently detailed." 217 F. 3d, at 1174. It remanded the case
to the District Court to examine the photos in camera and,
"consistent with [the Court of Appeals'] opinion," "balance
the effect of their release on the privacy of the Foster family
against the public benefit to be obtained by their release."
Ibid.

On remand, the District Court ordered release of the following five photographs:

"A* The photograph identified as `3--VF's [Vincent Foster's] body looking down from top of berm' must be
released, as the photograph is not so explicit as to
overcome the public interest.. . . . .

"A* The photograph entitled `5--VF's body--focusing on

Rt. side of shoulder/arm' is again of such a nature as
to be discoverable in that it is not focused in such a
manner as to unnecessarily impact the privacy interests of the family.. . . . .

"A* The photograph entitled `1--Right hand showing

gun & thumb in guard' is discoverable as it may be
probative of the public's right to know.. . . . .

"A* The photograph entitled `5--VF's body--focus on topof head thru heavy foliage' is discoverable." App. to

Pet. for Cert. 45a.
On the second appeal to the same panel, the majority,
again over Judge Pregerson's dissent, affirmed in part. 37Fed. Appx. 863 (2002). Without providing any explanation,

it upheld the release of all the pictures, "except that photo3--VF's body looking down from top of berm is to be withheld." Id., at 864.We granted OIC's petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over the properinterpretation of Exemption 7(C). 538 U. S. 1012 (2003).
The only documents at issue in this case are the four photographs the Court of Appeals ordered released in its 2002unpublished opinion. We reverse.

The OIC terminated its operations on March 23, 2004, see28 U. S. C. $ 596(b)(2), and transferred all records--including
the photographs that are the subject of Favish's FOIA re-quest--to the National Archives and Records Administration, see $ 594(k)(1). The National Archives and Records
Administration has been substituted as petitioner in the caption of this case. As all the actions relevant to our disposition of the case took place before March 23, 2004, we continue
to refer to petitioner as OIC in this opinion.

II
It is common ground among the parties that the deathscene photographs in OIC's possession are records or information "compiled for law enforcement purposes" as that
phrase is used in Exemption 7(C). App. 87. This leads to
the question whether disclosure of the four photographs
"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy."

Opinion of the Court
Favish contends the family has no personal privacy inter-est covered by Exemption 7(C). His argument rests on the

proposition that the information is only about the decedent,not his family. FOIA's right to personal privacy, in his view,
means only "the right to control information about oneself."Brief for Respondent Favish 4. He quotes from our decision
in Reporters Committee, where, in holding that a person has
a privacy interest sufficient to prevent disclosure of his ownrap sheet, we said "the common law and the literal understandings of privacy encompass the individual's control of in-formation concerning his or her person." 489 U. S., at 763.
This means, Favish says, that the individual who is the subject of the information is the only one with a privacy interest.

We disagree. The right to personal privacy is not confined, as Favish argues, to the "right to control information
about oneself." Brief for Respondent Favish 4. Favish
misreads the quoted sentence in Reporters Committee and
adopts too narrow an interpretation of the case's holding.
To say that the concept of personal privacy must "encompass" the individual's control of information about himself
does not mean it cannot encompass other personal privacy
interests as well. Reporters Committee had no occasion to
consider whether individuals whose personal data are not
contained in the requested materials also have a recognized
privacy interest under Exemption 7(C).

Reporters Committee explained, however, that the concept
of personal privacy under Exemption 7(C) is not some limited or "cramped notion" of that idea. 489 U. S., at 763.
Records or information are not to be released under FOIA
if disclosure "could reasonably be expected to constitute
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U. S. C.

$ 552(b)(7). This provision is in marked contrast to the language in Exemption 6, pertaining to "personnel and medical
files," where withholding is required only if disclosure
"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy." $ 552(b)(6). The adverb "clearly," found in Ex541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN
166 NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMIN. v. FAVISH

Opinion of the Court
emption 6, is not used in Exemption 7(C). In addition,"whereas Exemption 6 refers to disclosures that `would constitute' an invasion of privacy, Exemption 7(C) encompassesany disclosure that `could reasonably be expected to constitute' such an invasion." Reporters Committee, 489 U. S., at756. Exemption 7(C)'s comparative breadth is no mere accident in drafting. We know Congress gave special consideration to the language in Exemption 7(C) because it was theresult of specific amendments to an existing statute. See

id., at 756, n. 9, 777, n. 22.Law enforcement documents obtained by Government investigators often contain information about persons interviewed as witnesses or initial suspects but whose link to the
official inquiry may be the result of mere happenstance.
There is special reason, therefore, to give protection to this
intimate personal data, to which the public does not have a
general right of access in the ordinary course. Id., at 773.
In this class of cases where the subject of the documents "is
a private citizen," "the privacy interest . . . is at its apex."
Id., at 780.

Certain amici in support of Favish rely on the modifier
"personal" before the word "privacy" to bolster their view
that the family has no privacy interest in the pictures of

the decedent. This, too, misapprehends the family's position and the scope of protection the exemption provides.
The family does not invoke Exemption 7(C) on behalf of Vincent Foster in its capacity as his next friend for fear that
the pictures may reveal private information about Foster to
the detriment of his own posthumous reputation or some
other interest personal to him. If that were the case, a different set of considerations would control. Foster's relatives instead invoke their own right and interest to personal
privacy. They seek to be shielded by the exemption to secure their own refuge from a sensation-seeking culture for
their own peace of mind and tranquility, not for the sake of
the deceased.

Opinion of the Court
In a sworn declaration filed with the District Court, Fos-ter's sister, Sheila Foster Anthony, stated that the family had

been harassed by, and deluged with requests from, "[p]oliti-cal and commercial opportunists" who sought to profit from
Foster's suicide. App. 94. In particular, she was "horrifiedand devastated by [a] photograph [already] leaked to the
press." Ibid. "[E]very time I see it," Sheila Foster Anthony wrote, "I have nightmares and heart-pounding in-somnia as I visualize how he must have spent his last few

minutes and seconds of his life." Ibid. She opposed thedisclosure of the disputed pictures because "I fear that the
release of [additional] photographs certainly would set off
another round of intense scrutiny by the media. Undoubtedly, the photographs would be placed on the Internet for
world consumption. Once again my family would be the
focus of conceivably unsavory and distasteful media coverage." Id., at 95. "[R]eleasing any photographs," Sheila
Foster Anthony continued, "would constitute a painful unwarranted invasion of my privacy, my mother's privacy, my
sister's privacy, and the privacy of Lisa Foster Moody
(Vince's widow), her three children, and other members of
the Foster family." Id., at 93.

As we shall explain below, we think it proper to conclude
from Congress' use of the term "personal privacy" that it
intended to permit family members to assert their own privacy rights against public intrusions long deemed impermissible under the common law and in our cultural traditions.
This does not mean that the family is in the same position as
the individual who is the subject of the disclosure. We have
little difficulty, however, in finding in our case law and traditions the right of family members to direct and control disposition of the body of the deceased and to limit attempts to
exploit pictures of the deceased family member's remains for
public purposes.

Burial rites or their counterparts have been respected in
almost all civilizations from time immemorial. See gener541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

the very dawn of human culture and . . . in most parts of theworld"); 5 Encyclopedia of Religion 450 (1987) ("[F]uneral
rites . . . are the conscious cultural forms of one of our mostancient, universal, and unconscious impulses"). They are a
sign of the respect a society shows for the deceased and forthe surviving family members. The power of Sophocles'
story in Antigone maintains its hold to this day because ofthe universal acceptance of the heroine's right to insist on
respect for the body of her brother. See Antigone of Sopho-cles, 8 Harvard Classics: Nine Greek Dramas 255 (C. Eliot
ed. 1909). The outrage at seeing the bodies of Americansoldiers mutilated and dragged through the streets is but a
modern instance of the same understanding of the interestsdecent people have for those whom they have lost. Family
members have a personal stake in honoring and mourningtheir dead and objecting to unwarranted public exploitation
that, by intruding upon their own grief, tends to degrade therites and respect they seek to accord to the deceased person
who was once their own.In addition this well-established cultural tradition acknowledging a family's control over the body and death im-ages of the deceased has long been recognized at common
law. Indeed, this right to privacy has much deeper roots inthe common law than the rap sheets held to be protected
from disclosure in Reporters Committee. An early decisionby the New York Court of Appeals is typical:

"It is the right of privacy of the living which it is soughtto enforce here. That right may in some cases be itself
violated by improperly interfering with the character ormemory of a deceased relative, but it is the right of the
living, and not that of the dead, which is recognized. Aprivilege may be given the surviving relatives of a deceased person to protect his memory, but the privilegeexists for the benefit of the living, to protect their feel541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

We can assume Congress legislated against this background of law, scholarship, and history when it enacted
FOIA and when it amended Exemption 7(C) to extend its
terms. Those enactments were also against the background
of the Attorney General's consistent interpretation of the exemption to protect "members of the family of the person to
whom the information pertains," U. S. Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Memorandum on the Public Information
Section of the Administrative Procedure Act 36 (June 1967),

170 NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMIN. v. FAVISH

Opinion of the Court
We have observed that the statutory privacy right pro-tected by Exemption 7(C) goes beyond the common law and

the Constitution. See Reporters Committee, 489 U. S., at762, n. 13 (contrasting the scope of the privacy protection
under FOIA with the analogous protection under the com-mon law and the Constitution); see also

Marzen v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 825 F. 2d 1148, 1152 (CA7
1987) ("[T]he privacy interest protected under FOIA extendsbeyond the common law"). It would be anomalous to hold

in the instant case that the statute provides even less protec-tion than does the common law.

The statutory scheme must be understood, moreover, in
light of the consequences that would follow were we to adopt
Favish's position. As a general rule, withholding information under FOIA cannot be predicated on the identity of the
requester. See Reporters Committee, supra, at 771. We
are advised by the Government that child molesters, rapists,
murderers, and other violent criminals often make FOIA
requests for autopsies, photographs, and records of their
deceased victims. Our holding ensures that the privacy interests of surviving family members would allow the Government to deny these gruesome requests in appropriate
cases. We find it inconceivable that Congress could have
intended a definition of "personal privacy" so narrow that it
would allow convicted felons to obtain these materials without limitations at the expense of surviving family members'
personal privacy.

For these reasons, in agreement with the Courts of Appeals for both the District of Columbia and the Ninth Circuit,
see Accuracy in Media v. National Park Serv., 194 F. 3d 120
(CADC 1999); 217 F. 3d 1168 (CA9 2000), we hold that FOIA
recognizes surviving family members' right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative's death-scene images. Our holding is consistent with the unanimous view
of the Courts of Appeals and other lower courts that have
addressed the question. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v.

National Aeronautics and Space Admin., 782 F. Supp. 628,631, 632 (CADC 1991) (sustaining a privacy claim under the

narrower Exemption 6 with respect to an audiotape of theSpace Shuttle Challenger astronauts' last words, because
"[e]xposure to the voice of a beloved family member immedi-ately prior to that family member's death . . . would cause

"additional anguish" to the surviving family), aff 'd on othergrounds, 68 F. 3d 1438 (CADC 1995); Lesar v. Department of
Justice, 636 F. 2d 472, 487 (CADC 1980) (recognizing, withrespect to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
his survivors' privacy interests in avoiding "annoyance orharassment"). Neither the deceased's former status as a
public official, nor the fact that other pictures had been madepublic, detracts from the weighty privacy interests involved.

III
Our ruling that the personal privacy protected by Exemp-tion 7(C) extends to family members who object to the disclosure of graphic details surrounding their relative's deathdoes not end the case. Although this privacy interest is
within the terms of the exemption, the statute directs non-disclosure only where the information "could reasonably be
expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion" of the fami-ly's personal privacy. The term "unwarranted" requires us
to balance the family's privacy interest against the publicinterest in disclosure. See

Reporters Committee, 489 U. S.,at 762.

FOIA is often explained as a means for citizens to know" `what their Government is up to.' "

Id., at 773. This

541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
phrase should not be dismissed as a convenient formalism.It defines a structural necessity in a real democracy. The

statement confirms that, as a general rule, when documentsare within FOIA's disclosure provisions, citizens should not
be required to explain why they seek the information. Aperson requesting the information needs no preconceived
idea of the uses the data might serve. The information belongs to citizens to do with as they choose. Furthermore,as we have noted, the disclosure does not depend on the identity of the requester. As a general rule, if the informationis subject to disclosure, it belongs to all.

When disclosure touches upon certain areas defined in the
exemptions, however, the statute recognizes limitations that
compete with the general interest in disclosure, and that, in
appropriate cases, can overcome it. In the case of Exemption 7(C), the statute requires us to protect, in the proper
degree, the personal privacy of citizens against the uncontrolled release of information compiled through the power of
the State. The statutory direction that the information not
be released if the invasion of personal privacy could reasonably be expected to be unwarranted requires the courts to
balance the competing interests in privacy and disclosure.
To effect this balance and to give practical meaning to the
exemption, the usual rule that the citizen need not offer
a reason for requesting the information must be inapplicable.

Where the privacy concerns addressed by Exemption 7(C)
are present, the exemption requires the person requesting
the information to establish a sufficient reason for the disclosure. First, the citizen must show that the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest
more specific than having the information for its own sake.
Second, the citizen must show the information is likely to
advance that interest. Otherwise, the invasion of privacy
is unwarranted.

We do not in this single decision attempt to define the
reasons that will suffice, or the necessary nexus between the

541US1 Unit: $U35 [05-08-06 20:44:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

173Cite as: 541 U. S. 157 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
requested information and the asserted public interest thatwould be advanced by disclosure. On the other hand, there

must be some stability with respect to both the specific cate-gory of personal privacy interests protected by the statute
and the specific category of public interests that could out-weigh the privacy claim. Otherwise, courts will be left to
balance in an ad hoc manner with little or no real guidance.
Id., at 776. In the case of photographic images and otherdata pertaining to an individual who died under mysterious

circumstances, the justification most likely to satisfy Exemp-tion 7(C)'s public interest requirement is that the information
is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly
in the performance of their duties.

The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the family
has a privacy interest protected by the statute and to recognize as significant the asserted public interest in uncovering
deficiencies or misfeasance in the Government's investigations into Foster's death. It erred, however, in defining

the showing Favish must make to substantiate his public
interest claim. It stated that "[n]othing in the statutory
command conditions [disclosure] on the requesting party
showing that he has knowledge of misfeasance by the
agency" and that "[n]othing in the statutory command shields
an agency from disclosing its records because other agencies
have engaged in similar investigations." 217 F. 3d, at 1172-
1173. The court went on to hold that, because Favish has
"tender[ed] evidence and argument which, if believed, would
justify his doubts," the FOIA request "is in complete conformity with the statutory purpose that the public know
what its government is up to." Id., at 1173. This was insufficient. The Court of Appeals required no particular
showing that any evidence points with credibility to some
actual misfeasance or other impropriety. The court's holding leaves Exemption 7(C) with little force or content. By
requiring courts to engage in a state of suspended disbelief

174 NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMIN. v. FAVISH

Opinion of the Court
with regard to even the most incredible allegations, the paneltransformed Exemption 7(C) into nothing more than a rule

of pleading. The invasion of privacy under its rationalewould be extensive. It must be remembered that once
there is disclosure, the information belongs to the generalpublic. There is no mechanism under FOIA for a protective
order allowing only the requester to see whether the information bears out his theory, or for proscribing its generaldissemination.

We hold that, where there is a privacy interest protectedby Exemption 7(C) and the public interest being asserted is
to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order
to obtain disclosure. Rather, the requester must produce
evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person
that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred. In Department of State v. Ray, 502 U. S. 164 (1991),
we held there is a presumption of legitimacy accorded to the
Government's official conduct. Id., at 178-179. The presumption perhaps is less a rule of evidence than a general
working principle. However the rule is characterized,
where the presumption is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it. Cf. United States v. Armstrong,
517 U. S. 456, 464 (1996) (" `[I]n the absence of clear evidence
to the contrary, courts presume that [Government agents]
have properly discharged their official duties' "); United
States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926)
("The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of
public officers and, in the absence of clear evidence to the
contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged
their official duties"). Given FOIA's prodisclosure purpose,
however, the less stringent standard we adopt today is more
faithful to the statutory scheme. Only when the FOIA requester has produced evidence sufficient to satisfy this
standard will there exist a counterweight on the FOIA scale

175Cite as: 541 U. S. 157 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
for the court to balance against the cognizable privacy inter-ests in the requested records. Allegations of government

misconduct are " `easy to allege and hard to disprove,' "Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 585 (1998), so courts
must insist on a meaningful evidentiary showing. It wouldbe quite extraordinary to say we must ignore the fact that
five different inquiries into the Foster matter reached thesame conclusion. As we have noted, the balancing exercise
in some other case might require us to make a somewhatmore precise determination regarding the significance of the
public interest and the historical importance of the eventsin question. We might need to consider the nexus required
between the requested documents and the purported publicinterest served by disclosure. We need not do so here, however. Favish has not produced any evidence that wouldwarrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred to put the balanceinto play.

The Court of Appeals erred in its interpretation of Exemp-tion 7(C). The District Court's first order in March 1998--
before its decision was set aside by the Court of Appeals andsuperseded by the District Court's own order on remand--
followed the correct approach. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to grant OIC's motion for summary judgment withrespect to the four photographs in dispute.

It is so ordered.

BEDROC LIMITED, LLC, et al. v. UNITED STATES

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1593. Argued January 20, 2004--Decided March 31, 2004
The Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919 authorized the Secretary of

the Interior to designate certain "nonmineral" Nevada lands on which
settlers could obtain permits to drill for water. Under $ 8 of the Pittman Act, each land grant, or patent, reserved to the United States all
coal and other "valuable minerals" in the lands, and the right to remove
the same. When one of petitioners' predecessors-in-interest began extracting sand and gravel from land patented under the Pittman Act, the
Bureau of Land Management ruled that he had trespassed against the
Government's reserved interest in the property's "valuable minerals,"
and the Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed. Petitioner BedRoc
Limited, LLC, which subsequently acquired the property and continued
to remove the sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the
Department of the Interior, and petitioner Western Elite, Inc., filed a
quiet title action in Federal District Court. The court granted the Government summary judgment, holding that the contested sand and gravel
are "valuable minerals" reserved to the United States by the Pittman
Act. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
314 F. 3d 1080, reversed and remanded.

The Chief Justice, joined by Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Kennedy, concluded that sand and gravel are not "valuable minerals" reserved to the United States in land grants issued under
the Pittman Act. In construing the mineral reservation of the StockRaising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA)--which was identical to the
Pittman Act's except insofar as it reserved to the United States "all the
coal and other minerals," whereas the Pittman Act reserved "valuable
minerals"--this Court determined that neither the dictionary nor the
legal understanding of "minerals" prevailing in 1916 was conclusive, but
that the SRHA's purpose and history demonstrated that gravel was a
"mineral" reserved to the United States. Watt v. Western Nuclear,
Inc., 462 U. S. 36, 55-60. This Court will not extend that holding to
conclude that sand and gravel are "valuable minerals." The Western
Nuclear Court had no choice but to speculate about congressional intent
with respect to the scope of the amorphous term "minerals," but here

Syllabus
Congress has textually narrowed the term's scope by using the modifier
"valuable." The inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there
as the text is unambiguous. The proper inquiry in interpreting mineral
reservations focuses on the reservation's ordinary meaning when it was
enacted. Amoco Production Co. v. Southern Ute Tribe, 526 U. S. 865,
874. Because the Pittman Act applied only to Nevada, the ultimate
question is whether the State's sand and gravel were commonly regarded as "valuable minerals" in 1919. Common sense says no: They
were, and are, abundant throughout Nevada; they have no intrinsic
value; and they were commercially worthless in 1919. Thus, even if
they were regarded as minerals, no one would have mistaken them for
valuable minerals. The statutory context of the Pittman Act's mineral
reservation further confirms its ordinary meaning, as Congress explicitly cross-referenced the General Mining Act of 1872, and it is beyond
dispute that when the Pittman Act became law, common sand and gravel
could not constitute a locatable "valuable mineral deposit" under the
General Mining Act. Because the statutory reservation's text clearly
excludes sand and gravel, there is no occasion to resort to legislative
history here. Pp. 181-187.

Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that the
Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919's mineral reservation cannot
be meaningfully distinguished from the analogous provision in the
Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA), and that the mineral
reservations pursuant to both do not include sand and gravel. Emphasizing "valuable" in the Pittman Act ignores the fact that the Act uses
"valuable minerals" and "minerals" interchangeably. And it implies
that the Court erred in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36, not
by interpreting "minerals" too broadly to include sand and gravel, but
by interpreting "minerals" too narrowly by reading into the term a requirement that the minerals can be used for commercial purposes. If
"valuable" were the textual source of a commercial purpose requirement, then the SRHA's lack of that modifier would imply that the SRHA
contains no such requirement. Because the SRHA and the Pittman Act
should be construed similarly, the plurality's reasoning with respect to
the Pittman Act cannot be confined to that Act and naturally carries
over to the SRHA. If sand and gravel are not included within the
Pittman Act's mineral reservations because they were not considered
"valuable minerals" at the time the Act was passed, they, with respect
to SRHA lands, were not considered to be susceptible of commercial
use when Congress passed the SRHA. Although the Western Nuclear
Court incorrectly defined "minerals" to include sand and gravel, significant reliance interests would be upset if Western Nuclear were overruled. The Pittman Act, however, involves substantially less land than

Chief Justice Rehnquist announced the judgment ofthe Court and delivered an opinion, in which

The question here is whether sand and gravel are "valu-able minerals" reserved to the United States in land grants

issued under the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919(Pittman Act or Act), ch. 77, 41 Stat. 293. We hold they
are not.Beginning with the Homestead Act of 1862, ch. 75, 12 Stat.
392, and stretching into the early 20th century, Congressenacted a series of land-grant statutes aimed at settling the
American frontier. One of these was the Pittman Act.That Act sought to succeed where earlier homestead laws
had failed: promoting development and population growth inthe State of Nevada. H. R. Rep. No. 286, 66th Cong., 1st

Sess., 2 (1919).1 It was thought that Nevada's lack of sur-face water resources was hindering its agricultural progress.

Ibid. After rejecting various proposals to directly fund ex-ploration for underground water, Congress enacted the Pittman Act to encourage private citizens to prospect for waterin Nevada. Id., at 1.

Nevada lies in the heart of the Great Basin, that part ofthe United States lying roughly between the Sierra Nevada
Range on the west and the Wasatch and other mountainranges on the east. The western face of the Sierra Nevada
blocks rain-bearing winds off the Pacific Ocean from reaching
the Great Basin, forming a rain shadow over the entire re-gion. Nevada has, on the average, less precipitation than

any other State in the Union. This is one reason why mostof its rivers, instead of eventually flowing into the sea, disappear into "sinks." 5 The New Encyclopaedia Britannica 442(15th ed. 1985); Department of Agriculture Yearbook, Climate and Man 987-988 (1941) (cited in Nevada v. United
States, 463 U. S. 110, 114 (1983)).

The Pittman Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior
to designate certain "nonmineral" lands 2 in Nevada, onwhich settlers could obtain permits to drill for water.

$$ 1-2, 41 Stat. 293-294. Any settler who could demon-strate successful irrigation of at least 20 acres of crops was
eligible for a land grant, or patent, of up to 640 acres. $ 5,
id., at 294. Of central importance here, each patent issued
under the Act was required to contain "a reservation to theUnited States of all the coal and other valuable minerals in

the lands . . . , together with the right to prospect for, mine,and remove the same." $ 8,

id., at 295. By virtue of this

1 The population of Nevada in 1910 was only 81,875; by 1920, it had fallen
to 77,407. Less than 11% of Nevada's 112,000 square miles of land was
privately owned. H. R. Rep. No. 286, at 2.

reservation, the United States was free to dispose of the"coal and other valuable mineral deposits in such lands" in

accordance with "the provisions of the coal and mineral landlaws in force at the time of such disposal." Ibid.

The Pittman Act failed to significantly advance agricul-tural development in Nevada, S. Rep. No. 1282, 88th Cong.,
2d Sess., 1 (1964), and Congress repealed it in 1964, Pub.L. 88-417, 78 Stat. 389. The repealing legislation, however,
expressly reserved the rights of existing patentees. Ibid.Two such patentees, Newton and Mabel Butler, were the
predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners in this case. In1940, the Butlers obtained a patent for 560 acres of land in
Lincoln County, some 65 miles north of Las Vegas. As re-quired by the Act, the patent reserved the "coal and other
valuable minerals" to the United States. Common sand andgravel were plentiful and visible on the surface of the Butlers' land, but there was no commercial market for them dueto Nevada's sparse population and the land's remote location.
App. 10, 11.Earl Williams acquired the Butler property in 1993. By
that time, the expansion of Las Vegas had created a commer-cial market for the sand and gravel on the land. Shortly
after Williams began extracting the sand and gravel, how-ever, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) served him
with trespass notices pursuant to 43 CFR $ 9239.0-7 (1993)(providing that any unauthorized removal of "mineral materials" from public lands is "an act of trespass"). When Wil-liams challenged the notices, the BLM ruled that by removing sand and gravel Williams had trespassed against theGovernment's reserved interest in the "valuable minerals"
on the property. The Interior Board of Land Appeals af-firmed that decision.

Earl Williams, 140 I. B. L. A. 295(1997). Meanwhile, petitioner BedRoc Limited, LLC (BedRoc), acquired the Butler property from Williams in 1995.3

1999). The United States Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit affirmed, relying primarily on the legislative history
of the Pittman Act and our decision in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36 (1983). 314 F. 3d 1080 (2002). We
granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 986 (2003), and now reverse.

In Western Nuclear, supra, we construed the mineral
reservation in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916
(SRHA), 39 Stat. 862, 43 U. S. C. $ 291 et seq.--"the most
important . . . land-grant statut[e] enacted in the early
1900's." 462 U. S., at 47. Unlike the Pittman Act, the
SRHA was not limited to Nevada; it applied to any "public
lands" the Secretary of the Interior designated as " `stockraising lands.' " 43 U. S. C. $ 291 (1976 ed.) (repealed by
Pub. L. 94-579, 90 Stat. 2787). A person could obtain a patent under the SRHA if he resided on stockraising lands for
three years, $291, and "ma[de] permanent improvements
upon the land . . . tending to increase the value of the [land]
for stock-raising purposes," $ 293 (repealed by Pub. L. 94-
579, 90 Stat. 2787). The SRHA's mineral reservation was
identical to the Pittman Act's in every respect, save one:
Whereas the SRHA reserved to the United States "all the
coal and other minerals," $ 299 (2000 ed.), the Pittman Act
reserved "all the coal and other valuable minerals," $ 8, 41
Stat. 295 (emphasis added).

The question before us in Western Nuclear was "whether
gravel found on lands patented under the [SRHA] is a mineral reserved to the United States." 462 U. S., at 38. A

closely divided Court held that it is. Id., at 60. After de-termining that "neither the dictionary nor the legal understanding of the term `minerals' that prevailed in 1916 shedsmuch light on the question before us," we turned to the purpose and history of the SRHA. Id., at 46-47. We observedthat the SRHA, like other land-grant Acts containing mineral reservations, sought to "facilitate development of bothsurface and subsurface resources."

Id., at 49-52. Wetherefore reasoned that "the determination of whether a particular substance is included in the surface estate or the min-eral estate should be made in light of the use of the surface
estate that Congress contemplated." Id., at 52. Accord-ingly, we interpreted the SRHA's mineral reservation to include "substances that are mineral in character (i. e., that areinorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be
used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason tosuppose were intended to be included in the surface estate."
Id., at 53. Because we thought it unlikely that Congresswould have made the exploitation of gravel deposits dependent on farmers and ranchers "whose interests were knownto lie elsewhere," and because gravel met our other criteria,
we concluded that it is indeed a "mineral" reserved to theUnited States.

Id., at 55-60.4The Government argues that our rationale in Western Nuclear compels the outcome in this case, notwithstanding thePittman Act's seemingly narrower reservation of "valuable"
minerals. Petitioners, for their part, argue that Western

60-72 (Powell, J., joined by Rehnquist, Stevens, and O'Connor, JJ.,
dissenting). The dissenters pointed out that at the time the SRHA was
enacted the Department of the Interior "had ruled consistently that gravel
was not a mineral under the general mining laws." Id., at 62-67. Furthermore, the ultimate congressional purpose behind the SRHA was settling the West, not stockraising, the dissenters argued, and this purpose
would have been thwarted if potential settlers thought the Government
had reserved "commonplace substances that actually constitute much of
the soil." Id., at 71-72.

Nuclear should be distinguished on this ground or, in thealternative, overruled altogether. While we share the concerns expressed in the Western Nuclear dissent, see n. 4,supra, we decline to overrule our recent precedent. By the
same token, we will not extend Western Nuclear's holdingto conclude that sand and gravel are "valuable minerals."

Whatever the correctness of Western Nuclear's broad con-struction of the term "minerals," we are not free to so expansively interpret the Pittman Act's reservation. In Western
Nuclear, we had no choice but to speculate about congres-sional intent with respect to the scope of the amorphous

term "minerals." Here, by contrast, Congress has textuallynarrowed the scope of the term by using the modifier
"valuable." 5The preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires
us to "presume that [the] legislature says in a statute whatit means and means in a statute what it says there."

Thus, our inquiry begins with the statutory text, and endsthere as well if the text is unambiguous.

Western Nuclear dispositive because, according to him, "the Court's interpretation of the term `mineral' in the SRHA included the requirement that
the material be valuable." Post, at 190-191 (dissenting opinion). That is
not quite correct. Western Nuclear defined "minerals," in part, as substances "that can be used for commercial purposes" and that "have separate value" from the soil. 462 U. S., at 53-54. However, as the remainder of our opinion explains, the minimal inquiry into whether a substance
might at some point have separate value from the soil and might, in the
abstract, be susceptible of commercial use is a far different inquiry from
whether the substance is a "valuable mineral" as Congress used the term
in 1919.

to include sand and gravel in the Pittman Act's mineralreservation.

"In interpreting statutory mineral reservations like theone at issue here, we have emphasized that Congress `was
dealing with a practical subject in a practical way' and thatit intended the terms of the reservation to be understood in
`their ordinary and popular sense.' " Amoco Production Co.v.

Southern Ute Tribe, 526 U. S. 865, 873 (1999) (quotingBurke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 234 U. S. 669, 679 (1914)).

Importantly, the proper inquiry focuses on the ordinarymeaning of the reservation at the time Congress enacted it.
Amoco Production Co., supra, at 874; Leo Sheep Co. v.United States, 440 U. S. 668, 682 (1979) (land-grant statutes
should be interpreted in light of "the condition of the countrywhen the acts were passed" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)("[U]nless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as
taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning" atthe time Congress enacted the statute). Because the Pittman Act applied only to Nevada, the ultimate question iswhether the sand and gravel found in Nevada were commonly regarded as "valuable minerals" in 1919.Common sense tells us, and the Government does not contest, that the answer to that question is an emphatic "No."Sand and gravel were, and are, abundant throughout Nevada; they have no intrinsic value; and they were commer-cially worthless in 1919 due to Nevada's sparse population
and lack of development.6 Thus, even if Nevada's sand andgravel were regarded as minerals, no one would have mistaken them for valuable minerals. The Government arguesonly that sand and gravel were commercially marketable in
other parts of the United States during World War I andthat there is now a market for sand and gravel in some parts
of Nevada. As we have explained, this evidence is simply

irrelevant to the proper inquiry into the meaning of the stat-utory mineral reservation. Cf.

Amoco Production Co., 526
U. S., at 873-880 (relying on the popular meaning of "coal"in 1909 and 1910 to hold that a reservation of "coal" does not

include coalbed methane gas). Because we readily concludethat the "most natural interpretation" of the mineral reservation does not encompass sand and gravel, we "need not
consider the applicability of the canon that ambiguities inland grants are construed in favor of the sovereign."

Id.,
at 880.The statutory context of the Pittman Act's mineral reservation further confirms its ordinary meaning. The sentence
directly following the reservation provides that the reserved
"valuable mineral deposits . . . shall be subject to disposal by
the United States in accordance with the provisions of the
. . . mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal."

$ 8, 41 Stat. 295. Here, Congress was explicitly crossreferencing the General Mining Act of 1872, currently codified at Rev. Stat. $ 2319, 30 U. S. C. $ 22. Then, as now, the
General Mining Act provided that "all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States . . . shall be
free and open to exploration and purchase . . . under regulations prescribed by law." Ibid. We can therefore infer that
the reserved "valuable minerals" in Pittman Act lands were
the same class of minerals that could be located and disposed
of under the General Mining Act. Cf. Western Nuclear, 462
U. S., at 59 (drawing same inference from nearly identical
mineral reservation).

It is beyond dispute that when the Pittman Act became
law in 1919, common sand and gravel could not constitute a
locatable "valuable mineral deposit" under the General Mining Act. The Secretary of the Interior had held as much in
Zimmerman v. Brunson, 39 L. D. 310 (1910), see Western
Nuclear, supra, at 45 (discussing Zimmerman); 462 U. S., at
63-65 (Powell, J., dissenting) (same), and this remained the
Department's position until 1929, when it overruled Zimmer541US1 Unit: $U36 [05-08-06 20:46:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

man in Layman v. Ellis, 52 L. D. 714, see, e. g., WesternNuclear, supra, at 65-69 (Powell, J

., dissenting); Robert L.
Beery, 83 I. D. 249, 253 (1976) ("Prior to 1929 sand and gravelwere not considered locatable under the general mining

law").7 Thus, in the unlikely event that some ambitiousprospector had sought a patent from the United States in
1919 to extract sand and gravel from Pittman Act lands, theSecretary of the Interior would have flatly refused him.

The Government is correct that the Western NuclearCourt sidestepped the impact of this line of reasoning by
relying on the ambiguity of the term "minerals" and the pos-sibility that Congress was not aware of Interior's

Zimmer-man decision, see 462 U. S., at 45-47. But we decline to

extend that approach beyond the SRHA. In our analysis,the statutory structure of the Pittman Act convincingly reinforces the unambiguous meaning of the term "valuableminerals."

Notwithstanding the contemporaneous plain meaning ofthe Pittman Act's mineral reservation, the Government argues that the Act's legislative history counsels us to give"valuable minerals" precisely the same meaning we ascribed
to "minerals" in Western Nuclear. Because we have heldthat the text of the statutory reservation clearly excludes
sand and gravel, we have no occasion to resort to legislativehistory. See,

e. g., Lamie, 540 U. S., at 534, 536; HartfordUnderwriters, 530 U. S., at 6; Hughes Aircraft Co., 525 U. S.,

at 438; Connecticut Nat. Bank, 503 U. S., at 254. Havingdeclined to extend Western Nuclear's rationale to a statute
where the plain meaning will not support it, we will notallow it in through the back door by presuming that "the
legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for

It is so ordered.

I agree with Justice Stevens that the mineral reservation provision in the Pittman Underground Water Act of
1919 (Pittman Act or Act) cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the analogous provision in the Stock-Raising
Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA). As Justice Stevens
points out, the term "minerals" in the Pittman Act provision
is only twice modified by the adjective "valuable," which
"suggest[s] that the terms `valuable minerals' and `minerals'
were intended to be synonymous." Post, at 191 (dissenting

8 While Justice Stevens does not contest the plain meaning of the
Pittman Act's mineral reservation, he nonetheless takes us to task for
"refusing to examine" the legislative history proffered by the Government
and thereby engaging in a "deliberately uninformed" and "unconstrained"
method of statutory interpretation. Post, at 190-192. Of course, accepting Justice Stevens' approach would require a radical abandonment of
our longstanding precedents that permit resort to legislative history only
when necessary to interpret ambiguous statutory text. Chief Justice
Marshall in 1805 stated the principle that definitively resolves this case
nearly 200 years later: "Where a law is plain and unambiguous, whether
it be expressed in general or limited terms, the legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly expressed, and consequently no
room is left for construction." United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358,
399. We thus cannot accept Justice Stevens' invitation to presume that
Congress expressed itself in a single House Committee Report rather than
in the unambiguous statutory text approved by both Houses and signed
by the President. We fail to see, moreover, how a court exercises unconstrained discretion when it carries out its "sole function" with respect to
an unambiguous statute, namely, to "enforce it according to its terms."

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
opinion). I concur in the judgment, however, because I believe that mineral reservations pursuant to both the Pittman
Act and the SRHA do not include sand and gravel.

To reach its result without reconsidering Watt v. Western
Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36 (1983), the plurality relies heavily
on the Pittman Act's use of the term "valuable minerals,"
contrasting this with the SRHA's use of the term "minerals."
This difference, the plurality holds, makes the scope of the
Pittman Act's mineral reservation provision both more clear
and more narrow than that of the SRHA. See ante, at 183.
Placing so much emphasis on the modifier "valuable" in the
Pittman Act, however, ignores the fact that the Act uses the
terms "valuable minerals" and "minerals" interchangeably.
It also implies that the Court erred in Western Nuclear, not
by interpreting the term "minerals" too broadly to include
sand and gravel (as the plurality suggests here, see ante, at
183), but by interpreting "minerals" too narrowly by reading
into the term a requirement that the minerals can be used
for commercial purposes.* If the word "valuable" were the
textual source of a commercial purpose requirement, then
the SRHA's lack of that modifier would strongly imply that
the SRHA contains no commercial purpose requirement.
Because the Court in Western Nuclear properly interpreted
the term "minerals" to contain a commercial purpose requirement, I would not put so much emphasis on the modifier "valuable."

I disagree, however, with the Court's conclusion in Western Nuclear that sand and gravel are "minerals" under the

*Indeed, the Court in Western Nuclear at times suggested an even narrower definition of "mineral," stating that "Congress plainly contemplated
that mineral deposits on SRHA lands would be subject to location under
the mining laws." 462 U. S., at 51. Those laws allowed individuals "to
locate claims to federal land containing `valuable mineral deposits.' " Id.,
at 50-51 (emphasis added). Hence, even minerals indisputably considered
"valuable" might fall outside a mineral reservation under the SRHA if the
deposit itself was not substantial enough to be "valuable."

Stevens, J., dissenting
SRHA merely because, hypothetically, at the time of the pas-sage of the SRHA, they

could have been used for commercial
purposes, 462 U. S., at 55. Because the SRHA and the Pitt-man Act should be construed similarly, the plurality's reasoning with respect to the Pittman Act cannot be confined tothat Act and naturally carries over to the SRHA. As the
plurality points out, both common sense and the "statutory
context" of the Pittman Act's enactment confirm the viewthat sand and gravel are not included within the Pittman

Act's mineral reservations, since sand and gravel were notunderstood to be "valuable minerals" at the time of the passage of the Act. See ante, at 184-185. Likewise, sand andgravel, with respect to SRHA lands, were not considered to
be susceptible of commercial use at the time Congress passed
the SRHA.

Although the Court in Western Nuclear incorrectly applied its definition of "minerals" to include sand and gravel,
the Court is typically reluctant to overrule decisions involving statute interpretation because "stare decisis concerns
are at their acme in cases involving property and contract
rights." State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997). Because the Government identifies significant reliance interests
that would be upset by overruling Western Nuclear, I do
not advocate doing so. The Pittman Act, however, involves
substantially less land than the SRHA, and the Government
does not identify any significant reliance interests that would
be unsettled by our failing to extend Western Nuclear's reasoning. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and decline to extend Western Nuclear's
faulty reasoning beyond the SRHA.

forage crops" and "not susceptible of irrigation from any
known source of water supply." 43 U. S. C. $ 292 (1976 ed.).
Congress included in the statute "a reservation to the United
States of all the coal and other minerals in the lands . . .
entered and patented" under the Act. 43 U. S. C. $ 299 (2000
ed.). Two decades ago, in a closely divided decision, we held
that gravel found on lands patented under the Act is a mineral reserved to the United States. Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36, 55 (1983).

The Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919 (Pittman
Act), 41 Stat. 293, enacted just three years after the SRHA,
was designed to encourage the reclamation of lands in the
State of Nevada that were "not known to be susceptible of
successful irrigation at a reasonable cost from any known
source of water supply." H. R. Rep. No. 286, 66th Cong., 1st
Sess., 1 (1919). Today the Court decides that the reservation of minerals in $ 8 of the Pittman Act does not include
gravel. I think it highly unlikely that Congress would reserve its ownership of sand and gravel in the millions of
acres of land in the West that were covered by the SRHA
and not do so for the land in Nevada covered by the Pittman
Act. Indeed, the House Committee Report describing the
scope of the mineral reservation in $ 8 of the Pittman Act
plainly states: "Section 8 of the bill contains the same reservations of minerals, with the facility for prospecting for and
developing and mining such minerals as was provided in the
[SRHA]." Ibid. A clearer expression of Congress' intent
would be hard to find.

The plurality opinion rests entirely on the textual difference between the SRHA's reservation of " `all the coal and
other minerals' " and the Pittman Act's reservation of " `all
the coal and other valuable minerals.' " Ante, at 181. But
that holding ignores the fact that in Western Nuclear the
Court's interpretation of the term "mineral" in the SRHA

Stevens, J., dissenting
included the requirement that the material be valuable.*
Moreover, the term "mineral" or "minerals" appears eight
times in $ 8 of the Pittman Act, and only twice is it modified
by the adjective "valuable," strongly suggesting that the
terms "valuable minerals" and "minerals" were intended to
be synonymous. Thus, the text of $ 8 and its legislative history, as well as both the reasoning and the result in Western
Nuclear, all support the conclusion that Congress intended
the mineral reservation in these two statutes to be the same.
The single word "valuable," in short, cannot support the
weight The Chief Justice places on it.

As a matter of public policy, there is no reason why Congress would enact a broader reservation in either statute.
The policy of including sand and gravel in the reservation
may well be unwise, and, indeed, the majority in Western
Nuclear may have misinterpreted Congress' intent in 1916.

*"Given Congress' understanding that the surface of SRHA lands would
be used for ranching and farming, we interpret the mineral reservation in
the Act to include substances that are mineral in character (i. e., that are
inorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be
included in the surface estate. See 1 American Law of Mining $ 3.26
[(1982)] (`A reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the
surface all mineral substances which can be taken from the soil and which
have a separate value'). Cf. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, 188
U. S. [526, 536-537 (1903)] (`mineral lands include not merely metalliferous
lands, but all such as are chiefly valuable for their deposits of a mineral
character, which are useful in the arts or valuable for purposes of manufacture'); United States v. Isbell Construction Co., [78 I. D. 385, 390 (1971)]
(`the reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the surface all mineral substances which can be taken from the soil and have a
separate value') (emphasis in original). This interpretation of the mineral
reservation best serves the congressional purpose of encouraging the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources, for ranching and farming do not ordinarily entail the extraction of mineral substances that can be taken from the soil and that have separate value."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Neither of those possibilities, however, provides an adequatejustification for substituting the plurality's appraisal today of

Congress' judgment for the view that prevailed in a decisionthat has been settled law for two decades. This conclusion
is fortified by the well-recognized "need for certainty andpredictability where land titles are concerned." Leo Sheep
Co. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 687 (1979).In refusing to examine the legislative history that provides
a clear answer to the question whether Congress intendedthe scope of the mineral reservations in these two statutes
to be identical, the plurality abandons one of the most val-uable tools of judicial decisionmaking. As Justice Aharon
Barak of the Israel Supreme Court perceptively has ex-plained, the "minimalist" judge "who holds that the purpose
of the statute may be learned only from its language" retainsgreater discretion than the judge who "will seek guidance
from every reliable source." Judicial Discretion 62 (Y. Kauf-mann transl. 1989). A method of statutory interpretation
that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, in-creases the risk that the judge's own policy preferences will
affect the decisional process. The policy choice at issue inthis case is surely one that should be made either by Congress itself or by the executive agency administering thePittman Act. Congress' acceptance of the holding in Western Nuclear for the past two decades should control our deci-sion, and any residual doubt should be eliminated by the deference owed to the executive agency that has consistentlyconstrued the mineral reservations in land-grant statutes as
including sand and gravel. See 462 U. S., at 56-57 (citingrulings of the Department of the Interior).

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

193OCTOBER TERM, 2003
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. LARA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 03-107. Argued January 21, 2004--Decided April 19, 2004
After respondent Lara, an Indian who is not a member of the Spirit Lake

Tribe (Tribe), ignored the Tribe's order excluding him from its reservation, he struck one of the federal officers arresting him. He pleaded
guilty in Tribal Court to the crime of violence to a policeman. The
Federal Government then charged him with the federal crime of assaulting a federal officer. Lara claimed that, because key elements of that
crime mirrored elements of his tribal crime, he was protected by the
Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government countered that the Clause
does not bar successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns, and that
this "dual sovereignty" doctrine determined the outcome. The Government noted that this Court has held that a tribe acts as a separate
sovereign in prosecuting its own members, United States v. Wheeler,
435 U. S. 313, 318, 322-323; that, after this Court ruled that a tribe
lacks sovereign authority to prosecute nonmember Indians, see Duro v.
Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 679, Congress specifically authorized such prosecutions; and that, because this statute enlarges the tribes' self-government
powers to include "the inherent power of Indian tribes . . . to exercise
criminal jurisdiction over all Indians," 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2), the Tribe
here had exercised its own tribal authority, not delegated federal
authority. Accepting this argument, the Magistrate Judge rejected
Lara's double jeopardy claim. The en banc Eighth Circuit reversed,
holding that the "dual sovereignty" doctrine did not apply because the
Tribal Court was exercising a federal prosecutorial power, and, thus,
the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second prosecution.

Held: Because the Tribe acted in its capacity as a sovereign authority, the

Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal Government from
proceeding with the present prosecution for a discrete federal offense.
Pp. 199-210.

(a) Congress has the constitutional power to lift the restrictions on
the tribes' criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians. Pp. 199-207.

(1) Section 1301(2) "recognize[s] and affirm[s]" in each tribe the "inherent power" to prosecute nonmember Indians, and its legislative history confirms that such was Congress' intent. Thus, it seeks to adjust
the tribes' status, relaxing restrictions, recognized in Duro, that the

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
194 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Syllabus
political branches had imposed on the tribes' exercise of inherent prosecutorial power. Pp. 199-200.

(2) Several considerations lead to the conclusion that Congress has
the constitutional power to lift these restrictions. First, the Constitution, through the Indian Commerce and Treaty Clauses, grants Congress "plenary and exclusive" powers to legislate in respect to Indian
tribes. E. g., Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima
Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 470-471. Second, Congress, with this Court's
approval, has interpreted these plenary grants of power as authorizing
it to enact legislation that both restricts tribal powers and, in turn,
relaxes those restrictions. Third, Congress' statutory goal--to modify
the degree of autonomy enjoyed by a dependent sovereign that is not a
State--is not an unusual legislative objective. Fourth, Lara points to
no explicit language in the Constitution suggesting a limitation on Congress' institutional authority to relax tribal sovereignty restrictions previously imposed by the political branches. Fifth, the change at issue is
limited, concerning a power similar to the power to prosecute a tribe's
own members, which this Court has called inherent. Sixth, concluding
that Congress has the power to relax the restrictions imposed by the
political branches on the tribes' inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent with this Court's earlier cases. The holdings in Wheeler, supra,
at 326; Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, 209-210; and Duro,
supra, at 686, that the tribes' power to prosecute nonmembers was divested by treaties and Congress, reflected the Court's view of the tribes'
retained sovereign status at the time of those decisions; but they did
not set forth constitutional limits prohibiting Congress from taking actions to modify or adjust that status. The Court there based its descriptions of inherent tribal authority on the sources as they existed at
the time. Congressional legislation was one such important source, but
it is a source subject to change. When Duro, supra, at 686, like other
cases, referred to a statute that "delegated" power to the tribes, it simply did not consider whether a statute could constitutionally achieve the
same end by removing restrictions on the tribes' inherent authority.
Thus, none of those cases can be read to hold that the Constitution
forbids Congress to change judicially made federal Indian law through
an amendment to $ 1301(2). Wheeler, Oliphant, and Duro, then, are not
determinative because Congress has enacted a new statute, relaxing
restrictions on the bounds of the inherent tribal authority the United
States recognizes. Pp. 200-207.

(b) Lara's additional arguments cannot help him win his double jeopardy claim. This Court will not consider the merits of his due process
claim that his prosecution was invalid because the Indian Civil Rights
Act of 1968 does not guarantee counsel to an indigent criminal defend541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
ant. Proving that claim does not show that the source of the tribal
prosecution was federal power, something Lara must do to win his double jeopardy claim. Like the due process claim, Lara's argument that
the phrase "all Indians" in "inherent power . . . to exercise criminal
jurisdiction over all Indians" violates the Equal Protection Clause is
beside the point. And Lara simply repeats these due process and equal
protection arguments in a different form when he argues that the Duro
Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, such as an
indigent defendant's right to counsel, an important reason for concluding
that tribes lacked the "inherent power" to try nonmember Indians.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns a congressional statute "recogniz[ing]and affirm[ing]" the "inherent" authority of a tribe to bring

a criminal misdemeanor prosecution against an Indian whois not a member of that tribe--authority that this Court previously held a tribe did not possess. Compare 25 U. S. C.$ 1301(2) with

Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676 (1990). We mustdecide whether Congress has the constitutional power to

relax restrictions that the political branches have, over time,placed on the exercise of a tribe's inherent legal authority.
We conclude that Congress does possess this power.

I
Respondent Billy Jo Lara is an enrolled member of theTurtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in north-central

North Dakota. He married a member of a different tribe,the Spirit Lake Tribe, and lived with his wife and children
on the Spirit Lake Reservation, also located in North Da-kota. See Brief for Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae 4-5. After several incidents ofserious misconduct, the Spirit Lake Tribe issued an order
excluding him from the reservation. Lara ignored theorder; federal officers stopped him; and he struck one of the
arresting officers. 324 F. 3d 635, 636 (CA8 2003) (en banc).The Spirit Lake Tribe subsequently prosecuted Lara in
the Spirit Lake Tribal Court for "violence to a policeman."

Opinion of the Court
After Lara's tribal conviction, the Federal Governmentcharged Lara in the Federal District Court for the District

of North Dakota with the federal crime of assaulting a fed-eral officer. 324 F. 3d, at 636; 18 U. S. C. $ 111(a)(1). Key
elements of this federal crime mirror elements of the tribalcrime of "violence to a policeman." See Brief for United
States 7. And this similarity between the two crimes would
ordinarily have brought Lara within the protective reachof the Double Jeopardy Clause. U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (the

Government may not "subject" any person "for the same of-fence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb"); 324 F. 3d,
at 636. But the Government, responding to Lara's claim
of double jeopardy, pointed out that the Double Jeopardy
Clause does not bar successive prosecutions brought by separate sovereigns, and it argued that this "dual sovereignty"
doctrine determined the outcome here. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88 (1985) (the Double Jeopardy Clause
reflects the "common-law conception of crime as an offense
against the sovereignty of the government"; when "a defendant in a single act violates the `peace and dignity' of two
sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed
two distinct `offences' ").

The Government noted that this Court has held that an
Indian tribe acts as a separate sovereign when it prosecutes
its own members. United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,
318, 322-323 (1978) (a tribe's "sovereign power to punish
tribal offenders," while subject to congressional "defeasance," remains among those " `inherent powers of a limited
sovereignty which has never been extinguished' " (emphasis added and deleted)). The Government recognized, of
course, that Lara is not one of the Spirit Lake Tribe's own
members; it also recognized that, in Duro v. Reina, supra,
this Court had held that a tribe no longer possessed inherent
or sovereign authority to prosecute a "nonmember Indian."
Id., at 682. But it pointed out that, soon after this Court
decided Duro, Congress enacted new legislation specifically

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
198 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Opinion of the Court
authorizing a tribe to prosecute Indian members of a differ-ent tribe. See Act of Nov. 5, 1990, $$ 8077(b)-(d), 104 Stat.

1892-1893 (temporary legislation until September 30, 1991);Act of Oct. 28, 1991, 105 Stat. 646 (permanent legislation).
That new statute, in permitting a tribe to bring certaintribal prosecutions against nonmember Indians, does not
purport to delegate the Federal Government's own federal
power. Rather, it enlarges the tribes' own " `powers of self-government' " to include "the inherent power of Indian

tribes, hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise criminaljurisdiction over

all Indians," including nonmembers. 25
U. S. C. $ 1301(2) (emphasis added).

In the Government's view, given this statute, the Tribe,
in prosecuting Lara, had exercised its own inherent tribal
authority, not delegated federal authority; hence the "dual
sovereignty" doctrine applies, Heath, supra, at 88; and since
the two prosecutions were brought by two different sovereigns, the second, federal, prosecution does not violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause.

The Federal Magistrate Judge accepted the Government's
argument and rejected Lara's double jeopardy claim. 324
F. 3d, at 636-637. An Eighth Circuit panel agreed with the
Magistrate Judge. 294 F. 3d 1004 (2002). But the en banc
Court of Appeals, by a vote of 7 to 4, reached a different
conclusion. 324 F. 3d 635 (2003). It held the Tribal Court,
in prosecuting Lara, was exercising a federal prosecutorial
power; hence the "dual sovereignty" doctrine does not apply;
and the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the second prosecution.
Id., at 640. The four dissenting judges, agreeing with the
Federal Government, concluded that the Tribal Court had
exercised inherent tribal power in prosecuting Lara; hence
the "dual sovereignty" doctrine applies and allows the second, federal, prosecution. Id., at 641 (opinion of M. Arnold,
J.).

Because the Eighth Circuit and Ninth Circuit have
reached different conclusions about the new statute, we

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

granted certiorari. Cf. United States v. Enas, 255 F. 3d 662
(CA9 2001) (en banc), cert. denied, 534 U. S. 1115 (2002). We
now reverse the Eighth Circuit.

II
We assume, as do the parties, that Lara's double jeopardy
claim turns on the answer to the "dual sovereignty" question. What is "the source of [the] power to punish" nonmember Indian offenders, "inherent tribal sovereignty" or
delegated federal authority? Wheeler, supra, at 322 (emphasis added).

We also believe that Congress intended the former answer.
The statute says that it "recognize[s] and affirm[s]" in each
tribe the "inherent" tribal power (not delegated federal
power) to prosecute nonmember Indians for misdemeanors.
See supra, at 198; Appendix, infra (emphasis added). And
the statute's legislative history confirms that such was Congress' intent. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-261,
pp. 3-4 (1991) ("The Committee of the Conference notes that
. . . this legislation is not a delegation of this jurisdiction but
a clarification of the status of tribes as domestic dependent
nations"); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 102-61, p. 7 (1991); see also
S. Rep. No. 102-168, p. 4 (1991) ("recogniz[ing] and reaffirm[ing] the inherent authority of tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians"); 137 Cong. Rec.
9446 (1991) (remarks of Sen. Inouye) (the "premise [of the
legislation] is that the Congress affirms the inherent jurisdiction of tribal governments over nonmember Indians" (emphasis added)); id., at 10712-10714 (remarks of Rep. Miller,
House manager of the bill) (the statute "is not a delegation
of authority but an affirmation that tribes retain all rights
not expressly taken away" and the bill "recognizes an inherent tribal right which always existed"); id., at 10713 (remarks of Rep. Richardson, a sponsor of the amendment) (the
legislation "reaffirms" tribes' power).

200 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Opinion of the Court
Thus the statute seeks to adjust the tribes' status. It relaxes the restrictions, recognized in Duro, that the political
branches had imposed on the tribes' exercise of inherent
prosecutorial power. The question before us is whether the
Constitution authorizes Congress to do so. Several considerations lead us to the conclusion that Congress does possess
the constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes'
criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians as the statute
seeks to do.

First, the Constitution grants Congress broad general
powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers that
we have consistently described as "plenary and exclusive."
E. g., Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 470-471 (1979); Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U. S. 99, 103 (1993); see Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 323;
see also W. Canby, American Indian Law 2 (3d ed. 1998)
(hereinafter Canby) ("[T]he independence of the tribes is
subject to exceptionally great powers of Congress to regulate and modify the status of the tribes").

This Court has traditionally identified the Indian Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, and the Treaty
Clause, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2, as sources of that power. E. g.,
Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 552 (1974); McClanahan
v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, 172, n. 7 (1973); see
also Canby 11-12; F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian
Law 209-210 (1982 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen) (also mentioning,
inter alia, the Property Clause). The "central function of
the Indian Commerce Clause," we have said, "is to provide
Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs." Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490
U. S. 163, 192 (1989); see also, e. g., Ramah Navajo School
Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 458 U. S. 832, 837
(1982) ("broad power" under the Indian Commerce Clause);
White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142
(1980) (same, and citing Wheeler, supra, at 322-323).

201Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
The treaty power does not literally authorize Congress toact legislatively, for it is an Article II power authorizing the

President, not Congress, "to make Treaties." U. S. Const.,Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2. But, as Justice Holmes pointed out, treaties made pursuant to that power can authorize Congress todeal with "matters" with which otherwise "Congress could
not deal." Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 433 (1920);
see also L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the U. S. Constitu-tion 72 (2d ed. 1996). And for much of the Nation's history,

treaties, and legislation made pursuant to those treaties, gov-erned relations between the Federal Government and the
Indian tribes. See, e. g., Cohen 109-111; F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years 44-49 (1962).

We recognize that in 1871 Congress ended the practice of
entering into treaties with the Indian tribes. 25 U. S. C. $ 71
(stating that tribes are not entities "with whom the United
States may contract by treaty"). But the statute saved existing treaties from being "invalidated or impaired," ibid.,
and this Court has explicitly stated that the statute "in no
way affected Congress' plenary powers to legislate on problems of Indians," Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194, 203
(1975) (emphasis deleted).

Moreover, "at least during the first century of America's
national existence . . . Indian affairs were more an aspect
of military and foreign policy than a subject of domestic or
municipal law." Cohen 208 (footnotes omitted). Insofar as
that is so, Congress' legislative authority would rest in part,
not upon "affirmative grants of the Constitution," but upon
the Constitution's adoption of preconstitutional powers necessarily inherent in any Federal Government, namely, powers that this Court has described as "necessary concomitants
of nationality." United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 315-322 (1936); Henkin, supra, at 14-22,
63-72; cf. 2 J. Continental Cong. 174-175 (1775) (W. Ford ed.
1905) (creating departments of Indian affairs, appointing Indian commissioners, and noting the great importance of "se541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
curing and preserving the friendship of the Indian Nations");
Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 557 (1832) ("The treaties
and laws of the United States contemplate . . . that all inter-course with [Indians] shall be carried on exclusively by the

government of the union").Second, Congress, with this Court's approval, has interpreted the Constitution's "plenary" grants of power as authorizing it to enact legislation that both restricts and, inturn, relaxes those restrictions on tribal sovereign authority.

From the Nation's beginning Congress' need for such legisla-tive power would have seemed obvious. After all, the Government's Indian policies, applicable to numerous tribes with
diverse cultures, affecting billions of acres of land, of necessity would fluctuate dramatically as the needs of the Nation
and those of the tribes changed over time. See, e. g., Cohen
48. And Congress has in fact authorized at different times
very different Indian policies (some with beneficial results
but many with tragic consequences). Congressional policy,
for example, initially favored "Indian removal," then "assimilation" and the breakup of tribal lands, then protection of the
tribal land base (interrupted by a movement toward greater
state involvement and "termination" of recognized tribes);
and it now seeks greater tribal autonomy within the framework of a "government-to-government relationship" with
federal agencies. 59 Fed. Reg. 22951 (1994); see also 19
Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 98 (1983) (President Reagan reaffirming the rejection of termination as a policy and announcing the goal of decreasing tribal dependence on the
Federal Government); see 25 U. S. C. $ 450a(b) (congressional
commitment to "the development of strong and stable tribal
governments"). See generally Cohen 78-202 (describing
this history); Canby 13-32 (same).

Such major policy changes inevitably involve major
changes in the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty. The
1871 statute, for example, changed the status of an Indian
tribe from a "powe[r] . . . capable of making treaties" to a

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

203Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
"power with whom the United States may [not] contractby treaty." Compare

Worcester, supra, at 559, with 25
U. S. C. $ 71.One can readily find examples in congressional decisions to

recognize, or to terminate, the existence of individual tribes.See

United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419 (1866) ("If by
[the political branches] those Indians are recognized as a
tribe, this court must do the same"); Menominee Tribe v.
United States, 391 U. S. 404 (1968) (examining the rights of
Menominee Indians following the termination of their Tribe).Indeed, Congress has restored previously extinguished

tribal status--by re-recognizing a Tribe whose tribal existence it previously had terminated. 25 U. S. C. $$ 903-903f
(restoring the Menominee Tribe); cf. United States v. Long,
324 F. 3d 475 (CA7) (upholding against double jeopardy challenge successive prosecutions by the restored Menominee
Tribe and the Federal Government), cert. denied, 540 U. S.
822 (2003). Congress has advanced policies of integration
by conferring United States citizenship upon all Indians. 8
U. S. C. $ 1401(b). Congress has also granted tribes greater
autonomy in their inherent law enforcement authority (in respect to tribal members) by increasing the maximum criminal penalties tribal courts may impose. $ 4217, 100 Stat.
3207-146, codified at 25 U. S. C. $ 1302(7) (raising the maximum from "a term of six months and a fine of $500" to
"a term of one year and a fine of $5,000").

Third, Congress' statutory goal--to modify the degree of
autonomy enjoyed by a dependent sovereign that is not a
State--is not an unusual legislative objective. The political
branches, drawing upon analogous constitutional authority,
have made adjustments to the autonomous status of other
such dependent entities--sometimes making far more radical
adjustments than those at issue here. See, e. g., Hawaii--
Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197, 209-211 (1903) (describing
annexation of Hawaii by joint resolution of Congress and the
maintenance of a "Republic of Hawaii" until formal incorpo541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ration by Congress); Northern Mariana Islands--note fol-lowing 48 U. S. C. $ 1801 ("in accordance with the [United

Nations] trusteeship agreement . . . [establishing] a self-governing commonwealth . . . in political union with and
under the sovereignty of the United States"); the Philip-pines--22 U. S. C. $ 1394 (congressional authorization for the
President to "withdraw and surrender all right of . . . sovereignty" and to "recognize the independence of the PhilippineIslands as a separate and self-governing nation"); Presidential Proclamation No. 2695, 60 Stat. 1352 (so proclaiming);Puerto Rico--Act of July 3, 1950, 64 Stat. 319 ("[T]his Act is
now adopted in the nature of a compact so that people of
Puerto Rico may organize a government pursuant to a constitution of their own adoption"); P. R. Const., Art. I, $ 1
("Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico"); see also Cordova & Simonpietri Ins. Agency Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank N. A., 649 F. 2d 36, 39-41 (CA1 1981) (describing
various adjustments to Puerto Rican autonomy through congressional legislation since 1898).

Fourth, Lara points to no explicit language in the Constitution suggesting a limitation on Congress' institutional authority to relax restrictions on tribal sovereignty previously
imposed by the political branches. But cf. Part III, infra.

Fifth, the change at issue here is a limited one. It concerns a power similar in some respects to the power to prosecute a tribe's own members--a power that this Court has
called "inherent." Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 322-323. In large
part it concerns a tribe's authority to control events that
occur upon the tribe's own land. See United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975) ("Indian tribes are unique
aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both
their members and their territory" (emphasis added)); see
also, e. g., S. Rep. No. 102-168, at 21 (remarks of P. Hugen).
And the tribes' possession of this additional criminal jurisdiction is consistent with our traditional understanding of
the tribes' status as "domestic dependent nations." Chero541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

205Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
kee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831); see also id., at 16(describing tribe as "a distinct political society, separated

from others, capable of managing its own affairs and govern-ing itself "). Consequently, we are not now faced with a
question dealing with potential constitutional limits on con-gressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes in
tribal status. In particular, this case involves no interference with the power or authority of any State. Nor do wenow consider the question whether the Constitution's Due

Process or Equal Protection Clauses prohibit tribes fromprosecuting a nonmember citizen of the United States. See
Part III, infra.

Sixth, our conclusion that Congress has the power to relax
the restrictions imposed by the political branches on the
tribes' inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent with
our earlier cases. True, the Court held in those cases that
the power to prosecute nonmembers was an aspect of the
tribes' external relations and hence part of the tribal sovereignty that was divested by treaties and by Congress.
Wheeler, supra, at 326; Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435
U. S. 191, 209-210 (1978); Duro, 495 U. S., at 686. But these
holdings reflect the Court's view of the tribes' retained sovereign status as of the time the Court made them. They
did not set forth constitutional limits that prohibit Congress
from changing the relevant legal circumstances, i. e., from
taking actions that modify or adjust the tribes' status.

To the contrary, Oliphant and Duro make clear that the
Constitution does not dictate the metes and bounds of tribal
autonomy, nor do they suggest that the Court should
second-guess the political branches' own determinations. In
Oliphant, the Court rested its conclusion about inherent
tribal authority to prosecute tribe members in large part
upon "the commonly shared presumption of Congress, the
Executive Branch, and lower federal courts," a presumption which, "[w]hile not conclusive[,] carries considerable
weight." 435 U. S., at 206. The Court pointed out that

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
206 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Opinion of the Court
" `Indian law' draws principally upon the treaties drawn andexecuted by the Executive Branch and

legislation passed
by Congress." Ibid. (emphasis added). It added that those"instruments . . . form the backdrop for the intricate web of

judicially made Indian law." Ibid. (emphasis added).Similarly, in

Duro, the Court drew upon a host of different
sources in order to reach its conclusion that a tribe does not
possess the inherent power to prosecute a nonmember. TheCourt referred to historic practices, the views of experts, the

experience of forerunners of modern tribal courts, and thepublished opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the
Interior. 495 U. S., at 689-692. See also, e. g., Nevada v.
Hicks, 533 U. S. 353, 361, n. 4 (2001) ("Our holding in Worcester must be considered in light of . . . the 1828 treaty" (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); South Dakota
v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679, 695 (1993) ("Having concluded
that Congress clearly abrogated the Tribe's pre-existing regulatory control over non-Indian hunting and fishing, we find
no evidence in the relevant treaties or statutes that Congress
intended to allow the Tribes to assert regulatory jurisdiction
over these lands pursuant to inherent sovereignty" (emphasis added)); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow
Tribe, 471 U. S. 845, 855-856 (1985) ("[T]he existence and
extent of a tribal court's jurisdiction will require [inter alia]
a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions"); United States v. Kagama, 118
U. S. 375, 382-383 (1886) (characterizing Ex parte Crow Dog,
109 U. S. 556, 570 (1883), as resting on extant treaties and
statutes and recognizing congressional overruling of Crow
Dog).

Thus, the Court in these cases based its descriptions of
inherent tribal authority upon the sources as they existed
at the time the Court issued its decisions. Congressional
legislation constituted one such important source. And that
source was subject to change. Indeed Duro itself antici541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

207Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
pated change by inviting interested parties to "address theproblem [to] Congress." 495 U. S., at 698.

We concede that Duro, like several other cases, referredonly to the need to obtain a congressional statute that "delegated" power to the tribes. See id., at 686 (emphasis added);Bourland, supra, at 695, n. 15; Montana v. United States,
450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981); Mazurie, 419 U. S., at 556-557.But in so stating,

Duro (like the other cases) simply did notconsider whether a statute, like the present one, could constitutionally achieve the same end by removing restrictions onthe tribes' inherent authority. Consequently we do not read
any of these cases as holding that the Constitution forbidsCongress to change "judicially made" federal Indian law
through this kind of legislation. Oliphant, supra, at 206;cf. County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470
U. S. 226, 233-237 (1985) (recognizing the "federal commonlaw" component of Indian rights, which "common law" federal courts develop as "a `necessary expedient' when Con-gress has not `spoken to a

particular issue' " (quoting Mil-waukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 313-315 (1981))); id., at 313

("[F]ederal common law is `subject to the paramount author-ity of Congress' " (quoting New Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S.
336, 348 (1931))).Wheeler, Oliphant, and Duro, then, are not determinative
because Congress has enacted a new statute, relaxing re-strictions on the bounds of the inherent tribal authority that
the United States recognizes. And that fact makes all thedifference.

III
Lara makes several additional arguments. First, hepoints out that the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat.

77, lacks certain constitutional protections for criminal de-fendants, in particular the right of an indigent defendant to
counsel. See 25 U. S. C. $ 1302. And he argues that theDue Process Clause forbids Congress to permit a tribe to
prosecute a nonmember Indian citizen of the United States

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
208 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Opinion of the Court
in a forum that lacks this protection. See Argersinger v.
Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972) (Constitution guarantees indigents counsel where imprisonment possible).

Lara's due process argument, however, suffers from a critical structural defect. To explain the defect, we contrast this
argument with Lara's "lack of constitutional power" argument discussed in Part II, supra. Insofar as that "constitutional power" argument might help Lara win his double
jeopardy claim, it must proceed in four steps:

Step One: Congress does not possess the constitutional
power to enact a statute that modifies tribal power by "recogniz[ing] and affirm[ing]" the tribes' "inherent" authority
to prosecute nonmember Indians. 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2).

Step Two: Consequently, the word "inherent" in the statute's phrase "inherent power" is void.

Step Three: The word "inherent" is severable from the rest
of the statute (as are related words). The remainder of the
statute is valid without those words, but it then delegates
federal power to the tribe to conduct the prosecution.

Step Four: Consequently, the Tribe's prosecution of Lara
was federal. The current, second, prosecution is also federal. Hence Lara wins his Double Jeopardy Clause claim,
the subject of the present proceeding.

Although the Eighth Circuit accepted this argument, 324
F. 3d, at 640, we reject Step One of the argument, Part
II, supra. That rejection, without more, invalidates the
argument.

Lara's due process argument, however, is significantly different. That argument (if valid) would show that any
prosecution of a nonmember Indian under the statute is invalid; so Lara's tribal prosecution would be invalid, too.
Showing Lara's tribal prosecution was invalid, however, does
not show that the source of that tribal prosecution was federal power (showing that a state prosecution violated the
Due Process Clause does not make that prosecution federal).

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

209Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
But without that "federal power" showing, Lara cannot winhis double jeopardy claim here. Hence, we need not, and we

shall not, consider the merits of Lara's due process claim.Other defendants in tribal proceedings remain free to raise
that claim should they wish to do so. See 25 U. S. C. $ 1303(vesting district courts with jurisdiction over habeas writs
from tribal courts).

Second, Lara argues that Congress' use of the words "allIndians," in the statutory phrase "inherent power . . . to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians," violates theEqual Protection Clause. He says that insofar as the words
include nonmember Indians within the statute's scope (while
excluding all non-Indians) the statute is race based and without justification. Like the due process argument, however,
this equal protection argument is simply beside the point,
therefore we do not address it. At best for Lara, the argument (if valid) would show, not that Lara's first conviction
was federal, but that it was constitutionally defective. And
that showing cannot help Lara win his double jeopardy
claim.

Third, Lara points out that the Duro Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, for example, the
guarantee of an indigent's right to counsel, as an important
reason for concluding that tribes lacked the "inherent
power" to try a "group of citizens" (namely, nonmember Indians) who were not "include[d]" in those "political bodies."
495 U. S., at 693-694. In fact, Duro says the following: "We
hesitate to adopt a view of tribal sovereignty that would
single out another group of citizens, nonmember Indians, for
trial by political bodies that do not include them." Id., at
693. But this argument simply repeats the due process and
equal protection arguments rejected above in a somewhat
different form. Since precisely the same problem would
exist were we to treat the congressional statute as delegating federal power, this argument helps Lara no more than
the others.

For these reasons, we hold, with the reservations set forthin Part III,

supra, that the Constitution authorizes Congressto permit tribes, as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority, to prosecute nonmember Indians. We hold thatCongress exercised that authority in writing this statute.
That being so, the Spirit Lake Tribe's prosecution of Laradid not amount to an exercise of federal power, and the Tribe
acted in its capacity of a separate sovereign. Consequently,the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal
Government from proceeding with the present prosecutionfor a discrete

federal offense. Heath, 474 U. S., at 88.

The contrary judgment of the Eighth Circuit is

Reversed.

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT
Title 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2), as amended by Act of Oct. 28,1991, 105 Stat. 646, provides:

" `[P]owers of self-government' means and includes all gov-ernmental powers possessed by an Indian tribe, executive,
legislative, and judicial, and all offices, bodies, and tribunalsby and through which they are executed, including courts of
Indian offenses; and means the inherent power of Indiantribes, hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise criminal
jurisdiction over all Indians."

Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I join the Court's opinion without reservation, theadditional writing by my colleagues prompts this comment.

The inherent sovereignty of the Indian tribes has a historicalbasis that merits special mention. They governed territory
on this continent long before Columbus arrived. In con-trast, most of the States were never actually independent
sovereigns, and those that were enjoyed that independent

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
status for only a few years. Given the fact that Congresscan authorize the States to exercise--as

their own--inherent
powers that the Constitution has otherwise placed off limits,see,

e. g., Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 437-
438 (1946), I find nothing exceptional in the conclusion thatit can also relax restrictions on an ancient inherent tribal

power.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968(ICRA) enacted after the Court's decision in

Duro v. Reina,
495 U. S. 676 (1990), demonstrates Congress' clear intentionto restore to the tribes an inherent sovereign power to prosecute nonmember Indians. Congress was careful to rely onthe theory of inherent sovereignty, and not on a delegation.
Justice Souter's position that it was a delegation nonetheless, post, at 231 (dissenting opinion), is by no means without
support, but I would take Congress at its word. Under that
view, the first prosecution of Lara was not a delegated federal prosecution, and his double jeopardy argument must
fail. That is all we need say to resolve this case.

The Court's analysis goes beyond this narrower rationale
and culminates in a surprising holding: "For these reasons,
we hold . . . that the Constitution authorizes Congress to
permit tribes, as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority, to prosecute nonmember Indians." Ante, at 210. The
Court's holding is on a point of major significance to our understanding and interpretation of the Constitution; and, in
my respectful view, it is most doubtful.

Were we called upon to decide whether Congress has this
power, it would be a difficult question. Our decision in
United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 (1978), which the
Court cites today but discusses very little, is replete with
references to the inherent authority of the tribe over its own
members. As I read that case, it is the historic possession
of inherent power over "the relations among members of a

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
212 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
tribe" that is the whole justification for the limited tribalsovereignty the Court there recognized.

Id., at 326. It is
a most troubling proposition to say that Congress can relaxthe restrictions on inherent tribal sovereignty in a way that

extends that sovereignty beyond those historical limits.Cf.,

e. g., Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 445-446
(1997) ("In the main . . . `the inherent sovereign powers of
an Indian tribe'--those powers a tribe enjoys apart from ex-press provision by treaty or statute--`do not extend to the

activities of nonmembers of the tribe' " (quoting Montana v.
United States, 450 U. S. 544, 565 (1981))). To conclude that
a tribe's inherent sovereignty allows it to exercise jurisdiction over a nonmember in a criminal case is to enlarge the
"unique and limited character" of the inherent sovereignty
that Wheeler recognized. 435 U. S., at 323.

Lara, after all, is a citizen of the United States. To hold
that Congress can subject him, within our domestic borders,
to a sovereignty outside the basic structure of the Constitution is a serious step. The Constitution is based on a theory
of original, and continuing, consent of the governed. Their
consent depends on the understanding that the Constitution
has established the federal structure, which grants the citizen the protection of two governments, the Nation and the
State. Each sovereign must respect the proper sphere of
the other, for the citizen has rights and duties as to both.
See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838-
839 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Here, contrary to this
design, the National Government seeks to subject a citizen
to the criminal jurisdiction of a third entity to be tried for
conduct occurring wholly within the territorial borders of
the Nation and one of the States. This is unprecedented.
There is a historical exception for Indian tribes, but only to
the limited extent that a member of a tribe consents to be
subjected to the jurisdiction of his own tribe. See Duro,
supra, at 693. The majority today reaches beyond that limited exception.

213Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
The Court resolves, or perhaps avoids, the basic questionof the power of the Government to yield authority inside the

domestic borders over citizens to a third sovereign by usingthe euphemistic formulation that in amending the ICRA
Congress merely relaxed restrictions on the tribes. See
ante, at 196, 200, 202, 205, and 207. There is no language in
the statute, or the legislative history, that justifies this unusual phrase, cf. 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2) (referring to "the inher-ent power of Indian tribes, hereby recognized and affirmed,

to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians"); and, inmy respectful view, it obscures what is actually at stake in
this case. The terms of the statute are best understood as
a grant or cession from Congress to the tribes, and it should
not be doubted that what Congress has attempted to do is
subject American citizens to the authority of an extraconstitutional sovereign to which they had not previously been
subject. The relaxing-restrictions formulation is further
belied by the involvement of the United States in all aspects
of the tribal prosecution of a nonmember Indian. Federal
law defines the separate tribes, $ 1301, the broader class of
"Indians," the maximum penalty which the tribes may impose for crimes, and the procedural protections to which defendants are entitled in the trials, $ 1302. This does not
indicate the sort of detachment from the exercise of prosecutorial authority implicit in the description of Congress'
Act as having relaxed restrictions.

In addition to trying to evade the important structural
question by relying on the verbal formula of relaxation, the
Court also tries to bolster its position by noting that due
process and equal protection claims are still reserved.
Ante, at 210. That is true, but it ignores the elementary
principle that the constitutional structure was in place before
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were adopted. To
demean the constitutional structure and the consent upon
which it rests by implying they are wholly dependent for
their vindication on the Due Process and Equal Protection

214 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Clauses is a further, unreasoned holding of serious import.The political freedom guaranteed to citizens by the federal

structure is a liberty both distinct from and every bit asimportant as those freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of
Rights. Cf. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 449-453 (1998) (

Kennedy, J., concurring). The individual citizen
has an enforceable right to those structural guarantees of
liberty, a right which the majority ignores. Perhaps theCourt's holding could be justified by an argument that by

enrolling in one tribe Lara consented to the criminal jurisdic-tion of other tribes, but the Court does not mention the
point. And, in all events, we should be cautious aboutadopting that fiction.

The present case, however, does not require us to address
these difficult questions of constitutional dimension. Congress made it clear that its intent was to recognize and affirm
tribal authority to try Indian nonmembers as inherent in
tribal status. The proper occasion to test the legitimacy of
the Tribe's authority, that is, whether Congress had the
power to do what it sought to do, was in the first, tribal
proceeding. There, however, Lara made no objection to the
Tribe's authority to try him. In the second, federal proceeding, because the express rationale for the Tribe's authority
to try Lara--whether legitimate or not--was inherent sovereignty, not delegated federal power, there can be no double
jeopardy violation. Cf. Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S.
333, 345 (1907) ("[B]efore a person can be said to have been
put in jeopardy of life or limb the court in which he was
acquitted or convicted must have had jurisdiction to try him
for the offense charged"). For that reason, I concur in the
judgment.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
As this case should make clear, the time has come to reexamine the premises and logic of our tribal sovereignty
cases. It seems to me that much of the confusion reflected

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
in our precedent arises from two largely incompatible anddoubtful assumptions. First, Congress (rather than some

other part of the Federal Government) can regulate virtuallyevery aspect of the tribes without rendering tribal sovereignty a nullity. See, e. g., United States v. Wheeler, 435U. S. 313, 319 (1978). Second, the Indian tribes retain inherent sovereignty to enforce their criminal laws against theirown members. See,

e. g., id., at 326. These assumptions,which I must accept as the case comes to us, dictate the

outcome in this case, and I therefore concur in the judgment.I write separately principally because the Court fails to
confront these tensions, a result that flows from the Court'sinadequate constitutional analysis. I cannot agree with the
Court, for instance, that the Constitution grants to Congressplenary power to calibrate the "metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty." Ante, at 202; see also ante, at 210 (hold-ing that "the Constitution authorizes Congress" to regulate
tribal sovereignty). Unlike the Court, ante, at 200-201,I cannot locate such congressional authority in the Treaty
Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2, or the Indian Com-merce Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Additionally, I would ascribe
much more significance to legislation such as the Act of Mar.3, 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 2079, 16 Stat. 566, codified at 25 U. S. C.

$ 71, that purports to terminate the practice of dealing withIndian tribes by treaty. The making of treaties, after all, is
the one mechanism that the Constitution clearly provides forthe Federal Government to interact with sovereigns other
than the States. Yet, if I accept that Congress does havethis authority, I believe that the result in

Wheeler is ques-tionable. In my view, the tribes either are or are not separate sovereigns, and our federal Indian law cases untenablyhold both positions simultaneously.

ity to prosecute nonmember Indians), Congress amendedthe Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA). Specifically,

through this "Duro fix," Congress amended ICRA's defini-tion of the tribes' "powers of self-government" to "recogniz[e] and affir[m]" the existence of "inherent power . . . toexercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians." 25 U. S. C.

$ 1301(2). There is quite simply no way to interpret a recognition and affirmation of inherent power as a delegation offederal power, as the Court explains.

Ante, at 199. Delegated power is the very antithesis of inherent power.But even if the statute were less clear, I would not interpret it as a delegation of federal power. The power to bring
federal prosecutions, which is part of the putative delegated
power, is manifestly and quintessentially executive power.
Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 691 (1988); id., at 705
(Scalia, J., dissenting). Congress cannot transfer federal
executive power to individuals who are beyond "meaningful
Presidential control." Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,
922-923 (1997). And this means that, at a minimum, the
President must have some measure of "the power to appoint
and remove" those exercising that power. Id., at 922; see
also Morrison, supra, at 706-715 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

It does not appear that the President has any control over
tribal officials, let alone a substantial measure of the appointment and removal power. Cf. Brief for National Congress
of American Indians as Amicus Curiae 27-29. Thus, at
least until we are prepared to recognize absolutely independent agencies entirely outside of the Executive Branch with
the power to bind the Executive Branch (for a tribal prosecution would then bar a subsequent federal prosecution), the
tribes cannot be analogized to administrative agencies, as the
dissent suggests, post, at 227 (opinion of Souter, J.). That
is, reading the "Duro fix" as a delegation of federal power
(without also divining some adequate method of Presidential
control) would create grave constitutional difficulties. Cf.
INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 299-300 (2001); Solid Waste

Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers,531 U. S. 159, 173 (2001). Accordingly, the Court has only

two options: Either the "Duro fix" changed the result inDuro or it did nothing at all.

II
In Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 322-323, the Court explained that,prior to colonization, "the tribes were self-governing sovereign political communities." The Court acknowledged, how-ever, that, after "[t]heir incorporation within the territory of
the United States," the tribes could exercise their inherentsovereignty only as consistent with federal policy embodied
in treaties, statutes, and Executive Orders. Id., at 323; seealso

id., at 327-328. Examining these sources for potentialconflict, the Court concluded that the tribes retained the

ability to exercise their inherent sovereignty to punish theirown members. Id., at 323-330.

Although Wheeler seems to be a sensible example of fed-eral common lawmaking, I am not convinced that it was correctly decided. To be sure, it makes sense to conceptualize

1 I am sympathetic to Justice Kennedy's position that we need not
resolve the question presented. Ante, at 211 (opinion concurring in judgment). If Congress has power to restore tribal authority to prosecute
nonmember Indians, respondent's tribal prosecution was the legitimate
exercise of a separate sovereign. As such, under the dual sovereignty
doctrine, it does not bar his subsequent federal prosecution. On the other
hand, if the amendment to ICRA had no effect (the only other possibility),
jeopardy did not attach in the tribal prosecution. See, e. g., Serfass v.
United States, 420 U. S. 377, 391 (1975); Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S.
333, 345 (1907) (noting "that before a person can be said to have been put
in jeopardy of life or limb the court in which he was acquitted or convicted
must have had jurisdiction to try him for the offense charged"); United
States v. Phelps, 168 F. 3d 1048, 1053-1054 (CA8 1999) (holding tribal court
prosecution without jurisdiction did not bar subsequent federal prosecution). Jeopardy could have attached in the tribal prosecution for federal
purposes only if the Federal Government had authorized the prosecution.
But Congress did not authorize tribal prosecutions, and nothing suggests
that the Executive Branch prompted respondent's tribal prosecution.

218 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
the tribes as sovereigns that, due to their unique situation,cannot exercise the full measure of their sovereign powers.

Wheeler, at times, seems to analyze the problem in just thisway. See,

e. g., id., at 323-326; id., at 323 (relying on Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), discussed
infra).

But I do not see how this is consistent with the apparently
"undisputed fact that Congress has plenary authority to leg-islate for the Indian tribes in all matters, including their

form of government." 435 U. S., at 319. The sovereign is,by definition, the entity "in which independent and supreme
authority is vested." Black's Law Dictionary 1395 (6th ed.
1990). It is quite arguably the essence of sovereignty not
to exist merely at the whim of an external government.

Further, federal policy itself could be thought to be inconsistent with this residual-sovereignty theory. In 1871, Congress enacted a statute that purported to prohibit entering
into treaties with the "Indian nation[s] or tribe[s]." 16 Stat.
566, codified at 25 U. S. C. $ 71. Although this Act is constitutionally suspect (the Constitution vests in the President
both the power to make treaties, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2, and to
recognize foreign governments, Art. II, $ 3; see, e. g., United
States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 228-230 (1942)), it nevertheless
reflects the view of the political branches that the tribes had
become a purely domestic matter.

To be sure, this does not quite suffice to demonstrate that
the tribes had lost their sovereignty. After all, States retain sovereignty despite the fact that Congress can regulate
States qua States in certain limited circumstances. See,
e. g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); cf. New
York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 160-161 (1992); Garcia
v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S.
528 (1985). But the States (unlike the tribes) are part of a
constitutional framework that allocates sovereignty between
the State and Federal Governments and specifically grants
Congress authority to legislate with respect to them, see

U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 5. And even so, we have explainedthat "the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, notStates." New York, 505 U. S., at 166; id., at 162-166; see
also Printz, 521 U. S., at 910-915.The tribes, by contrast, are not part of this constitutional
order, and their sovereignty is not guaranteed by it. AsChief Justice Marshall explained:

"[T]he relation of the Indians to the United States ismarked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist
no where else. . . .
"[Y]et it may well be doubted whether those tribeswhich reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the

United States can, with strict accuracy, be denominatedforeign nations. They may, more correctly, perhaps, be
denominated domestic dependent nations." CherokeeNation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16-17 (1831).

Chief Justice Marshall further described the tribes as "inde-pendent political communities, retaining their original natural rights," and specifically noted that the tribes possessedthe power to "mak[e] treaties." Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet.
515, 559 (1832). Although the tribes never fit comfortablywithin the category of foreign nations, the 1871 Act tends to
show that the political branches no longer considered thetribes to be anything like foreign nations. And it is at least
arguable that the United States no longer considered thetribes to be sovereigns.

2 Federal Indian policy is, to say the

least, schizophrenic. And this confusion continues to infusefederal Indian law and our cases.

2 Additionally, the very enactment of ICRA through normal legislation
conflicts with the notion that tribes possess inherent sovereignty. Title
25 U. S. C. $ 1302, for example, requires tribes "in exercising powers of
self-government" to accord individuals most of the protections in the Bill
of Rights. I doubt whether Congress could, through ordinary legislation,
require States (let alone foreign nations) to use grand juries.

220 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Nevertheless, if I accept Wheeler, I also must accept thatthe tribes do retain inherent sovereignty (at least to enforce

their criminal laws against their own members) and thelogical consequences of this fact. In Heath v. Alabama, 474
U. S. 82, 88 (1985), the Court elaborated the dual sover-eignty doctrine and explained that a single act that violates
the " `peace and dignity' of two sovereigns by breaking thelaws of each" constitutes two separate offenses. This, of
course, is the reason that the Double Jeopardy Clause doesnot bar successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns.
But whether an act violates the "peace and dignity" of asovereign depends not in the least on whether the perpetrator is a member (in the case of the tribes) or a citizen (in thecase of the States and the Nation) of the sovereign.

Hea th also instructs, relying on Wheeler, that theseparate-sovereign inquiry "turns on whether the two entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinctsources of power."

Heath, supra, at 88. But Wheelermakes clear that the tribes and the Federal Government do

draw their authority to punish from distinct sources and thatthey are separate sovereigns. Otherwise, the subsequent
federal prosecution in Wheeler would have violated the Dou-ble Jeopardy Clause.

3 It follows from our case law that Indian tribes possess inherent sovereignty to punish anyonewho violates their laws.

In Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676 (1990), the Court held thatthe Indian tribes could no longer enforce their criminal laws
against nonmember Indians. Despite the obvious tension,
Duro and Wheeler are not necessarily inconsistent. Al-though

Wheeler and Heath, taken together, necessarily implythat the tribes retain inherent sovereignty to try anyone

who violates their criminal laws, Wheeler and Duro make

3 I acknowledge that Wheeler focused specifically on the tribes' authority
to try their own members. See 435 U. S., at 323-330. But, as I discuss
below, the distinction between the tribes' external and internal powers is
not constitutionally required.

clear that conflict with federal policy can operate to prohibitthe exercise of this sovereignty.

Duro, then, is not a case
about "inherent sovereignty" (a term that we have used tooimprecisely); rather, it is a case about whether a specific exercise of tribal sovereignty conflicts with federal policy.Indeed, the Court in

Duro relied primarily on Oliphant v.
Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), which held that tribes
could not enforce their criminal laws against non-Indians.In reaching that conclusion, the Court in

Oliphant carefully
examined the views of Congress and the Executive Branch.
Id., at 197-206 (discussing treaties, statutes, and views of the
Executive Branch); id., at 199 (discussing Attorney General
opinions, including 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 693 (1834) (concluding
that tribal exercise of criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians
was inconsistent with various treaties)). Duro at least rehearsed the same analysis. 495 U. S., at 688-692. Thus, although Duro is sprinkled with references to various constitutional concerns, see, e. g., id., at 693-694, Duro, Oliphant,
and Wheeler are classic federal-common-law decisions. See
also County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470
U. S. 226, 233-236 (1985).

I acknowledge that our cases have distinguished between
"tribal power [that] is necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control internal relations" and tribal power
as it relates to the external world. Montana v. United
States, 450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981); see also Nevada v. Hicks,
533 U. S. 353, 358-359 (2001); South Dakota v. Bourland, 508
U. S. 679, 695, n. 15 (1993); Duro, supra, at 685-686; Wheeler,
435 U. S., at 322-325. This distinction makes perfect sense
as a matter of federal common law: Purely "internal" matters
are by definition unlikely to implicate any federal policy.
But, critically, our cases have never drawn this line as a constitutional matter. That is why we have analyzed extant
federal law (embodied in treaties, statutes, and Executive
Orders) before concluding that particular tribal assertions of
power were incompatible with the position of the tribes.

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
See, e. g., National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,471 U. S. 845, 853-854 (1985); Oliphant, supra, at 204 ("While

Congress never expressly forbade Indian tribes to imposecriminal penalties on non-Indians, we now make express our
implicit conclusion of nearly a century ago [referring to Inre Mayfield, 141 U. S. 107 (1891)] that Congress consistently
believed this to be the necessary result of its repeated legis-lative actions").

As noted, in response to Duro, Congress amended ICRA.Specifically, Congress "recognized and affirmed" the existence of "inherent power . . . to exercise criminal jurisdictionover all Indians." 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2). President Bush
signed this legislation into law. See 27 Weekly Comp. ofPres. Doc. 1573-1574 (1991). Further, as this litigation demonstrates, it is the position of the Executive Branch that thetribes possess inherent authority to prosecute nonmember
Indians.In my view, these authoritative pronouncements of the political branches make clear that the exercise of this aspect ofsovereignty is not inconsistent with federal policy and therefore with the position of the tribes. Thus, while Duro mayhave been a correct federal-common-law decision at the time,
the political branches have subsequently made clear that the

4 Justice Souter believes that I have overlooked Oliphant's reliance
on sources other than "treaties, statutes, and the views of the Executive
Branch." Post, at 230, n. 2. Justice Souter quotes the following passage from Oliphant: "[E]ven ignoring treaty provisions and congressional
policy, Indians do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians absent
affirmative delegation of such power by Congress. . . . Indian tribes are
prohibited from exercising both those powers of autonomous states that
are expressly terminated by Congress and those powers inconsistent with
their status." 435 U. S., at 208 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). The second quoted sentence is entirely consistent
with federal common lawmaking and is difficult to understand as anything
else. I admit that the first sentence, which removes from consideration
most of the sources of federal common law, makes the second sentence
puzzling. But this is precisely the confusion that I have identified and
that I hope the Court begins to resolve.

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
tribes' exercise of criminal jurisdiction against nonmemberIndians is consistent with federal policy. The potential conflicts on which Duro must have been premised, according tothe political branches, do not exist. See also ante, at 205.
I therefore agree that, as the case comes to us, the Tribeacted as a separate sovereign when it prosecuted respondent. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not barthe subsequent federal prosecution.

III
I believe that we must examine more critically our tribalsovereignty case law. Both the Court and the dissent, however, compound the confusion by failing to undertake thenecessary rigorous constitutional analysis. I would begin
by carefully following our assumptions to their logical con-clusions and by identifying the potential sources of federal
power to modify tribal sovereignty.The dissent admits that "[t]reaties and statutes delineating
the tribal-federal relationship are properly viewed as an in-dependent elaboration by the political branches of the fine
details of the tribes' dependent position, which strips thetribes of any power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over
those outside their own memberships." Post, at 228. Tothe extent that this is a description of the federal-commonlaw process, I agree. But I do not understand how the dis-sent can then conclude that "the jurisdictional implications
[arising from this analysis are] constitutional in nature."Ibid. By this I understand the dissent to mean that Congress cannot alter the result, though the dissent neverquite says so.

The analysis obviously has constitutional implications. Itis, for example, dispositive of respondent's double jeopardy
claim. But it does not follow that this Court's federal-common-law decisions limiting tribes' authority to exercise
their inherent sovereignty somehow become enshrined asconstitutional holdings that the political branches cannot

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
alter. When the political branches demonstrate that a par-ticular exercise of the tribes' sovereign power is in fact

consistent with federal policy, the underpinnings of afederal-common-law decision disabling the exercise of that
tribal power disappear. Although I do not necessarily agreethat the tribes have any residual inherent sovereignty or
that Congress is the constitutionally appropriate branch to
make adjustments to sovereignty, see Part II, supra, it isimportant to recognize the logical implications of these

assumptions.Similarly unavailing is the dissent's observation that when
we perform the separate-sovereign analysis "we are undertaking a constitutional analysis based on legal categories of
constitutional dimension." Post, at 229. The dissent concludes from this that our double jeopardy analysis in this
context "must itself have had constitutional status." Ibid.
This ipse dixit does not transform our common-law decisions
into constitutional holdings. Cf. Dickerson v. United States,
530 U. S. 428, 459-461 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

I do, however, agree that this case raises important constitutional questions that the Court does not begin to answer.
The Court utterly fails to find any provision of the Constitution that gives Congress enumerated power to alter tribal
sovereignty. The Court cites the Indian Commerce Clause
and the treaty power. Ante, at 200. I cannot agree that
the Indian Commerce Clause " `provide[s] Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.' " Ibid.
(quoting Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S.
163, 192 (1989)). At one time, the implausibility of this assertion at least troubled the Court, see, e. g., United States
v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 378-379 (1886) (considering such
a construction of the Indian Commerce Clause to be "very
strained"), and I would be willing to revisit the question.
Cf., e. g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000);
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995); id., at 584-593
(Thomas, J., concurring).

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Next, the Court acknowledges that "[t]he treaty powerdoes not literally authorize Congress to act legislatively,

for it is an Article II power authorizing the President, notCongress, `to make Treaties.' "

Ante, at 201 (quoting U. S.
Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2). This, of course, suffices to showthat it provides

no power to Congress, at least in the absence
of a specific treaty. Cf. Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416
(1920). The treaty power does not, as the Court seems tobelieve, provide Congress with free-floating power to legislate as it sees fit on topics that could potentially implicatesome unspecified treaty. Such an assertion is especially
ironic in light of Congress' enacted prohibition on Indian
treaties.

In the end, the Court resorts to citing past examples of
congressional assertions of this or similar power. Ante,
at 202-203. At times, such history might suffice. Cf.
Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 610-611
(1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). But it does not suffice
here for at least two reasons. First, federal Indian law is at
odds with itself. I find it difficult to reconcile the result in
Wheeler with Congress' 1871 prospective prohibition on the
making of treaties with the Indian tribes. The Federal Government cannot simultaneously claim power to regulate virtually every aspect of the tribes through ordinary domestic
legislation and also maintain that the tribes possess anything
resembling "sovereignty." See Part II, supra. In short,
the history points in both directions.

Second, much of the practice that the Court cites does not
actually help its argument. The "Insular Cases," which include the Hawaii and Puerto Rico examples, ante, at 203-204,
involved Territories of the United States, over which Congress has plenary power to govern and regulate. See Reid
v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 13 (1957); U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 3,
cl. 2. The existence of a textual source for congressional
power distinguishes these cases. And, incidentally, al541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
226 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Souter, J., dissenting
though one might think that Congress' authority over thetribes could be found in Article IV, $ 3, cl. 2, the Court has

held that the Territories are the United States for doublejeopardy purposes, see,

e. g., Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 321-322;
Puerto Rico v. Shell Co. (P. R.), Ltd., 302 U. S. 253, 264-266(1937), which would preclude the result in

Wheeler. It is for
this reason as well that the degree of autonomy of Puerto
Rico is beside the point. See Wheeler, supra, at 321; post,at 229.

The Court should admit that it has failed in its quest tofind a source of congressional power to adjust tribal sovereignty. Such an acknowledgment might allow the Court toask the logically antecedent question

whether Congress (as
opposed to the President) has this power. A cogent answer
would serve as the foundation for the analysis of the sovereignty issues posed by this case. We might find that the
Federal Government cannot regulate the tribes through ordinary domestic legislation and simultaneously maintain that
the tribes are sovereigns in any meaningful sense. But
until we begin to analyze these questions honestly and rigorously, the confusion that I have identified will continue to
haunt our cases.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

It is as true today as it was in 1886 that the relationship
of Indian tribes to the National Government is "an anomalous one and of a complex character." United States v.
Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 381. Questions of tribal jurisdiction,
whether legislative or judicial, do not get much help from
the general proposition that tribes are "domestic dependent
nations," Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831), or
"wards of the [American] nation," Kagama, supra, at 383.
Our cases deciding specific questions, however, demonstrate
that the tribes do retain jurisdiction necessary to protect
tribal self-government or control internal tribal relations,

Souter, J., dissenting
Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981), including
the right to prosecute tribal members for crimes, United
States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 323-324 (1978), a sovereign
right that is "inherent," ibid., but neither exclusive, Kagama, supra, at 384-385 (federal criminal jurisdiction), nor
immune to abrogation by Congress, Wheeler, supra, at 323
("the sufferance of Congress"). Furthermore, except as
provided by Congress, tribes lack criminal jurisdiction over
non-Indians, Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, 212
(1978), and over nonmember Indians, Duro v. Reina, 495
U. S. 676, 685, 688 (1990).

Of particular relevance today, we held in Duro that because tribes have lost their inherent criminal jurisdiction
over nonmember Indians, any subsequent exercise of such
jurisdiction "could only have come to the Tribe" (if at all)
"by delegation from Congress." Id., at 686. Three years
later, in South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679 (1993), we
reiterated this understanding that any such "delegation"
would not be a restoration of prior inherent sovereignty; we
specifically explained that "tribal sovereignty over nonmembers cannot survive without express congressional delegation, and is therefore not inherent." Id., at 695, n. 15 (emphasis in original; citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).1 Our precedent, then, is that any tribal exercise
of criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers necessarily rests
on a "delegation" of federal power and is not akin to a State's
congressionally permitted exercise of some authority that
would otherwise be barred by the dormant Commerce
Clause, see New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 171
(1992). It is more like the delegation of lawmaking power
to an administrative agency, whose jurisdiction would not
even exist absent congressional authorization.

1 Bourland was a civil case about the regulation of hunting and fishing
by non-Indians. Its applicability in the criminal context is presumably
a fortiori.

228 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Souter, J., dissenting
It is of no moment that we have given ostensibly alternat-ing explanations for this conclusion. We have sometimes indicated that the tribes' lack of inherent criminal jurisdictionover nonmembers is a necessary legal consequence of the
basic fact that the tribes are dependent on the Federal Gov-ernment.

Wheeler, supra, at 326 ("[The tribes' inability to]
try nonmembers in tribal courts . . . rest[s] on the fact that
the dependent status of Indian tribes within our territorialjurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations"); Oliphant, 435 U. S., at 210 ("By submitting to the overriding
sovereignty of the United States, Indian tribes therefore
necessarily give up their power to try non-Indian citizens of
the United States . . ."). At other times, our language has
suggested that the jurisdictional limit stems from congressional and treaty limitations on tribal powers. See id., at
204 ("Congress' various actions and inactions in regulating
criminal jurisdiction on Indian reservations demonstrated an
intent to reserve jurisdiction over non-Indians for the federal
courts"); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,
471 U. S. 845, 853-854 (1985) ("In Oliphant we . . . concluded
that federal legislation conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts to try non-Indians for offenses committed in
Indian Country had implicitly pre-empted tribal jurisdiction"). What has never been explicitly stated, but should
come as no surprise, is that these two accounts are not inconsistent. Treaties and statutes delineating the tribal-federal
relationship are properly viewed as an independent elaboration by the political branches of the fine details of the tribes'
dependent position, which strips the tribes of any power to
exercise criminal jurisdiction over those outside their own
memberships.

What should also be clear, and what I would hold today, is
that our previous understanding of the jurisdictional implications of dependent sovereignty was constitutional in nature,
certainly so far as its significance under the Double Jeopardy

541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

229Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)
Souter, J., dissenting
Clause is concerned. Our discussions of Indian sovereigntyhave naturally focused on the scope of tribes' inherent legislative or judicial jurisdiction. E. g., Nevada v. Hicks, 533U. S. 353 (2001) ( jurisdiction of tribal courts over civil suit
against state official); South Dakota v. Bourland, supra(tribal regulations governing hunting and fishing). And application of the double jeopardy doctrine of dual sovereignty,
under which one independent sovereign's exercise of crimi-nal jurisdiction does not bar another sovereign's subsequent

prosecution of the same defendant, turns on just this ques-tion of how far a prosecuting entity's inherent jurisdiction
extends. Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333, 354-355
(1907). When we enquire "whether the two [prosecuting]
entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power," Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88
(1985), in other words, we are undertaking a constitutional
analysis based on legal categories of constitutional dimension
(i. e., is this entity an independent or dependent sovereign?).
Thus, our application of the doctrines of independent and
dependent sovereignty to Indian tribes in response to a double jeopardy claim must itself have had constitutional status.
See Wheeler, supra, at 326 (holding that tribes' inability to
prosecute nonmembers "rest[s] on the fact that the dependent status of Indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction
is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently
to determine their external relations").

That means that there are only two ways that a tribe's
inherent sovereignty could be restored so as to alter application of the dual sovereignty rule: either Congress could grant
the same independence to the tribes that it did to the Philippines, see ante, at 204, or this Court could repudiate its existing doctrine of dependent sovereignty. The first alternative
has obviously not been attempted, and I see no reason for us
to venture down a path toward the second. To begin with,
the theory we followed before today has the virtue of fitting
the facts: no one could possibly deny that the tribes are sub541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
230 UNITED STATES v. LARA

Souter, J., dissenting
ordinate to the National Government. Furthermore, whilethis is not the place to reexamine the concept of dual sovereignty itself, there is certainly no reason to adopt a canon ofbroad construction calling for maximum application of the
doctrine. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, principlesof stare decisis are particularly compelling in the law of
tribal jurisdiction, an area peculiarly susceptible to confu-sion. And confusion, I fear, will be the legacy of today's
decision, for our failure to stand by what we have previouslysaid reveals that our conceptualizations of sovereignty and
dependent sovereignty are largely rhetorical.2

2 Justice Thomas's disagreement with me turns ultimately on his readiness to discard prior case law in this field and, indeed, on his rejection in
this very case of the concept of dependent sovereignty. He notes, for
example, ante, at 220 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the Court in
Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88 (1985), explained that one act that
violates the peace and dignity of two sovereigns constitutes two separate
offenses for purposes of double jeopardy. Justice Thomas then concludes that whether an act violates a sovereign's peace and dignity does
not depend (when the sovereign is an Indian tribe) on whether the perpetrator is a member of the tribe. Justice Thomas therefore assumes that
tribes "retain inherent sovereignty to try anyone who violates their criminal laws." Ante, at 220. This Court, however, has held exactly to the
contrary: a tribe has no inherent jurisdiction to prosecute a nonmember.
In rejecting this precedent, Justice Thomas implicitly rejects the concept of dependent sovereignty, upon which our holdings in United States
v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 (1978), and Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435
U. S. 191 (1978), rested. Reciting Oliphant's examination of treaties, statutes, and views of the Executive Branch, Justice Thomas attempts to
suggest that these opinions were only momentary expressions of malleable
federal policy. But he somehow ignores Oliphant's own emphasis that its
analysis did not rest on historical expressions of federal policy; rather,
"even ignoring treaty provisions and congressional policy, Indians do not
have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians absent affirmative delegation
of such power by Congress. . . . Indian tribes are prohibited from exercising both those powers of autonomous states that are expressly terminated
by Congress and those powers inconsistent with their status." Id., at
208 (emphasis in original; citation and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 686 (1990). There is simply no basis
for Justice Thomas's recharacterization of this clear holding.

I would therefore stand by our explanations in Oliphantand Duro and hold that Congress cannot reinvest tribal

courts with inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmemberIndians. It is not that I fail to appreciate Congress's express wish that the jurisdiction conveyed by statute betreated as inherent, but Congress cannot control the interpretation of the statute in a way that is at odds with theconstitutional consequences of the tribes' continuing dependent status. What may be given controlling effect, however,is the principal object of the 1990 amendments to the Indian
Civil Rights Act of 1968, 25 U. S. C. $ 1301 et seq., which wasto close "the jurisdictional void" created by

Duro by recog-nizing (and empowering) the tribal court as "the best forum

to handle misdemeanor cases over non-member Indians,"H. R. Rep. No. 102-261, p. 6 (1991). I would therefore honor
the drafters' substantive intent by reading the Act as a del-egation of federal prosecutorial power that eliminates the
jurisdictional gap.3 Finally, I would hold that a tribe'sexercise of this delegated power bars subsequent federal
prosecution for the same offense. I respectfully dissent.

3 Justice Thomas suggests that this delegation may violate the separation of powers. Ante, at 215-217. But we are not resolving the question
whether Lara could be "prosecuted pursuant to . . . delegated power," 324
F. 3d 635, 640 (CA8 2003), only whether the prosecution was in fact the
exercise of an inherent power, see Pet. for Cert. (I), and whether the
exercise of a delegated power would implicate the protection against double jeopardy.

HOUSEHOLD CREDIT SERVICES, INC., et al. v.

PFENNIG

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-857. Argued February 23, 2004--Decided April 21, 2004
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) regulates, inter alia, the disclosures

that credit card issuers must make to consumers, 15 U. S. C. $ 1637(a),
and provides consumers with a civil remedy for creditors' failure to comply, $ 1640. Among other things, the creditor's periodic balance statement to the consumer must include "[t]he amount of any finance charge,"

$ 1637(b)(4), which is defined as an amount "payable directly or indirectly by the [consumer], and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit," $ 1605(a). Section
1604(a) expressly gives to the Federal Reserve Board (Board) expansive
authority to prescribe regulations containing "such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions" as, in the Board's judgment, "are necessary or proper to effectuate [TILA's] purposes . . . , to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith." The
Board's Regulation Z interprets $ 1605(a)'s "finance charge" definition to
exclude "charges . . . for exceeding a credit limit" (over-limit fees).

Respondent holds a credit card issued by one of the petitioner financial institutions and in which the other holds an interest. Although the
parties' agreement set respondent's credit limit at $2,000, she was able
to make charges exceeding that limit, subject to a $29 over-limit fee for
each month in which her balance exceeded $2,000. While her monthly
billing statement disclosed the over-limit fees, the amount was not included as part of the "finance charge," consistent with Regulation Z.
Respondent filed suit alleging that petitioners violated TILA by failing
to classify over-limit fees as "finance charges," but the District Court
granted petitioners' motion to dismiss on the ground that Regulation Z
specifically excludes such fees. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that
the exclusion conflicts with $ 1605(a)'s plain language. Noting, first,
that, as a remedial statute, TILA must be liberally interpreted in favor
of consumers, the court then concluded that the over-limit fees in this
case were imposed "incident to an extension of credit" and therefore
fell squarely within $ 1605's language. That conclusion turned on the
distinction the court drew between unilateral acts of default, which
would not generate a "finance charge," and acts of default resulting from
an agreement between the creditor and the consumer, which would.

Held: Regulation Z is not an unreasonable interpretation of $ 1605.

Pp. 238-245.

(a) Because respondent does not challenge the Board's authority
under $ 1604(a) to issue binding regulations, this Court faces only two
questions. It asks, first, whether "Congress has directly spoken to the
precise question at issue," Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, in which case courts, as well
as the Board, "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent
of Congress," id., at 842-843. However, whenever Congress has "explicitly left a gap for the [implementing] agency to fill," the agency's
regulation is "given controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious,
or manifestly contrary to the statute." Id., at 843-844. Pp. 238-239.

(b) TILA itself does not explicitly address whether over-limit fees are
included within the "finance charge" definition. The Sixth Circuit did
not attempt to clarify the scope of $ 1605(a)'s critical term "incident to
the extension of credit." Because the phrase "incident to" does not
make clear whether a substantial (as opposed to a remote) connection is
required between an antecedent and its object, cf. Holly Farms Corp.
v. NLRB, 517 U. S. 392, 402, n. 9, it cannot be concluded that the term
"finance charge," standing alone, unambiguously includes over-limit
fees. Moreover, an examination of TILA's related provisions, as well
as the full text of $ 1605 itself, casts doubt on the Sixth Circuit's interpretation. A consumer holding an open-end credit plan may incur two
types of charges--finance charges and "other charges which may be
imposed as part of the plan." $$ 1637(a)(1)-(5). TILA does not make
clear which charges fall into each category, but its recognition of at least
two categories establishes that Congress did not contemplate that all
charges made in connection with an open-end credit plan would be considered "finance charges." And where TILA explicitly addresses overlimit fees, it defines them as fees imposed "in connection with an extension of credit," $ 1637(c)(1)(B)(iii), rather than "incident to an extension

of charges that fall within the "finance charge" definition includes
over-limit or comparable fees. Thus, $ 1605(a) is, at best, ambiguous.
Pp. 239-242.

(c) Regulation Z's exclusion of over-limit fees from "finance charge[s]"
is in no way manifestly contrary to $ 1605. Regulation Z defines
"finance charge" as "the cost of consumer credit," excluding as less relevant to determining such cost a number of specific payments, including
over-limit fees, that do not automatically recur or are imposed only
when a consumer defaults on a credit agreement. Because over-limit
fees are imposed only in the latter circumstance, they can reasonably be

characterized as a penalty for defaulting on the credit agreement, and
the Board's decision to exclude them from "finance charge[s]" is reasonable. Despite the Board's rational decision to adopt a uniform rule excluding from the term "finance charge" all penalties imposed for exceeding the credit limit, the lower court adopted a case-by-case approach
contingent on whether an act of default was "unilateral." That approach would prove unworkable to creditors and, more importantly, lead
to significant confusion for the consumer, who would be able to decipher
if a charge is more properly a "finance charge" or an "other charge" only
by recalling the details of the particular transaction that caused him to
exceed his credit limit. In most cases, the consumer would not even
know the relevant facts, which are contingent on the nature of the authorization given by the creditor to the merchant. Here, the Board
accomplished all of the objectives set forth in $ 1604(a)'s broad delegation of rulemaking authority when it set forth a clear, easy to apply (and
easy to enforce) rule that highlights the charges the Board determined
to be most relevant to a consumer's credit decisions. Pp. 242-245.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 82Stat. 146, in order to promote the "informed use of credit"

by consumers. 15 U. S. C. $ 1601(a). To that end, TILA'sdisclosure provisions seek to ensure "meaningful disclosure
of credit terms." Ibid. Further, Congress delegated ex-pansive authority to the Federal Reserve Board (Board)
to enact appropriate regulations to advance this purpose.$ 1604(a). We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 957 (2003), to decide whether the Board's Regulation Z, which specificallyexcludes fees imposed for exceeding a credit limit (over-limit
fees) from the definition of "finance charge," is an unreason-able interpretation of $ 1605. We conclude that it is not, and,
accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit.

I
Respondent, Sharon Pfennig, holds a credit card initiallyissued by petitioner Household Credit Services, Inc. (Household), but in which petitioner MBNA America Bank, N. A.,now holds an interest through the acquisition of Household's
credit card portfolio. Although the terms of respondent'scredit card agreement set respondent's credit limit at $2,000,
respondent was able to make charges exceeding that limit,subject to a $29 "over-limit fee" for each month in which her
balance exceeded $2,000.TILA regulates, inter alia, the substance and form of disclosures that creditors offering "open end consumer creditplans" (a term that includes credit card accounts) must make
to consumers, $ 1637(a), and provides a civil remedy for con-sumers who suffer damages as a result of a creditor's failure
to comply with TILA's provisions, $ 1640.1 When a creditor

contemplates repeated transactions, which prescribes the terms of such

Opinion of the Court
and a consumer enter into an open-end consumer credit plan,the creditor is required to provide to the consumer a statement for each billing cycle for which there is an outstandingbalance due. $ 1637(b). The statement must include the account's outstanding balance at the end of the billing period,$ 1637(b)(8), and "[t]he amount of any finance charge added
to the account during the period, itemized to show the
amounts, if any, due to the application of percentage ratesand the amount, if any, imposed as a minimum or fixed

charge," $ 1637(b)(4). A "finance charge" is an amount "pay-able directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit
is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit." $ 1605(a).
The Board has interpreted this definition to exclude
"[c]harges . . . for exceeding a credit limit." See 12 CFR

$ 226.4(c)(2) (2004) (Regulation Z). Thus, although respondent's billing statement disclosed the imposition of an overlimit fee when she exceeded her $2,000 credit limit, consistent with Regulation Z, the amount was not included as part
of the "finance charge."

On August 24, 1999, respondent filed a complaint in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio on behalf of a purported nationwide class of all consumers who were charged or assessed over-limit fees by petitioners. Respondent alleged in her complaint that petitioners
allowed her and each of the other putative class members to
exceed their credit limits, thereby subjecting them to overlimit fees. Petitioners violated TILA, respondent alleged,
by failing to classify the over-limit fees as "finance charges"
and thereby "misrepresented the true cost of credit" to
respondent and the other class members. Class Action
Complaint in No. C2-99 815, |||| 34-39, App. to Pet. for Cert.
A39-A40. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on
the ground that Regulation Z specifically excludes overlimit fees from the definition of "finance charge." 12 CFR

Opinion of the Court

$ 226.4(c)(2) (2004). The District Court agreed and granted
petitioners' motion to dismiss.

On appeal, respondent argued, and the Court of Appeals
agreed, that Regulation Z's explicit exclusion of over-limit
fees from the definition of "finance charge" conflicts with the
plain language of 15 U. S. C. $ 1605(a). The Court of Appeals
first noted that, as a remedial statute, TILA must be liberally interpreted in favor of consumers. 295 F. 3d 522,
528 (CA6 2002). The Court of Appeals then concluded that
the over-limit fees in this case were imposed "incident to
the extension of credit" and therefore fell squarely within

$ 1605's definition of "finance charge." Id., at 528-529. The
Court of Appeals' conclusion turned on the distinction between unilateral acts of default and acts of default resulting
from consumers' requests for additional credit, exceeding a
predetermined credit limit, that creditors grant. Under the
Court of Appeals' reasoning, a penalty imposed due to a unilateral act of default would not constitute a "finance charge."
Id., at 530-531. Respondent alleged in her complaint, however, that petitioners "allowed [her] to make charges and/or
assessed [her] charges that allowed her balance to exceed
her credit limit of two thousand dollars," App. to Pet. for
Cert. A39, || 34, putting her actions under the category of
acts of default resulting from consumers' requests for additional credit, exceeding a predetermined credit limit, that
creditors grant. The Court of Appeals held that because
petitioners "made an additional extension of credit to [respondent] over and above the alleged `credit limit,' " id., || 35,
and charged the over-limit fee as a condition of this additional extension of credit, the over-limit fee clearly and unmistakably fell under the definition of a "finance charge."
295 F. 3d, at 530. Based on its reading of respondent's allegations, the Court of Appeals limited its holding to "those
instances in which the creditor knowingly permits the credit
card holder to exceed his or her credit limit and then imposes

Congress has expressly delegated to the Board the authority to prescribe regulations containing "such classifications,
differentiations, or other provisions" as, in the judgment of
the Board, "are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of [TILA], to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof,
or to facilitate compliance therewith." $ 1604(a). Thus, the
Court has previously recognized that "the [Board] has
played a pivotal role in `setting [TILA] in motion. . . .' "
Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)
(quoting Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States,
288 U. S. 294, 315 (1933)). Indeed, "Congress has specifically
designated the [Board] and staff as the primary source for
interpretation and application of truth-in-lending law." 444
U. S., at 566. As the Court recognized in Ford Motor Credit
Co., twice since the passage of TILA, Congress has made
this intention clear: first by providing a good-faith defense
to creditors who comply with the Board's rules and regulations, 88 Stat. 1518, codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1640(f), and, second, by expanding this good-faith defense to creditors who
conform to "any interpretation or approval by an official or
employee of the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by
the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals," 90
Stat. 197, codified as amended, at $ 1640(f). 444 U. S., at
566-567.

Respondent does not challenge the Board's authority to
issue binding regulations. Thus, in determining whether

Opinion of the Court
Regulation Z's interpretation of TILA's text is binding on
the courts, we are faced with only two questions. We first
ask whether "Congress has directly spoken to the precise
question at issue." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). If
so, courts, as well as the agency, "must give effect to the
unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id., at 842-
843. However, whenever Congress has "explicitly left a gap
for the agency to fill," the agency's regulation is "given controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." Id., at 843-844.

A
TILA itself does not explicitly address whether over-limit
fees are included within the definition of "finance charge."
Congress defined "finance charge" as "all charges, payable
directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is
extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor
as an incident to the extension of credit." $ 1605(a). The
Court of Appeals, however, made no attempt to clarify the
scope of the critical term "incident to the extension of
credit." The Court of Appeals recognized that, " `[i]n ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look
to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the
language and design of the statute as a whole.' " 295 F. 3d,
at 529-530 (quoting K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S.
281, 291 (1988)). However, the Court of Appeals failed to
examine TILA's other provisions, or even the surrounding
language in $ 1605, before reaching its conclusion. Because
petitioners would not have imposed the over-limit fee had
they not "granted [respondent's] request for additional
credit, which resulted in her exceeding her credit limit," the
Court of Appeals held that the over-limit fee in this case
fell squarely within $ 1605(a)'s definition of "finance charge."
295 F. 3d, at 528-529. Thus, the Court of Appeals rested

240 HOUSEHOLD CREDIT SERVICES, INC. v. PFENNIG

Opinion of the Court
its holding primarily on its particular characterization of thetransaction that led to the over-limit charge in this case.

3

The Court of Appeals' characterization of the transactionin this case, however, is not supported even by the facts as

set forth in respondent's complaint. Respondent alleged inher complaint that the over-limit fee is imposed for each
month in which her balance exceeds the original credit limit.App. to Pet. for Cert. A39, || 35. If this were true, however,
the over-limit fee would be imposed not as a direct result ofan extension of credit for a purchase that caused respondent
to exceed her $2,000 limit, but rather as a result of the factthat her charges exceeded her $2,000 limit at the time respondent's monthly charges were officially calculated. Be-cause over-limit fees, regardless of a creditor's particular
billing practices, are imposed only when a consumer exceedshis credit limit, it is perfectly reasonable to characterize an
over-limit fee not as a charge imposed for obtaining an exten-sion of credit over a consumer's credit limit, but rather as a
penalty for violating the credit agreement.The Court of Appeals thus erred in resting its conclusion
solely on this particular characterization of the details ofcredit card transactions, a characterization that is not clearly
compelled by the terms and definitions of TILA, and onewith which others could reasonably disagree. Certainly, regardless of how the fee is characterized, there is at leastsome connection between the over-limit fee and an extension
of credit. But, this Court has recognized that the phrase

3 Respondent does not attempt to defend the Court of Appeals' reasoning in this Court and has abandoned her principal argument on appeal--
that Regulation Z conflicts with the plain language of $ 1605. Instead,
respondent maintains that the Board's exclusion of over-limit fees in Regulation Z is not challenged in this case because Regulation Z does not
cover over-limit fees imposed for authorized extensions of credit. Because respondent did not advance this theory in the Court of Appeals, and
did not raise it in her brief in opposition accompanied by an appropriate
cross-petition, see Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S.
355, 364 (1994), we decline to consider it here.

Opinion of the Court
"incident to or in conjunction with" implies some necessaryconnection between the antecedent and its object, although

it "does not place beyond rational debate the nature or ex-tent of the required connection." Holly Farms Corp. v.
NLRB, 517 U. S. 392, 403, n. 9 (1996) (internal quotationmarks omitted). In other words, the phrase "incident to"
does not make clear whether a substantial (as opposed to aremote) connection is required. Thus, unlike the Court of
Appeals, we cannot conclude that the term "finance charge"unambiguously includes over-limit fees. That term, standing alone, is ambiguous.

Moreover, an examination of TILA's related provisions, aswell as the full text of $ 1605 itself, casts doubt on the Court

of Appeals' interpretation of the statute. A consumer hold-ing an open-end credit plan may incur two types of charges--
finance charges and "other charges which may be imposed aspart of the plan." $$ 1637(a)(1)-(5). TILA does not make
clear which charges fall into each category. But TILA's rec-ognition of at least two categories of charges does make clear
that Congress did not contemplate that all charges made in
connection with an open-end credit plan would be considered"finance charges." And where TILA does explicitly address

over-limit fees, it defines them as fees imposed "in connec-tion with an extension of credit," $ 1637(c)(1)(B)(iii), rather
than "incident to the extension of credit," $ 1605(a). Fur-thermore, none of $ 1605's specific examples of charges that
fall within the definition of "finance charge" includes over-limit or comparable fees. See,

e. g., $ 1605(a)(2) ("[s]ervice or
carrying charge"); $ 1605(a)(3) (loan fee or similar charge);$ 1605(a)(6) (mortgage broker fees).

4 Additionally, by specifically excepting charges from the term "finance
charge" that would otherwise be included under a broad reading of "incident to the extension of credit," see $ 1605(a) (charges of a type payable in
a comparable cash transaction); ibid. (fees imposed by third-party closing
agents); $ 1605(d)(1) (fees and charges relating to perfecting security interests); $ 1605(e) (fees relating to the extension of credit secured by real

242 HOUSEHOLD CREDIT SERVICES, INC. v. PFENNIG

Opinion of the Court
As our prior discussion indicates, the best interpretationof the term "finance charge" may exclude over-limit fees.

But $ 1605(a) is, at best, ambiguous, because neither $ 1605(a)nor its surrounding provisions provides a clear answer.
While we acknowledge that there may be some fees not ex-plicitly addressed by $ 1605(a)'s definition of "finance charge"
but which are unambiguously included in or excluded by thatdefinition, over-limit fees are not such fees.

B
Because $ 1605 is ambiguous, the Board's regulation imple-menting $ 1605 "is binding in the courts unless procedurally

defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestlycontrary to the statute."

United States v. Mead Corp., 533U. S. 218, 227 (2001).

Regulation Z's exclusion of over-limit fees from the term"finance charge" is in no way manifestly contrary to $ 1605.
Regulation Z defines the term "finance charge" as "the costof consumer credit." 12 CFR $ 226.4 (2004). It specifically excludes from the definition of "finance charge" thefollowing:

"(1) Application fees charged to all applicants for credit,whether or not credit is actually extended.
"(2) Charges for actual unanticipated late payment, for
exceeding a credit limit, or for delinquency, default, or
a similar occurrence.

"(3) Charges imposed by a financial institution for paying items that overdraw an account, unless the paymentof such items and the imposition of the charge were previously agreed upon in writing.
"(4) Fees charged for participation in a credit plan,
whether assessed on an annual or other periodic basis.

property), Congress appears to have excluded such an expansive interpretation of the term.

Opinion of the Court
"(5) Seller's points.
"(6) Interest forfeited as a result of an interest reduction required by law on a time deposit used as securityfor an extension of credit.

"(7) [Certain fees related to real estate.]
"(8) Discounts offered to induce payment for a purchase
by cash, check, or other means, as provided in section167(b) of the Act." $ 226.4(c) (emphasis added).

The Board adopted the regulation to emphasize "disclosuresthat are relevant to credit decisions, as opposed to disclosures related to events occurring after the initial creditchoice," because "the primary goals of [TILA] are not particularly enhanced by regulatory provisions relating to changesin terms on outstanding obligations and on the effects of the
failure to comply with the terms of the obligation." 45 Fed.Reg. 80649 (1980). The Board's decision to emphasize disclosures that are most relevant to a consumer's initial creditdecisions reflects an understanding that "

[m]eaningful disclosure does not mean more disclosure," but instead "de-scribes a balance between `competing considerations of complete disclosure . . . and the need to avoid . . . [informational
overload].' " Ford Motor Credit Co., 444 U. S., at 568 (quot-ing S. Rep. No. 96-73, p. 3 (1979)). Although the fees excluded from the term "finance charge" in Regulation Z (e. g.,application charges, late payment charges, and over-limit
fees) might be relevant to a consumer's credit decision, theBoard rationally concluded that these fees--which are not
automatically recurring or are imposed only when a con-sumer defaults on a credit agreement--are less relevant to
determining the true cost of credit. Because over-limit fees,
which are imposed only when a consumer breaches the terms
of his credit agreement, can reasonably be characterized as
a penalty for defaulting on the credit agreement, the Board's
decision to exclude them from the term "finance charge" is
surely reasonable.

244 HOUSEHOLD CREDIT SERVICES, INC. v. PFENNIG

Opinion of the Court
In holding that Regulation Z conflicts with $ 1605's defini-tion of the term "finance charge," the Court of Appeals ignored our warning that "judges ought to refrain from sub-stituting their own interstitial lawmaking for that of the
[Board]." Ford Motor Credit Co., supra, at 568. Despitethe Board's rational decision to adopt a uniform rule excluding from the term "finance charge" all penalties imposed for
exceeding the credit limit, the Court of Appeals adopted acase-by-case approach contingent on whether an act of default was "unilateral." Putting aside the lack of textual sup-port for this approach, the Court of Appeals' approach would
prove unworkable to creditors and, more importantly, lead
to significant confusion for consumers. Under the Court of
Appeals' rule, a consumer would be able to decipher if a
charge is considered a "finance charge" or an "other charge"
each month only by recalling the details of the particular
transaction that caused the consumer to exceed his credit
limit. In most cases, the consumer would not even know
the relevant facts, which are contingent on the nature of the
authorization given by the creditor to the merchant. Moreover, the distinction between "unilateral" acts of default and
acts of default where a consumer exceeds his credit limit
(but has not thereby renegotiated his credit limit and is still
subject to the over-limit fee) is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the workings of the credit card industry.
As the Board explained below, a creditor's "authorization" of
a particular point-of-sale transaction does not represent a
final determination that a particular transaction is within a
consumer's credit limit because the authorization system is
not suited to identify instantaneously and accurately overlimit transactions. Brief for Board of Governors of Federal
Reserve System as Amicus Curiae in No. 00-4213 (CA6),
pp. 7-9.

Congress has authorized the Board to make "such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and [to] provide
for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transac541US1 Unit: $U38 [05-21-06 17:55:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

all of these objectives by setting forth a clear, easy to apply(and easy to enforce) rule that highlights the charges the
Board determined to be most relevant to a consumer's creditdecisions. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.

It is so ordered.

ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION et al. v.SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

DISTRICT et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1343. Argued January 14, 2004--Decided April 28, 2004
Respondent South Coast Air Quality Management District (District)--the

California subdivision responsible for air pollution control in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area--enacted six Fleet Rules prohibiting the
purchase or lease by various public and private fleet operators of vehicles that do not comply with requirements in the Rules. Petitioner Engine Manufacturers Association sued the District and its officials, claiming that the Fleet Rules were pre-empted by $ 209 of the federal Clean
Air Act (CAA), which prohibits the adoption or attempted enforcement
of any state or local "standard relating to the control of emissions from
new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines," 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a).
In upholding the Rules, the District Court found that they were not
"standard[s]" under $ 209 because they regulate only the purchase of
vehicles that are otherwise certified for sale in California, and distinguished decisions of the First and Second Circuits pre-empting similar
state laws as involving a restriction on vehicle sales rather than vehicle
purchases. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. The Fleet Rules do not escape pre-emption just because they address the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale.
Neither the District Court's interpretation of "standard" to include only
regulations that compel manufacturers to meet specified emission limits
nor its resulting distinction between purchase and sales restrictions
finds support in $ 209(a)'s text or the CAA's structure. The ordinary
meaning of language employed by Congress is assumed accurately to
express its legislative purpose. Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly,
Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194. Today, as when $ 209(a) became law, "standard"
means that which "is established by authority, custom, or general consent, as a model or example; criterion; test." Webster's Second New
International Dictionary 2455. The criteria referred to in $ 209 relate
to the emission characteristics of a vehicle or engine. This interpretation is consistent with the use of "standard" throughout Title II of the
CAA. Defining "standard" to encompass only production mandates

Syllabus
confuses standards with methods of enforcing standards. Manufacturers (or purchasers) can be made responsible for ensuring that vehicles
comply with emission standards, but the standards themselves are separate from enforcement techniques. While standards target vehicles
and engines, standard-enforcement efforts can be directed toward manufacturers or purchasers. This distinction is borne out in the enforcement provisions immediately following CAA $ 202. And $ 246, which
requires federal purchasing restrictions, shows that Congress contemplated the enforcement of emission standards through purchase requirements. A purchase/sale distinction also makes no sense, since a manufacturer's right to sell federally approved vehicles is meaningless absent
a purchaser's right to buy them. Pp. 252-258.

2. While at least certain aspects of the Fleet Rules appear to be preempted, the case is remanded for the lower courts to address, in light
of the principles articulated here, questions neither passed on below nor
presented in the certiorari petition that may affect the ultimate disposition of petitioners' suit. Pp. 258-259.

Opinion of the Court
fleet operators of vehicles that do not comply with strin-gent emission requirements. The question in this case is

whether these local Fleet Rules escape pre-emption under$ 209(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 81 Stat. 502, as renumbered and amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a), because they ad-dress the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture
or sale. I

The District is responsible under state law for developingand implementing a "comprehensive basinwide air quality
management plan" to reduce emission levels and therebyachieve and maintain "state and federal ambient air quality
standards." Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 40402(e)(West 1996). Between June and October 2000, the District
adopted six Fleet Rules. The Rules govern operators offleets of street sweepers (Rule 1186.1), of passenger cars,
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles (Rule 1191), ofpublic transit vehicles and urban buses (Rule 1192), of solid
waste collection vehicles (Rule 1193), of airport passengertransportation vehicles, including shuttles and taxicabs
picking up airline passengers (Rule 1194), and of heavy-dutyon-road vehicles (Rule 1196). All six Rules apply to public
operators; three apply to private operators as well (Rules1186.1, 1193, and 1194).

The Fleet Rules contain detailed prescriptions regardingthe types of vehicles that fleet operators must purchase or
lease when adding or replacing fleet vehicles. Four of theRules (1186.1, 1192, 1193, and 1196) require the purchase
or lease of "alternative-fuel vehicles," 1 and the other two

1 These Rules define "alternative-fuel vehicles" in varying ways, but all
exclude vehicles that run on diesel. See Rule 1186.1(c)(2), App. 17 (a vehicle with an engine that "use[s] compressed or liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (propane), methanol, electricity, or fuel cells. Hybridelectric and dual-fuel technologies that use diesel fuel are not considered

emission specifications established by the California Air Re-sources Board (CARB).

3 CARB is a statewide regulatory

body that California law designates as "the air pollution con-trol agency for all purposes set forth in federal law." Cal.

also adds that the vehicle must "mee[t] the emission requirements of Title
13, Section 1956.1 of the California Code of Regulations"); Rule 1193(c)(1),
id., at 52 (a vehicle that "uses compressed or liquefied natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas, methanol, electricity, fuel cells, or other advanced technologies that do not rely on diesel fuel"); Rule 1196(c)(1), id., at 66-67 (same
definition as Rule 1193 for the most part, but also adds that the vehicle
must be "certified by the California Air Resources Board").

2 Rule 1191(c)(1), id., at 24-25, defines "alternative-fueled vehicle" as a

vehicle that "is not powered by gasoline or diesel fuel and emits hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, or nitrogen oxides, on an individual basis at least
equivalent to or lower than a ULEV [acronym described in n. 3, infra]."
Rule 1194(c)(2), App. 59, defines "alternative-fueled vehicle" as a vehicle
that "is not powered by gasoline or diesel fuel."

3 More specifically, Rules 1191(d), (e)(1), id., at 27-28, require that these

vehicles comply with CARB's Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV), Ultra-LowEmission Vehicle (ULEV), Super-Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle (SULEV),
or Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards. Rule 1194(d), id., at 61-63,
requires that the vehicles comply with the ULEV, SULEV, or ZEV standards. LEV, ULEV, SULEV, and ZEV are acronyms adopted by CARB as
part of a federally approved emission reduction program. This program
establishes five tiers of vehicles based on their emission characteristics:
Transitional Low-Emission Vehicles (TLEVs); LEVs; ULEVs; SULEVs;
and ZEVs. The tiers are subject to varying emission limitations for carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nonmethane organic gases, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, $$ 1960.1(e)(3),
(g), (h)(2), (p), $ 1961(a) (2004). No vehicle may be sold in California unless it meets the TLEV, LEV, ULEV, SULEV, or ZEV requirements.
See Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $$ 43009, 43016-43017, 43102, 43105,
43150-43156 (West 1996). Additionally, manufacturers are obligated to
meet overall "fleet average" emission requirements. The fleet average
emission requirements decrease over time, requiring manufacturers to sell
progressively cleaner mixes of vehicles. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13,

$$ 1960.1(g)(2), 1961(b) (2004). Manufacturers retain flexibility to decide
how many vehicles in each emission tier to sell in order to meet the fleet
average. See 158 F. Supp. 2d 1107, 1113-1114 (CD Cal. 2001).

Opinion of the Court
Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 39602 (West 1996). The Rulesrequire operators to keep records of their purchases and

leases and provide access to them upon request. See, e. g.,Rule 1186.1(g)(1), App. 23. Violations expose fleet operators
to fines and other sanctions. See Cal. Health & Safety CodeAnn. $$ 42400-42410, 40447.5 (West 1996 and Supp. 2004).

In August 2000, petitioner Engine Manufacturers Asso-ciation sued the District and its officials, also respondents,
claiming that the Fleet Rules are pre-empted by $ 209 of theCAA, which prohibits the adoption or attempted enforcement of any state or local "standard relating to the controlof emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines." 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a).4 The District Courtgranted summary judgment to respondents, upholding the
Rules in their entirety. It held that the Rules were not"standard[s]" under $ 209(a) because they regulate only the
purchase of vehicles that are otherwise certified for sale inCalifornia. The District Court recognized that the Courts
of Appeals for the First and Second Circuits had previouslyheld that CAA $ 209(a) pre-empted state laws mandating
that a specified percentage of a manufacturer's in-state salesbe of "zero-emission vehicles." See Association of Int'l Automobile Mfrs., Inc. v. Commissioner, Mass. Dept. of Envi-ronmental Protection, 208 F. 3d 1, 6-7 (CA1 2000); American Automobile Mfrs. Assn. v. Cahill, 152 F. 3d 196, 200(CA2 1998).

Opinion of the Court

regulation does not compel manufacturers to meet a newemissions limit, but rather affects the purchase of vehicles,

as the Fleet Rules do, that regulation is not a standard."158 F. Supp. 2d 1107, 1118 (CD Cal. 2001).

The Ninth Circuit affirmed on the reasoning of the DistrictCourt. 309 F. 3d 550 (2002). We granted certiorari. 539
U. S. 914 (2003). II

Section 209(a) of the CAA states:

"No State or any political subdivision thereof shall adoptor attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motorvehicle engines subject to this part. No State shall require certification, inspection, or any other approval re-lating to the control of emissions . . . as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), orregistration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,
or equipment." 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a).
The District Court's determination that this express pre-emption provision did not invalidate the Fleet Rules hinged

on its interpretation of the word "standard" to include onlyregulations that compel manufacturers to meet specified
emission limits. This interpretation of "standard" in turncaused the court to draw a distinction between purchase
restrictions (not pre-empted) and sale restrictions (pre-empted). Neither the manufacturer-specific interpretation
of "standard" nor the resulting distinction between purchaseand sale restrictions finds support in the text of $ 209(a) or
the structure of the CAA."Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinarymeaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose." Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985). Today, as in 1967 when $ 209(a)
became law, "standard" is defined as that which "is estab541US1 Unit: $U39 [05-08-06 20:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lished by authority, custom, or general consent, as a modelor example; criterion; test." Webster's Second New International Dictionary 2455 (1945). The criteria referred to in$ 209(a) relate to the emission characteristics of a vehicle or
engine. To meet them the vehicle or engine must not emitmore than a certain amount of a given pollutant, must be
equipped with a certain type of pollution-control device, or
must have some other design feature related to the controlof emissions. This interpretation is consistent with the use

of "standard" throughout Title II of the CAA (which governsemissions from moving sources) to denote requirements such
as numerical emission levels with which vehicles or engines
must comply, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 7521(a)(3)(B)(ii), or emissioncontrol technology with which they must be equipped, e. g.,

$ 7521(a)(6).

Respondents, like the courts below, engraft onto this
meaning of "standard" a limiting component, defining it as
only "[a] production mandat[e] that require[s] manufacturers
to ensure that the vehicles they produce have particular
emissions characteristics, whether individually or in the aggregate." Brief for Respondent South Coast Air Quality
Management District 13 (emphases added). This confuses
standards with the means of enforcing standards. Manufacturers (or purchasers) can be made responsible for ensuring
that vehicles comply with emission standards, but the standards themselves are separate from those enforcement
techniques. While standards target vehicles or engines,
standard-enforcement efforts that are proscribed by $ 209
can be directed to manufacturers or purchasers.

The distinction between "standards," on the one hand, and
methods of standard enforcement, on the other, is borne out
in the provisions immediately following $ 202. These separate provisions enforce the emission criteria--i. e., the $ 202
standards. Section 203 prohibits manufacturers from selling any new motor vehicle that is not covered by a "certificate of conformity." 42 U. S. C. $ 7522(a). Section 206

Opinion of the Court

enables manufacturers to obtain such a certificate by dem-onstrating to the Environmental Protection Agency that

their vehicles or engines conform to the $ 202 standards.$ 7525. Sections 204 and 205 subject manufacturers, dealers, and others who violate the CAA to fines imposed in civilor administrative enforcement actions. $$ 7523-7524. By
defining "standard" as a "production mandate directed toward manufacturers," respondents lump together $ 202 andthese other distinct statutory provisions, acknowledging a

standard to be such only when it is combined with a mandatethat prevents manufacturers from selling noncomplying
vehicles.That a standard is a standard even when not enforced
through manufacturer-directed regulation can be seen inCongress's use of the term in another portion of the CAA.
As the District Court recognized, CAA $ 246 (in conjunctionwith its accompanying provisions) requires state-adopted
and federally approved "restrictions on the purchase of fleet
vehicles to meet clean-air standards." 158 F. Supp. 2d, at
1118 (emphasis added); see also 42 U. S. C. $$ 7581-7590.
(Respondents do not defend the District's Fleet Rules as authorized by this provision; the Rules do not comply with all
of the requirements that it contains.) Clearly, Congress
contemplated the enforcement of emission standards through
purchase requirements.6

Respondents contend that their qualified meaning of
"standard" is necessary to prevent $ 209(a) from pre-empting
"far too much" by "encompass[ing] a broad range of statelevel clean-air initiatives" such as voluntary incentive pro6 The District Court reasoned that "[i]t is not rational to conclude that
the CAA would authorize purchasing restrictions on the one hand, and
prohibit them, as a prohibited adoption of a `standard,' on the other." 158
F. Supp. 2d, at 1118. This reasoning is flawed; it is not irrational to view
Congress's prescription of numerous detailed requirements for such programs as inconsistent with unconstrained state authority to enact programs that ignore those requirements.

grams. Brief for Respondent South Coast Air Quality Man-agement District 29; id., at 29-30. But it is hard to see why

limitation to mandates on manufacturers is necessary for thispurpose; limitation to mandates on manufacturers and purchasers, or to mandates on anyone, would have the samesalvific effect. We need not resolve application of $ 209(a) to
voluntary incentive programs in this case, since all the FleetRules are mandates.

In addition to having no basis in the text of the statute,treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions differently for pre-emption purposes would make no sense. Themanufacturer's right to sell federally approved vehicles is
meaningless in the absence of a purchaser's right to buythem. It is true that the Fleet Rules at issue here cover
only certain purchasers and certain federally certified vehi-cles, and thus do not eliminate all demand for covered vehicles. But if one State or political subdivision may enactsuch rules, then so may any other; and the end result would
undo Congress's carefully calibrated regulatory scheme.A command, accompanied by sanctions, that certain purchasers may buy only vehicles with particular emission char-acteristics is as much an "attempt to enforce" a "standard"
as a command, accompanied by sanctions, that a certain per-centage of a manufacturer's sales volume must consist of
such vehicles. We decline to read into $ 209(a) a purchase/sale distinction that is not to be found in the text of $ 209(a)
or the structure of the CAA.

III
The dissent expresses many areas of disagreement withour interpretation, but this should not obscure its agreement

with our answer to the question "whether these local FleetRules escape pre-emption . . . because they address the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale."
Supra, at 249. The dissent joins us in answering "no." See
post, at 262-263 (opinion of Souter, J.). It reaches a differ541US1 Unit: $U39 [05-08-06 20:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

ent outcome in the case because (1) it feels free to read intothe unconditional words of the statute a requirement for the

courts to determine which purchase restrictions in fact co-erce manufacture and which do not; and (2) because it believes that Fleet Rules containing a "commercial availability"proviso do not coerce manufacture.

As to the first point: The language of $ 209(a) is categorical.
It is (as we have discussed) impossible to find in it an excep-tion for standards imposed through purchase restrictions

rather than directly upon manufacturers; it is even more in-ventive to discover an exception for only that

subcategory of
standards-imposed-through-purchase-restrictions that does
not coerce manufacture. But even if one accepts that invention, one cannot conclude that these "provisos" save the day.
For if a vehicle of the mandated type were commercially
available, thus eliminating application of the proviso, the
need to sell vehicles to persons governed by the Rule would
effectively coerce manufacturers into meeting the artificially
created demand. To say, as the dissent does, that this would
be merely the consequence of "market demand and free competition," post, at 263, is fanciful. The demand is a demand,
not generated by the market but compelled by the Rules,
which in turn effectively compels production. To think that
the Rules are invalid until such time as one manufacturer
makes a compliant vehicle available, whereupon they become
binding, seems to us quite bizarre.

The dissent objects to our interpretive method, which neither invokes the "presumption against preemption" to determine the scope of pre-emption nor delves into legislative
history. Post, at 260-261. Application of those methods, on
which not all Members of this Court agree, demonstrably
makes no difference to resolution of the principal question,
which the dissent (after applying them) answers the same as
we. As for the additional question that the dissent reaches,
we think the same is true: The textual obstacles to the
strained interpretation that would validate the Rules by rea541US1 Unit: $U39 [05-08-06 20:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

257Cite as: 541 U. S. 246 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
son of the "commercial availability" provisos are insurmount-able--principally, the categorical words of $ 209(a). The dissent contends that giving these words their natural mean-ing of barring implementation of standards at the purchase
and sale stage renders superfluous the second sentence of$ 209(a), which provides: "No State shall require certification,
inspection, or any other approval relating to the control of
emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicleengine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling

(if any), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicleengine, or equipment." 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a). We think it
not superfluous, since it makes clear that the term "attempt
to enforce" in the first sentence is not limited to the actual
imposition of penalties for violation, but includes steps preliminary to that action. Ibid. The sentence is, however,
fatal to the dissent's interpretation of the statute. It categorically prohibits "certification, inspection, or any other approval" as conditions precedent to sale. Why in the world
would it do that if it had no categorical objection to standards imposed at the sale stage? Why disable the States
from assuring compliance with requirements that they are
authorized to impose?

The dissent next charges that our interpretation attributes carelessness to Congress because $ 246 mandates fleet
purchasing restrictions, but does so without specifying "notwithstanding" $ 209(a). Post, at 264. That addition might
have been nice, but hardly seems necessary. It is obvious,
after all, that the principal sales restrictions against which

$ 209(a) is directed are those requiring compliance with
state-imposed standards. What $ 246 mandates are fleet
purchase restrictions under federal standards designed precisely for federally required clean-fuel fleet vehicle programs--which programs, in turn, must be federally approved as meeting detailed federal specifications. It is not
surprising that a "notwithstanding" $ 209(a) did not come to
mind. Far from casting doubt upon our interpretation, $ 246

Opinion of the Court

is impossible to reconcile with the dissent's interpretation.The fleet purchase standards it mandates must comply

strictly with federal specifications, being neither more le-nient nor more demanding. But what is the use of imposing
such a limitation if the States are entirely free to imposetheir own fleet purchase standards with entirely different
specifications?Finally, the dissent says that we should "admit" that our
opinion pre-empts voluntary incentive programs. Post, at265-266. Voluntary programs are not at issue in this case,
and are significantly different from command-and-controlregulation. Suffice it to say that nothing in the present
opinion necessarily entails pre-emption of voluntary pro-grams. It is at least arguable that the phrase "adopt or attempt to enforce any standard" refers only to standards that
are enforceable--a possibility reinforced by the fact that theprohibition is imposed only on entities (States and political

subdivisions) that have power to enforce.

IV
The courts below held all six of the Fleet Rules to be en-tirely outside the pre-emptive reach of $ 209(a) based on reasoning that does not withstand scrutiny. In light of theprinciples articulated above, it appears likely that at least
certain aspects of the Fleet Rules are pre-empted. For ex-ample, the District may have attempted to enforce CARB's
ULEV, SULEV, and ZEV standards when, in Rule 1194, itrequired 50% of new passenger-car and medium-duty-vehicle
purchases by private airport-shuttle van operators to "meetULEV, SULEV, or ZEV emission standards" after July 1,
2001, and 100% to meet those standards after July 1, 2002.7See Rules 1194(d)(2)(A)-(B), App. 62.

It does not necessarily follow, however, that the FleetRules are pre-empted

in toto. We have not addressed a

number of issues that may affect the ultimate disposition ofpetitioners' suit, including the scope of petitioners' challenge,

whether some of the Fleet Rules (or some applications ofthem) can be characterized as internal state purchase decisions (and, if so, whether a different standard for pre-emption applies), and whether $ 209(a) pre-empts the Fleet
Rules even as applied beyond the purchase of new vehicles(

e. g., to lease arrangements or to the purchase of used vehi-cles). These questions were neither passed on below nor

presented in the petition for certiorari. They are best ad-dressed in the first instance by the lower courts in light of
the principles articulated above.The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

$ 7543(a). The better reading of this provision rests on
two interpretive principles the majority opinion does not
address.

First, "[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those
[where] Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the
States have traditionally occupied, we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were
not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the
clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Medtronic, Inc.
v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wisconsin Public Intervenor
v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 605 (1991) (applying presumption
against preemption to a local regulation). The pertinence of
this presumption against federal preemption is clear enough
from the terms of the Act itself: $ 101 states that "air pollution prevention (that is, the reduction or elimination, through
any measures, of the amount of pollutants produced or created at the source) and air pollution control at its source is
the primary responsibility of States and local governments."
42 U. S. C. $ 7401(a)(3); 2 see Huron Portland Cement Co. v.
Detroit, 362 U. S. 440, 442 (1960) ("Legislation designed to
free from pollution the very air that people breathe clearly
falls within the exercise of even the most traditional concept
of what is compendiously known as the police power"). The
resulting presumption against displacing law enacted or authorized by a State applies both to the "question whether

that the 1967 amendments to the Act (which separated the existing Act
into separate titles) moved this finding to Title I rather than Title II
(which regulates motor vehicle emissions). There is no doubt that $ 101
recognizes state primacy over efforts to control pollution from all sources.
Indeed, $ 101 specifically notes that the "air pollution" to which it refers
is "brought about by," among other causes, "motor vehicles." 42 U. S. C.

choice, and the legislative history of this preemption provi-sion shows that Congress's purpose in passing it was to stop
States from imposing regulatory requirements that directly
limited what manufacturers could sell. During the hearingsleading up to the 1967 amendments, "[t]he auto industry . . .

was adamant that the nature of their manufacturing mecha-nism required a single national standard in order to eliminate undue economic strain on the industry." S. Rep.No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 33 (1967). Auto manufacturers sought to safeguard "[t]he ability of those engaged in themanufacture of automobiles to obtain clear and consistent
answers concerning emission controls," and to prevent "achaotic situation from developing in interstate commerce in
new motor vehicles." H. R. Rep. No. 728, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., 21 (1967). Cf. Air Pollution Control, Hearings on
S. 306 before a Special Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution of the Senate Committee on Public Works, 89th Cong.,
1st Sess., 91 (1965) (Sen. Muskie) ("Do you think a given
manufacturer could produce automobiles meeting 50 standards?"). Congress was not responding to concerns about
varying regional appetites for whatever vehicle models the
manufacturers did produce; it was addressing the industry's
fear that States would bar manufacturers from selling engines that failed to meet specifications that might be different in each State.3

3 In fact, Congress allowed California to adopt its own specification
standards, 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(b) ($ 209(b) of the Act); see also S. Rep.
No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 33 (1967), but only California was so indulged. Cf. 42 U. S. C. $ 7507 ($ 177 of the Act) (reiterating that States
may not require the creation of "a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine
different than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under California standards (a `third vehicle')").

Souter, J., dissenting

Section 209(a) can easily be read to give full effect to bothprinciples. As amended in 1967, $ 202 of the Act authorized

federal regulators to promulgate emissions standards for"any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor
vehicle engines." $ 202(a), 81 Stat. 499. The 1967 amend-ments in turn defined "new motor vehicle" as "a motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser," and a "new motor vehicleengine" as "an engine in a new motor vehicle or a motor

vehicle engine the equitable or legal title to which has neverbeen transferred to the ultimate purchaser." $ 212(3), 81
Stat. 503. Section 202 of the 1967 Act, in other words, is
naturally understood as concerning itself with vehicles prior
to sale and eligible to be sold. Section 203 further underscored this focus on what manufacturers could produce for
sale: as incorporated in the 1967 amendments, $ 203 prohibited a variety of acts by manufacturers, but left vehicle purchasers and users entirely unregulated. 81 Stat. 499.

On this permissible reading of the 1967 amendments,

$ 209(a) has no preemptive application to South Coast's fleet
purchase requirement. The National Government took over
the direct regulation of manufacturers' design specifications
addressing tailpipe emissions, and disabled States (the California exception aside, see n. 3, supra) from engaging in the
same project. The "standards" that $ 209(a) preempts, accordingly, are production mandates imposed directly on manufacturers as a condition of sale. Section 209(a) simply does
not speak to regulations that govern a vehicle buyer's choice
between various commercially available options.

This is not to say that every conceivable purchase restriction would be categorically free from preemption. A state
law prohibiting any purchase by any buyer of any vehicle
that failed to meet novel, state-specified emissions criteria
would have the same effect as direct regulation of car manufacturers, and would be preempted by $ 209(a) as an "attempt
to enforce [a] standard relating to the control of emissions

from new motor vehicles." 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a). But thatfantasy is of no concern here, owing to a third central point

that the majority passes over: South Coast's Fleet Rules re-quire the purchase of cleaner engines only if cleaner engines
are commercially available. E. g., App. 69 (Fleet Rule1196(e)(1)(C) (exempting fleets from Rule if no complying engine "is commercially available from any manufacturer . . .or could be used in a specific application")); see also App.
21, 30, 50, 55, 63 (Fleet Rules 1186.1(e), 1191(f)(8), 1192(e)(2),1193(e)(3), and 1194(e)(2)). If no one is selling cleaner engines, fleet owners are free to buy any vehicles they desire.The manufacturers would, of course, understand that a market existed for cleaner engines, and if one auto maker beganproducing them, others might well be induced to do the same;
but that would not matter under the Act, which was notadopted to exempt producers from market demand and free
competition. So long as a purchase requirement is subjectto a commercial availability proviso, there is no basis to condemn that kind of market-based limitation along with thestate command-and-control regulation of production specifications that prompted the passage of $ 209.In sum, I am reading "standard" in a practical way that
keeps the Act's preemption of standards in tune with Con-gress's object in providing for preemption, which was to prevent the States from forcing manufacturers to produce en-gines with particular characteristics as a legal condition of
sale. The majority's approach eliminates this considerationof legislative purposes, as well as the presumption against
preemption, by acting as though anything that could possiblybe described as a standard must necessarily be a "standard"
for the purposes of the Act: a standard is a standard is astandard.

4 The majority reveals its misalliance with Ger4 This same hypersimplification allows the majority to mischaracterize
my narrower definition of "standard" as the illegitimate creation of a
nontextual exception to $ 209(a)'s categorical preemption of standards.

II
Reading the statute this way not only does a better job ofhonoring preemption principles consistently with congressional intent, but avoids some difficulties on the majority'scontrary interpretation. To begin with, the Court's broad
definition of an " `attempt to enforce any standard relating tothe control of emissions,' "

ante, at 252, renders superfluousthe second sentence of $ 209(a), which provides that "[n]o

State shall require certification, inspection, or any other ap-proval relating to the control of emissions from any new
motor vehicle . . . as condition precedent to the initial retailsale, titling (if any), or registration of such motor vehicle,"
42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a). At the very least, on the majority'sview, it is hard to imagine any state inspection requirement
going to the control of emissions from a new motor vehiclethat would not be struck down anyway as an attempt to enforce an emissions standard.Next, on the majority's broad interpretation of "standard,"
Congress would seem to have been careless in drafting acritical section of the Act. In the one clear instance of which
we are aware in which the Act authorizes States to enactlaws that would otherwise be preempted by $ 209, Congress
expressly provided that the authorization is effective not-withstanding that preemption section. See 42 U. S. C.

$ 7507 (authorizing States to adopt California productionmandates "[n]otwithstanding section 7543(a) of this title").
The natural negative implication is that, if a statutory au-thorization does not include such a "notwithstanding" clause
or something similar, its subject matter would not otherwisebe preempted by $ 209(a). Given that, the majority's interpretation of the scope of $ 209(a) is difficult to square with$ 246, which requires States to establish fleet purchasing requirements for "covered fleet operator[s]" in ozone and car-bon monoxide "nonattainment areas" (that is, regions strug541US1 Unit: $U39 [05-08-06 20:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
gling with especially intractable pollution), 42 U. S. C. $ 7586.Section 246 thus requires States, in some cases, to establish

precisely the kind of purchaser regulations (adopted here bya lower level governmental authority) that the majority
claims have been preempted by $ 209(a). But $ 246 gives noindication that its subject matter would otherwise be preempted; there is certainly no "notwithstanding" clause.
This silence suggests that Congress never thought $ 209(a)would have any preemptive effect on fleet purchasing requirements like the ones at issue.Finally, the Court suggests that both voluntary incentive
programs, ante, at 254-255, and internal state purchasing
decisions, ante, at 258-259, may well be permissible on its
reading of $ 209(a). These suggestions are important in
avoiding apparent implausibility in the majority's position; if
a State were said to be barred even from deciding to run
a cleaner fleet than the National Government required, it
would take an airtight argument to convince anyone that
Congress could have meant such a thing. But it is difficult,
when actually applying the majority's expansive sense of
forbidden "standard," to explain how the specification of
emissions characteristics in a State's internal procurement
guidelines could escape being considered an impermissible
"adopt[ion of a] standard," 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(a), even if the
standard only guided local purchasing decisions. By the
same token, it is not obvious how, without some legal sleight
of hand, the majority can avoid preempting voluntary incentive programs aimed at the private sector; the benefit proffered by such schemes hinges on the recipient's willingness
to buy a vehicle or engine that complies with an emissions
standard (i. e., a vehicle or engine that, in the words of the
majority, "must not emit more than a certain amount of a
given pollutant, must be equipped with a certain type of
pollution-control device, or must have some other design
feature related to the control of emissions," ante, at 253).
Such a program clearly "adopt[s]" an emissions standard as

the majority defines it. Cf. ibid. (cautioning respondents notto "confus[e] standards with the means of enforcing standards"). The Court should, then, admit to preemption ofstate programs that even petitioners concede are not barred
by $ 209(a). See Reply Brief for Petitioners 7 (acknowledg-ing that $ 209(a) does not preempt voluntary incentive programs). That is not a strong recommendation for the major-ity's reading.

III
These objections to the Court's interpretation are not, tobe sure, dispositive, standing alone. They call attention to

untidy details, and rightly understood legislation can be un-tidy: statutes can be unsystematic, redundant, and fuzzy
about drawing lines. As a purely textual matter, both themajority's reading and mine have strengths and weaknesses.
The point is that the tie breakers cut in favor of sustainingthe South Coast Fleet Rules. My reading adheres more
closely to the legislative history of $ 209(a). It takes properaccount of the fact that the Fleet Rules with this commercial
availability condition do not require manufacturers, even in-directly, to produce a new kind of engine. And, most importantly, my reading adheres to the well-established presump-tion against preemption.

appeal from the united states district court for themiddle district of pennsylvania

No. 02-1580. Argued December 10, 2003--Decided April 28, 2004
After Pennsylvania's General Assembly adopted a congressional redistricting plan, plaintiffs-appellants sued to enjoin the plan's implementation, alleging, inter alia, that it constituted a political gerrymander in
violation of Article I and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause. The three-judge District Court dismissed the gerrymandering
claim, and the plaintiffs appealed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
241 F. Supp. 2d 478, affirmed.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor,
and Justice Thomas, concluded that political gerrymandering claims
are nonjusticiable because no judicially discernible and manageable
standards for adjudicating such claims exist. They would therefore
overrule Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, in which this Court held that
political gerrymandering claims are justiciable, but could not agree upon
a standard for assessing political gerrymandering claims. Pp. 274-306.

(a) Political gerrymanders existed in colonial times and continued
through the framing. The Framers provided a remedy for the problem:
The Constitution gives state legislatures the initial power to draw federal election districts, but authorizes Congress to "make or alter" those
districts. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 4. In Bandemer, the Court held that
the Equal Protection Clause also grants judges the power--and duty--
to control that practice. Pp. 274-277.

(b) Neither Art. I, $ 2 or $ 4, nor the Equal Protection Clause, provides a judicially enforceable limit on the political considerations that
the States and Congress may take into account when districting.
Pp. 277-291.

(1) Among the tests for determining the existence of a "nonjusticiable" or "political" question is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S.
186, 217. Because the Bandemer Court was "not persuaded" that there
are no such standards for deciding political gerrymandering cases, 478
U. S., at 123, such cases were justiciable. However, the six-Justice majority in Bandemer could not discern what the standards might be. For
the past 18 years, the lower courts have simply applied the Bandemer

268 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Syllabus
plurality's standard, almost invariably producing the same result as
would have obtained had the question been nonjusticiable: Judicial intervention has been refused. Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justifies revisiting whether the standard
promised by Bandemer exists. Pp. 277-281.

(2) The Bandemer plurality's standard--that a political gerrymandering claim can succeed only where the plaintiffs show "both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual
discriminatory effect on that group," 478 U. S., at 127--has proved unmanageable in application. Because that standard was misguided when
proposed, has not been improved in subsequent application, and is not
even defended by the appellants in this Court, it should not be affirmed
as a constitutional requirement. Pp. 281-284.

(3) Appellants' proposed two-pronged standard based on Art. I, $ 2,
and the Equal Protection Clause is neither discernible nor manageable.
Appellants are mistaken when they contend that their intent prong
("predominant intent") is no different from that which this Court has
applied in racial gerrymandering cases. In those cases, the predominant intent test is applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted, see, e. g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, whereas here
appellants assert that their test is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation behind the entire statewide plan.
Vague as a predominant motivation test might be when used to evaluate
single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide. For this
and other reasons, the racial gerrymandering cases provide no comfort.
The effects prong of appellants' proposal requires (1) that the plaintiffs
show that the rival party's voters are systematically "packed" or
"cracked"; and (2) that the court be persuaded from the totality of the
circumstances that the map can thwart the plaintiffs' ability to translate
a majority of votes into a majority of seats. This standard is not discernible because the Constitution provides no right to proportional representation. Even were the standard discernible, it is not judicially
manageable. There is no effective way to ascertain a party's majority
status, and, in any event, majority status in statewide races does not
establish majority status for particular district contests. Moreover,
even if a majority party could be identified, it would be impossible to
ensure that it won a majority of seats unless the States' traditional election structures were radically revised. Pp. 284-290.

(4) For many of the same reasons, Justice Powell's Bandemer
standard--a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that evaluates districts with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander
is not "fair"--must also be rejected. "Fairness" is not a judicially manageable standard. Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably

met than that is necessary to enable state legislatures to discern the
limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the
courts' discretion, and to win public acceptance for the courts' intrusion
into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking. Pp. 290-291.

(c) Writing separately in dissent, Justices Stevens, Souter, and
Breyer each propose a different standard for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims. These proposed standards each have their own
deficiencies, but additionally fail for reasons identified with respect to
the standards proposed by appellants and those proposed in Bandemer.
Justice Kennedy concurs in the judgment, recognizing that there
are no existing manageable standards for measuring whether a political
gerrymander burdens the representational rights of a party's voters.
Pp. 292-305.

(d) Stare decisis does not require that Bandemer be allowed to stand.
Stare decisis claims are at their weakest with respect to a decision interpreting the Constitution, particularly where there has been no reliance
on that decision. Pp. 305-306.

Justice Kennedy, while agreeing that appellants' complaint must be
dismissed, concluded that all possibility of judicial relief should not be
foreclosed in cases such as this because a limited and precise rationale
may yet be found to correct an established constitutional violation.
Courts confront two obstacles when presented with a claim of injury
from partisan gerrymandering. First is the lack of comprehensive and
neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries. No substantive
definition of fairness in districting commands general assent. Second
is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention. That
courts can grant relief in districting cases involving race does not answer the need for fairness principles, since those cases involve sorting
permissible districting classifications from impermissible ones. Politics
is a different matter. Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735. A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more
than the conclusion that political classifications were applied. It must
rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally
permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated
to any legitimate legislative objective. The object of districting is to
establish "fair and effective representation for all citizens." Reynolds
v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533. It might seem that courts could determine, by
the exercise of their judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights. The lack,
however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation
makes the analysis difficult. With no agreed upon substantive principles of fair districting, there is no basis on which to define clear, manage541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
270 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Syllabus
able, and politically neutral standards for measuring the burden a given
partisan classification imposes on representational rights. Suitable
standards for measuring this burden are critical to our intervention.
In this case, the plurality convincingly demonstrates that the standards
proposed in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, by the parties here, and
by the dissents are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent,
or both. There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like
these to be nonjusticiable. However, they are not so compelling that
they require the Court now to bar all future partisan gerrymandering
claims. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, makes clear that the more abstract
standards that guide analysis of all Fourteenth Amendment claims suffice to ensure justiciability of claims like these. That a workable standard for measuring a gerrymander's burden on representational rights
has not yet emerged does not mean that none will emerge in the future.
The Court should adjudicate only what is in the case before it. In this
case, absent a standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim
has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants' evidence
at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications. That describes no constitutional flaw under the governing
Fourteenth Amendment standard. Gaffney, supra, at 752. While the
equal protection standard continues to govern such cases, the First
Amendment may prove to offer a sounder and more prudential basis for
judicial intervention in political gerrymandering cases. First Amendment analysis does not dwell on whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose, but concentrates
on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the
complaining party's voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political
association. That analysis allows a pragmatic or functional assessment
that accords some latitude to the States. See, e. g., Eu v. San Francisco
County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214. Pp. 306-317.

could not agree upon a standard to adjudicate them. Thepresent appeal presents the questions whether our decision

in Bandemer was in error, and, if not, what the standardshould be.

I
The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows. Thepopulation figures derived from the 2000 census showed that

Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Con-gress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealth's previous
delegation. Pennsylvania's General Assembly took up thetask of drawing a new districting map. At the time, the
Republican Party controlled a majority of both state Housesand held the Governor's office. Prominent national figures
in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly toadopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure
against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redis-tricting plans elsewhere. The Republican members of Pennsylvania's House and Senate worked together on such a plan.On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan,
which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.Plaintiffs, registered Democrats who vote in Pennsylvania,
brought suit in the United States District Court for theMiddle District of Pennsylvania, seeking to enjoin implementation of Act 1 under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.Defendants-appellees were the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and various executive and legislative officers respon-sible for enacting or implementing Act 1. The complaint
alleged, among other things, that the legislation created mal-apportioned districts, in violation of the one-person, one-vote
requirement of Article I, $ 2, of the United States Constitu-tion, and that it constituted a political gerrymander, in violation of Article I and the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment. With regard to the latter contention,
the complaint alleged that the districts created by Act 1were "meandering and irregular," and "ignor[ed] all traditional redistricting criteria, including the preservation of

local government boundaries, solely for the sake of partisanadvantage." Juris. Statement 136a, || 22, 135a, || 20.

A three-judge panel was convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C.$ 2284. The defendants moved to dismiss. The District
Court granted the motion with respect to the political gerry-mandering claim, and (on Eleventh Amendment grounds) all
claims against the Commonwealth; but it declined to dismissthe apportionment claim as to other defendants. See

Viethv. Pennsylvania, 188 F. Supp. 2d 532 (MD Pa. 2002) (Vieth

I). On trial of the apportionment claim, the District Courtruled in favor of plaintiffs. See

Vieth v. Pennsylvania, 195
F. Supp. 2d 672 (MD Pa. 2002) (Vieth II). It retained juris-diction over the case pending the court's review and approval

of a remedial redistricting plan. On April 18, 2002, Gover-nor Schweiker signed into law Act No. 2002-34, Pa. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 25, $ 3595.301 (Purdon Supp. 2003) (Act 34), a re-medial plan that the Pennsylvania General Assembly had
enacted to cure the apportionment problem of Act 1.Plaintiffs moved to impose remedial districts, arguing that
the District Court should not consider Act 34 to be a proper
remedial scheme, both because it was malapportioned, andbecause it constituted an unconstitutional political gerrymander like its predecessor. The District Court denied this mo-tion, concluding that the new districts were not malapportioned, and rejecting the political gerrymandering claim forthe reasons previously assigned in

Vieth I. Vieth v. Pennsylvania, 241 F. Supp. 2d 478, 484-485 (MD Pa. 2003) (Vieth
III). The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their Act 34
political gerrymandering claim.2 We noted probable juris-diction. 539 U. S. 957 (2003).

2 The plaintiffs apparently never amended their complaint to allege that
Act 34 was a political gerrymander, yet the District Court's decision in
Vieth III resolved that claim on the merits. Because subject-matter jurisdiction is not implicated and neither party has raised the point, we
assume that the District Court deemed the plaintiffs' original complaint
to have been constructively amended.

Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania

at the beginning of the 18th century, where several countiesconspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into sur-rounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives. See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of theGerrymander 26-28 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith). In 1732,
two members of His Majesty's Council and the attorney gen-eral and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs
of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Gover-nor had proceeded to "divide old Precincts established by
Law, & to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts hehas endeavoured to prepossess People in a future election
according to his desire, his Designs herein being . . . eitherto endeavour by his means to get a Majority of his creatures
in the Lower House" or to disrupt the assembly's proceed-ings. 3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380-381 (W.
Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29. The political gerry-mander remained alive and well (though not yet known by
that name) at the time of the framing. There were allega-tions that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress. See 2W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint
1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb.9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P.
Ford ed. 1904). And in 1812, of course, there occurred thenotoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts
that gave the gerrymander its name--an amalgam of thenames of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the
creature ("salamander") which the outline of an election dis-trict he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.
See Webster's New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed.1945). "By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in
party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation

enacted for the formation of election districts. It was gen-erally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power

which was not proportionate to its numerical strength."Griffith 123.

It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy forsuch practices in the Constitution. Article I, $ 4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districtsfor federal elections, permitted Congress to "make or alter"
those districts if it wished.3 Many objected to the congres-sional oversight established by this provision. In the course
of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, CharlesPinckney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant
language. James Madison responded in defense of the pro-vision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:

"Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite meas-ure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to suc-ceed. Besides, the inequality of the Representation in
the Legislatures of particular States, would produce alike inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties havingthe power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter. What danger could there be in giv-ing a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?" 2
Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240-241(M. Farrand ed. 1911).

Although the motion of Pinckney and Rutledge failed, oppo-sition to the "make or alter" provision of Article I, $ 4--and
the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerryman3 Article I, $ 4, provides as follows:
"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."

dering--continued to be voiced in the state ratifying de-bates. A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned

that state legislatures

"might make an unequal and partial division of the
states into districts for the election of representatives,or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.

Without these powers in Congress, the people can haveno remedy; but the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators andrepresentatives of twelve states, without the influence
of our commotions and factions, who will hear impar-tially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal
and sacred rights of election." 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).

The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections,and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant. In the ApportionmentAct of 1842, 5 Stat. 491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts "com-posed of contiguous territory." See Griffith 12 (noting that
the law was "an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander"). Congress again imposed these requirements inthe Apportionment Act of 1862, 12 Stat. 572, and in 1872

further required that districts "contai[n] as nearly as practi-cable an equal number of inhabitants," 17 Stat. 28, $ 2. In
the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a com-pactness requirement. 31 Stat. 733. The requirements of
contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were re-peated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 37 Stat. 13,
but were not thereafter continued. Today, only the singlemember-district-requirement remains. See 2 U. S. C. $ 2c.
Recent history, however, attests to Congress's awareness of
the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its
power under Article I, $ 4, to control them. Since 1980, no
fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerry541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mandering in congressional districting. See H. R. 5037,101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess.

(1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529,97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st
Sess. (1981).4Eighteen years ago, we held that the Equal Protection
Clause grants judges the power--and duty--to control politi-cal gerrymandering, see

Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109(1986). It is to consideration of this precedent that we

now turn. III

As Chief Justice Marshall proclaimed two centuries ago,"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Sometimes, however, the law is that
the judicial department has no business entertaining theclaim of unlawfulness--because the question is entrusted to
one of the political branches or involves no judicially enforce-able rights. See, e. g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224
(1993) (challenge to procedures used in Senate impeachmentproceedings); Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118 (1912) (claims arising under the GuarantyClause of Article IV, $ 4). Such questions are said to be
"nonjusticiable," or "political questions."In

Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), we set forth sixindependent tests for the existence of a political question:

"[1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitmentof the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2]
a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable stand4 The States, of course, have taken their own steps to prevent abusive
districting practices. A number have adopted standards for redistricting,
and measures designed to insulate the process from politics. See, e. g.,
Iowa Code $ 42.4(5) (2003); N. J. Const., Art. II, $ 2; Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 25-2
(1993); Idaho Code $ 72-1506 (1948-1999); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21-A,

ards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of decidingwithout an initial policy determination of a kind clearly

Id., at 217.

These tests are probably listed in descending order of bothimportance and certainty. The second is at issue here, and

there is no doubt of its validity. "The judicial Power" cre-ated by Article III, $ 1, of the Constitution is not

S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 332-333(1999), or even whatever Congress chooses to assign them,
see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 576-577(1992); Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman
S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 110-114 (1948). It is the power toact in the manner traditional for English and American
courts. One of the most obvious limitations imposed by thatrequirement is that judicial action must be governed by
standard, by rule. Laws promulgated by the LegislativeBranch can be inconsistent, illogical, and ad hoc; law pronounced by the courts must be principled, rational, and basedupon reasoned distinctions.

Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in Davisv.

Bandemer that, since it was "not persuaded that there areno judicially discernible and manageable standards by which

political gerrymander cases are to be decided," 478 U. S., at123, such cases were justiciable. The clumsy shifting of the
burden of proof for the premise (the Court was "not per-suaded" that standards do not exist, rather than "persuaded"

that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact thatthe six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially

discernable standards might be. There was no majority onthat point. Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see id., at 127 (plural-ity opinion of White, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and
Blackmun, JJ.); two believed it was something else, see id.,at 161 (Powell, J., joined by

Stevens, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part). The lower courts have lived with

that assurance of a standard (or more precisely, lack of assur-ance that there is no standard), coupled with that inability
to specify a standard, for the past 18 years. In that time,they have considered numerous political gerrymandering
claims; this Court has never revisited the unanswered ques-tion of what standard governs.

Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was
initially unable to enunciate. They have simply applied thestandard set forth in

Bandemer's four-Justice plurality opin-ion. This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice

plurality standard has met the test of time--but for the factthat its application has almost invariably produced the same
result (except for the incurring of attorney's fees) as wouldhave obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: Judicial
intervention has been refused. As one commentary has putit, "[t]hroughout its subsequent history, Bandemer has
served almost exclusively as an invitation to litigation with-out much prospect of redress." S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, &
R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 886 (rev. 2d ed. 2002). Theone case in which relief was provided (and merely preliminary relief, at that) did not involve the drawing of districtlines;

Moreover, although the case in which relief was provided
seemingly involved the ne plus ultra of partisan manipulation, see n. 5, supra, we would be at a loss to explain why
the Bandemer line should have been drawn just there, and
should not have embraced several districting plans that were
upheld despite allegations of extreme partisan discriminaopinion) (upholding, as modified, a preliminary injunction). Martin dealt
with North Carolina's system of electing superior court judges statewide,

tion, bizarrely shaped districts, and disproportionate results.See, e. g., Session v. Perry, 298 F. Supp. 2d 451 (ED Tex.

2004) (per curiam); O'Lear v. Miller, 222 F. Supp. 2d 850(ED Mich.), summarily aff 'd, 537 U. S. 997 (2002); Badham v.

Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing toshow for it justify us in revisiting the question whether the
standard promised by Bandemer exists. As the followingdiscussion reveals, no judicially discernible and manageable
standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claimshave emerged. Lacking them, we must conclude that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable and that Bandemer was wrongly decided.

A
We begin our review of possible standards with that pro-posed by Justice White's plurality opinion in

Bandemer be-cause, as the narrowest ground for our decision in that case,

it has been the standard employed by the lower courts. Theplurality concluded that a political gerrymandering claim
could succeed only where plaintiffs showed "both intentionaldiscrimination against an identifiable political group and an
actual discriminatory effect on that group." 478 U. S., at127. As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged
that "[a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, itshould not be very difficult to prove that the likely political
consequences of the reapportionment were intended." Id.,at 129. However, the effects prong was significantly harder
to satisfy. Relief could not be based merely upon the factthat a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensuratewith its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made
its winning of elections more difficult. Id., at 132. Rather,

282 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Opinion of Scalia, J.
it would have to be shown that, taking into account a varietyof historic factors and projected election results, the group

had been "denied its chance to effectively influence the politi-cal process" as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate. Id., at 132-133. It would not beenough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been
"placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters" or that the district "departs from pre-existingpolitical boundaries."

Id., at 140-141. Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus "onthe opportunity of members of the group to participate in

party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their
chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate." Id., at 133.
A statewide challenge, by contrast, would involve an analysis
of "the voters' direct or indirect influence on the elections of
the state legislature as a whole." Ibid. (emphasis added).
With what has proved to be a gross understatement, the plurality acknowledged this was "of necessity a difficult inquiry." Id., at 143.

In her Bandemer concurrence, Justice O'Connor predicted that the plurality's standard "will over time either
prove unmanageable and arbitrary or else evolve towards
some loose form of proportionality." Id., at 155 (opinion
concurring in judgment, joined by Burger, C. J., and
Rehnquist, J.). A similar prediction of unmanageability
was expressed in Justice Powell's opinion, making it the
prognostication of a majority of the Court. See id., at 171
("The . . . most basic flaw in the plurality's opinion is its
failure to enunciate any standard that affords guidance to
legislatures and courts"). That prognostication has been
amply fulfilled.

In the lower courts, the legacy of the plurality's test is
one long record of puzzlement and consternation. See, e. g.,
Session, supra, at 474 ("Throughout this case we have borne

fended before us today by the appellants, we decline to affirmit as a constitutional requirement.

B
Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workablestandard based on Article I, $ 2, and the Equal Protection

Clause. We consider it at length not only because it reflectsthe litigant's view as to the best that can be derived from 18
years of experience, but also because it shares many featureswith other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may
be said of them as well. Appellants' proposed standard re-tains the two-pronged framework of the

Bandemer plural-ity--intent plus effect--but modifies the type of showing sufficient to satisfy each.To satisfy appellants' intent standard, a plaintiff must
"show that the mapmakers acted with a predominant intentto achieve partisan advantage," which can be shown "by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence that other neu-tral and legitimate redistricting criteria were subordinated
to the goal of achieving partisan advantage." Brief for Ap-pellants 19 (emphasis added). As compared with the Bandemer plurality's test of mere intent to disadvantage the plain-tiff 's group, this proposal seemingly makes the standard
more difficult to meet--but only at the expense of makingthe standard more indeterminate.

"Predominant intent" to disadvantage the plaintiff 's politi-cal group refers to the relative importance of that goal as
compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pur-sue--contiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incum-bents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic
neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the VotingRights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc. Appellants contend that their intent test must be discernible andmanageable because it has been borrowed from our racial
gerrymandering cases. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900

Opinion of Scalia, J.
(1995); Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993). To begin with,in a very important respect that is not so. In the racial

gerrymandering context, the predominant intent test hasbeen applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs
voted. See Miller, supra; United States v. Hays, 515 U. S.737 (1995). Here, however, appellants do not assert that an
apportionment fails their intent test if any single district
does so. Since "it would be quixotic to attempt to bar statelegislatures from considering politics as they redraw district

lines," Brief for Appellants 3, appellants propose a test thatis satisfied only when "partisan advantage was the predominant motivation behind the entire statewide plan," id., at 32
(emphasis added). Vague as the "predominant motivation"
test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all
but evaporates when applied statewide. Does it mean, for
instance, that partisan intent must outweigh all other
goals--contiguity, compactness, preservation of neighborhoods, etc.--statewide? And how is the statewide "outweighing" to be determined? If three-fifths of the map's
districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly
observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the "predominant" goal between those two? We are sure appellants do not think so.

Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a "predominant intent" test to racial
gerrymandering is easier and less disruptive. The Constitution clearly contemplates districting by political entities, see
Article I, $ 4, and unsurprisingly that turns out to be rootand-branch a matter of politics. See Miller, supra, at 914
("[R]edistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition . . .");
Shaw, supra, at 662 (White, J., dissenting) ("[D]istricting inevitably is the expression of interest group politics . . .");

is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have sub541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stantial political consequences"). By contrast, the purposeof segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful

one, and is much more rarely encountered. Determiningwhether the shape of a particular district is so substantially
affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally sus-pect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excessof an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it. Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and com-mon practice means that there is almost

always room for anelection-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims ofracial gerrymandering. Finally, courts might be justified in
accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce aconstitutional command which (like the Fourteenth Amendment obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear;whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not toapply

too much partisanship in districting) which is both du-bious and severely unmanageable. For these reasons, to the

extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent amodel of discernible and manageable standards, they provide
no comfort here.The effects prong of appellants' proposal replaces the Bandemer plurality's vague test of "denied its chance to effec-tively influence the political process," 478 U. S., at 132-133,
with criteria that are seemingly more specific. The requi-site effect is established when "(1) the plaintiffs show that
the districts systematically `pack' and `crack' the rival par-ty's voters,

7 and (2) the court's examination of the `totality

of circumstances' confirms that the map can thwart the plain-tiffs' ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority

7 "Packing" refers to the practice of filling a district with a supermajority of a given group or party. "Cracking" involves the splitting of a group
or party among several districts to deny that group or party a majority
in any of those districts.

of seats." Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnoteadded). This test is loosely based on our cases applying $ 2

of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, to dis-crimination by race, see, e. g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512
U. S. 997 (1994). But a person's politics is rarely as readilydiscernible--and never as permanently discernible--as a
person's race. Political affiliation is not an immutable char-acteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and
even within a given election, not all voters follow the partyline. We dare say (and hope) that the political party which
puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose evenin its registration stronghold. These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fash-ion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft
a remedy. See Bandemer, supra, at 156 (O'Connor, J., con-curring in judgment).

Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerryman-dering can be determined, appellants' test would invalidate

the districting only when it prevents a majority of the elec-torate from electing a majority of representatives. Before
considering whether this particular standard is judicially

8 A delicious illustration of this is the one case we have found--alluded
to above--that provided relief under Bandemer. See n. 5, supra. In Republican Party of North Carolina v. Hunt, No. 94-2410, 1996 WL 60439
(CA4, Feb. 12, 1996) (per curiam) (unpublished), judgt. order reported at
77 F. 3d 470, the District Court, after a trial with no less than 311 stipulations by the parties, 132 witness statements, approximately 300 exhibits,
and 2 days of oral argument, concluded that North Carolina's system of
electing superior court judges on a statewide basis "had resulted in Republican candidates experiencing a consistent and pervasive lack of success and exclusion from the electoral process as a whole and that these
effects were likely to continue unabated into the future." 1996 WL 60439,
at *1. In the elections for superior court judges conducted just five days
after this pronouncement, "every Republican candidate standing for the
office of superior court judge was victorious at the state level," ibid., a
result which the Fourth Circuit thought (with good reason) "directly at
odds with the recent prediction by the district court," id., at *2, causing
it to remand the case for reconsideration.

manageable we question whether it is judicially discerniblein the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation. Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard restsupon the principle that groups (or at least political-action
groups) have a right to proportional representation. Butthe Constitution contains no such principle. It guarantees
equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representa-tion in government to equivalently sized groups. It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fun-damentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be
accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.9Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable. To begin with, how is a party's majoritystatus to be established? Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and someDemocrats won. See Juris. Statement 137a-138a (describing how Democratic candidates received more votes for Pres-ident and auditor general, and Republicans received more
votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treas-urer). Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide
races establishes majority status for district contests, onewould have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation. That is as-suredly not true. As one law review comment has put it:

9 The Constitution also does not share appellants' alarm at the asserted
tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives. Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their
State's congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are "effectively" distributed so as to constitute
bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts). Choosing the former
"dilutes" the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the
same to the moderate. Neither Article I, $ 2, nor the Equal Protection
Clause takes sides in this dispute.

"There is no statewide vote in this country for the House
of Representatives or the state legislature. Rather,
there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.
If the districts change, the candidates change, their
strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns
change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues
change--everything changes. Political parties do not
compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the
highest mean district vote percentages: They compete
for specific seats." Lowenstein & Steinberg, The Quest
for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 59-60 (1985).

See also Schuck, Partisan Gerrymandering: A Political Problem Without Judicial Solution, in Political Gerrymandering
and the Courts 240, 241 (B. Grofman ed. 1990).

But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it
impossible to ensure that that party wins a majority of
seats--unless we radically revise the States' traditional
structure for elections. In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district
lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide
will produce a majority of seats for that party. The point is
proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania,
which, according to appellants' own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map "free from partisan gerrymandering." Juris. Statement 137a. On this
"neutral playing fiel[d]," the Democrats' statewide majority
of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of
seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans). Id., at 133a, 137a.
Whether by reason of partisan districting or not, party constituents may always wind up "packed" in some districts and
"cracked" throughout others. See R. Dixon, Democratic

example, a legislature that draws district lines with no ob-jectives in mind except compactness and respect for the

lines of political subdivisions. Under that system, politicalgroups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic
voters in cities) would be systematically affected by whatmight be called a "natural" packing effect. See Bandemer,
478 U. S., at 159 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).Our one-person, one-vote cases, see

Reynolds v. Sims, 377U. S. 533 (1964); Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), have

no bearing upon this question, neither in principle nor inpracticality. Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representa-tives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a
majority say, is not at all to say that each discernible group,whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must
have representation equivalent to its numbers. And not inpracticality, because the easily administrable standard of
population equality adopted by Wesberry and Reynolds en-ables judges to decide whether a violation has occurred (and
to remedy it) essentially on the basis of three readily deter-mined factors--where the plaintiff lives, how many voters
are in his district, and how many voters are in other dis-tricts; whereas requiring judges to decide whether a districting system will produce a statewide majority for a majorityparty casts them forth upon a sea of imponderables, and asks
them to make determinations that not even election expertscan agree upon.

For these reasons, we find appellants' proposed standardsneither discernible nor manageable.

C
For many of the same reasons, we also reject the standardsuggested by Justice Powell in

Bandemer. He agreed withthe plurality that a plaintiff should show intent and effect,

but believed that the ultimate inquiry ought to focus onwhether district boundaries had been drawn solely for parti541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

291Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)

san ends to the exclusion of "all other neutral factors relevant to the fairness of redistricting." 478 U. S., at 161 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also id.,
at 164-165. Under that inquiry, the courts should consider
numerous factors, though "[n]o one factor should be dispositive." Id., at 173. The most important would be "the
shapes of voting districts and adherence to established political subdivision boundaries." Ibid. "Other relevant considerations include the nature of the legislative procedures by
which the apportionment law was adopted and legislative
history reflecting contemporaneous legislative goals." Ibid.
These factors, which "bear directly on the fairness of a redistricting plan," combined with "evidence concerning population disparities and statistics tending to show vote dilution,"
make out a claim of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Ibid.

While Justice Powell rightly criticized the Bandemer plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his
opinion also falls short of the mark. It is essentially a
totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable
factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye
to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has
gone too far--or, in Justice Powell's terminology, whether it
is not "fair." "Fairness" does not seem to us a judicially
manageable standard. Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle
political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a party's not
winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of
its vote. Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably
met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to
meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to
win public acceptance for the courts' intrusion into a process
that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

IV
We turn next to consideration of the standards proposedby today's dissenters. We preface it with the observation

that the mere fact that these four dissenters come up withthree different standards--all of them different from the two
proposed in Bandemer and the one proposed here by appel-lants--goes a long way to establishing that there is no constitutionally discernible standard.

A
Justice Stevens concurs in the judgment that we shouldnot address plaintiffs' statewide political gerrymandering

challenges. Though he reaches that result via standinganalysis,

post, at 327, 328 (dissenting opinion), while we reachit through political-question analysis, our conclusions are the

same: these statewide claims are nonjusticiable.

Justice Stevens would, however, require courts to con-sider political gerrymandering challenges at the individualdistrict level. Much of his dissent is addressed to the incom-patibility of severe partisan gerrymanders with democratic
principles. We do not disagree with that judgment, anymore than we disagree with the judgment that it would be
unconstitutional for the Senate to employ, in impeachmentproceedings, procedures that are incompatible with its obligation to "try" impeachments. See Nixon v. United States,506 U. S. 224 (1993). The issue we have discussed is not
whether severe partisan gerrymanders violate the Constitu-tion, but whether it is for the courts to say when a violation
has occurred, and to design a remedy. On that point, Justice Stevens's dissent is less helpful, saying, essentially,that if we can do it in the racial gerrymandering context we

can do it here.We have examined,

supra, at 285-288, the many reasonswhy that is not so. Only a few of them are challenged by

Justice Stevens. He says that we "mistakenly assum[e]that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making politi541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

293Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
cal judgments." Post, at 338. But we do not say that race-conscious decisionmaking is always unlawful. Race can be

used, for example, as an indicator to achieve the purpose ofneighborhood cohesiveness in districting. What we have
said is impermissible is "the purpose of segregating voterson the basis of race,"

supra, at 286--that is to say, racial
gerrymandering for race's sake, which would be the equivalent of political gerrymandering for politics' sake. Justice
Stevens says we "er[r] in assuming that politics is `an ordinary and lawful motive' " in districting, post, at 324--but allhe brings forward to contest that is the argument that an

excessive injection of politics is unlawful. So it is, and so
does our opinion assume. That does not alter the reality
that setting out to segregate voters by race is unlawful and
hence rare, and setting out to segregate them by political
affiliation is (so long as one doesn't go too far) lawful and
hence ordinary.

Justice Stevens's confidence that what courts have done
with racial gerrymandering can be done with political gerrymandering rests in part upon his belief that "the same standards should apply," post, at 335. But in fact the standards
are quite different. A purpose to discriminate on the basis
of race receives the strictest scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, while a similar purpose to discriminate on
the basis of politics does not. "[N]othing in our case law
compels the conclusion that racial and political gerrymanders
are subject to precisely the same constitutional scrutiny. In
fact, our country's long and persistent history of racial discrimination in voting--as well as our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, which always has reserved the strictest
scrutiny for discrimination on the basis of race--would seem
to compel the opposite conclusion." Shaw, 509 U. S., at 650
(citation omitted). That quoted passage was in direct response to (and rejection of ) the suggestion made by Justices White and Stevens in dissent that "a racial gerrymander of the sort alleged here is functionally equivalent to

gerrymanders for nonracial purposes, such as political gerry-manders."

Ibid. See also Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 964
(1996) (plurality opinion) ("We have not subjected politicalgerrymandering to strict scrutiny").

Justice Stevens relies on First Amendment cases tosuggest that politically discriminatory gerrymanders are
subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection
Clause. See post, at 324-325. It is elementary that scru-tiny levels are claim specific. An action that triggers a

heightened level of scrutiny for one claim may receive a verydifferent level of scrutiny for a different claim because the
underlying rights, and consequently constitutional harms,
are not comparable. To say that suppression of political
speech (a claimed First Amendment violation) triggers strict
scrutiny is not to say that failure to give political groups
equal representation (a claimed equal protection violation)
triggers strict scrutiny. Only an equal protection claim is
before us in the present case--perhaps for the very good
reason that a First Amendment claim, if it were sustained,
would render unlawful all consideration of political affiliation
in districting, just as it renders unlawful all consideration of
political affiliation in hiring for non-policy-level government
jobs. What cases such as Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347
(1976), require is not merely that Republicans be given a
decent share of the jobs in a Democratic administration, but
that political affiliation be disregarded.

Having failed to make the case for strict scrutiny of political gerrymandering, Justice Stevens falls back on the
argument that scrutiny levels simply do not matter for purposes of justiciability. He asserts that a standard imposing
a strong presumption of invalidity (strict scrutiny) is no more
discernible and manageable than a standard requiring an
evenhanded balancing of all considerations with no thumb on
the scales (ordinary scrutiny). To state this is to refute it.
As is well known, strict scrutiny readily, and almost always,
results in invalidation. Moreover, the mere fact that there

Opinion of Scalia, J.
exist standards which this Court could apply--the proposi-tion which much of

Justice Stevens's opinion is devoted toestablishing, see,
e. g., post, at 321-327, 340-341--does notmean that those standards are discernible in the Constitution. This Court may not willy-nilly apply standards--evenmanageable standards--having no relation to constitutional
harms. Justice Stevens points out, see post, at 327, n. 15,that

Bandemer said differences between racial and politicalgroups "may be relevant to the manner in which the case is

adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal toentertain such a case." 478 U. S., at 125. As 18 years have
shown, Bandemer was wrong.

B
Justice Souter, like Justice Stevens, would restrictthese plaintiffs, on the allegations before us, to districtspecific political gerrymandering claims. Post, at 346, 353(dissenting opinion). Unlike

Justice Stevens, however,
Justice Souter recognizes that there is no existing work-able standard for adjudicating such claims. He proposes a

"fresh start," post, at 345: a newly constructed standardloosely based in form on our Title VII cases, see

McDonnellDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), and complete

with a five-step prima facie test sewn together from partsof, among other things, our Voting Rights Act jurisprudence,
law review articles, and apportionment cases. Even if theseself-styled "clues" to unconstitutionality could be manageably applied, which we doubt, there is no reason to thinkthey would detect the constitutional crime which

Justice
Souter is investigating--an "extremity of unfairness" inpartisan competition.

Post, at 344.Under
Justice Souter's proposed standard, in order tochallenge a particular district, a plaintiff must show (1) that

he is a member of a "cohesive political group"; (2) "that thedistrict of his residence . . . paid little or no heed" to traditional districting principles; (3) that there were "specific cor541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
296 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Opinion of Scalia, J.
relations between the district's deviations from traditional
districting principles and the distribution of the population
of his group"; (4) that a hypothetical district exists which
includes the plaintiff 's residence, remedies the packing or
cracking of the plaintiff 's group, and deviates less from traditional districting principles; and (5) that "the defendants
acted intentionally to manipulate the shape of the district in
order to pack or crack his group." Post, at 347-350. When
those showings have been made, the burden would shift to
the defendants to justify the district "by reference to objectives other than naked partisan advantage." Post, at 351.

While this five-part test seems eminently scientific, upon
analysis one finds that each of the last four steps requires a
quantifying judgment that is unguided and ill suited to the
development of judicial standards: How much disregard of
traditional districting principles? How many correlations
between deviations and distribution? How much remedying of packing or cracking by the hypothetical district?
How many legislators must have had the intent to pack and
crack--and how efficacious must that intent have been (must
it have been, for example, a sine qua non cause of the districting, or a predominant cause)? At step two, for example, Justice Souter would require lower courts to assess
whether mapmakers paid "little or no heed to . . . traditional
districting principles." Post, at 348. What is a lower court
to do when, as will often be the case, the district adheres to
some traditional criteria but not others? Justice Souter's
only response to this question is to evade it: "It is not necessary now to say exactly how a district court would balance
a good showing on one of these indices against a poor showing on another, for that sort of detail is best worked out case
by case." Post, at 348-349. But the devil lurks precisely
in such detail. The central problem is determining when
political gerrymandering has gone too far. It does not solve
that problem to break down the original unanswerable ques541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

297Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
tion (How much political motivation and effect is too much?)into four more discrete but equally unanswerable questions.

Justice Souter's proposal is doomed to failure for a morebasic reason: No test--yea, not even a five-part test--can
possibly be successful unless one knows what he is testingfor. In the present context, the test ought to identify deprivation of that minimal degree of representation or influenceto which a political group is constitutionally entitled. As we
have seen, the Bandemer test sought (unhelpfully, but atleast gamely) to specify what that minimal degree was: "[a]
chance to effectively influence the political process." 478U. S., at 133. So did the appellants' proposed test: "[the]
ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority ofseats." Brief for Appellants 20.

Justice Souter avoidsthe difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what

his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful "ex-tremity of unfairness." He vaguely describes the harm he
is concerned with as vote dilution, post, at 351, a term whichusually implies some actual effect on the weight of a vote.
But no element of his test looks to the effect of the gerry-mander on the electoral success, the electoral opportunity, or
even the political influence, of the plaintiff 's group. We donot know the precise constitutional deprivation his test is
designed to identify and prevent.Even if (though it is implausible)

Justice Souter believesthat the constitutional deprivation consists of merely "vote

dilution," his test would not even identify that effect.Despite his claimed reliance on the McDonnell Douglas
framework, Justice Souter would allow the plaintiff no op-portunity to show that the mapmakers' compliance with traditional districting factors is pretextual.10 His reason for

10 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the district's shape "were
more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander." Post, at
352. But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise

298 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Opinion of Scalia, J.
this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence
to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of
intentional vote dilution. As we have explained above,
packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite
consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for
political subdivision lines. See supra, at 289-290. An even
better example is the traditional criterion of incumbency
protection. Justice Souter has previously acknowledged
it to be a traditional and constitutionally acceptable districting principle. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 1047-1048 (dissenting
opinion). Since that is so, his test would not protect those
who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection
of representatives of either party. Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin
with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts
of existing incumbents of that party. By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting
mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

Like us, Justice Souter acknowledges and accepts that
"some intent to gain political advantage is inescapable whenever political bodies devise a district plan, and some effect
results from the intent." Post, at 344. Thus, again like us,
he recognizes that "the issue is one of how much is too
much." Ibid. And once those premises are conceded, the
only line that can be drawn must be based, as Justice Souter again candidly admits, upon a substantive "notio[n] of
fairness." Ibid. This is the same flabby goal that deprived
Justice Powell's test of all determinacy. To be sure, Justice
Souter frames it somewhat differently: Courts must intervene, he says, when "partisan competition has reached an
extremity of unfairness." Ibid. (emphasis added). We do
not think the problem is solved by adding the modifier.

until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case. And that prima
facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with
traditional districting criteria.

We agree with much of Justice Breyer's dissenting opin-ion, which convincingly demonstrates that "political considerations will likely play an important, and proper, role in thedrawing of district boundaries."

Post, at 358. This places
Justice Breyer, like the other dissenters, in the difficultposition of drawing the line between good politics and bad

politics. Unlike them, he would tackle this problem at thestatewide level.

The criterion Justice Breyer proposes is nothing moreprecise than "the

unjustified use of political factors to en-trench a minority in power."

Post, at 360 (emphasis in origi-nal). While he invokes in passing the Equal Protection

Clause, it should be clear to any reader that what constitutesunjustified entrenchment depends on his own theory of "effective government." Post, at 356. While one must agreewith

Justice Breyer's incredibly abstract starting pointthat our Constitution sought to create a "basically democratic" form of government, ibid., that is a long and impass-able distance away from the conclusion that the Judiciary
may assess whether a group (somehow defined) has achieveda level of political power (somehow defined) commensurate
with that to which they would be entitled absent unjustifiedpolitical machinations (whatever that means).

Justice Breyer provides no real guidance for the jour-ney. Despite his promise to do so, ibid., he never tells us
what he is testing for, beyond the unhelpful "unjustified en-trenchment." Post, at 360. Instead, he "set[s] forth several
sets of circumstances that lay out the indicia of abuse,""along a continuum," post, at 365, proceeding (presumably)
from the most clearly unconstitutional to the possibly uncon-stitutional. With regard to the first "scenario," he is willing
to assert that the indicia "would be sufficient to support aclaim." Post, at 366. This seems refreshingly categorical,
until one realizes that the indicia consist not merely of thefailure of the party receiving the majority of votes to acquire

Opinion of Scalia, J.
a majority of seats in two successive elections, but also ofthe fact that there is no "neutral" explanation for this phenomenon. Ibid. But of course there always is a neutralexplanation--if only the time-honored criterion of incumbent
protection. The indicia set forth in Justice Breyer's sec-ond scenario "

could also add up to unconstitutional gerrymandering," ibid. (emphasis added); and for those in the
third "a court may conclude that the map crosses the consti-tutional line,"

post, at 367 (emphasis added). We find none
of this helpful. Each scenario suffers from at least one ofthe problems we have previously identified, most notably the

difficulties of assessing partisan strength statewide and ofascertaining whether an entire statewide plan is motivated
by political or neutral justifications, see supra, at 285-286,289-290. And even at that, the last two scenarios

do not
even purport to provide an answer, presumably leaving it toeach district court to determine whether, under those circumstances, "unjustified entrenchment" has occurred. Insum, we neither know precisely what

Justice Breyer is
testing for, nor precisely what fails the test.

But perhaps the most surprising omission from Justice
Breyer's dissent, given his views on other matters, is the
absence of any cost-benefit analysis. Justice Breyer acknowledges that "a majority normally can work its political
will," post, at 362, and well describes the number of actors,
from statewide executive officers, to redistricting commissions, to Congress, to the People in ballot initiatives and referenda, that stand ready to make that happen. See post,
at 362-363. He gives no instance (and we know none) of
permanent frustration of majority will. But where the majority has failed to assert itself for some indeterminate period (two successive elections, if we are to believe his first
scenario), Justice Breyer simply assumes that "court action may prove necessary," post, at 364. Why so? In the
real world, of course, court action that is available tends to
be sought, not just where it is necessary, but where it is in
the interest of the seeking party. And the vaguer the test

for availability, the more frequently interest rather than necessity will produce litigation. Is the regular insertion of
the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty
that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity
it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achieved--
an accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the
majority will? We think not.

V
Justice Kennedy recognizes that we have "demonstrat[ed] the shortcomings of the other standards that have
been considered to date," post, at 308 (opinion concurring in
judgment). He acknowledges, moreover, that we "lack . . .
comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral
boundaries," post, at 306-307; and that there is an "absence
of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention," post, at
307. From these premises, one might think that Justice
Kennedy would reach the conclusion that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable. Instead, however, he
concludes that courts should continue to adjudicate such
claims because a standard may one day be discovered.

The first thing to be said about Justice Kennedy's disposition is that it is not legally available. The District Court
in this case considered the plaintiffs' claims justiciable
but dismissed them because the standard for unconstitutionality had not been met. It is logically impossible to affirm that dismissal without either (1) finding that the
unconstitutional-districting standard applied by the District
Court, or some other standard that it should have applied,
has not been met, or (2) finding (as we have) that the claim
is nonjusticiable. Justice Kennedy seeks to affirm "[b]ecause, in the case before us, we have no standard." Post,
at 313. But it is our job, not the plaintiffs', to explicate the
standard that makes the facts alleged by the plaintiffs adequate or inadequate to state a claim. We cannot nonsuit
them for our failure to do so.

Justice Kennedy asserts that to declare nonjusticiabilitywould be incautious.

Post, at 311. Our rush to such a holding after a mere 18 years of fruitless litigation "contrastsstarkly" he says, "with the more patient approach" that this

Court has taken in the past. Post, at 310. We think not.When it has come to determining what areas fall beyond our
Article III authority to adjudicate, this Court's practice,
from the earliest days of the Republic to the present, hasbeen more reminiscent of Hannibal than of Hamlet. On July

18, 1793, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson wrote theJustices at the direction of President Washington, asking
whether they might answer "questions [that] depend for
their solution on the construction of our treaties, on the laws
of nature and nations, and on the laws of the land," but that
arise "under circumstances which do not give a cognisance
of them to the tribunals of the country." 3 Correspondence
and Public Papers of John Jay 486-487 (H. Johnston ed. 1891)
(emphasis in original). The letter specifically invited the
Justices to give less than a categorical yes-or-no answer, offering to present the particular questions "from which [the
Justices] will themselves strike out such as any circumstances might, in their opinion, forbid them to pronounce on."
Id., at 487. On August 8, 1793, the Justices responded in a
categorical and decidedly "impatient" manner, saying that
the giving of advisory opinions--not just advisory opinions
on particular questions but all advisory opinions, presumably even those concerning legislation affecting the Judiciary--was beyond their power. "[T]he lines of separation
drawn by the Constitution between the three departments
of the government" prevented it. Id., at 488. The Court
rejected the more "cautious" course of not "deny[ing] all
hopes of intervention," post, at 310, but leaving the door open
to the possibility that at least some advisory opinions (on a
theory we could not yet imagine) would not violate the separation of powers. In Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 7
(1973), a case filed after the Ohio National Guard's shooting

of students at Kent State University, the plaintiffs sought"initial judicial review and continuing surveillance by a federal court over the training, weaponry, and orders of theGuard." The Court held the suit nonjusticiable; the matter
was committed to the political branches because, inter alia,"it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity
in which the courts have less competence." Id., at 10. The
Court did not adopt the more "cautious" course of letting thelower courts try their hand at regulating the military before

we declared it impossible. Most recently, in Nixon v.
United States, the Court, joined by Justice Kennedy, held
that a claim that the Senate had employed certain impermissible procedures in trying an impeachment was a nonjusticiable political question. Our decision was not limited to the
particular procedures under challenge, and did not reserve
the possibility that sometime, somewhere, technology or the
wisdom derived from experience might make a court challenge to Senate impeachment all right.

The only cases Justice Kennedy cites in defense of his
never-say-never approach are Baker v. Carr and Bandemer.
See post, at 310-311. Bandemer provides no cover. There,
all of the Justices who concluded that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable proceeded to describe what they
regarded as the discernible and manageable standard that
rendered it so. The lower courts were set wandering in the
wilderness for 18 years not because the Bandemer majority
thought it a good idea, but because five Justices could not
agree upon a single standard, and because the standard the
plurality proposed turned out not to work.

As for Baker v. Carr: It is true enough that, having had
no experience whatever in apportionment matters of any
sort, the Court there refrained from spelling out the equal
protection standard. (It did so a mere two years later in
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964).) But the judgment
under review in Baker, unlike the one under review here,
did not demand the determination of a standard. The lower

Opinion of Scalia, J.
court in Baker had held the apportionment claim of the plain-tiffs nonjusticiable, and so it was logically possible to dispose of the appeal by simply disagreeing with the nonjusti-ciability determination. As we observed earlier, that is not
possible here, where the lower court has held the claim justi-ciable but unsupported by the facts. We must either enunciate the standard that causes us to agree or disagree withthat merits judgment, or else affirm that the claim is beyond
our competence to adjudicate.

Justice Kennedy worries that "[a] determination by theCourt to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decisionto intervene." Post, at 310. But it is the function of the
courts to provide relief, not hope. What we think woulderode confidence is the Court's refusal to do its job--announcing that there may well be a valid claim here, but weare not yet prepared to figure it out. Moreover, that course
does more than erode confidence; by placing the districtcourts back in the business of pretending to afford help when
they in fact can give none, it deters the political process fromaffording genuine relief. As was noted by a lower court confronted with a political gerrymandering claim:

"When the Supreme Court resolves Vieth, it may chooseto retreat from its decision that the question is justiciable, or it may offer more guidance on the nature of therequired effect. . . . We have learned firsthand what will
result if the Court chooses to do neither. Throughoutthis case we have borne witness to the powerful, conflicting forces nurtured by Bandemer's holding that thejudiciary is to address `excessive' partisan line-drawing,
while leaving the issue virtually unenforceable. Inevi-tably, as the political party in power uses district lines
to lock in its present advantage, the party out of powerattempts to stretch the protective cover of the Voting
Rights Act, urging dilution of critical standards thatmay, if accepted, aid their party in the short-run but

work to the detriment of persons now protected by theAct in the long-run. Casting the appearance both that

there is a wrong and that the judiciary stands readywith a remedy,

Bandemer as applied steps on legislative
incentives for self-correction." Session, 298 F. Supp.2d, at 474.

But the conclusive refutation of Justice Kennedy's posi-tion is the point we first made: it is not an available disposition. We can affirm because political districting presents anonjusticiable question; or we can affirm because we believe
the correct standard which identifies unconstitutional politi-cal districting has not been met; we cannot affirm because
we do not know what the correct standard is. Reduced toits essence,

Justice Kennedy's opinion boils down to this:
"As presently advised, I know of no discernible and manageable standard that can render this claim justiciable. I amunhappy about that, and hope that I will be able to change

my opinion in the future." What are the lower courts tomake of this pronouncement? We suggest that they must
treat it as a reluctant fifth vote against justiciability at dis-trict and statewide levels--a vote that may change in some
future case but that holds, for the time being, that this mat-ter is nonjusticiable.

VI
We conclude that neither Article I, $ 2, nor the Equal Protection Clause, nor (what appellants only fleetingly invoke)Article I, $ 4, provides a judicially enforceable limit on the

political considerations that the States and Congress maytake into account when districting.

Considerations of stare decisis do not compel us to allow
Bandemer to stand. That case involved an interpretation of
the Constitution, and the claims of stare decisis are at their
weakest in that field, where our mistakes cannot be corrected
by Congress. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828
(1991). They are doubly weak in Bandemer because the ma541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
306 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
jority's inability to enunciate the judicially discernible andmanageable standard that it thought existed (or did not think

did not exist) presaged the need for reconsideration in lightof subsequent experience. And they are triply weak because it is hard to imagine how any action taken in relianceupon Bandemer could conceivably be frustrated--except the
bringing of lawsuits, which is not the sort of primary conductthat is relevant.

While we do not lightly overturn one of our own holdings,"when governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, `this Court has never felt constrained to follow prece-dent.' " 501 U. S., at 827 (quoting

Smith v. Allwright, 321U. S. 649, 665 (1944)). Eighteen years of essentially pointless litigation have persuaded us that Bandemer is incapableof principled application. We would therefore overrule that
case, and decline to adjudicate these political gerrymander-ing claims.

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
A decision ordering the correction of all election districtlines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and

state courts to unprecedented intervention in the Americanpolitical process. The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nation's politicallife. While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint
the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed,and while understanding that great caution is necessary
when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all pos-sibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale
were found to correct an established violation of the Consti-tution in some redistricting cases.

When presented with a claim of injury from partisan ger-rymandering, courts confront two obstacles. First is the
lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

307Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
electoral boundaries. No substantive definition of fairnessin districting seems to command general assent. Second is

the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.With uncertain limits, intervening courts--even when proceeding with best intentions--would risk assuming political,not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill
will and distrust.

That courts can grant relief in districting cases where raceis involved does not answer our need for fairness principles

here. Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones. Race is an impermissible classification. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630
(1993). Politics is quite a different matter. See Gaffney v.
Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 752 (1973) ("It would be idle, we
think, to contend that any political consideration taken into
account in fashioning a reapportionment plan is sufficient to
invalidate it").

A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must
rest on something more than the conclusion that political
classifications were applied. It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible,
were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated
to any legitimate legislative objective.

The object of districting is to establish "fair and effective
representation for all citizens." Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S.
533, 565-568 (1964). At first it might seem that courts could
determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether
political classifications are related to this object or instead
burden representational rights. The lack, however, of any
agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes
this analysis difficult to pursue.

The second obstacle--the absence of rules to confine judicial intervention--is related to the first. Because there are
yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manage541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
308 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
able, and politically neutral standards for measuring the par-ticular burden a given partisan classification imposes on

representational rights. Suitable standards for measuringthis burden, however, are critical to our intervention. Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymanderingcase to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.

In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants'rights. The fairness principle appellants propose is that a

majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able toelect a majority of the Commonwealth's congressional delegation. There is no authority for this precept. Even if the
novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way
to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an
alleged burden on representational rights. The plurality
demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that
have been considered to date. See ante, at Parts III and
IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in Davis v.
Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986), by the parties before us, and
by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both). I would add two comments to the plurality's analysis. The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover,
helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.
Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislator's duty in
drawing district lines.

Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at
the outset (e. g., contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights. They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.
Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

309Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
unavoidably have significant political effect, whether in-tended or not. For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not as-sure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its
face, would not in fact benefit one political party over an-other. See

Gaffney, supra, at 753 ("District lines are rarely
neutral phenomena. They can well determine what district
will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republi-can, or make a close race likely"); see also R. Bork, The

Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law88-89 (1990) (documenting the author's service as a special
master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting
that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit
unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory
District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 1000-1006 (1998) (explaining that compactness
standards help Republicans because Democrats are more
likely to live in high density regions).

The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized. See Lowenstein & Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory?
33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ("[W]hat matters to us, and
what we think matters to almost all Americans when district
lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and
the policies the parties stand for are affected. When such
things are at stake there is no neutrality. There is only political contest"). The dearth of helpful historical guidance
must, in part, cause this uncertainty.

There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like
these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail
in the long run. In my view, however, the arguments are
not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future
claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander. It is not in
our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the at541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
310 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
tempt to define standards and remedies where it is allegedthat a constitutional right is burdened or denied. Nor is it

alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election districtlines. Courts, after all, already do so in many instances. A
determination by the Court to deny all hopes of interventioncould erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the appor-tionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims

makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusalto entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering. The plurality's conclusion that absent an "easily admin-istrable standard,"

ante, at 290, the appellants' claim must
be nonjusticiable contrasts starkly with the more patient ap-proach of

Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), not to mention
the controlling precedent on the question of justiciability of
Davis v. Bandemer, supra, the case the plurality would overrule. See ante, at 305-306.In

Baker the Court made clear that the more abstract
standards that guide analysis of all Fourteenth Amendment
claims sufficed to ensure justiciability of a one-person, one-vote claim. See 369 U. S., at 226.

"Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations
for which judicially manageable standards are lacking.Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause

are well developed and familiar, and it has been open tocourts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must,
that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action." Ibid.

The Court said this before the more specific standard with
which we are now familiar emerged to measure the burden nonequipopulous districting causes on representational
rights. See Reynolds, 377 U. S., at 565-568 (concluding that

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

311Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
"[s]ince the achieving of fair and effective representation forall citizens is concededly the basic aim of legislative apportionment," a legislature's reliance on other apportionmentinterests is invalid, arbitrary, and capricious action if it leads
to unequal populations among districts). The plurality'sresponse that in

Baker this Court sat in review only of a
nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark. See ante,
at 303-304. As the plurality itself instructs: Before a courtcan conclude that it "has [any] business entertaining [a]

claim," it must conclude that some "judicially enforceablerigh[t]" is at issue.

Ante, at 277. Whether a manageable
standard made the right at issue in Baker enforceable was
as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here. In light of
Baker and Davis v. Bandemer, which directly address the
question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the plurality's further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be
thought controlling. See ante, at 302-303.

Even putting Baker to the side--and so assuming that
the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymander's burden on representational rights distinguishes
one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering
claims for justiciability purposes--I would still reject the
plurality's conclusions as to nonjusticiability. Relying on
the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of
a categorical negative. That is, the different treatment of
claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no
standard could exist. This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

That no such standard has emerged in this case should not
be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.
Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full
analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.
Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
312 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
most serious claims, for we have long believed that "theright to vote" is one of "those political processes ordinarily

to be relied upon to protect minorities." United States v.
Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). If a
State passed an enactment that declared "All future appor-tionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party X's

rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles," we would surelyconclude the Constitution had been violated. If that is so,

we should admit the possibility remains that a legislaturemight attempt to reach the same result without that express
directive. This possibility suggests that in another case a
standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an
apportionment's de facto incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and
so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of
apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).

The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative. Ante, at 306 ("Eighteen years of essentially pointless
litigation have persuaded us"). As Justice Souter is correct to point out, however, during these past 18 years the
lower courts could do no more than follow Davis v. Bandemer, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable
standard. See post, at 344-345 (dissenting opinion). Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short
period. In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in
the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities. Computer assisted districting has become so routine
and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can
use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours,
not months. See, e. g., Larios v. Cox, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335
(ND Ga. 2004) (per curiam). Technology is both a threat
and a promise. On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation
to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow. On the other hand, these new

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

313Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
technologies may produce new methods of analysis that makemore evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and par-ties. That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by thederived standards.

If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a
gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge,hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned

the field. That is a risk the Court should not take. Instead,we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.
See Baker, 369 U. S., at 331 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (concluding that the malapportionment claim "should have been dismissed for `failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted' " because "[u]ntil it is first decided to what extent
[the] right [to apportion] is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what [a State] has done or failed to do . . .
runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of `justiciability' or `political question' ").

Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by
which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those
same rights. Failing to show that the alleged classifications
are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants' evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted
political classifications. That describes no constitutional
flaw, at least under the governing Fourteenth Amendment
standard. See Gaffney, 412 U. S., at 752. As a consequence, appellants' complaint alleges no impermissible use of
political classifications and so states no valid claim on which
relief may be granted. It must be dismissed as a result.
See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); see also Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 134.

The plurality thinks I resolve this case with reference to
no standard, see ante, at 301, but that is wrong. The Four541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
314 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
teenth Amendment standard governs; and there is no doubtof that. My analysis only notes that if a subsidiary standard

could show how an otherwise permissible classification, asapplied, burdens representational rights, we could conclude
that appellants' evidence states a provable claim under theFourteenth Amendment standard.

Though in the briefs and at argument the appellants relied
on the Equal Protection Clause as the source of their sub-stantive right and as the basis for relief, I note that the

complaint in this case also alleged a violation of FirstAmendment rights. See Amended Complaint || 48; Juris.
Statement 145a. The First Amendment may be the more
relevant constitutional provision in future cases that allege
unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. After all, these
allegations involve the First Amendment interest of not burdening or penalizing citizens because of their participation in
the electoral process, their voting history, their association
with a political party, or their expression of political views.
See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976) (plurality opinion).
Under general First Amendment principles those burdens
in other contexts are unconstitutional absent a compelling
government interest. See id., at 362. "Representative democracy in any populous unit of governance is unimaginable
without the ability of citizens to band together in promoting
among the electorate candidates who espouse their political
views." California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S.
567, 574 (2000). As these precedents show, First Amendment concerns arise where a State enacts a law that has the
purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their
party to disfavored treatment by reason of their views. In
the context of partisan gerrymandering, that means that
First Amendment concerns arise where an apportionment
has the purpose and effect of burdening a group of voters'
representational rights.

The plurality suggests there is no place for the First
Amendment in this area. See ante, at 294. The implication

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

315Cite as: 541 U. S. 267 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
is that under the First Amendment any and all considerationof political interests in an apportionment would be invalid.

Ibid. ("Only an equal protection claim is before us in thepresent case--perhaps for the very good reason that a First
Amendment claim, if it were sustained, would render unlaw-ful

all consideration of political affiliation in districting").
That misrepresents the First Amendment analysis. The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used. Theinquiry instead is whether political classifications were used

to burden a group's representational rights. If a court wereto find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on
groups or persons by reason of their views, there would
likely be a First Amendment violation, unless the State
shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends
first on courts' having available a manageable standard by
which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to
conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction
on the rights of a party's voters.

Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose
and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its
voters, the First Amendment may offer a sounder and more
prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause. The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactment's classifications.
This works where race is involved since classifying by race
is almost never permissible. It presents a more complicated
question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible
classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.
That question can only be answered in the affirmative by
the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens. The First Amendment analysis
concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining party's voters for
reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association. The
analysis allows a pragmatic or functional assessment that accords some latitude to the States. See Eu v. San Francisco

Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude thatpartisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible. Indeed, the plurality seems to acknowledge it is not.See ante, at 292 ("We do not disagree with [the] judgment"
that "partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with demo-cratic principles");

ante, at 293 (noting that it is the case, andthat the plurality opinion assumes it to be the case, that "an

excessive injection of politics [in districting] is unlawful").This is all the more reason to admit the possibility of later
suits, while holding just that the parties have failed to prove,under our "well developed and familiar" standard, that these
legislative classifications "reflec[t] no policy, but simply arbi-trary and capricious action." Baker, 369 U. S., at 226. That
said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard thatturns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting
process were excessive. Excessiveness is not easily deter-mined. Consider these apportionment schemes: In one
State, Party X controls the apportionment process anddraws the lines so it captures every congressional seat. In
three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment proc-ess. It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a
more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in eachState. Still, the total effect of Party Y's effort is to capture
more new seats than Party X captured. Party X's gerry-mander was more egregious. Party Y's gerrymander was
more subtle. In my view, however, each is culpable.

The ordered working of our Republic, and of the demo-cratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint

in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned. That should not be thought to serve the interestsof our political order. Nor should it be thought to serve

our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracyworks. Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaringthat, when it comes to apportionment: " `We are in the business of rigging elections.' " Hoeffel, Six Incumbents Are aWeek Away from Easy Election, Winston-Salem Journal,
Jan. 27, 1998, p. B1 (quoting a North Carolina state senator).

Still, the Court's own responsibilities require that we re-frain from intervention in this instance. The failings of the

many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerry-mander imposes on representational rights make our intervention improper. If workable standards do emerge tomeasure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared
to order relief. With these observations, I join the judgment of the Court.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable. Although our
reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of
the Court are convinced that the plurality's answer to that
question is erroneous. Moreover, as is apparent from our
separate writings today, we share the view that, even if
these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the
future. That we presently have somewhat differing views--
concerning both the precedential value of some of our recent
cases and the standard that should be applied in future
cases--should not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater
significance.

The concept of equal justice under law requires the State
to govern impartially. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620,
623 (1996); Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 265 (1983); New
York City Transit Authority v. Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 587

(1979). Today's plurality opinion would exempt governingofficials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisangerrymanders that are devoid of any rational justification.
In my view, when partisanship is the legislature's sole mo-tivation--when any pretense of neutrality is forsaken unabashedly and all traditional districting criteria are sub-verted for partisan advantage--the governing body cannot
be said to have acted impartially.Although we reaffirm the central holding of the Court in
Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986), we have not reachedagreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymandering claims. I would decide this case on a narrowground. Plaintiffs-appellants urge us to craft new rules that
in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide elec-tion results to protect the democratic process from a transient majority's abuse of its power to define voting districts.I agree with the plurality's refusal to undertake that ambitious project. Ante, at 284-290. I am persuaded, however,that the District Court failed to apply well-settled propositions of law when it granted the defendants' motion to dis-miss plaintiff-appellant Susan Furey's gerrymandering claim.

According to the complaint, Furey is a registered Demo-crat who resides at an address in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was located under the 1992 districting plan inCongressional District 13.

1 Under the new plan adopted by

the General Assembly in 2002, Furey's address now placesher in the "non-compact" District 6.

2 Furey alleges that the

new districting plan was created "solely" to effectuate theinterests of Republicans,

3 and that the General Assembly relied "exclusively" on a principle of "maximum partisan ad-vantage" when drawing the plan.

4 In my judgment, Furey's

allegations are plainly sufficient to establish: (1) that she hasstanding to challenge the constitutionality of District 6;

(2) that her district-specific claim is not foreclosed by theBandemer plurality's rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that,at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvania's redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciatedin our voting rights cases both before and after

Bandemer.The District Court therefore erred when it granted the defendants' motion to dismiss Furey's claim.

I
Prior to our seminal decision in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S.186 (1962), a majority of this Court had heeded Justice

Frankfurter 's repeated warnings about the dire conse-quences of entering the "political thicket" of legislative districting. Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, 556 (1946). Asa result, even the most egregious gerrymanders were sheltered from judicial review.5 It was after Baker that we firstdecided that the Constitution prohibits legislators from
drawing district lines that diminish the value of individualvotes in overpopulated districts. In reaching that conclu5 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the
State's district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not
reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, "despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population." 328 U. S., at
569 (Black, J., dissenting). The populations of Illinois' districts in 1945
consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000
in the most. Ibid. Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that "due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not
meet for judicial determination." Id., at 552. Fewer than 20 years later,
the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of facts--a Tennessee
apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growth--held, in obvious tension
with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.
Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197-198. The Court distinguished Colegrove as
simply "a refusal to exercise equity's powers." 369 U. S., at 235.

sion, we explained that "legislatures . . . should be bodieswhich are collectively responsive to the popular will," Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 565 (1964), and we accordinglydescribed "the basic aim of legislative apportionment" as
"achieving . . . fair and effective representation for all citi-zens," id., at 565-566. Consistent with that goal, we also
reviewed claims that the majority had discriminated againstparticular groups of voters by drawing multimember districts that threatened "to minimize or cancel out the votingstrength of racial or political elements of the voting population." Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433, 439 (1965). Suchdistricts were "vulnerable" to constitutional challenge "if racial or political groups ha[d] been fenced out of the politicalprocess and their voting strength invidiously minimized."
Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 754 (1973). See also
Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 143 (1971); Burns v. Rich-ardson, 384 U. S. 73, 88 (1966).

Our holding in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 118-127, that parti-san gerrymandering claims are justiciable followed ineluctably from the central reasoning in Baker, 369 U. S. 186.What was true in

Baker is no less true in this context:

"The question here is the consistency of state actionwith the Federal Constitution. We have no question

decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of govern-ment coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturb-ance at home if we take issue with [Pennsylvania] as to
the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Norneed the appellants, in order to succeed in this action,
ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations forwhich judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause arewell developed and familiar, and it has been open to
courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amend-ment to determine, if on the particular facts they must,
that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply ar541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

bitrary and capricious action." Id., at 226 (footnoteomitted).

"[T]hat the [gerrymandering] claim is submitted by a politi-cal group, rather than a racial group, does not distinguish
[the cases] in terms of justiciability." Bandemer, 478 U. S.,at 125.

At issue in this case, as the plurality states, ante, at 278,is Baker's second test--the presence or absence of judicially
manageable standards. The judicial standards applicable togerrymandering claims are deeply rooted in decisions that
long preceded Bandemer and have been refined in latercases. Among those well-settled principles is the understanding that a district's peculiar shape might be a symptomof an illicit purpose in the line-drawing process. Most notably, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 340 (1960),the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the
boundaries of the city of Tuskegee "from a square to anuncouth twenty-eight-sided figure" for the sole purpose of
preventing African-Americans from voting in municipalelections. The allegations of bizarre shape and improper
motive, "if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed]that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting
measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering."
Id., at 341. Justice Fortas' concurring opinion in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526, 538 (1969), which referred togerrymandering as "the deliberate and arbitrary distortion

of district boundaries and populations for partisan or per-sonal political purposes," also identified both shape and purpose as relevant standards. The maps attached as exhibitsin Gomillion, 364 U. S., at 348 (Appendix to opinion of the
Court), and in subsequent voting rights cases demonstratethat an "uncouth" or bizarre shape can easily identify a district designed for a single-minded, nonneutral purpose.With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations
have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness ofa gerrymander. In his dissent in

Bandemer, Justice Powell

Stevens, J., dissenting
explained that "the merits of a gerrymandering claim mustbe determined by reference to the configurations of the districts, the observance of political subdivision lines, and othercriteria that have independent relevance to the fairness of
redistricting." 478 U. S., at 165. Applying this three-partstandard, Justice Powell first reviewed the procedures used
in Indiana's redistricting process and noted that the party inpower had excluded the opposition from its deliberations and
had placed excessive weight on data concerning party votingtrends.

Id., at 175-176. Second, Justice Powell pointed tothe strange shape of districts that conspicuously ignored traditional districting principles. Id., at 176-177. He notedthe impact of such shapes on residents of the uncouth districts,6 and he included in his opinion maps that illustratedthe irregularity of the district shapes, id., at 181, 183. Third
and finally, Justice Powell reviewed other "substantial evi-dence," including contemporaneous statements and press accounts, demonstrating that the architects of the districts"were motivated solely by partisan considerations."

Id.,at 177.

The Court has made use of all three parts of Justice Pow-ell's standard in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence. In those cases, the Court has examined claims thatredistricting schemes violate the equal protection guarantee
where they are "so highly irregular" on their face that they"rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an
effort" to segregate voters by race, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.630, 646-647 (1993) (Shaw I), or where "race for its own sake,
and not other districting principles, was the legislature'sdominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district
lines," Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913 (1995). See

6 " `[T]he potential for voter disillusion and nonparticipation is great,' as
voters are forced to focus their political activities in artificial electoral
units. Intelligent voters, regardless of party affiliation, resent this sort
of political manipulation of the electorate for no public purpose." 478

Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 905 (1996) (Shaw II).7 The Shaw line
of cases has emphasized that "reapportionment is one area
in which appearances do matter," Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647,
and has focused both on the shape of the challenged districts
and the purpose behind the line-drawing in assessing the
constitutionality of majority-minority districts under the
Equal Protection Clause. These decisions, like Justice Powell's opinion in Bandemer, have also considered the process
by which the districting schemes were enacted,8 looked to
other evidence demonstrating that purely improper considerations motivated the decision,9 and included maps illustrating
outlandish district shapes.10

Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought
the question of justiciability in cases such as this--where a
set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a
districting scheme with discriminatory effects--to be well
settled. The plurality's contrary conclusion cannot be

7 The reasoning in these decisions followed not only from Gomillion v.
Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), see Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 644-645 (relying
on Gomillion), but also from Justice Powell's observation in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 173, n. 12 (1986), that "[i]n some cases, proof of
grotesque district shapes may, without more, provide convincing proof of
unconstitutional gerrymandering."

8 In Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 917-919 (1995), the Court reviewed

the procedures followed by the Georgia Legislature in responding to the
Justice Department's objections to its original plan, and the part that the
operator of its "reapportionment computer" played in designing the districts, to support its conclusion "that the legislature subordinated traditional districting principles to race." See also Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S.
952, 961-962 (1996) (plurality opinion) (discussing use of computer program
to manipulate district lines).

9 In Shaw II, 517 U. S. 899, 910 (1996), for instance, the Court considered

the fact that certain reports regarding the effects of past discrimination
were not before the legislature and therefore could not have played a role
in the districting process.

squared with our long history of voting rights decisions.
Especially perplexing is the plurality's ipse dixit distinction
of our racial gerrymandering cases. Notably, the plurality
does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that
have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims
would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering
cases. Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its
view that race as a districting criterion is "much more rarely
encountered" than partisanship, ante, at 286, and that determining whether race--"a rare and constitutionally suspect
motive"--dominated a districting decision "is quite different
from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive
as to [be] invali[d]," ibid. But those considerations are
wholly irrelevant to the issue of justiciability.

To begin with, the plurality errs in assuming that politics
is "an ordinary and lawful motive." We have squarely rejected the notion that a "purpose to discriminate on the basis
of politics," ante, at 286, 293, is never subject to strict scrutiny. On the contrary, "political belief and association constitute the core of those activities protected by the First
Amendment," Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, 356 (1976) (plurality opinion), and discriminatory governmental decisions
that burden fundamental First Amendment interests are
subject to strict scrutiny, id., at 363; cf. Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 94-95 (1972). Thus, unless
party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position in question, government officials may not base a decision
to hire, promote, transfer, recall, discharge, or retaliate
against an employee, or to terminate a contract, on the
individual's partisan affiliation or speech. See Board of
Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S. 668, 674-675
(1996); O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518

Stevens, J., dissenting
519-520 (1980); Elrod, 427 U. S., at 355-363.11 It follows
that political affiliation is not an appropriate standard for
excluding voters from a congressional district.

The plurality argues that our patronage cases do not support the proposition that strict scrutiny should be applied in
political gerrymandering cases because "[i]t is elementary
that scrutiny levels are claim specific." Ante, at 294. It is
also elementary, however, that the level of scrutiny is relevant to the question whether there has been a constitutional
violation, not the question of justiciability.12 The standards
outlined above are discernible and judicially manageable regardless of the number of cases in which they must be applied or the level of scrutiny at which the analysis occurs.13
Thus, the dicta from Shaw I and Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952
(1996), on which the plurality relies, ante, at 293-294, are
beside the point, because they speak not at all to the subject
of justiciability. And while of course a difference exists be11 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in
Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia,
J.), correctly state the law--namely, that "when a practice not expressly
prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a
long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back
to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it
down," id., at 95. Cf. ante, at 274-275 (tracing the history of political
gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century). But "[o]ur inquiry
does not begin with the judgment of history"; "[r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a
challenged governmental practice." Elrod, 427 U. S., at 354-355.

12 It goes without saying that a claim that otherwise would trigger strict

scrutiny might nonetheless be nonjusticiable. See, e. g., Allen v. Wright,
468 U. S. 737 (1984); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per
curiam).

13 The plurality explains that it is willing to "accep[t] a modest degree

of unmanageability" where the "constitutional command . . . is clear," but
not where the "constitutional obligation . . . is both dubious and severely
unmanageable." Ante, at 286. Not only does this statement cast doubt
on the plurality's faith in our racial gerrymandering cases, but its reasoning is clearly tautological.

Stevens, J., dissenting
tween the constitutional interests protected by the First andFourteenth Amendments, the relevant lesson of the patronage cases is that partisanship is not always as benign a con-sideration as the plurality appears to assume. In any event,
as I understand the plurality's opinion, it seems to agree thatif the State goes "too far"--if it engages in "political gerrymandering for politics' sake"--it violates the Constitution inthe same way as if it undertakes "racial gerrymandering for
race's sake." Ante, at 293. But that sort of constitutionalviolation cannot be touched by the courts, the plurality maintains, because the judicial obligation to intervene is "dubi-ous."

Ante, at 286.14State action that discriminates against a political minority

for the sole and unadorned purpose of maximizing the powerof the majority plainly violates the decisionmaker's duty to
remain impartial. See, e. g., Lehr, 463 U. S., at 265. Gerry-manders necessarily rest on legislators' predictions that
"members of certain identifiable groups . . . will vote in thesame way."

Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 87 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). "In the line-drawingprocess, racial, religious, ethnic, and economic gerrymanders

are all species of political gerrymanders." Id., at 88. Thus,the critical issue in both racial and political gerrymandering
cases is the same: whether a single nonneutral criterion con-trolled the districting process to such an extent that the Constitution was offended. This Court has treated that precisequestion as justiciable in

Gomillion and in the Shaw line ofcases, and today's plurality has supplied no persuasive reason

14 The plurality's reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan
gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims
will give rise to a flood of litigation. See ante, at 286. But the list of
cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 280, suggests that in
the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three
or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year. That volume is
obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation
that followed our adoption of the "one-person, one-vote" rule. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964).

for distinguishing the justiciability of partisan gerryman-ders. Those cases confirm and reinforce the holding that

partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable.15

II
The plurality opinion in Bandemer dealt with a claim thatthe Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a state-wide basis. 478 U. S., at 127. In my judgment, the Bandemer Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge,because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that
affected members of their party throughout the State. Inthe subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however,
the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges andrequired, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating
race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the dis-tricts they are challenging. See United States v. Hays, 515
U. S. 737, 745 (1995). Because Hays has altered the stand-ing rules for gerrymandering claims--and because, in my
view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of thesame constitutional concern--the

Hays standing rule re-quires dismissal of the statewide claim.

16 But that does not

15 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: "That
the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the
group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant
to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do
not justify a refusal to entertain such a case." 478 U. S., at 125.

16 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 280, n. 6, support the

conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed
in Justice Powell's dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 744 (1983). I remain convinced
that our opinions correctly interpreted the law. If that standard were
applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case
would be required. For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I
dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was
incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the
political gerrymandering context. Given the Court's illogical disposition
of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the

end the matter. Challenges to specific districts, such as
those considered in the Shaw cases, relate to a different type
of "representational" harm, and those allegations necessarily
must be considered on a district-by-district basis. The complaint in this case alleges injuries of both types--a group
harm to Democratic voters throughout Pennsylvania and a
more individualized representational injury to Furey as a
resident of District 6.

In a challenge to a statewide districting plan, plaintiffsappellants complain that they have been injured because of
their membership in a particular, identifiable group. The
plaintiffs-appellees in Bandemer, for example, alleged "that
Democratic voters over the State as a whole, not Democratic
voters in particular districts, ha[d] been subjected to unconstitutional discrimination." 478 U. S., at 127 (citing complaint). They specifically claimed that they were injured as
members of a group because the number of Democratic representatives was not commensurate with the number of
Democratic voters throughout Indiana. Much like the
plaintiffs-appellees in Bandemer, plaintiffs-appellants in this
case allege that the statewide plan will enable Republicans,
who constitute about half of Pennsylvania's voters, to elect
13 or 14 members of the State's 19-person congressional delegation.17 Under Hays, however, plaintiffs-appellants lack
standing to challenge the districting plan on a statewide
basis. 515 U. S., at 744-745.18

A challenge to a specific district or districts, on the other
hand, alleges a different type of injury entirely--one that

standing issue. I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never
have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

our recent racial gerrymandering cases have recognized as
cognizable.19 In Shaw I we held that "a plaintiff challenging a reapportionment statute under the Equal Protection
Clause may state a claim by alleging that the legislation,
though race neutral on its face, rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into
different districts on the basis of race." 509 U. S., at 649.
Af ter describing the pernici ous consequences of raceconscious districting--even when designed to enhance the
representation of the minority--and after explaining why
dramatically irregular shapes " `have sufficient probative
force to call for an explanation,' " id., at 647 (quoting Karcher
v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 755 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring)), we described the message a misshapen district sends
to elected officials:

"When a district obviously is created solely to effectuate
the perceived common interests of one racial group,
elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that
group, rather than their constituency as a whole. This
is altogether antithetical to our system of representative
democracy." Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 648.

Undergirding the Shaw cases is the premise that racial gerrymanders effect a constitutional wrong when they disrupt
the representational norms that ordinarily tether elected officials to their constituencies as a whole.

"[L]egislatures," we have explained, "should be bodies
which are collectively responsive to the popular will," Reynolds, 377 U. S., at 565, for "[l]egislators are elected by voters,

19 The plurality in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 127, itself acknowledged that
"the focus of the equal protection inquiry" in a statewide challenge "is
necessarily somewhat different from that involved in the review of individual districts."

not farms or cities or economic interests," id., at 562.20 Gerrymanders subvert that representative norm because the
winner of an election in a gerrymandered district inevitably
will infer that her success is primarily attributable to the
architect of the district rather than to a constituency defined
by neutral principles. The Shaw cases hold that this disruption of the representative process imposes a cognizable
"representational har[m]." Hays, 515 U. S., at 745. Because that harm falls squarely on the voters in the district
whose representative might or does misperceive the object
of her fealty, the injury is cognizable only when stated by
voters who reside in that particular district, see Shaw II,
517 U. S., at 904; otherwise the "plaintiff would be asserting
only a generalized grievance against governmental conduct
of which he or she does not approve," Hays, 515 U. S., at
745. See also Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S., at 957-958 (plurality
opinion).

Although the complaint in this case includes a statewide
challenge, plaintiff-appellant Furey states a stronger claim
as a resident of the misshapen District 6.21 She complains
not merely about the injury resulting from the probable election of a congressional delegation that does not fairly repre20 Cf. McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93, 153 (2003)

corruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the
merits or the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes
of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the
officeholder").

The complaint does not claim that they resided in a different district under
the old districting scheme, nor does it anywhere allege, as it does on Furey's behalf, that District 16 in particular is irregularly shaped. A glance
at the appended map, infra, reveals that District 16 is not especially unusual in its contours. Without more specific allegations regarding District 16, I would limit the analysis to District 6.

She also alleges that the grotesque configuration of that dis-trict itself imposes a special harm on the members of the

political minority residing in District 6 that directly parallelsthe harm recognized in Shaw I. Officials elected by the majority party in such a district, she claims, "are more likely tobelieve that their primary obligation is to represent only the
members of that group, rather than the constituency as awhole."

23 This is precisely the harm that the Shaw cases

treat as cognizable in the context of racial gerrymandering.The same treatment is warranted in this case.

The risk of representational harms identified in the Shawcases is equally great, if not greater, in the context of partisan gerrymanders. Shaw I was borne of the concern thatan official elected from a racially gerrymandered district will
feel beholden only to a portion of her constituents, and thatthose constituents will be defined by race. 509 U. S., at 648.
The parallel danger of a partisan gerrymander is that therepresentative will perceive that the people who put her in
power are those who drew the map rather than those whocast ballots, and she will feel beholden not to a subset of her
constituency, but to no part of her constituency at all.24 Theproblem, simply put, is that the will of the cartographers
rather than the will of the people will govern.25 As Judge

25 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the

English "rotten borough." In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite
population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. "Because rep541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Elected officials in some sense serve two masters: the con-stituents who elected them and the political sponsors who

support them. Their primary obligations are, of course, tothe public in general, but it is neither realistic nor fair to
expect them wholly to ignore the political consequences oftheir decisions. "It would be idle . . . to contend that any
political consideration taken into account in fashioning a re-apportionment plan is sufficient to invalidate it." Gaffney,
412 U. S., at 752. Political factors are common and permissi-ble elements of the art of governing a democratic society.

But while political considerations may properly influencethe decisions of our elected officials, when such decisions disresentation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over
time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs. Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residents--only a few sheep--yet sent the same
number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants." R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the
United States, 1776-1850, p. 37 (1987). As a result of this system, "many
insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did
not," and "even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny
fraction of the population." J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform
Bill 176 (1914). Meanwhile, "[t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash," and
"[t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way." Ibid.
The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, onevote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such
a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government
rather than to his constituents (if he had any). Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting
their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the
constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

advantage members of a minority group--whether the minority is defined by its members' race, religion, or political affiliation--they must rest on a neutral predicate. See
Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976) ("The
federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially");
Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 166 (Powell, J., dissenting). The
Constitution enforces "a commitment to the law's neutrality
where the rights of persons are at stake." Romer, 517 U. S.,
at 623. See also Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 375 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring)
("States act as neutral entities, ready to take instruction and
to enact laws when their citizens so demand"). Thus, the
Equal Protection Clause implements a duty to govern impartially that requires, at the very least, that every decision by
the sovereign serve some nonpartisan public purpose.26

In evaluating a claim that a governmental decision violates
the Equal Protection Clause, we have long required a showing of discriminatory purpose. See Washington v. Davis,

26 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental
neutrality is buttressed by this Court's recognition that the Elections
Clause is not " `a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor
or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.' " Cook v. Gralike, 531 U. S. 510, 523 (2001) (quoting U. S. Term
Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 833-834 (1995)). And this duty
to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.
Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees
neutrally carry out their duties. See Ex parte Curtis, 106 U. S. 371, 372-
373 (1882). Some of those laws avoided the danger that "the government
itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses
of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time
being the control of the public patronage." Id., at 375. It is "fundamental" that federal employees "are expected to enforce the law and execute
the programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against
any political party or group or the members thereof." Civil Service
Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 564-565 (1973). That expectation reflects the principle that "the impartial execution of the laws" is a
"great end of Government." Id., at 565.

Stevens, J., dissenting
426 U. S. 229 (1976).27 That requirement applies with full
force to districting decisions. The line that divides a racial
or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be
entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factors--
county lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a
river or major thoroughfare. But if the district lines were
chosen for the purpose of limiting the number of minority
students in the school, or the number of families holding unpopular religious or political views, that invidious purpose
surely would invalidate the district. See Gomillion v.
Lightfoot, 364 U. S., at 344-345; cf. Board of Ed. of Kiryas
Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 699-700
(1994).

Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the
purpose of the districting body to determine whether race,
above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing
process. We began by holding in Shaw I that a districting
scheme could be "so irrational on its face that it [could] be
understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race." 509 U. S., at
658. Then, in Miller, we explained that Shaw I's irrationalshape test did not treat the bizarreness of a district's lines
itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of
the district's contours in Shaw I was "persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines." 515 U. S., at

27 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New
York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had
not shown that the statute was " `the product of a state contrivance to
segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.' " 426 U. S., at 240 (quoting Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52, 58 (1964)). We emphasized that
the Court in Wright had been unanimous in identifying the issue as
"whether the `boundaries . . . were purposefully drawn on racial lines.' "
426 U. S., at 240 (quoting Wright, 376 U. S., at 67).

913. Under the Shaw cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not per se impermissible, see Shaw I,
509 U. S., at 642; Shaw II, 517 U. S. 899, but when race is
elevated to paramount status--when it is the be-all and endall of the redistricting process--the legislature has gone too
far. "Race must not simply have been a motivation . . . but
the predominant factor motivating the legislature's districting decision." Easley, 532 U. S., at 241 (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).

Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator
of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.
We have explained that "traditional districting principles,"
which include "compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions," are "important not because they are constitutionally required . . . but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been
gerrymandered on racial lines." Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647
(citing Gaffney, 412 U. S., at 752, n. 18; Karcher, 462 U. S.,
at 755 (Stevens, J., concurring)). "Where these or other
race-neutral considerations are the basis for redistricting
legislation, and are not subordinated to race, a State can `defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial
lines.' " Miller, 515 U. S., at 916 (quoting Shaw I, 509 U. S.,
at 647).

In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of
political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander
is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as
political or racial. Gerrymandering always involves the
drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting
strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize
the strength of one or more groups of opponents. Mobile,
446 U. S., at 87 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). In
seeking the desired result, legislators necessarily make judgments about the probability that the members of identifiable

Stevens, J., dissenting
groups--whether economic, religious, ethnic, or racial--willvote in a certain way. The overriding purpose of those predictions is political. See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 749-750(

Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens,J., concurring in judgment).

28 It follows that the standards

that enable courts to identify and redress a racial gerryman-der could also perform the same function for other species of

gerrymanders. See Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 125; Cousins v.City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisan-ship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting
process. Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictatethe outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines,so long as it does not predominate. If, as plaintiff-appellant
Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislatorswho designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a politi-cal minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the
district.The plurality reasons that the standards for evaluating racial gerrymanders are not workable in cases such as thisbecause partisan considerations, unlike racial ones, are perfectly legitimate. Ante, at 285-286. Until today, however,there has not been the slightest intimation in any opinion
written by any Member of this Court that a naked purpose

28 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.
Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.
In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its
obligation to govern neutrally. See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753-754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850-853

to disadvantage a political minority would provide a rationalbasis for drawing a district line.

29 On the contrary, our opinions referring to political gerrymanders have consistently as-sumed that they were at least undesirable, and we always

have indicated that political considerations are among thosefactors that may not dominate districting decisions.

30

Purely partisan motives are "rational" in a literal sense, butthere must be a limiting principle. "[T]he word `rational'--

for me at least--includes elements of legitimacy and neutral-ity that must always characterize the performance of the
sovereign's duty to govern impartially." Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring). A legislature controlled by one partycould not, for instance, impose special taxes on members of

the minority party, or use tax revenues to pay the majorityparty's campaign expenses. The rational basis for government decisions must satisfy a standard of legitimacy and

29 The plurality's long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders
is interesting, ante, at 274-277, but it surely is not intended to suggest
that the vintage of an invidious practice--even "an American political tradition as old as the Republic," Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S. 668, 688 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting)--should insulate it
from constitutional review. Compare, e. g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130
(1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721,
729 (2003). The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to
justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental
power. In the end, however, the plurality's defense of its position comes
down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to
administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

30 Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (plurality opinion); Gaffney v. Cummings, 412

U. S. 735, 754 (1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 143 (1971); Burns
v. Richardson, 384 U. S. 73, 88 (1966); Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433, 439
(1965). Consistent with these statements, the District Court in a recent
case correctly described political gerrymandering as "a purely partisan
exercise" and "an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental
distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the
expense of the public good." App. to Juris. Statement in Balderas v.
Texas, O. T. 2001, No. 01-1196, p. 10.

neutrality; an acceptable rational basis can be neither purely
personal nor purely partisan. See id., at 452-453.

The Constitution does not, of course, require proportional
representation of racial, ethnic, or political groups. In that
I agree with the plurality. Ante, at 288. We have held,
however, that proportional representation of political groups
is a permissible objective, Gaffney, 412 U. S., at 754, and
some of us have expressed the opinion that a majority's decision to enhance the representation of a racial minority is
equally permissible, particularly when the decision is designed to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.31
Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces today--
that a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one
seeking to benefit a racial minority--is doubly flawed. It
disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and
a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot
provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.32

31 See Shaw II, 517 U. S., at 918 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Bush v. Vera,
517 U. S., at 1033-1034 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Miller, 515 U. S., at 947-
948 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

32 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental

decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive "rational basis"
scrutiny. But "[n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable." Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327 (2003). When race is
used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be
as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political
affiliation, economic status, or national origin. The fact that race is an
immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable
or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.
See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 88 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment). Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for
Democratic candidates, and vice versa.

The plurality asserts that a person's politics, unlike her race, is not
readily "discernible." Ante, at 287. But that assertion is belied by the
evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no
difficulty in discerning the voters' political affiliation. After all, eligibility
to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party
affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

In sum, in evaluating a challenge to a specific district,I would apply the standard set forth in the Shaw cases and

ask whether the legislature allowed partisan considerationsto dominate and control the lines drawn, forsaking all neutral
principles.33 Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion canbe identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a district's bizarre shape is a naked desireto increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to
save the district from an equal protection challenge. Sucha narrow test would cover only a few meritorious claims, but
it would preclude extreme abuses, such as those disclosed bythe record in

Badham v. Eu, 694 F. Supp. 664 (ND Cal. 1988),summarily aff 'd, 488 U. S. 1024 (1989),

34 and it would perhaps shorten the time period in which the pernicious effectsof such a gerrymander are felt. This test would mitigate

the current trend under which partisan considerationsare becoming the be-all and end-all in apportioning
representatives. IV

Plaintiff-appellant Furey plainly has stated a claim thatDistrict 6 constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. According to the complaint, Pennsylvania's 2002 redis-tricting plan splits "Montgomery County alone . . . into six

33 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria "that may serve to defeat a claim that
a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines." Shaw I, 509 U. S., at
647. Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to
both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion. See
Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 162, 168 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

34 The California districting scheme at issue in Badham featured a large

number of districts with highly irregular shapes, all designed, the
plaintiffs-appellants alleged, to dilute Republican voting strength throughout the State. See Juris. Statement in Badham v. Eu, O. T. 1987,

different congressional districts." 35 The new District 6
"looms like a dragon descending on Philadelphia from the
west, splitting up towns and communities throughout Montgomery and Berks Counties." 36 Furey alleges that the districting plan was created "solely to effectuate the interests"
of Republicans,37 and that the General Assembly relied "exclusively on a principle of maximum partisan advantage"
when drawing the plan,38 "to the exclusion of all other criteria." 39 The 2002 plan "is so irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort . . . to advance the
interests of one political party, without regard for traditional
redistricting principles and without any legitimate or compelling justification." 40 "The problem," Furey claims, is
that the legislature "subordinated--indeed ignored--all traditional redistricting principles and all legitimate bases for
governmental decisionmaking, in order to favor those with
one political viewpoint over another." 41 The plan "ignores
all other traditional redistricting criteria," she alleges, "thus
demonstrating that partisanship--and nothing else--was the
rationale behind the plan." 42 Because this complaint states
a claim under a judicially manageable standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering cases, I would reverse the
judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The plurality candidly acknowledges that legislatures can
fashion standards to remedy political gerrymandering that
are perfectly manageable and, indeed, that the legislatures
in Iowa and elsewhere have done so. Ante, at 277, n. 4. If

a violation of the Constitution is found, a court could imposea remedy patterned after such a statute. Thus, the problem, in the plurality's view, is not that there is no judiciallymanageable standard to fix an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but rather that the Judiciary lacks the ability todetermine when a state legislature has violated its duty to
govern impartially.Quite obviously, however, several standards for identifying
impermissible partisan influence are available to judges whohave the will to enforce them. We could hold that every
district boundary must have a neutral justification; we couldapply Justice Powell's three-factor approach in

Bandemer;we could apply the predominant motivation standard fashioned by the Court in its racial gerrymandering cases; or wecould endorse either of the approaches advocated today by
Justice Souter and Justice Breyer. What is clear isthat it is not the unavailability of judicially manageable
standards that drives today's decision. It is, instead, a fail-ure of judicial will to condemn even the most blatant violations of a state legislature's fundamental duty to governimpartially.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

The Constitution guarantees both formal and substantialequality among voters. For 40 years, we have recognized
that lines dividing a State into voting districts must pro-duce divisions with equal populations: one person, one vote.
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 568 (1964). Otherwise, avote in a less populous district than others carries more
clout.Creating unequally populous districts is not, however, the
only way to skew political results by setting district lines.The choice to draw a district line one way, not another, always carries some consequence for politics, save in a mythi-cal State with voters of every political identity distributed in
an absolutely gray uniformity. The spectrum of opportunityruns from cracking a group into impotent fractions, to packing its members into one district for the sake of marginaliz-ing them in another. However equal districts may be in
population as a formal matter, the consequence of a vote castcan be minimized or maximized,

Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S.725, 734, n. 6 (1983), and if unfairness is sufficiently demonstrable, the guarantee of equal protection condemns it as adenial of substantial equality.

Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S.109, 129-134 (1986) (plurality opinion).

The notion of fairness assumed to be denied in these caseshas been described as "each political group in a State [having] the same chance to elect representatives of its choice asany other political group," id., at 124, and as a "right to `fair

theory be responsive to the sentiments of the community").It is undeniable that political sophisticates understand such

fairness and how to go about destroying it, see App. toJuris. Statement 134a, although it cannot possibly be described with the hard edge of one person, one vote. Thedifficulty has been to translate these notions of fairness into
workable criteria, as distinct from mere opportunities for re-viewing courts to make episodic judgments that things have
gone too far, the sources of difficulty being in the facts thatsome intent to gain political advantage is inescapable whenever political bodies devise a district plan, and some effectresults from the intent.

Wells, supra, at 554-555 (White,J., dissenting) ("In reality, of course, districting is itself a

gerrymandering in the sense that it represents a complexblend of political, economic, regional, and historical considerations"). Thus, the issue is one of how much is too much,and we can be no more exact in stating a verbal test for too
much partisanship than we can be in defining too much raceconsciousness when some is inevitable and legitimate. See
Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 1057-1062 (1996) (Souter, J.,dissenting). Instead of coming up with a verbal formula for
too much, then, the Court's job must be to identify clues,as objective as we can make them, indicating that partisan
competition has reached an extremity of unfairness.The plurality says, in effect, that courts have been trying
to devise practical criteria for political gerrymandering fornearly 20 years, without being any closer to something workable than we were when Davis was decided. Ante, at 281.1While this is true enough, I do not accept it as sound counsel
of despair. For I take it that the principal reason we havenot gone from theoretical justiciability to practical administrability in political gerrymandering cases is the Davis plu-rality's specification that any criterion of forbidden gerrymandering must require a showing that members of theplaintiff 's group had "essentially been shut out of the political process," 478 U. S., at 139. See, e. g., Badham v. Eu, 694

F. Supp. 664, 670-671 (ND Cal. 1988) (three-judge court).That is, in order to avoid a threshold for relief so low that

almost any electoral defeat (let alone failure to achieve pro-portionate results) would support a gerrymandering claim,
the Davis plurality required a demonstration of such perva-sive devaluation over such a period of time as to raise real
doubt that a case could ever be made out. Davis suggestedthat plaintiffs might need to show even that their efforts to
deliberate, register, and vote had been impeded. 478 U. S.,at 133. This standard, which it is difficult to imagine a
major party meeting, combined a very demanding burdenwith significant vagueness; and if appellants have not been
able to propose a practical test for a Davis violation, thefault belongs less to them than to our predecessors. As
Judge Higginbotham recently put it, "[i]t is now painfullyclear that Justice Powell's concern that

[Davis] offered a` "constitutional green light" to would-be gerrymanderers'

has been realized." Session v. Perry, 298 F. Supp. 2d 451,474 (ED Tex. 2004)

(per curiam) (footnote omitted) (quotingDavis, supra, at 173 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). II

Since this Court has created the problem no one else hasbeen able to solve, it is up to us to make a fresh start. There
are a good many voices saying it is high time that we did, forin the years since Davis, the increasing efficiency of partisan
redistricting has damaged the democratic process to a degreethat our predecessors only began to imagine. E. g., Issacharoff, Gerrymandering and Political Cartels, 116 Harv.L. Rev. 593, 624 (2002) (The "pattern of incumbent entrenchment has gotten worse as the computer technology for moreexquisite gerrymandering has improved"); Karlan, The Fire
Next Time: Reapportionment After the 2000 Census, 50Stan. L. Rev. 731, 736 (1998) ("Finer-grained census data,

ders"); Pildes, Principled Limitations on Racial and PartisanRedistricting, 106 Yale L. J. 2505, 2553-2554 (1997) ("Recent

cases now document in microscopic detail the astonishingprecision with which redistricters can carve up individual
precincts and distribute them between districts with confi-dence concerning the racial and partisan consequences").
See also Morrill, A Geographer's Perspective, in Political
Gerrymandering and the Courts 213-214 (B. Grofman ed.1990) (noting that gerrymandering can produce "high proportions of very safe seats"); Brief for Bernard Grofman et al. as
Amici Curiae 5-8 (decline of competitive seats). Cf. Wells,
394 U. S., at 551 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("A computer may
grind out district lines which can totally frustrate the popular will on an overwhelming number of critical issues").

I would therefore preserve Davis's holding that political
gerrymandering is a justiciable issue, but otherwise start
anew. I would adopt a political gerrymandering test analogous to the summary judgment standard crafted in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), calling for
a plaintiff to satisfy elements of a prima facie cause of action,
at which point the State would have the opportunity not only
to rebut the evidence supporting the plaintiff 's case, but to
offer an affirmative justification for the districting choices,
even assuming the proof of the plaintiff 's allegations. My
own judgment is that we would have better luck at devising
a workable prima facie case if we concentrated as much as
possible on suspect characteristics of individual districts instead of statewide patterns. It is not that a statewide view
of districting is somehow less important; the usual point of
gerrymandering, after all, is to control the greatest number
of seats overall. But, as will be seen, we would be able to
call more readily on some existing law when we defined what
is suspect at the district level, and for now I would conceive
of a statewide challenge as itself a function of claims that
individual districts are illegitimately drawn. Finally, in the
same interest of threshold simplicity, I would stick to prob541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lems of single-member districts; if we could not devise aworkable scheme for dealing with claims about these, we

would have to forget the complications posed by multimem-ber districts.

III

A
For a claim based on a specific single-member district,I would require the plaintiff to make out a prima facie case

with five elements. First, the resident plaintiff would iden-tify a cohesive political group to which he belonged, which
would normally be a major party, as in this case and inDavis. There is no reason in principle, however, to rule out
a claimant from a minor political party (which might, if itshowed strength, become the target of vigorous hostility
from one or both major parties in a State) or from a differentbut politically coherent group whose members engaged in
bloc voting, as a large labor union might do. The point isthat it must make sense to speak of a candidate of the group's
choice, easy to do in the case of a large or small politicalparty, though more difficult when the organization is not defined by politics as such.2Second, a plaintiff would need to show that the district of
his residence, see United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737 (1995)(requiring residence in a challenged district for standing),

2 The plurality says it would not be easy to define such a group, because
"a person's politics is rarely as readily discernible--and never as permanently discernible--as a person's race," ante, at 287. But anytime political gerrymandering has been shown to occur, evidence must at least imply
that the defendants themselves sat down, identified the relevant groups,
and set out to concentrate the vote of one and dilute that of the others.
If a plaintiff has the evidence, a court can figure out what was going on.
In major-party cases I do not see any problem with permitting a plaintiff
to allege that he is a registered Republican, for example, and that the
state legislature set out through gerrymandering to minimize the number
of Republicans elected. If references to registration will not serve, a
plaintiff will need to show the criteria for partisan affiliation employed by
the defendants in the challenged districting process.

paid little or no heed to those traditional districting princi-ples whose disregard can be shown straightforwardly: contiguity, compactness, respect for political subdivisions, andconformity with geographic features like rivers and mountains. Because such considerations are already relevant tojustifying small deviations from absolute population equality,
Karcher, 462 U. S., at 740, and because compactness inparticular is relevant to demonstrating possible majorityminority districts under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1008 (1994), there is nodoubt that a test relying on these standards would fall within

judicial competence.Indeed, although compactness is at first blush the least
likely of these principles to yield precision, it can be meas-ured quantitatively in terms of dispersion, perimeter, and
population ratios, and the development of standards wouldthus be possible. See generally Pildes & Niemi, Expressive
Harms, "Bizarre Districts," and Voting Rights: EvaluatingElection-District Appearances After

3 Those measures, as defined by Professors Pildes and Niemi, include
dispersion, the ratio of the area of the district to the area of the smallest
circle that circumscribes the district, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 554-555; perimeter, the ratio of the area of the district to the area of the circle whose
diameter equals the length of the area's perimeter, id., at 555-556; and
population, the ratio of the district's population to the population contained by the minimum convex figure that encloses the district (or
"rubber-band" area), id., at 556-557, and n. 206. The population measure
can also be taken using the district's circumscribing circle in the denominator. Id., at 557. See also Polsby & Popper, The Third Criterion: Compactness as a Procedural Safeguard Against Partisan Gerrymandering, 9

how a district court would balance a good showing on one ofthese indices against a poor showing on another, for that sort

of detail is best worked out case by case.Third, the plaintiff would need to establish specific correlations between the district's deviations from traditional dis-tricting principles and the distribution of the population of
his group. For example, one of the districts to which appel-lants object most strongly in this case is District 6, which
they say "looms like a dragon descending on Philadelphiafrom the west, splitting up towns and communities throughout Montgomery and Berks Counties." App. to Juris. State-ment 136a. To make their claim stick, they would need to
point to specific protuberances on the Draconian shape thatreach out to include Democrats, or fissures in it that squirm
away from Republicans. They would need to show thatwhen towns and communities were split, Democrats tended
to fall on one side and Republicans on the other. Althoughsome counterexamples would no doubt be present in any
complex plan, the plaintiff 's showing as a whole would needto provide reasonable support for, if not compel, an inference
that the district took the shape it did because of the distribu-tion of the plaintiff 's group. That would begin, but not complete, the plaintiff 's case that the defendant had choseneither to pack the group (drawn a district in order to include
a uselessly high number of the group) or to crack it (drawnit so as to include fatally few), the ordinary methods of vote
dilution in single-member district systems. Ante, at 286,n. 7.

Fourth, a plaintiff would need to present the court with ahypothetical district including his residence, one in which the
proportion of the plaintiff 's group was lower (in a packingclaim) or higher (in a cracking one) and which at the same
time deviated less from traditional districting principles thanthe actual district. Cf.

50 (1986) (requiring a similar showing to demonstrate thata multimember district is "responsible for minority voters'

inability to elect [their preferred] candidates"). This hypo-thetical district would allow the plaintiff to claim credibly
that the deviations from traditional districting principleswere not only correlated with, but also caused by, the packing or cracking of his group. Drawing the hypothetical dis-trict would, of course, necessarily involve redrawing at least
one contiguous district,4 and a plaintiff would have to showthat this could be done subject to traditional districting principles without packing or cracking his group (or another)worse than in the district being challenged.

Fifth, and finally, the plaintiff would have to show that thedefendants acted intentionally to manipulate the shape of the
district in order to pack or crack his group. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976). In substantiating claimsof political gerrymandering under a plan devised by a single

major party, proving intent should not be hard, once thethird and fourth (correlation and cause) elements are established, politicians not being politically disinterested or char-acteristically naive.

Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 128("[W]e think it most likely that whenever a legislature redistricts, those responsible for the legislation will know thelikely political composition of the new districts"). I would,
however, treat any showing of intent in a major-party caseas too equivocal to count unless the entire legislature were
controlled by the governor's party (or the dominant legisla-tive party were vetoproof).

5

4 It would not necessarily involve redrawing other noncontiguous districts, and I would not permit a plaintiff to ask for such a remedy unless
he first made out a prima facie case as to multiple districts. See infra,
at 353.

5 Amici JoAnn Erfer et al. suggest that a political party strong enough

to redistrict without the other's approval is analogous to a firm that exercises monopolistic control over a market, and that the ability to exercise
such unilateral control should therefore trigger "heightened constitutional
scrutiny." Brief 18-19 (citing Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953), the
Texas Jaybird primary case). See also Issacharoff, Gerrymandering and

If the affected group were not a major party, proof of in-tent could, admittedly, be difficult. It would be possible that

a legislature might not even have had the plaintiff 's group inmind, and a plaintiff would naturally have a hard time showing requisite intent behind a plan produced by a bipartisancommission.

B
A plaintiff who got this far would have shown that hisState intentionally acted to dilute his vote, having ignored

reasonable alternatives consistent with traditional district-ing principles. I would then shift the burden to the defendants to justify their decision by reference to objectives otherthan naked partisan advantage. They might show by rebuttal evidence that districting objectives could not be servedby the plaintiff 's hypothetical district better than by the district as drawn, or they might affirmatively establish legiti-mate objectives better served by the lines drawn than by
the plaintiff 's hypothetical.The State might, for example, posit the need to avoid racial
vote dilution. Cf. Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S., at 990 (O'Connor,J., concurring) (compliance with $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 is a compelling state interest). It might plead oneperson, one vote, a standard compatible with gerrymandering but in some places perhaps unattainable without somelopsided proportions. The State might adopt the object
of proportional representation among its political partiesthrough its districting process.

Gaffney v. Cummings, 412U. S. 735, 754 (1973);
6 cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at

Political Cartels, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 593 (2002); Issacharoff & Pildes, Politics

fruitful, though I do not embrace it at this point out of caution about a
wholesale conceptual transfer from economics to politics.

6 Some commentators have criticized Gaffney itself for failing to account

for the harm of bipartisan political gerrymandering to the political process.
E. g., Issacharoff, Political Cartels, supra, at 613 ("Gaffney illustrates the
problem of the use of a discrimination model unmoored to any positive
account of the electoral process"). Gaffney is settled law, and for today's

1024 (totality of the circumstances did not support finding of
vote dilution where "minority groups constitute[d] effective
voting majorities in a number of state Senate districts substantially proportional to their share in the population").7

This is not, however, the time or place for a comprehensive
list of legitimate objectives a State might present. The
point here is simply that the Constitution should not petrify traditional districting objectives as exclusive, and it is
enough to say that the State would be required to explain
itself, to demonstrate that whatever reasons it gave were
more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.

purposes I would take as given its approval of bipartisan gerrymanders,
with their associated goal of incumbent protection. The plurality may be
correct, ante, at 297-298, that the test I propose could catch more objectionable gerrymanders if we rejected incumbent protection as an acceptable purpose of districting. But I am wary of lumping all measures aimed
at incumbent protection together at this point, and I think we would gain
a better sense of what to do if we waited upon the experience of the
district courts in assessing particular efforts at incumbency protection offered by the States in responding to prima facie cases.

7 It is worth a moment to address the plurality's charge that any judicial

remedy for political gerrymandering necessarily assumes a right to proportional representation. Ante, at 288 ("Deny it as appellants may (and
do), [their] standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least
political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation").
I agree with this Court's earlier statements that the Constitution guarantees no right to proportional representation. See Davis v. Bandemer, 478
U. S. 109, 130 (1986) (plurality opinion) (citing Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403
U. S. 124 (1971), and White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973)). It does not
follow that the Constitution permits every state action intended to achieve
any extreme form of disproportionate representation. "Proportional representation" usually refers to a set of procedural mechanisms used to guarantee, with more or less precision, that a political party's seats in the
legislature will be proportionate to its share of the vote. See generally
S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, & R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 1089-1172
(rev. 2d ed. 2002) (discussing voting systems other than the single-member
district). The Constitution requires a State to adopt neither those mechanisms nor their goal of giving a party seats proportionate to its vote.

C
As for a statewide claim, I would not attempt an ambitiousdefinition without the benefit of experience with individual

district claims, and for now I would limit consideration ofa statewide claim to one built upon a number of districtspecific ones. Each successful district-specific challengewould necessarily entail redrawing at least one contiguous
district, and the more the successful claims, the more sur-rounding districts to be redefined. At a certain point, the
ripples would reach the state boundary, and it would nolonger make any sense for a district court to consider the
problems piecemeal. D

The plurality says that my proposed standard would notsolve the essential problem of unworkability. It says that
"[i]t does not solve [the] problem [of determining when ger-rymandering has gone too far] to break down the original
unanswerable question . . . into four more discrete butequally unanswerable questions." Ante, at 296-297. It is
common sense, however, to break down a large and intracta-ble issue into discrete fragments as a way to get a handle on
the larger one, and the elements I propose are not only trac-table in theory, but the very subjects that judges already
deal with in practice. The plurality asks, for example,"[w]hat . . . a lower court [is] to do when, as will often be
the case, the district adheres to some traditional criteria butnot others?"

Ante, at 296. This question already arises incases under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the

district courts have not had the same sort of difficulty an-swering it as they have in applying the Davis v. Bandemer
plurality. See, e. g., Johnson v. Hamrick, 155 F. Supp. 2d1355, 1362-1363 (ND Ga. 2001) (noncontiguity of a plaintiff 's
Gingles districts was not fatal to a $ 2 claim against a munici-pal districting scheme because "the city's boundaries are

tions [of the proposed districts] are separated by unincorpo-rated areas and are relatively near the districts to which

they are joined"). The enquiries I am proposing are not, tobe sure, as hard edged as I wish they could be, but neither
do they have a degree of subjectivity inconsistent with thejudicial function.

The plurality also says that my standard is destined to fail
because I have not given a precise enough account of theextreme unfairness I would prevent.

Ante, at 297-298.
But this objection is more the reliable expression of the plu-rality's own discouragement than the description of an Achilles heel in my suggestion. The harm from partisan gerrymandering is (as I have said, supra, at 343, 349-350) a
species of vote dilution: the point of the gerrymander is to
capture seats by manipulating district lines to diminish the
weight of the other party's votes in elections. To devise a
judicial remedy for that harm, however, it is not necessary
to adopt a full-blown theory of fairness, furnishing a precise
measure of harm caused by divergence from the ideal in each
case. It is sufficient instead to agree that gerrymandering
is, indeed, unfair, as the plurality does not dispute; to observe
the traditional methods of the gerrymanderer, which the plurality summarizes, ante, at 274-276; and to adopt a test
aimed at detecting and preventing the use of those methods,
which, I think, mine is. If those methods are unnecessary
to effective gerrymandering, as the plurality implies, ante,
at 297-298, it is hard to explain why they have been so popular down through the ages of American politics. My test
would no doubt leave substantial room for a party in power
to seek advantage through its control of the districting process; the only way to prevent all opportunism would be to
remove districting wholly from legislative control, which I
am not prepared to say the Constitution requires. But that
does not make it impossible for courts to identify at least
the worst cases of gerrymandering, and to provide a remedy.
The most the plurality can show is that my approach would

not catch them all. Cf. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law ofRules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1178 (1989) ("To achieve what

is, from the standpoint of the substantive policies involved,the `perfect' answer is nice--but it is just one of a number of
competing values"). IV

In drafting the complaint for this case, appellants' counselnaturally proceeded on the assumption that they had to satisfy the Davis v. Bandemer plurality, or some revision inlight of Shaw, but not the prima facie case I have in mind.
Richard and Norma Jean Vieth make only statewide claims,for which the single district claim brought by Susan Furey
provides insufficient grounding. As for Furey's own claim,her allegations fall short, for example, on the feasibility of
an alternative district superior to her own, as I would re-quire. But she might well be able to allege what I would
require, if given leave to amend. I would grant her thatleave, and therefore would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings. From theCourt's judgment denying her that opportunity, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
The use of purely political considerations in drawing dis-trict boundaries is not a "necessary evil" that, for lack of

judicially manageable standards, the Constitution inevitablymust tolerate. Rather, pure politics often helps to secure
constitutionally important democratic objectives. Butsometimes it does not. Sometimes purely political "gerrymandering" will fail to advance any plausible democratic ob-jective while simultaneously threatening serious democratic
harm. And sometimes when that is so, courts can identifyan equal protection violation and provide a remedy. Because the plaintiffs could claim (but have not yet proved)that such circumstances exist here, I would reverse the District Court's dismissal of their complaint.

The plurality focuses directly on the most difficult issuebefore us. It says, "[n]o test--yea, not even a five-part

test--can possibly be successful unless one knows what he istesting for." Ante, at 297 (emphasis in original). That is
true. Thus, I shall describe a set of circumstances in whichthe use of purely political districting criteria could conflict
with constitutionally mandated democratic requirements--circumstances that the courts should "test for." I shall then
explain why I believe it possible to find applicable judi-cially manageable standards. And I shall illustrate those
standards. I

I start with a fundamental principle. "We the People,"who "ordain[ed] and establish[ed]" the American Constitution, sought to create and to protect a workable form of gov-ernment that is in its " `principles, structure, and whole
mass,' " basically democratic. G. Wood, The Creation of theAmerican Republic, 1776-1787, p. 595 (1969) (quoting W.
Murray, Political Sketches, Inscribed to His Excellency JohnAdams 5 (1787)). See also,

e. g., A. Meiklejohn, Free Speechand Its Relation to Self-Government 14-15 (1948). In a

modern Nation of close to 300 million people, the workabledemocracy that the Constitution foresees must mean more
than a guaranteed opportunity to elect legislators represent-ing equally populous electoral districts.

Reynolds v. Sims,377 U. S. 533, 568 (1964); Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S.

526, 530-531 (1969); Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 730(1983). There must also be a method for transforming the
will of the majority into effective government.This Court has explained that political parties play a necessary role in that transformation. At a minimum, theyhelp voters assign responsibility for current circumstances,
thereby enabling those voters, through their votes for indi-vidual candidates, to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction
with the political status quo. Those voters can either voteto support that status quo or vote to "throw the rascals out."

See generally McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540U. S. 93, 188 (2003);

California Democratic Party v. Jones,
530 U. S. 567, 574 (2000); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604,
615-616 (1996). A party-based political system that satisfiesthis minimal condition encourages democratic responsibility.

It facilitates the transformation of the voters' will into a government that reflects that will.Why do I refer to these elementary constitutional principles? Because I believe they can help courts identify atleast one abuse at issue in this case. To understand how
that is so, one should begin by asking why single-member
electoral districts are the norm, why the Constitution does
not insist that the membership of legislatures better reflect
different political views held by different groups of voters.
History, of course, is part of the answer, but it does not tell
the entire story. The answer also lies in the fact that a
single-member-district system helps to ensure certain democratic objectives better than many "more representative"
(i. e., proportional) electoral systems. Of course, singlemember districts mean that only parties with candidates who
finish "first past the post" will elect legislators. That fact
means in turn that a party with a bare majority of votes or
even a plurality of votes will often obtain a large legislative
majority, perhaps freezing out smaller parties. But singlemember districts thereby diminish the need for coalition
governments. And that fact makes it easier for voters to
identify which party is responsible for government decisionmaking (and which rascals to throw out), while simultaneously providing greater legislative stability. Cf. C. Mershon, The Costs of Coalition: Coalition Theories and Italian
Governments, 90 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 534 (1996) (noting that
from 1946 to 1992, under proportional systems "almost no
[Italian] government stayed in office more than a few years,
and many governments collapsed after only a few months");

in Choosing an Electoral System: Issues and Alternatives15, 24 (A. Lijphart & B. Grofman eds. 1984) (describing the

"political paralysis which had become the hallmark of theFourth Republic" under proportional representation). See
also Duverger, Which is the Best Electoral System? inChoosing an Electoral System,

supra, at 31, 32 (arguing
that proportional systems "preven[t] the citizens from expressing a clear choice for a governmental team," and thatnonproportional systems allow voters to "choose governments with the capacity to make decisions"). This is notto say that single-member districts are preferable; it is simply to say that single-member-district systems and moredirectly-representational systems reflect different conclusions about the proper balance of different elements of a
workable democratic government.

If single-member districts are the norm, however, then
political considerations will likely play an important, and
proper, role in the drawing of district boundaries. In part,
that is because politicians, unlike nonpartisan observers, normally understand how "the location and shape of districts"
determine "the political complexion of the area." Gaffney v.
Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 753 (1973). It is precisely because
politicians are best able to predict the effects of boundary
changes that the districts they design usually make some
political sense. See, e. g., Persily, In Defense of Foxes
Guarding Henhouses: The Case for Judicial Acquiescence to
Incumbent-Protecting Gerrymanders, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 649,
678, and nn. 94-95 (2002) (recounting the author's experience
as a neutral court-appointed boundary drawer, in which the
plan he helped draw moved an uninhabited swamp from
one district to another, thereby inadvertently disrupting environmental projects that were important to the politician
representing the swamp's former district).

More important for present purposes, the role of political considerations reflects a surprising mathematical fact.
Given a fairly large state population with a fairly large con541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gressional delegation, districts assigned so as to be perfectly
random in respect to politics would translate a small shift in
political sentiment, say a shift from 51% Republican to 49%
Republican, into a seismic shift in the makeup of the legislative delegation, say from 100% Republican to 100% Democrat. See M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory
District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 1002 (1998) (suggesting that, where the state
population is large enough, even randomly selected compact
districts will generally elect no politicians from the party
that wins fewer votes statewide). Any such exaggeration
of tiny electoral changes--virtually wiping out legislative
representation of the minority party--would itself seem
highly undemocratic.

Given the resulting need for single-member districts with
nonrandom boundaries, it is not surprising that "traditional"
districting principles have rarely, if ever, been politically
neutral. Rather, because, in recent political memory, Democrats have often been concentrated in cities while Republicans have often been concentrated in suburbs and sometimes rural areas, geographically drawn boundaries have
tended to "pac[k]" the former. See ante, at 290 (plurality
opinion) (citing Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 159 (1986)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)); Lowenstein &

(explaining that the " `formal' criteria . . . do not live up to
their advance billing as `fair' or `neutral' "). Neighborhood
or community-based boundaries, seeking to group Irish, Jewish, or African-American voters, often did the same. All
this is well known to politicians, who use their knowledge
about the effects of the "neutral" criteria to partisan advantage when drawing electoral maps. And were it not so, the
iron laws of mathematics would have worked their extraordinary volatility-enhancing will.

Breyer, J., dissenting
This is to say that traditional or historically based bound-aries are not, and should not be, "politics free." Rather,

those boundaries represent a series of compromises of princi-ple--among the virtues of, for example, close representation
of voter views, ease of identifying "government" and "op-position" parties, and stability in government. They also
represent an uneasy truce, sanctioned by tradition, amongdifferent parties seeking political advantage.

As I have said, reference back to these underlying consid-erations helps to explain why the legislature's use of political
boundary-drawing considerations ordinarily does not violatethe Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The reason lies
not simply in the difficulty of identifying abuse or finding anappropriate judicial remedy. The reason is more fundamental: Ordinarily, there simply is no abuse. The use of purelypolitical boundary-drawing factors, even where harmful to
the members of one party, will often nonetheless find justifi-cation in other desirable democratic ends, such as maintaining relatively stable legislatures in which a minority partyretains significant representation.

II
At the same time, these considerations can help identifyat least one circumstance where use of purely political

boundary-drawing factors can amount to a serious, and re-mediable, abuse, namely, the unjustified use of political factors to entrench a minority in power. By entrenchment Imean a situation in which a party that enjoys only minority
support among the populace has nonetheless contrived totake, and hold, legislative power. By unjustified entrenchment I mean that the minority's hold on power is purely theresult of partisan manipulation and not other factors. These
"other" factors that could lead to "justified" (albeit tempo-rary) minority entrenchment include sheer happenstance,
the existence of more than two major parties, the uniqueconstitutional requirements of certain representational bod541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ies such as the Senate, or reliance on traditional (geographic,communities of interest, etc.) districting criteria.

The democratic harm of unjustified entrenchment is obvi-ous. As this Court has written in respect to popularly
based electoral districts:

"Logically, in a society ostensibly grounded on representative government, it would seem reasonable that amajority of the people of a State could elect a majority

of that State's legislators. To conclude differently, andto sanction minority control of state legislative bodies,
would appear to deny majority rights in a way that farsurpasses any possible denial of minority rights that
might otherwise be thought to result. Since legislatures are responsible for enacting laws by which all citi-zens are to be governed, they should be bodies which

are collectively responsive to the popular will." Reynolds, 377 U. S., at 565.

Where unjustified entrenchment takes place, voters find it
far more difficult to remove those responsible for a govern-ment they do not want; and these democratic values are

dishonored.

The need for legislative stability cannot justify entrench-ment, for stability is compatible with a system in which the

loss of majority support implies a loss of power. The needto secure minority representation in the legislature cannot
justify entrenchment, for minority party representation isalso compatible with a system in which the loss of minority
support implies a loss of representation. Constitutionallyspecified principles of representation, such as that of two
Senators per State, cannot justify entrenchment where the
House of Representatives or similar state legislative body
is at issue. Unless some other justification can be found in
particular circumstances, political gerrymandering that so
entrenches a minority party in power violates basic democratic norms and lacks countervailing justification. For this

Breyer, J., dissenting
reason, whether political gerrymandering does, or does not,violate the Constitution in other instances, gerrymandering

that leads to entrenchment amounts to an abuse that violatesthe Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.

III
Courts need not intervene often to prevent the kind ofabuse I have described, because those harmed constitute a

political majority, and a majority normally can work its po-litical will. Where a State has improperly gerrymandered
legislative or congressional districts to the majority's disad-vantage, the majority should be able to elect officials in
statewide races--particularly the Governor--who may helpto undo the harm that districting has caused the majority's
party, in the next round of districting if not sooner. Andwhere a State has improperly gerrymandered congressional
districts, Congress retains the power to revise the State'sdistricting determinations. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 4;
ante, at 275-277 (plurality opinion) (discussing the history ofCongress' "power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States").Moreover, voters in some States, perhaps tiring of the political boundary-drawing rivalry, have found a procedural so-lution, confiding the task to a commission that is limited in
the extent to which it may base districts on partisan con-cerns. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 12 States currently give "first and final authorityfor [state] legislative redistricting to a group other than the
legislature." National Conference of State Legislatures,Redistricting Commissions and Alternatives to the Legislature Conducting Redistricting (2004), available at http://www.ncsl.org/programs/ legman/Redistrict/Com&alter.htm

political data. Ibid.; Iowa General Assembly, LegislativeService Bureau, Legislative Guide to Redistricting (Dec.
2000), available at http://www.legis.state.ia.us/Central/LSB/Guides/redist.htm. Indeed, where state governments have
been unwilling or unable to act, "an informed, civically militant electorate," Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 270 (1962)(Frankfurter, J., dissenting), has occasionally taken matters

into its own hands, through ballot initiatives or referendums.Arizona voters, for example, passed Proposition 106, which
amended the State's Constitution and created an independent redistricting commission to draw legislative and congressional districts. Ariz. Const., Art. 4, pt. 2, $ 1 (West 2001).
Such reforms borrow from the systems used by other countries utilizing single-member districts. See, e. g., Administration and Cost of Elections Project, Boundary Delimitation
(hereinafter ACE Project), Representation in the Canadian
Parliament, available at http://www.aceproject.org/main/
english/ bd/ bdy_ca.htm (describing Canada's independent
boundary commissions, which draft maps based on equality
of population, communities of interest, and geographic factors); ACE Project, The United Kingdom Redistribution
Process, available at http://www.aceproject.org/main/english/

Parliament after consultation with the public); G. Gudgin &
P. Taylor, Seats, Votes, and the Spatial Organisation of Elections 8 (1979) (noting that the United Kingdom's boundary commissions are "explicitly neutral in a party political
sense").

But we cannot always count on a severely gerrymandered
legislature itself to find and implement a remedy. See Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 126. The party that controls the process
has no incentive to change it. And the political advantages
of a gerrymander may become ever greater in the future.

Breyer, J., dissenting
The availability of enhanced computer technology allows theparties to redraw boundaries in ways that target individual

neighborhoods and homes, carving out safe but slim victorymargins in the maximum number of districts, with little risk
of cutting their margins too thin. See generally Handley, AGuide to 2000 Redistricting Tools and Technology, in The
Real Y2K Problem: Census 2000 Data and Redistricting
Technology (N. Persily ed. 2000); Karlan, The Fire NextTime: Reapportionment After the 2000 Census, 50 Stan.

L. Rev. 731, 736 (1998); ante, at 345-346 (Souter, J., dissent-ing). By redrawing districts every 2 years, rather than
every 10 years, a party might preserve its political advantages notwithstanding population shifts in the State. The
combination of increasingly precise map-drawing technology
and increasingly frequent map drawing means that a party
may be able to bring about a gerrymander that is not only
precise, but virtually impossible to dislodge. Thus, court action may prove necessary.

When it is necessary, a court should prove capable of finding an appropriate remedy. Courts have developed districting remedies in other cases. See, e. g., Branch v. Smith, 538
U. S. 254 (2003) (affirming the District Court's injunction of
use of state court's redistricting plan and order that its own
plan be used until a state plan could be precleared under the
Voting Rights Act of 1965); Karcher, 462 U. S. 725 (upholding
the District Court's holding that a congressional reapportionment plan was unconstitutional); Reynolds, 377 U. S., at
586-587 (upholding the District Court's actions in ordering
into effect a reapportionment of both houses of the state legislature). See also Issacharoff, Judging Politics: The Elusive Quest for Judicial Review of Political Fairness, 71 Texas
L. Rev. 1643, 1688-1690, and nn. 227-233 (1993) (reporting

plans rejected and sent back to the state legislatures, 6court-ordered state house plans, and 9 state house plans sent

back for further legislative action--all of which meant that,leaving aside the preclearance provisions of $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, about one-third of all redistricting wasdone either directly by the federal courts or under courts'
injunctive authority (citing cases)). Moreover, if the dan-gers of inadvertent political favoritism prove too great, a
procedural solution, such as the use of a politically balancedboundary-drawing commission, may prove possible.

The bottom line is that courts should be able to identifythe presence of one important gerrymandering evil, the unjustified entrenching in power of a political party that thevoters have rejected. They should be able to separate the
unjustified abuse of partisan boundary-drawing considera-tions to achieve that end from their more ordinary and justified use. And they should be able to design a remedy forextreme cases.

IV
I do not claim that the problem of identification and sep-aration is easily solved, even in extreme instances. But

courts can identify a number of strong indicia of abuse. Thepresence of actual entrenchment, while not always unjustified (being perhaps a chance occurrence), is such a sign,particularly when accompanied by the use of partisan
boundary-drawing criteria in the way that Justice Stevensdescribes,

i. e., a use that both departs from traditional crite-ria and cannot be explained other than by efforts to achieve

partisan advantage. Below, I set forth several sets of cir-cumstances that lay out the indicia of abuse I have in mind.
The scenarios fall along a continuum: The more permanentlyentrenched the minority's hold on power becomes, the less
evidence courts will need that the minority engaged in ger-rymandering to achieve the desired result.

Consider, for example, the following sets of circumstances.First, suppose that the legislature has proceeded to redraw

541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
366 VIETH v. JUBELIRER

Breyer, J., dissenting
boundaries in what seem to be ordinary ways, but the en-trenchment harm has become obvious.

E. g., (a) the legislature has not redrawn district boundaries more than oncewithin the traditional 10-year period; and (b) no radical departure from traditional districting criteria is alleged; but(c) a majority party (as measured by the votes actually cast
for all candidates who identify themselves as members of
that party in the relevant set of elections; i. e., in congres-sional elections if a congressional map is being challenged)

has twice failed to obtain a majority of the relevant legisla-tive seats in elections; and (d) the failure cannot be explained
by the existence of multiple parties or in other neutral ways.
In my view, these circumstances would be sufficient to support a claim of unconstitutional entrenchment.

Second, suppose that plaintiffs could point to more serious
departures from redistricting norms. E. g., (a) the legislature has not redrawn district boundaries more than once
within the traditional 10-year period; but (b) the boundarydrawing criteria depart radically from previous or traditional criteria; (c) the departure cannot be justified or explained other than by reference to an effort to obtain
partisan political advantage; and (d) a majority party (as defined above) has once failed to obtain a majority of the relevant seats in election using the challenged map (which fact
cannot be explained by the existence of multiple parties or
in other neutral ways). These circumstances could also add
up to unconstitutional gerrymandering.

Third, suppose that the legislature clearly departs from
ordinary districting norms, but the entrenchment harm,
while seriously threatened, has not yet occurred. E. g.,
(a) the legislature has redrawn district boundaries more than
once within the traditional 10-year census-related period--
either, as here, at the behest of a court that struck down an
initial plan as unlawful, see Vieth v. Pennsylvania, 195
F. Supp. 2d 672 (MD Pa. 2002) (per curiam) (finding that
Pennsylvania's first redistricting plan violated the one541US1 Unit: $U40 [05-21-06 18:03:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

person, one-vote mandate), or of its own accord; (b) theboundary-drawing criteria depart radically from previous

traditional boundary-drawing criteria; (c) strong, objective,unrefuted statistical evidence demonstrates that a party
with a minority of the popular vote within the State in alllikelihood will obtain a majority of the seats in the relevant
representative delegation; and (d) the jettisoning of tradi-tional districting criteria cannot be justified or explained
other than by reference to an effort to obtain partisan politi-cal advantage. To my mind, such circumstances could also
support a claim, because the presence of midcycle redistrict-ing, for any reason, raises a fair inference that partisan machinations played a major role in the map-drawing process.Where such an inference is accompanied by statistical evidence that entrenchment will be the likely result, a courtmay conclude that the map crosses the constitutional line we
are describing.The presence of these, or similar, circumstances--where
the risk of entrenchment is demonstrated, where partisanconsiderations render the traditional district-drawing compromises irrelevant, where no justification other than partyadvantage can be found--seem to me extreme enough to set
off a constitutional alarm. The risk of harm to basic demo-cratic principle is serious; identification is possible; and remedies can be found. V

The plurality sets forth several criticisms of my approach.Some of those criticisms are overstated. Compare ante, at
300 ("[O]f course there always is a neutral explanation [ofgerrymandering]--if only the time-honored criterion of incumbent protection"), with Brief for Appellants 13 (pointingto examples of efforts to gerrymander an incumbent of the
opposition party out of office and elect a new member of thecontrolling party); compare ante, at 300 (complaining of "the
difficulties of assessing partisan strength statewide"), with
supra, at 366 (identifying the "majority party" simply by

Breyer, J., dissenting
adding up "the votes actually cast for all candidates whoidentify themselves as members of that party in the relevant

set of elections").Other criticisms involve differing judgments. Compare
ante, at 299 (complaining about the vagueness of unjustifiedpolitical machination, "whatever that means," and of unjustified entrenchment), with supra, at 360-361 (detailed discus-sion of "justified" and

Reynolds v. Sims); compare ante, at301 (finding costs of judicial intervention too high), with

supra, at 364-365 (finding costs warranted to ensure major-ity rule).

But the plurality makes one criticism that warrants a moreelaborate response. It observes "that the mere fact that
these four dissenters come up with three different stand-ards--all of them different from the two proposed in Bandemer and the one proposed here by appellants--goes a longway to establishing that there is no constitutionally discernible standard." Ante, at 292.Does it? The dissenting opinions recommend sets of
standards that differ in certain respects. Members of a ma-jority might well seek to reconcile such differences. But
dissenters might instead believe that the more thorough,specific reasoning that accompanies separate statements will
stimulate further discussion. And that discussion could leadto change in the law, where, as here, one member of the majority, disagreeing with the plurality as to justiciability, re-mains in search of appropriate standards. See

ante, at 311-312 (
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).

VI
In the case before us, there is a strong likelihood that theplaintiffs' complaint could be amended readily to assert circumstances consistent with those I have set forth as appro-priate for judicial intervention. For that reason, I would
authorize the plaintiffs to proceed; and I dissent from themajority's contrary determination.

JONES et al., on behalf of herself and a class of

others similarly situated v. R. R. DONNELLEY& SONS CO.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 02-1205. Argued February 24, 2004--Decided May 3, 2004
After this Court held that federal courts should apply the most appropriate state statute of limitations to claims arising under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1981, which contains no statute of limitations, see Goodman v. Lukens
Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 660, Congress enacted a 4-year statute of limitations for causes of action "arising under an Act of Congress enacted
after [December 1, 1990]," 28 U. S. C. $ 1658. Petitioners, AfricanAmerican former employees of respondent, filed a class action alleging
violations of $ 1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Respondent sought summary judgment, claiming that the applicable state
2-year statute of limitations barred their claims, but the District Court
held that petitioners' wrongful discharge, refusal to transfer, and hostile
work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are
governed by $ 1658. The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that

$ 1658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute.

Held: Petitioners' causes of action are governed by $ 1658. Pp. 375-385.

(a) Because the meaning of "arising under" in $ 1658 is ambiguous,
Congress' intent must be ascertained by looking beyond the section's
bare text to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was
designed to accomplish. Pp. 375-377.

(b) Before $ 1658's enactment, Congress' failure to pass a uniform limitations statute for federal causes of action had created a void that
spawned a vast amount of litigation. The settled practice of borrowing
state statutes of limitations generated a host of issues, such as which of
the forum State's statutes was the most appropriate, whether the forum
State's law or that of the situs of the injury controlled, and when a
statute of limitations could be tolled. Congress was keenly aware of
these problems, and a central purpose of $ 1658 was to minimize the
need for borrowing. That purpose would not be served if $ 1658 were
interpreted to reach only entirely new sections of the United States
Code. An amendment to an existing statute is no less an "Act of Congress" than a new, stand-alone statute. What matters is the new rights
of action and corresponding liabilities created by the enactment. Thus,

a cause of action "aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted" after December 1, 1990--and therefore is governed by $ 1658's 4-year statute of
limitations--if the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment. This construction best serves Congress' interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of
borrowing state statutes of limitations, while protecting litigants' settled expectations by applying only to causes of actions not available
until after December 1, 1990. It also is consistent with the common
usage of "arise" and with this Court's interpretations of "arising under"
as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter
jurisdiction. Pp. 377-383.

(c) Petitioners' hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and
failure to transfer claims all "ar[ose] under" the 1991 Act in the sense
that they were made possible by that Act. The 1991 Act overturned
this Court's decision in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.
164, 171, which held that racial harassment relating to employment conditions was not actionable under $ 1981. The Act redefined $ 1981's key
"make and enforce contracts" language to include the "termination of
contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship," $ 1981(b). In Rivers v. Roadway
Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, this Court held that the amendment enlarged the category of conduct subject to $ 1981 liability, id., at 303, and
thus did not apply to a case that arose before it was enacted, id., at 300.
Rivers' reasoning supports the conclusion that the 1991 Act qualifies as
an "Act of Congress enacted after [December 1, 1990]." Petitioners'
causes of action clearly arose under the 1991 Act, and the hypothetical
problems posited by respondent and the Seventh Circuit pale in comparison with the difficulties that federal courts faced for decades in trying to answer questions raised by borrowing state limitations rules.

Goodman v. LukensSteel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 660 (1987), that federal courts should

apply "the most appropriate or analogous state statute oflimitations" to claims based on asserted violations of $ 1981.
Three years after our decision in Goodman, Congress en-acted a catchall 4-year statute of limitations for actions
arising under federal statutes enacted after December 1,1990. 28 U. S. C. $ 1658. The question in this case is
whether petitioners' causes of action, which allege violationsof $ 1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991
Act), 105 Stat. 1071, are governed by $ 1658 or by the per-sonal injury statute of limitations of the forum State.

372 JONES v. R. R. DONNELLEY & SONS CO.

Opinion of the Court
25, 1996, petitioners filed this class action alleging violationsof their rights under $ 1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.

Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that theywere subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given
an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated ordenied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant. Respondent sought summary judgment on the
ground that petitioners' claims are barred by the applicableIllinois statute of limitations because they arose more than

two years before the complaint was filed. Petitioners re-sponded that their claims are governed by $ 1658, which provides: "Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil actionarising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of
the enactment of this section may not be commenced laterthan 4 years after the cause of action accrues."

1 Section

1658 was enacted on December 1, 1990. Thus, petitioners'claims are subject to the 4-year statute of limitations if they

arose under an Act of Congress enacted after that date.The original version of the statute now codified at Rev.
Stat. $ 1977, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981, was enacted as $ 1 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27. It was amended in minorrespects in 1870 and recodified in 1874, see

Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 168-169, n. 8 (1976), but its basic cover-age did not change prior to 1991. As first enacted, $ 1981

provided in relevant part that "all persons [within the juris-diction of the United States] shall have the same right, in
every State and Territory . . . to make and enforce contracts
. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens." 14 Stat. 27. We held
in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989),

1 In 2002, Congress amended $ 1658 to add a separate provision (subsection (b)) specifying the statute of limitations for certain securities law
claims. Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Pub.
L. 107-204, $ 804(a), 116 Stat. 801. The original language of $ 1658 (quoted
above) was left unchanged but is now set forth in subsection (a). See 28
U. S. C. $ 1658(a) (2000 ed., Supp. III).

Opinion of the Court
that the statutory right "to make and enforce contracts" did
not protect against harassing conduct that occurred after the
formation of the contract. Under that holding, it is clear
that petitioners' hostile work environment, wrongful discharge, and refusal to transfer claims do not state violations
of the original version of $ 1981. In 1991, however, Congress responded to Patterson by adding a new subsection to

$ 1981 that defines the term " `make and enforce contracts' "
to include the "termination of contracts, and the enjoyment
of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981(b).2 It is undisputed that petitioners have alleged violations of the amended
statute. The critical question, then, is whether petitioners'
causes of action "ar[ose] under" the 1991 Act or under $ 1981
as originally enacted.

The District Court determined that petitioners' wrongful
termination, refusal to transfer, and hostile work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are governed by $ 1658. Adams v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons, 149

2 The current version of $ 1981 reads as follows:
"(a) Statement of equal rights

"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.

"(b) `Make and enforce contracts' defined

"For purposes of this section, the term `make and enforce contracts'
includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions
of the contractual relationship.

"(c) Protection against impairment

"The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment
by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State
law."

374 JONES v. R. R. DONNELLEY & SONS CO.

Opinion of the Court
F. Supp. 2d 459 (ND Ill. 2001).3 In its view, the plain textof $ 1658 compels the conclusion that, "whenever Congress,

after December 1990, passes legislation that creates a newcause of action, the catch-all statute of limitations applies to
that cause of action." Id., at 464. The 1991 amendment to$ 1981 falls within that category, the court reasoned, because
it opened the door to claims of postcontract discriminationthat, under

Patterson, could not have been brought under$ 1981 as enacted. 149 F. Supp. 2d, at 464.

The District Court certified its ruling for an interlocutoryappeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b), and the Court of Appeals reversed. 305 F. 3d 717 (CA7 2002). It concludedthat $ 1658 "applies only when an act of Congress creates a
wholly new cause of action, one that does not depend on thecontinued existence of a statutory cause of action previously
enacted and kept in force by the amendment." Id., at 726.The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court
explained, because the text of $ 1981(b) "simply cannot standon its own"; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that "provides the basic
right of recovery for an individual whose constitutionalrights have been violated."

Id., at 727.
The Court of Appeals' conclusion that $ 1658 does notapply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment

to a pre-existing statute is consistent with decisions from theThird and Eighth Circuits. See

Zubi v. AT&T Corp., 219
F. 3d 220, 224 (CA3 2000); Madison v. IBP, Inc., 257 F. 3d780, 798 (CA8 2001). Conversely, the Courts of Appeals for

the Sixth and Tenth Circuits have held that $ 1658 applies"whenever Congress, after December 1990, passes legislation

3 The court found matters somewhat less clear with respect to petitioners' claims regarding their employee status (which involved allegations
that respondent has a practice of using its African-American employees as
" `temporary' " or " `casual' " employees), and directed the parties to "sort
out this question amongst themselves in light of" its ruling. 149 F. Supp.

3d 506, 514 (CA6 2003). We granted certiorari to resolvethe conflict in the Circuits, 538 U. S. 1030 (2003), and now
reverse. II

Petitioners, supported by the United States as amicus curiae, argue that reversal is required by the "plain language"of $ 1658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for

"civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enactedafter" December 1, 1990. They point out that the 1991 Act
is, by its own terms, an "Act" of Congress that was "enacted"after December 1, 1990. See Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071.
Moreover, citing our interpretations of the term "arisingunder" in other federal statutes and in Article III of the
Constitution, petitioners maintain that their causes of actionarose under the 1991 Act.

Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an"Act of Congress enacted" after 1991, but argues that the
meaning of the term "arising under" is not so clear. Weagree. Although our expositions of the "arising under" concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the termas it is used in $ 1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer. For example, Chief Justice Marshall's state-ment that a case arises under federal law for purposes of
Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law "forms an in-gredient of the original cause,"

Osborn v. Bank of UnitedStates, 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners' view

that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendmentto $ 1981, because the 1991 Act clearly "forms an ingredient"
of petitioners' claims.4 But the same could be said of the

amendment, whether or not the plaintiff could have stated a claim

Opinion of the Court
original version of $ 1981. Thus, reliance on Osborn wouldsuggest that petitioners' causes of action arose under the

pre-1991 version of $ 1981 as well as under the 1991 Act, justas a cause of action may arise under both state and federal
law. As the Court of Appeals observed, however, $ 1658does not expressly "address the eventuality when a cause of
action `aris[es] under' two different `Acts,' one enacted beforeand one enacted after the effective date of $ 1658." 305
F. 3d, at 724.Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III,
but at how Congress has used the term "arising under" infederal legislation. They point in particular to the statutes
in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matterjurisdiction.

5 We have interpreted those statutes to mean

that a claim arises under federal law if federal law providesa necessary element of the plaintiff 's claim for relief.

6 Petitioners recognize that we have construed the term morebroadly in other statutes,

7 but argue that the placement of

$ 1658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke ourinterpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules. We

hesitate to place too much significance on the location of astatute in the United States Code. But even if we accepted

5 See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 ("The district courts shall have original
jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States"); $ 1338(a) ("The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and trademarks").

6 See, e. g., Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U. S.

800, 808 (1988) (a case may " `aris[e] under' " federal law if " `federal law is
a necessary element of [a claim]' "); Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air
Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 830 (2002) (a claim " `arises
under' " patent law if either " `federal patent law creates the cause of action' " or " `the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution
of a substantial question of federal patent law' ").

under the Medicare Act for purposes of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(h) when " `both
the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation' " of the claim
is the Medicare Act).

Opinion of the Court
the proposition that Congress intended the term "arisingunder" to have the same meaning in $ 1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambig-uous. We have said that "[t]he most familiar definition of
the statutory `arising under' limitation" is the statement byJustice Holmes that a suit " `arises under the law that creates
the cause of action,' " Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1,8-9 (1983) (quoting American Well Works Co. v. Layne &

Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916)). On one hand, thatstatement could support petitioners' view that their causes
of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutoryright that did not previously exist. On the other hand, it
also could support respondent's claim that petitioners' causesof action arose under the original version of $ 1981, which
contains the operative language setting forth the elementsof their claims. Justice Holmes' formulation even could support the view that petitioners' claims arose under both ver-sions of the statute. Cf.

T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d823, 827 (CA2 1964) (Friendly, J.) ("It has come to be realized

that Mr. Justice Holmes' formula is more useful for inclusionthan for the exclusion for which it was intended"). In order
to ascertain Congress' intent, therefore, we must look be-yond the bare text of $ 1658 to the context in which it was
enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.

III
In Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio,446 U. S. 478, 483 (1980), we observed that Congress' failure

to enact a uniform statute of limitations applicable to federalcauses of action created a "void which is commonplace in federal statutory law." Over the years that void has spawneda vast amount of litigation. Prior to the enactment of

$ 1658, the "settled practice [was] to adopt a local time limita-tion as federal law if it [was] not inconsistent with federal

law or policy to do so." Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261,

Opinion of the Court
266-267 (1985). Such "[l]imitation borrowing," Board of
Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U. S., at 484, generated a host of
issues that required resolution on a statute-by-statute basis.
For example, it often was difficult to determine which of the
forum State's statutes of limitations was the most appropriate to apply to the federal claim. We wrestled with that
issue in Wilson v. Garcia, in which we considered which
state statute provided the most appropriate limitations principle for claims arising under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. 471 U. S.,
at 268, 276-279 (resolving split of authority over whether the
closest state analogue to an action brought under $ 1983 was
an action for tortious injury to the rights of another, an action on an unwritten contract, or an action for a liability on
a statute). Before reaching that question, however, we first
had to determine whether the characterization of a $ 1983
claim for statute of limitations purposes was an issue of state
or federal law and whether all such claims should be characterized in the same way. Ibid. Two years later, in Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., we answered the same three questions for claims arising under $ 1981. 482 U. S., at 660,
661-662. Both decisions provoked dissent 8 and further

litigation.9

The practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations also
forced courts to address the "frequently present problem of
a conflict of laws in determining which State statute [was]
controlling, the law of the forum or that of the situs of the
injury." S. Rep. No. 619, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 4-6 (1955)

find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while aplaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would
be permitted to proceed. Ibid. Interstate variances of
that sort could be especially confounding in class actions be-cause they often posed problems for joint resolution. See

Memorandum from R. Marcus, Assoc. Reporter to WorkloadSubcommittee (Sept. 1, 1989), reprinted in App. to Vol. 1
Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Sub-committee Reports (1990), Doc. No. 5, p. 10 (hereinafter Marcus Memorandum). Courts also were forced to grapple withquestions such as whether federal or state law governed
when an action was "commenced," or when service of processhad to be effectuated. See

Sentry Corp. v. Harris, 802 F. 2d
229 (CA7 1986) (addressing those issues in the wake of our
decision in Wilson). And the absence of a uniform federal
limitations period complicated the development of federal
law on the question when, or under what circumstances, a
statute of limitations could be tolled. See 802 F. 2d, at 234-
242 (discussing conflicting authority on whether tolling was
a matter of state or federal law); Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U. S., at 485 (explaining that " `borrowing' logically included [state] rules of tolling").

Corp. v. Harris, 802 F. 2d, at 246.11 Congress answered thatcall by creating the Federal Courts Study Committee, which
recommended the enactment of a retroactive, uniform fed-eral statute of limitations.

12 As we have noted, $ 1658 applies only to claims arising under statutes enacted after De-cember 1, 1990, but it otherwise follows the Committee's

recommendation. The House Report accompanying thefinal bill confirms that Congress was keenly aware of the
problems associated with the practice of borrowing statestatutes of limitations, and that a central purpose of $ 1658
was to minimize the occasions for that practice.13The history that led to the enactment of $ 1658 strongly
supports an interpretation that fills more rather than less ofthe void that has created so much unnecessary work for federal judges.14 The interpretation favored by respondent

12 A report prepared for the Committee concluded that "there is little to

be said in favor of the current situation and there seems to be no identifiable support for continuing this situation." Marcus Memorandum 1.

13 The House Report notes "a number of practical problems" created by

the practice of borrowing statutes of limitations: " `It obligates judges and
lawyers to determine the most analogous state law claim; it imposes uncertainty on litigants; reliance on varying state laws results in undesirable
variance among the federal courts and disrupts the development of federal doctrine on the suspension of limitation periods.' " H. R. Rep.
No. 101-734, p. 24 (1990).

14 A few years after $ 1658 was enacted, we described it as supplying

"a general, 4-year limitations period for any federal statute subsequently
enacted without one of its own." North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515
U. S. 29, 34, n. (1995). In his separate opinion in that case, Justice
Scalia captured the basic purpose of $ 1658 when he observed that

Opinion of the Court
and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting$ 1658 to cases in which the plaintiff 's cause of action is based

solely on a post-1990 statute that " `establishes a new causeof action without reference to preexisting law.' " 305 F. 3d,
at 727 (quoting Zubi v. AT&T Corp., 219 F. 3d, at 225). Onthat view, $ 1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post1990 enactments. Congress routinely creates new rights ofaction by amending existing statutes, and "[a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms pre-viously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes."
Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 308 (1994).Nothing in the text or history of $ 1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections ofthe United States Code. An amendment to an existing statute is no less an "Act of Congress" than a new, stand-alonestatute. What matters is the substantive effect of an enactment--the creation of new rights of action and correspond-ing liabilities--not the format in which it appears in the
Code.The Court of Appeals reasoned that $ 1658 must be given
a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants' settled expectations.The court observed that Congress refused to make $ 1658
retroactive because, " `with respect to many statutes thathave no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial deci-sion,' " and " `retroactively imposing a four year statute of
limitations on legislation that the courts have previouslyruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one
[State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten todisrupt the settled expectations of . . . many parties.' " 305
F. 3d, at 725-726 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, p. 24(1990)). Concerns about settled expectations provide a
valid reason to reject an interpretation of $ 1658 under which
"a uniform nationwide limitations period for a federal cause of action is
always significantly more appropriate" than a rule that applies in some
States but not in others. Id., at 37 (opinion concurring in judgment).

382 JONES v. R. R. DONNELLEY & SONS CO.

Opinion of the Court
any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger
the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the
plaintiff 's claim would have been available--and subject to
a state statute of limitations--prior to December 1, 1990.
Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the
reading of $ 1658 adopted by the District Court and urged
by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period
applies only to causes of action that were not available until
after $ 1658 was enacted. If a cause of action did not exist
prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations
that would then be disrupted by application of $ 1658.

We conclude that a cause of action "aris[es] under an Act
of Congress enacted" after December 1, 1990--and therefore
is governed by $ 1658's 4-year statute of limitations--if the
plaintiff 's claim against the defendant was made possible by
a post-1990 enactment. That construction best serves Congress' interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the
practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at
the same time protecting settled interests. It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate
state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves
in place the "borrowed" limitations periods for pre-existing
causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.

Interpreting $ 1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word "arise" to mean
"come into being; originate" 15 or "spring up." 16 Finally,
that construction is consistent with our interpretations of

Opinion of the Court
the term "arising under" as it is used in statutes governing
the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as
narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under
which "arising under" means something akin to "based solely
upon." We should avoid reading $ 1658 in such a way as to
give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to
every other context in which it is used.

IV
In this case, petitioners' hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure to transfer claims "ar[ose] under" the 1991 Act in the sense that petitioners' causes of
action were made possible by that Act. Patterson held that
"racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment
is not actionable under $ 1981." 491 U. S., at 171 (emphasis
added). The 1991 Act overturned Patterson by defining the
key "make and enforce contracts" language in $ 1981 to include the "termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all
benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual
relationship." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981(b). In Rivers v. Roadway
Express, Inc., we recognized that the 1991 amendment "enlarged the category of conduct that is subject to $ 1981 liability," 511 U. S., at 303, and we therefore held that the amendment does not apply "to a case that arose before it was
enacted," id., at 300. Our reasoning in Rivers supports the
conclusion that the 1991 Act fully qualifies as "an Act of Congress enacted after [December 1, 1990]" within the meaning
of $ 1658. Because petitioners' hostile work environment,
wrongful termination, and failure to transfer claims did not
allege a violation of the pre-1990 version of $ 1981 but did
allege violations of the amended statute, those claims
"ar[ose] under" the amendment to $ 1981 contained in the
1991 Act.

384 JONES v. R. R. DONNELLEY & SONS CO.

Opinion of the Court
While that conclusion seems eminently clear in this case,17
respondent has posited various hypothetical cases in which
it might be difficult to determine whether a particular claim
arose under the amended or the unamended version of a statute. Similarly, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying

$ 1658 to post-1990 amendments could be problematic in
some cases because " `the line between an amendment that
modifies an existing right and one that creates a new right
is often difficult to draw.' " 305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting Zubi
v. AT&T Corp., 219 F. 3d, at 224). We are not persuaded
that any "guess work," 305 F. 3d, at 725, is required to
determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the
relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or
whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent
amendment. Courts routinely make such determinations
when dealing with amendments (such as the 1991 amendment to $ 1981) that do not apply retroactively.18 In any
event, such hypothetical problems pale in comparison with
the difficulties that federal courts faced for decades in trying

17 Indeed, respondent concedes that, "[i]n this case, the nature of the
`new' claim is clear. It is recognized that liability under $ 1981 was expanded, because this Court had spoken on the scope of $ 1981 and Congress
reversed the Court's interpretation in the Civil Rights Act of 1991."
Brief for Respondent 26.

18 Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiff's cause of

action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be
particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority
regarding the scope of the original statute. In such cases, courts will
have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities. Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial
ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding
whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively. See, e. g., Hughes
Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 948-950 (1997).
The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-oflimitations inquiries undermines respondent's claim that application of

$ 1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal
judges.

DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OFCRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL

INSTITUTIONS DIVISION v. HALEY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 02-1824. Argued March 2, 2004--Decided May 3, 2004
Respondent was charged with and convicted of felony theft. Based on

two prior convictions, he was also charged as a habitual offender.
Under Texas' habitual offender statute, a defendant convicted of a felony
is subject to a sentence of 2 to 20 years if (1) he has two prior felony
convictions, and (2) the conviction for the first prior offense became final
before commission of the second. Texas law requires the State to prove
the habitual offender allegations to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt at
a separate penalty hearing. The jury here convicted respondent of the
habitual offender charge, and the judge sentenced him to 161/2 years.
As it turned out, the evidence presented at the penalty phase showed
that respondent had committed his second offense three days before his
first conviction became final, meaning that he was not eligible for the
habitual offender enhancement. No one, including defense counsel,
noted the discrepancy--either at trial or on direct appeal. Respondent
first raised the issue in a request for state postconviction relief, arguing
that the evidence at the penalty hearing was insufficient to support the
habitual offender conviction. The state court rejected his sufficiency of
the evidence claim on procedural grounds, because he had not raised the
issue earlier; the state court likewise rejected respondent's claim that
counsel had been ineffective for failing to object. Respondent renewed
his sufficiency of the evidence and ineffective assistance claims in a subsequent federal habeas application. Conceding that respondent was
not, in fact, eligible for the habitual offender enhancement, the State
nevertheless argued that respondent had procedurally defaulted his sufficiency of the evidence claim. The District Court excused the procedural default because respondent was actually innocent of the enhanced
sentence; it thus did not reach the ineffective assistance claim. The
Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the actual innocence exception applies to noncapital sentencing procedures involving career offenders and
habitual felony offenders.

Held: A federal court faced with allegations of actual innocence, whether

of the sentence or of the crime charged, must first address all nondefaulted claims for comparable relief and other grounds for cause to ex541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
cuse the procedural default. Normally, a federal court will not entertain a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim in a habeas petition
absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the default. However, this Court recognizes a narrow exception to the general rule when
the applicant can demonstrate actual innocence of the substantive offense, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496, or, in the capital sentencing
context, of the aggravating circumstances rendering the inmate eligible
for the death penalty, Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333. The Court
declines to answer the question presented here, whether this exception
should be extended to noncapital sentencing error, because the District
Court failed first to consider alternative grounds for relief urged by
respondent. This avoidance principle was implicit in Carrier itself,
where the Court expressed confidence that, "for the most part, `victims
of a fundamental miscarriage of justice will meet the cause-andprejudice standard,' " 477 U. S., at 495-496, particularly given the availability of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, id., at 496. Petitioner
concedes that respondent has a viable and significant ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Success on the merits would give respondent all
of the relief that he seeks, i. e., resentencing, and also would provide
cause to excuse the procedural default of his sufficiency of the evidence
claim. The many threshold legal questions often accompanying actual
innocence claims provide additional reason for restraint. For instance,
respondent's claim raises the question whether the holding of In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358--that each element of a criminal offense must be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt--should be extended to proof of prior
convictions used to support recidivist enhancements. Not all actual innocence claims will involve threshold constitutional questions, but, as
this case illustrates, such claims are likely to present equally difficult
questions regarding the scope of the actual innocence exception itself.

Out of respect for finality, comity, and the orderly adminis-tration of justice, a federal court will not entertain a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim in a petition for habeascorpus absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse
the default. We have recognized a narrow exception to thegeneral rule when the habeas applicant can demonstrate that
the alleged constitutional error has resulted in the convictionof one who is actually innocent of the underlying offense or,

Opinion of the Court
by respondent, grounds that might obviate any need to reachthe actual innocence question, we vacate the judgment and

remand. I

In 1997, respondent Michael Wayne Haley was arrestedafter stealing a calculator from a local Wal-Mart and attempting to exchange it for other merchandise. Respondentwas charged with, and found guilty at trial of, theft of property valued at less than $1,500, which, because respondentalready had two prior theft convictions, was a "state jail felony" punishable by a maximum of two years in prison. App.8; Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 31.03(e)(4)(D) (Supp. 2004). The
State also charged respondent as a habitual felony offender.The indictment alleged that respondent had two prior felony
convictions and that the first--a 1991 conviction for deliveryof amphetamine--"became final prior to the commission" of
the second--a 1992 robbery. App. 9. The timing of thefirst conviction and the second offense is significant: Under
Texas' habitual offender statute, only a defendant convictedof a felony who "has previously been finally convicted of two
felonies, and the second previous felony conviction is for anoffense that occurred subsequent to the first previous conviction having become final, . . . shall be punished for a second-degree felony." $ 12.42(a)(2) (emphasis added). A second
degree felony carries a minimum sentence of 2 and a maxi-mum sentence of 20 years in prison. $ 12.33(a) (2003).

Texas provides for bifurcated trials in habitual offendercases. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.07, $ 3 (Vernon
Supp. 2004). If a defendant is found guilty of the substan-tive offense, the State, at a separate penalty hearing, must
prove the habitual offender allegations beyond a reasonabledoubt. Ibid. During the penalty phase of respondent's
trial, the State introduced records showing that respondenthad been convicted of delivery of amphetamine on October
18, 1991, and attempted robbery on September 9, 1992. Therecord of the second conviction, however, showed that re541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
spondent had committed the robbery on October 15, 1991--three days

before his first conviction became final. Neither
the prosecutor, nor the defense attorney, nor the witness ten-dered by the State to authenticate the records, nor the trial

judge, nor the jury, noticed the 3-day discrepancy. Indeed,the defense attorney chose not to cross-examine the State's
witness or to put on any evidence.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the habitual of-fender charge and recommended a sentence of 16

1/2 years; the

court followed the recommendation. Respondent appealed.Appellate counsel did not mention the 3-day discrepancy

nor challenge the sufficiency of the penalty-phase evidence
to support the habitual offender enhancement. The State
Court of Appeals affirmed respondent's conviction and sentence; the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused respondent's petition for discretionary review.

Respondent thereafter sought state postconviction relief,
arguing for the first time that he was ineligible for the habitual offender enhancement based on the timing of his second
conviction. App. 83, 87-88. The state habeas court refused
to consider the merits of that claim because respondent had
not raised it, as required by state procedural law, either at
trial or on direct appeal. Id., at 107, 108. The state habeas
court rejected respondent's related ineffective assistance of
counsel claim, saying only that "counsel was not ineffective"
for failing to object to or to appeal the enhancement. Id.,
at 108. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarily
denied respondent's state habeas application. Id., at 109.

In August 2000, respondent filed a timely pro se application for a federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 2254, renewing his sufficiency of the evidence and
ineffective assistance of counsel claims. App. 110, 118-119;
id., at 122, 124, 126-127. The State conceded that respondent was "correct in his assertion that the enhancement paragraphs as alleged in the indictment do not satisfy section
12.42(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code." Id., at 132, 140.

Opinion of the Court
Rather than agree to resentencing, however, the State ar-gued that respondent had procedurally defaulted the sufficiency of the evidence claim by failing to raise it before thestate trial court or on direct appeal.

Id., at 142-144. The
Magistrate Judge, to whom the habeas application had beenreferred, recommended excusing the procedural default and

granting the sufficiency of the evidence claim because respondent was " `actually innocent' of a sentence for a second-degree felony."

Haley v. Director, Texas Dept. of Criminal
Justice, Institutions Div., Civ. No. 6:00cv518 (ED Tex., Sept.13, 2001), p. 10, App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (citing

Sones v.
Hargett, 61 F. 3d 410, 419 (CA5 1995)). Because she recommended relief on the erroneous enhancement claim, the Magistrate Judge did not address respondent's related ineffective
assistance of counsel challenges. App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-
52a. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report, granted the application, and ordered the State to resentence respondent "without the improper enhancement."
Id., at 36a-37a (Oct. 27, 2001).

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding narrowly that the actual innocence exception "applies to
noncapital sentencing procedures involving a career or habitual felony offender." Haley v. Cockrell, 306 F. 3d 257, 264
(2002). The Fifth Circuit thus joined the Fourth Circuit in
holding that the exception should not extend beyond allegedly erroneous recidivist enhancements to other claims of
noncapital factual sentencing error: "[T]o broaden the exception further would `swallow' the `cause portion of the cause
and prejudice requirement' and it `would conflict squarely
with Supreme Court authority indicating that generally
more than prejudice must exist to excuse a procedural default.' " Id., at 266 (quoting United States v. Mikalajunas,
186 F. 3d 490, 494-495 (CA4 1999)). Finding the exception
satisfied, the panel then granted relief on the merits of respondent's otherwise defaulted sufficiency of the evidence
claim. In so doing, the panel assumed that challenges to the

sufficiency of noncapital sentencing evidence are cognizableon federal habeas under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307

(1979). 306 F. 3d, at 266-267 (citing French v. Estelle, 692F. 2d 1021, 1024-1025 (CA5 1982)).

The Fifth Circuit's decision exacerbated a growing diver-gence of opinion in the Courts of Appeals regarding the
availability and scope of the actual innocence exception inthe noncapital sentencing context. Compare

Embrey v.Hershberger, 131 F. 3d 739 (CA8 1997) (en banc) (no actual

innocence exception for noncapital sentencing error); Reid v.Oklahoma, 101 F. 3d 628 (CA10 1996) (same), with Spence v.
Superintendent, Great Meadow Correctional Facility, 219F. 3d 162 (CA2 2000) (actual innocence exception applies in
noncapital sentencing context when error is related to find-ing of predicate act forming the basis for enhancement), and
Mikalajunas, supra (actual innocence exception applies innoncapital sentencing context where error relates to a recidivist enhancement). We granted the State's request for awrit of certiorari, 540 U. S. 945 (2003), and now vacate and
remand. II

The procedural default doctrine, like the abuse of writ doc-trine, "refers to a complex and evolving body of equitable
principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statu-tory developments, and judicial decisions."

McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991). A corollary to the habeas

statute's exhaustion requirement, the doctrine has its rootsin the general principle that federal courts will not disturb
state court judgments based on adequate and independentstate law procedural grounds. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433
U. S. 72, 81 (1977); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486-487(1953). But, while an adequate and independent state procedural disposition strips this Court of certiorari jurisdictionto review a state court's judgment, it provides only a strong
prudential reason, grounded in "considerations of comity andconcerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice,"

Opinion of the Court
not to pass upon a defaulted constitutional claim presentedfor federal habeas review.

Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S.
536, 538-539 (1976); see also Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 399(1963) ("[T]he doctrine under which state procedural defaults

are held to constitute an adequate and independent state lawground barring direct Supreme Court review is not to be
extended to limit the power granted the federal courts under
the federal habeas statute"). That being the case, we haverecognized an equitable exception to the bar when a habeas

applicant can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the proce-dural default.

Wainwright, supra, at 87. The cause and
prejudice requirement shows due regard for States' finality
and comity interests while ensuring that "fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984).

The cause and prejudice standard is not a perfect safeguard against fundamental miscarriages of justice. Murray
v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), thus recognized a narrow
exception to the cause requirement where a constitutional
violation has "probably resulted" in the conviction of one
who is "actually innocent" of the substantive offense. Id.,
at 496; accord, Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298 (1995). We subsequently extended this exception to claims of capital sentencing error in Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992).
Acknowledging that the concept of " `actual innocence' " did
not translate neatly into the capital sentencing context, we
limited the exception to cases in which the applicant could
show "by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable
state law." Id., at 336.

We are asked in the present case to extend the actual innocence exception to procedural default of constitutional claims
challenging noncapital sentencing error. We decline to answer the question in the posture of this case and instead hold
that a federal court faced with allegations of actual inno541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cence, whether of the sentence or of the crime charged, mustfirst address all nondefaulted claims for comparable relief

and other grounds for cause to excuse the procedural default.This avoidance principle was implicit in

Carrier itself,
where we expressed confidence that, "for the most part,`victims of a fundamental miscarriage of justice will meet

the cause-and-prejudice standard.' " 477 U. S., at 495-496
(quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982)). Our con-fidence was bolstered by the availability of ineffective assistance of counsel claims--either as a ground for cause or as afreestanding claim for relief--to safeguard against miscarriages of justice. The existence of such safeguards, we observed, "may properly inform this Court's judgment in determining `[w]hat standards should govern the exercise of
the habeas court's equitable discretion' with respect to procedurally defaulted claims." Carrier, supra, at 496 (quoting
Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984)).

Petitioner here conceded at oral argument that respondent
has a viable and "significant" ineffective assistance of counsel
claim. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18 ("[W]e agree at this point there
is a very significant argument of ineffective assistance of
counsel"); see also id., at 7 (agreeing "not [to] raise any procedural impediment" to consideration of the merits of respondent's ineffective assistance claim on remand). Success on
the merits would give respondent all of the relief that he
seeks--i. e., resentencing. It would also provide cause to
excuse the procedural default of his sufficiency of the evidence claim. Carrier, supra, at 488.

Contrary to the dissent's view, see post, at 397 (opinion of
Stevens, J.), it is precisely because the various exceptions
to the procedural default doctrine are judge-made rules that
courts as their stewards must exercise restraint, adding to
or expanding them only when necessary. To hold otherwise
would be to license district courts to riddle the cause and
prejudice standard with ad hoc exceptions whenever they
perceive an error to be "clear" or departure from the rules

Opinion of the Court
expedient. Such an approach, not the rule of restraintadopted here, would have the unhappy effect of prolonging

the pendency of federal habeas applications as each new ex-ception is tested in the courts of appeals. And because petitioner has assured us that the State will not seek to reincar-cerate respondent during the pendency of his ineffective
assistance claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 ("[T]he state is willing
to allow the ineffective assistance case to be litigated beforeproceeding to reincarcerate [respondent]"), the negative consequences for respondent of our judgment to vacate and re-mand in this case are minimal.

While availability of other remedies alone would be sufficient justification for a general rule of avoidance, the many
threshold legal questions often accompanying claims of actual innocence provide additional reason for restraint. For
instance, citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979),
respondent here seeks to bring through the actual innocence
gateway his constitutional claim that the State's penaltyphase evidence was insufficient to support the recidivist enhancement. But the constitutional hook in Jackson was
In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), in which we held that
due process requires proof of each element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We have not extended
Winship's protections to proof of prior convictions used to
support recidivist enhancements. Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998); see also Apprendi v.
New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 488-490 (2000) (reserving judgment as to the validity of Almendarez-Torres); Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 734 (1998) (Double Jeopardy Clause
does not preclude retrial on a prior conviction used to support recidivist enhancement). Respondent contends that
Almendarez-Torres should be overruled or, in the alternative, that it does not apply because the recidivist statute at
issue required the jury to find not only the existence of his
prior convictions but also the additional fact that they were
sequential. Brief for Respondent 30-31. These difficult

Stevens, J., dissenting
constitutional questions, simply assumed away by the dis-sent, see post, at 397 (citing Jackson, supra, and Thompson

v. Louisville, 362 U. S. 199 (1960)), are to be avoided ifpossible.

To be sure, not all claims of actual innocence will involvethreshold constitutional issues. Even so, as this case and
the briefing illustrate, such claims are likely to presentequally difficult questions regarding the scope of the actual
innocence exception itself. Whether and to what extent theexception extends to noncapital sentencing error is just one
example. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The unending search for symmetry in the law can causejudges to forget about justice. This should be a simple case.

Respondent was convicted of the theft of a calculator.Because of his prior theft convictions, Texas law treated respondent's crime as a "state jail felony," which is punishableby a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Tex. Penal
Code Ann. $ 12.35(a) (2003). But as a result of a congeriesof mistakes made by the prosecutor, the trial judge, and his
attorney, respondent was also erroneously convicted and sen-tenced under Texas' habitual offender law, $ 12.42(a)(2)
(Supp. 2004). Respondent consequently received a sentenceof more than 16 years in the penitentiary. The State concedes that respondent does not qualify as a habitual offenderand that the 16-year sentence was imposed in error.

1 Respondent has already served more than 6 years of that sen-tence--a sentence far in excess of the 2-year maximum that

Texas law authorizes for respondent's crime.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Because, as all parties agree, there is no factual basis forrespondent's conviction as a habitual offender, it follows inexorably that respondent has been denied due process of law.
Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U. S. 199 (1960); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). And because that constitutionalerror clearly and concededly resulted in the imposition of an

unauthorized sentence, it also follows that respondent is a
"victim of a miscarriage of justice," Wainwright v. Sykes, 433U. S. 72, 91 (1977), entitled to immediate and unconditional

release.The Magistrate Judge, the District Court, and the Court
of Appeals all concluded that respondent is entitled to such
relief. Not a word in any federal statute or any provision
of the Federal Rules of Procedure provides any basis for
challenging that conclusion. The Court's contrary determination in this case rests entirely on a procedural rule of its
own invention. But having also invented the complex jurisprudence that requires a prisoner to establish "cause and
prejudice" as a basis for overcoming procedural default, the
Court unquestionably has the authority to recognize a narrow exception for the unusual case that is as clear as this one.

Indeed, in the opinion that first adopted the cause and
prejudice standard, the Court explained its purpose as providing "an adequate guarantee" that a procedural default
would "not prevent a federal habeas court from adjudicating
for the first time the federal constitutional claim of a defendant who in the absence of such an adjudication will be the
victim of a miscarriage of justice." Ibid. The Court has
since held that in cases in which the cause and prejudice
standard is inadequate to protect against fundamental miscarriages of justice, the cause and prejudice requirement
"must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally
unjust incarceration." Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135
(1982).

If there were some uncertainty about the merits of respondent's claim that he has been incarcerated unjustly, it

Stevens, J., dissenting
might make sense to require him to pursue other avenuesfor comparable relief before deciding the claim.

2 But in this

case, it is universally acknowledged that respondent's incar-ceration is unauthorized. The miscarriage of justice is manifest. Since the "imperative of correcting a fundamentallyunjust incarceration" will lead to the issuance of the writ
regardless of the outcome of the cause and prejudice inquiry,
the Court's ruling today needlessly postpones final adjudica-tion of respondent's claim and perversely prolongs the very

injustice that the cause and prejudice standard was designedto prevent.

That the State has decided to oppose the grant of habeasrelief in this case, even as it concedes that respondent has
already served more time in prison than the law authorized,might cause some to question whether the State has forgotten its overriding "obligation to serve the cause of justice."
United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 111 (1976); see post,
p. 399 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). But this Court is surely
no less at fault. In its attempt to refine the boundaries of
the judge-made doctrine of procedural default, the Court has
lost sight of the basic reason why the "writ of habeas corpus
indisputably holds an honored position in our jurisprudence."
Engle, 456 U. S., at 126. Habeas corpus is, and has for centuries been, a "bulwark against convictions that violate fun2 Because it is not always easy to discern the difference between "constitutional claims that call into question the reliability of an adjudication of
legal guilt," to which the cause and prejudice requirement applies, and
claims that a constitutional violation "probably resulted in the conviction
of one who is actually innocent," for which failure to show cause is excused, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495-496 (1986), a court reviewing
a claim of actual innocence must generally proceed with caution. But that
type of caution is plainly unwarranted in a case in which constitutional
error has concededly resulted in the imposition of an unlawful sentence.
In such a case, there is simply no risk that entertaining the habeas applicant's procedurally defaulted claim will result in an unwarranted encroachment on the principles of comity and finality that underlie the procedural
default doctrine.

damental fairness." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omit-ted). Fundamental fairness should dictate the outcome of

this unusually simple case.I respectfully dissent.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
For the reasons Justice Stevens sets forth, the respondent should be entitled to immediate relief, and I join his dis-senting opinion. The case also merits this further comment

concerning the larger obligation of state or federal officialswhen they know an individual has been sentenced for a crime
he did not commit.In 1997, Michael Haley was sentenced to serve 16 years
and 6 months in prison for violating the Texas habitualoffender law. Texas officials concede Haley did not violate
this law. They agree that Haley is guilty only of theft, a
crime with a 2-year maximum sentence. Yet, despite the
fact that Haley served more than two years in prison for his
crime, Texas officials come before our Court opposing Haley's petition for relief. They wish to send Haley back to
prison for a crime they agree he did not commit.

The rigors of the penal system are thought to be mitigated
to some degree by the discretion of those who enforce the
law. See, e. g., Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 31 J. Am.
Inst. Crim. L. & C. 3, 6 (1940-1941). The clemency power
is designed to serve the same function. Among its benign
if too-often ignored objects, the clemency power can correct
injustices that the ordinary criminal process seems unable
or unwilling to consider. These mechanisms hold out the
promise that mercy is not foreign to our system. The law
must serve the cause of justice.

These mitigating elements seem to have played no role in
Michael Haley's case. Executive discretion and clemency
can inspire little confidence if officials sworn to fight injustice
choose to ignore it. Perhaps some would say that Haley's
innocence is a mere technicality, but that would miss the

point. In a society devoted to the rule of law, the differencebetween violating or not violating a criminal statute cannot

be shrugged aside as a minor detail.It may be that Haley's case provides a convenient mechanism to vindicate an important legal principle. Beyond that,however, Michael Haley has a greater interest in knowing
that he will not be reincarcerated for a crime he did notcommit. It is not clear to me why the State did not exercise
its power and perform its duty to vindicate that interest inthe first place.

SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPI, SECRETARY OF

VETERANS AFFAIRS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 02-1657. Argued February 23, 2004--Decided May 3, 2004
The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) authorizes the payment of attorney's fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States
absent a showing by the Government that its position in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(A).
Section 2412(d)(1)(B) sets a deadline of 30 days after final judgment for
the filing of a fee application and directs that the application include:
(1) a showing that the applicant is a "prevailing party"; (2) a showing
that the applicant is "eligible to receive an award"; and (3) a statement
of "the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney . . . stating the actual time expended and the rate" charged. Section 2412(d)(1)(B)'s second sentence further requires the applicant to
"allege that the position of the United States was not substantially
justified."

Petitioner Scarborough prevailed before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in an action for disability benefits against respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Scarborough's counsel filed a timely
application for attorney's fees and costs pursuant to $ 2412(d), showing
that Scarborough was the prevailing party in the underlying litigation
and was eligible to receive an award. Counsel also stated the total
amount sought, and itemized hours and rates of work. But counsel
failed initially to allege, in addition, that "the position of the United
States was not substantially justified." $ 2412(d)(1)(B). The Secretary
moved to dismiss the application on the ground that the CAVC lacked
subject-matter jurisdiction to award fees because Scarborough's counsel
had failed to make the required no-substantial-justification allegation.
Scarborough's counsel immediately filed an amended application adding
that allegation. In the interim between the initial filing and the amendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing period had expired.
For that sole reason, the CAVC dismissed Scarborough's fee application.

In affirming, the Federal Circuit initially held that EAJA plainly and
unambiguously requires a party seeking fees under $ 2412(d) to submit
an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day
time limit. This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and
remanded the case in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S.

Syllabus
106. In Edelman, the Court had upheld an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation allowing amendment of an employment discrimination charge, timely filed under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, to add, after the filing deadline, the required, but
initially absent, verification. Title VII, the Court explained, permitted
"relation back" of a verification missing from an original filing. Id., at
115-118. On remand, the Federal Circuit adhered to its earlier decision, distinguishing Edelman on the ground that, in Title VII's remedial
scheme, laypersons often initiate the process, whereas EAJA is directed
to attorneys. The appeals court also observed that the timely filing
and verification requirements at issue in Edelman appear in separate
statutory provisions, while EAJA's 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutory
provision. The Federal Circuit also distinguished the holding in Becker
v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757, that a pro se litigant's failure to hand sign
a timely filed notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect. This Court had noted in Becker, the Federal Circuit
pointed out, that the timing and signature requirements there at issue
were found in separate rules.

Held: A timely fee application, pursuant to $ 2412(d), may be amended

after the 30-day filing period has run to cure an initial failure to allege
that the Government's position in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification. Thus, Scarborough's fee application, as amended,
qualifies for consideration and determination on the merits. Pp. 413-423.

(a) Whether Scarborough is time barred by $ 2412(d)(1)(B) from gaining the fee award authorized by $ 2412(d)(1)(A) does not concern the
federal courts' "subject-matter jurisdiction." Rather, it concerns a
mode of relief (costs including legal fees) ancillary to the judgment of a
court that has plenary "jurisdiction of [the civil] action" in which the fee
application is made. See $$ 2412(b) and (d)(1)(A); 38 U. S. C. $ 7252(a).
More particularly, the current dispute presents a question of time. The
issue is not whether, but when, $$ 2412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee
applicant to "allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified." Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants
used the label "jurisdictional" not for such claim-processing rules, but
only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter
jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a
court's adjudicatory authority. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454-
455. Section 2412(d)(1)(B) does not describe what classes of cases the
CAVC is competent to adjudicate, but relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court's adjudicatory authority. Pp. 413-414.

(b) Unlike the $ 2412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant
must show (his "prevailing party" status, "eligib[ility] to receive an
award," and "the amount sought, including an itemized statement"), the
required "not substantially justified" allegation imposes no proof burden
on the fee applicant, but is simply an allegation or pleading requirement.
So understood, the applicant's pleading burden is akin to Becker's signature requirement and Edelman's verification requirement. Like those
requirements, EAJA's ten-word "not substantially justified" allegation
is a "think twice" prescription that "stem[s] the urge to litigate irresponsibly," Edelman, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, the allegation functions to shift the burden to the Government to prove that its position
in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(A).
The allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the
Government is aware, from the moment a fee application is filed, that to
defeat the application on the merits, it will have to prove its position
"was substantially justified." A failure to make the allegation, therefore, should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is
applying for fees, from what judgment, and to which court. Becker,
532 U. S., at 767. Moreover, because Scarborough's lawyer's statutory
contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by an EAJA award,
see 38 U. S. C. $ 5904(d)(1); Fee Agreements, note following 28 U. S. C.

$ 2412, allowing the curative amendment benefits the complainant directly, and is not fairly described as simply a boon for his counsel.

The Court rejects the Government's assertion that the relation-back
regime, as now codified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), is out
of place in this context because that Rule governs "pleadings," a term
that does not encompass fee applications. In Becker and Edelman, the
Court approved application of the relation-back doctrine to a notice of
appeal and an EEOC discrimination charge, neither of which is a "pleading" under the Federal Rules. Moreover, "relation back" was not an
invention of the federal rulemakers. This Court applied the doctrine
well before the Federal Rules became effective, see, e. g., New York Central & Hudson River R. Co. v. Kinney, 260 U. S. 340, 346. Thus, the
relation-back doctrine properly guides the Court's determination here:
The amended application "arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth" in the initial application.
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2). Pp. 414-419.

(c) The Court rejects the Government's argument that $ 2412's waiver
of sovereign immunity from liability for fees is conditioned on the fee
applicant's meticulous compliance with each and every $ 2412(d)(1)(B)
requirement within 30 days of final judgment, including the allegation
that the United States' position "was not substantially justified."

Opinion of the Court
nia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145--in which the Court
recognized that limitation principles generally apply to the Government
in the same way they apply to private parties--are enlightening on this
issue. The Government asserts unpersuasively that Irwin and Franconia do not bear on this case because $ 2412(d) authorizes fee awards
against it under rules that have no analogue in private litigation. Because many statutes that create claims for relief against the United
States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants, Irwin's
reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations
with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent. In any event,

$ 2412(d) is analogous to federal "prevailing party" fee-shifting statutes
that are applicable to suits between private litigants. Finally, the
Court's conclusion will not expose the Government to any unfair imposition. The Government has never argued that it will be prejudiced if
Scarborough's "not substantially justified" allegation is permitted to relate back to his timely filed fee application. Moreover, a showing of
prejudice should preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in the
first place. EAJA itself also has a built-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A)
disallows fees where "special circumstances make an award unjust."

Opinion of the Court
Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 257 (1975). Relevant
here, EAJA authorizes the payment of fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States; the Government may defeat this entitlement by showing that its
position in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(A). In a further provision,

$ 2412(d)(1)(B), the Act prescribes the timing and content of
applications seeking fees authorized by $ 2412(d)(1)(A). Section 2412(d)(1)(B) specifies as the time for filing the application "within thirty days of final judgment in the action." In
the same sentence, the provision identifies the application's
contents, in particular, a showing that the applicant is a "prevailing party" who meets the financial eligibility condition
(in this case, a net worth that "did not exceed $2,000,000 at
the time the . . . action was filed," $ 2412(d)(2)(B)); and a
statement of the amount sought, with an accompanying itemization. The fee application instruction adds in the next
sentence: "The [applicant] shall also allege that the position
of the United States was not substantially justified."

Petitioner Randall C. Scarborough was the prevailing
party in an action against the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability benefits. His counsel filed a timely application for fees showing Scarborough's "eligib[ility] to receive
an award" and "the amount sought, including [the required]
itemized statement." $ 2412(d)(1)(B). But counsel failed
initially to allege, in addition, that "the position of the United
States was not substantially justified." Pointing to that
omission, the Government moved to dismiss the fee application. Scarborough's counsel immediately filed an amended
application adding that the Government's opposition to the
underlying claim for benefits "was not substantially justified." In the interim between the initial filing and the
amendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing period
had expired. For that sole reason, the United States Court
of Appeals for Veterans Claims granted the Government's

motion to dismiss the application and the Federal Circuit affirmed that disposition.

Scarborough's petition for certiorari presents this question: May a timely fee application, pursuant to $ 2412(d), be
amended after the 30-day filing period has run to cure an
initial failure to allege that the Government's position in the
underlying litigation lacked substantial justification? We
hold that a curative amendment is permissible and that Scarborough's fee application, as amended, qualifies for consideration and determination on the merits.

Congress enacted EAJA, Pub. L. 96-481, Tit. II, 94 Stat.
2325, in 1980 "to eliminate the barriers that prohibit small
businesses and individuals from securing vindication of their
rights in civil actions and administrative proceedings brought
by or against the Federal Government." H. R. Rep. No. 96-
1005, p. 9; see Congressional Findings and Purposes, 94 Stat.
2325, note following 5 U. S. C. $ 504 ("It is the purpose of

this title . . . to diminish the deterrent effect of seeking review of, or defending against, governmental action . . . .").
Among other reforms, EAJA amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2412,
which previously had authorized courts to award costs, but
not attorney's fees and expenses, to prevailing parties in civil
litigation against the United States. EAJA added two
new prescriptions to $ 2412 that expressly authorize attorney's fee awards against the Federal Government. First,

$ 2412(b) made the United States liable for attorney's fees
and expenses "to the same extent that any other party would
be liable under the common law or under the terms of any
statute which specifically provides for such an award." Second, $ 2412(d) rendered the Government liable for a prevailing private party's attorney's fees and expenses in cases in
which suit would lie only against the United States or an

agency of the United States. This case concerns the con-struction of $ 2412(d).

Congress initially adopted $ 2412(d) for a trial period ofthree years, Pub. L. 96-481, $ 204(c); in 1985, Congress substantially reenacted the measure, this time without a sunsetprovision, Pub. L. 99-80, 99 Stat. 183. See id., $ 6(b)(2), 99
Stat. 186. Congress' aim, in converting $ 2412(d) from atemporary measure to a permanent one, was "to ensure that
certain individuals, partnerships, corporations . . . or otherorganizations will not be deterred from seeking review of, or
defending against, unjustified governmental action becauseof the expense involved." H. R. Rep. No. 99-120, p. 4.

Section 2412(d) currently provides, in relevant part:

"(d)(1)(A) Except as otherwise specifically providedby statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party

other than the United States fees and other expenses,in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection
(a),[1] incurred by that party in any civil action (otherthan cases sounding in tort), . . . brought by or against
the United States in any court having jurisdiction ofthat action, unless the court finds that the position of the
United States was substantially justified or that specialcircumstances make an award unjust.

"(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other ex-penses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the
action, submit to the court an application for fees andother expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under thissubsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness . . .stating the actual time expended and the rate at which
fees and other expenses were computed. The party

shall also allege that the position of the United Stateswas not substantially justified."

Section 2412(d)(1)(A) thus entitles a prevailing party to feesabsent a showing by the Government that its position in
the underlying litigation "was substantially justified," while$ 2412(d)(1)(B) sets a deadline of 30 days after final judgment
for the filing of a fee application and directs that the applica-tion shall include: (1) a showing that the applicant is a prevailing party; (2) a showing that the applicant is eligible toreceive an award (in Scarborough's case, that the applicant's
"net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civilaction was filed," $ 2412(d)(2)(B)); and (3) a statement of the
amount sought together with an itemized account of timeexpended and rates charged. The second sentence of

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) adds a fourth instruction, requiring the appli-cant simply to "allege" that the position of the United States
was not substantially justified.

Opinion of the Court
The Clerk of the CAVC returned Scarborough's initial feeapplication on the ground that it was filed too soon. App.

6-7. After the CAVC issued a judgment noting that thetime for filing postdecision motions had expired, Scarborough's counsel filed a second EAJA application (the one atissue here) setting forth, as did the first application, that
Scarborough was the prevailing party in the underlying litigation; that his net worth did not exceed $2 million; and adescription of work counsel performed for Scarborough since

counsel's retention in August 1998. Id., at 8-9. The appli-cation requested $19,333.75 in attorney's fees and $117.80 in
costs. Id., at 9. Scarborough's applications, both the first
and the second, failed to allege "that the position of the
United States [in the underlying litigation] was not substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(B). In all other respects,
it is not here disputed, Scarborough's filings met the

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) application-content requirements.

Again, the Clerk of the CAVC found the application premature, but this time retained it, unfiled, until the time to
appeal the CAVC's judgment had expired. The Clerk then
filed the fee application and notified the respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs that his response was due within 30
days. Id., at 10. After receiving and exhausting a 30-day
extension of time to respond, the Secretary moved to dismiss
the fee application. Id., at 2. The CAVC lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction to award fees under $ 2412(d), the Secretary maintained, because Scarborough's counsel had failed to
allege, within 30 days of the final judgment, "that the position of the United States was not substantially justified,"

$ 2412(d)(1)(B). CAVC Record, Doc. 12, pp. 4-5.

Scarborough's counsel promptly filed an amendment to the
fee application, stating in a new paragraph that "the government's defense of the Appellant's claim was not substantially
justified." App. 11. Simultaneously, Scarborough opposed
the Secretary's motion to dismiss, urging that the omission

Opinion of the Court
by amendment and was not a jurisdictional defect. CAVCRecord, Doc. 13, pp. 1-2. On June 14, 2000, the CAVC dismissed Scarborough's fee application on the ground assertedby the Government.

Scarborough v. West, 13 Vet. App. 530
(per curiam).A year-and-a-half later, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 273 F. 3d 1087 (2001). EAJA must
be construed strictly in favor of the Government, the Courtof Appeals stated, because the Act effects a partial waiver

of sovereign immunity, rendering the United States liable forattorney's fees when the Government otherwise would not
be required to pay. Id., at 1089-1090. In the court's view,
"[t]he language of the EAJA statute is plain and unambiguous"; it requires a party seeking fees under $ 2412(d)
to submit an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day time limit. Id., at 1090 (citing

$ 2412(d)(1)(B)). The court acknowledged that the Courts
of Appeals for the Third and Eleventh Circuits read

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) to require only that the fee application be filed
within 30 days; those Circuits allow later amendments to
perfect the application-content specifications set out in

$ 2412(d)(1)(B). Id., at 1090-1091 (citing Dunn v. United
States, 775 F. 2d 99, 104 (CA3 1985) (applicant need not submit within 30 days an itemized statement accounting for the
amount sought), and Singleton v. Apfel, 231 F. 3d 853, 858
(CA11 2000) (applicant need not allege within 30 days that
her net worth did not exceed $2 million or that the Government's position was not substantially justified)).

The Federal Circuit also distinguished its own decision in
Bazalo v. West, 150 F. 3d 1380 (1998), which had held that
an applicant may supplement an EAJA application to cure
an initial failure to show eligibility for fees. The applicant
in Bazalo had failed to allege and establish, within the
30-day period, that he was a qualified "party" within the
meaning of $ 2412(d), i. e., that his "net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed,"

Opinion of the Court

$ 2412(d)(2)(B). Id., at 1381. Bazalo differed from Scarbor-ough's case, the Court of Appeals said, because the

Bazalo
applicant had essentially complied with the basic pleadingrequirements and simply needed to "fles[h] out . . . the details." 273 F. 3d, at 1092.We granted Scarborough's initial petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and
remanded the case in light of this Court's decision in Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106 (2002). See 536
U. S. 920 (2002). Edelman concerned an Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation relating to

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the regulation allowed amendment of an employment discrimination charge,
timely filed with the EEOC, to add, after the filing deadline
had passed, the required, but initially absent, verification.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(b) (requiring charges to "be in writing under oath or affirmation"). We upheld the regulation.
Title VII, we explained, in line with "a long history of practice," 535 U. S., at 116, permitted "relation back" of a verification missing from an original filing, id., at 115-118.

On remand of Scarborough's case to the same Federal Circuit panel, two of the three judges adhered to the panel's
unanimous earlier decision and distinguished Edelman. 319
F. 3d 1346 (2003). Unlike the civil rights statute in Edelman, the Court of Appeals majority said, a "remedial
scheme" in which laypersons often initiate the process,
EAJA is directed to attorneys, who do not need "paternalistic protection." 319 F. 3d, at 1353 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The Federal Circuit's majority further observed
that the two requirements at issue in Edelman--the timely
filing of a discrimination charge and the verification of that
charge--appear in separate statutory provisions. In contrast, EAJA's 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutory
provision. 319 F. 3d, at 1353. The majority also distinguished Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757 (2001), in which

541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
412 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPI

Opinion of the Court
we held that a pro se litigant's failure to hand sign a timelyfiled notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect. This Court had noted in Becker, the FederalCircuit majority pointed out, that the timing and signature
requirements there at issue were found in separate rules.See 319 F. 3d, at 1353. The Federal Circuit's opinion next
distinguished Edelman's verification requirement and Becker's signature requirement from EAJA's no-substantial-justification-allegati on requirement on this additional

ground: "[The] . . . substantial justification [allegation] is nota pro forma requirement," for it "requires an applicant to
analyze the case record" and "is one portion of the basis of
the award itself." 319 F. 3d, at 1353. Reiterating that the
no-substantial-justification allegation is "jurisdictional," the
Federal Circuit held that Scarborough's "[n]oncompliance
[was] fatal" and dismissed the application. Id., at 1355.

Chief Judge Mayer dissented. The no-substantialjustification allegation, he found, "is akin to the verification
requirement of Edelman and the signature requirement of
Becker." Id., at 1356. In addition to the pathmarking
Edelman and Becker decisions, he regarded this case as
"substantially the same case as Bazalo." 319 F. 3d, at 1356.
In light of EAJA's purpose "to eliminate the financial disincentive for those who would defend against unjustified governmental action and thereby deter it," Chief Judge Mayer
concluded, "it is apparent that Congress did not intend the
EAJA application process to be an additional deterrent to
the vindication of rights because of a missing averment."
Ibid.

We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 986 (2003), in view of the
division of opinion among the Circuits on the question
whether an EAJA application may be amended, outside the
30-day period, to allege that the Government's position in the
underlying litigation was not substantially justified, compare
Singleton, 231 F. 3d 853, with 319 F. 3d 1346. We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Opinion of the Court

II

A
We clarify, first, that the question before us--whetherScarborough is time barred by $ 2412(d)(1)(B) from gaining the fee award authorized by $ 2412(d)(1)(A)--does notconcern the federal courts' "subject-matter jurisdiction."
Rather, it concerns a mode of relief (costs including legalfees) ancillary to the judgment of a court that has plenary
"jurisdiction of [the civil] action" in which the fee applicationis made. See $$ 2412(b) and (d)(1)(A) (costs including fees
awardable "in any civil action" brought against the UnitedStates "in any court having jurisdiction of [that] action"); 38
U. S. C. $ 7252(a) ("The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claimsshall have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the
Board of Veterans' Appeals.").3 More particularly, the cur-rent dispute between Scarborough and the Government presents a question of time. The issue is not whether, butwhen, $$ 2412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee applicant to "allege that the position of the United States was not substan-tially justified." As we recently observed:

"Courts, including this Court, . . . have more than oc-casionally [mis]used the term `jurisdictional' to describe
emphatic time prescriptions in [claim processing]rules . . . . Classifying time prescriptions, even rigid
ones, under the heading `subject matter jurisdiction' canbe confounding. Clarity would be facilitated if courts
and litigants used the label `jurisdictional' not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating

3 Scarborough had already invoked the CAVC's exclusive jurisdiction--
by appealing the Board of Veterans' Appeals' July 1998 decision denying
his claim for disability benefits--well before he applied for fees; this distinguishes his case from Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312
(1988), on which the Government relies. See Brief for Respondent 11, 20,
n. 3. Torres involved the omission of required content (each applicant's
name) in a notice of appeal, the filing that triggers appellate-court jurisdiction over the case. See 487 U. S., at 315, 317.

Opinion of the Court
the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and thepersons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's

adjudicatory authority." Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.443, 454-455 (2004) (citation, some internal quotation
marks, and brackets omitted).
In short, $ 2412(d)(1)(B) does not describe what "classes ofcases,"

id., at 455, the CAVC is competent to adjudicate;instead, the section relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court's adjudi-catory authority. Accordingly, as Kontrick indicates, the
provision's 30-day deadline for fee applications and itsapplication-content specifications are not properly typed
"jurisdictional." B

We turn next to the reason why Congress required thefee applicant to "allege" that the Government's position "was
not substantially justified, " $ 2412(d)(1)(B).4 Unlike the$ 2412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must show
(his "prevailing party" status and "eligib[ility] to receive anaward," and "the amount sought, including an itemized statement" reporting "the actual time expended and the rate atwhich fees and other expenses were computed"), the required "not substantially justified" allegation imposes noproof burden on the fee applicant. It is, as its text conveys,
nothing more than an allegation or pleading requirement.The burden of establishing "that the position of the United
States was substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(A) indicatesand courts uniformly have recognized, must be shouldered
by the Government. See, e. g., Pierce v. Underwood, 487

4 All agree that $ 2412(d)(1)(B) requires a fee applicant to allege that the
Government's position "was not substantially justified." In this regard,
the dissent sees fire where there is no flame. The guides the dissent sets
out, post, at 424-425, nn. 2 and 3--court rules and agency regulations--
address only what the applicant must plead, not the question of time presented here.

that currently exis[t] require that the burden of proof rest
with the Government.").Congress did not, however, want the "substantially justified" standard to "be read to raise a presumption that theGovernment position was not substantially justified simply
because it lost the case . . . ." Ibid. By allocating the burden of pleading "that the position of the United States was
not substantially justified"--and that burden only--to the fee
applicant, Congress apparently sought to dispel any assumption that the Government must pay fees each time it loses.
Complementarily, the no-substantial-justification-allegation
requirement serves to ward off irresponsible litigation, i. e.,
unreasonable or capricious fee-shifting demands. As counsel for the Government stated at oral argument, allocating
the pleading burden to fee applicants obliges them "to examine the Government's position and make a determination . . .
whether it is substantially justified or not." Tr. of Oral Arg.
31; see id., at 19 (petitioner recognizes that "the purpose
of this allegation [is to make] a lawyer think twice"). So
understood, the applicant's burden to plead that the Government's position "was not substantially justified" is akin to the
signature requirement in Becker and the oath or affirmation
requirement in Edelman.

In Becker, a pro se litigant had typed, but had neglected
to hand sign, his name, as required by Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 11(a), on his timely filed notice of appeal. 532
U. S., at 760-761, 763; see supra, at 411-412. Although we
called the rules on the timing and content of notices of appeal
"linked jurisdictional provisions," Becker, 532 U. S., at 765
(referring to Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3 and 4), we concluded

541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
416 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPI

Opinion of the Court
that a litigant could add the signature required by Rule 11(a)even after the time for filing the notice had expired, 532

U. S., at 766-767. Rule 11(a), we observed, provides that"omission of the signature" on any "pleading, written motion,
[or] other paper" may be "corrected promptly after beingcalled to the attention of the attorney or party." See 532
U. S., at 764. Permitting a late signature to perfect an appeal, we explained, was hardly pathbreaking, for "[o]theropinions of this Court are in full harmony with the view that

imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal whereno genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what
judgment, to which appellate court." Id., at 767-768 (citing
Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 245, 248-249 (1992), and
Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 181 (1962)).

The next Term, in Edelman, we described our decision in
Becker as having allowed "relation back" of the late signature to the timely filed notice of appeal. 535 U. S., at 116.
Edelman involved an EEOC regulation permitting a Title
VII discrimination charge timely filed with the agency to
be amended, outside the charge-filing period, to include an
omitted, but required, verification. Id., at 109; see supra,
at 411. "There is no reason," we observed in sustaining the
regulation, "to think that relation back of the oath here is
any less reasonable than relation back of the signature in
Becker. Both are aimed at stemming the urge to litigate
irresponsibly . . . ." 535 U. S., at 116.

Becker and Edelman inform our judgment in this case.
Like the signature and verification requirements, EAJA's
ten-word "not substantially justified" allegation is a "think
twice" prescription that "stem[s] the urge to litigate irresponsibly," Edelman, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, the
allegation functions to shift the burden to the Government
to prove that its position in the underlying litigation "was
substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(A). We note, too, that
the allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the Government is aware, from the moment a fee appli541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

417Cite as: 541 U. S. 401 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
cation is filed, that to defeat the application on the merits, itwill have to prove its position "was substantially justified."

As Becker indicates, the lapse here "should not be fatalwhere no genuine doubt exists about who is app[lying] [for
fees], from what judgment, to which . . . court." 532 U. S.,at 767. Moreover, because Scarborough's lawyer's statutory
contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by an
EAJA award, see 38 U. S. C. $ 5904(d)(1); Fee Agreements,note following 28 U. S. C. $ 2412, allowing the curative

amendment benefits the complainant directly, and is notfairly described as simply a boon for his counsel. Permitting amendment thus advances Congress' purpose, in enacting EAJA, to reduce the "emphasi[s], virtually to the exclusion of all other issues, [on] the cost of potential litigation" in
a party's decision whether to challenge unjust governmental
action. H. R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 7.

The Government, however, maintains that the relationback regime, as now codified in Rule 15(c) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, is out of place in this context, for
that Rule governs "pleadings," a term that does not encompass fee applications. Brief for Respondent 21; see Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2) (permitting relation back of amendments to pleadings when "the claim or defense asserted in
the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction,
or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the
original [timely filed] pleading"). See also Rule 7(a) (enumerating permitted "pleadings"). Scarborough acknowledges that Rule 15(c) itself is directed to federal district
court "pleadings," but urges that this Court has approved
application of the relation-back doctrine in analogous settings. Brief for Petitioner 28. Most recently, as just related, we applied the doctrine in Becker and Edelman to,
respectively, a notice of appeal and an EEOC discrimination
charge, neither of which is a "pleading" under the Federal
Rules. As the Government concedes, moreover, see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 35-36, "relation back" was not an invention of the

Opinion of the Court
federal rulemakers. We applied the doctrine well before1938, the year the Federal Rules became effective. See,

e. g., New York Central & Hudson River R. Co. v. Kinney,260 U. S. 340, 346 (1922); Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Renn,
241 U. S. 290, 293-294 (1916); Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v.Wulf, 226 U. S. 570, 575-576 (1913). With a view to thenexisting practice, the original Rules Advisory Committee de-scribed "relation back" as "a well recognized doctrine." Advisory Committee's 1937 Note on Subd. (c) of Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 15, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 686. Commentators have observed that the doctrine Rule 15(c) embraces "has its rootsin the former federal equity practice and a number of state
codes." 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 1496, p. 64 (2d ed. 1990).

The relation-back doctrine, we accordingly hold, properlyguides our determination that Scarborough's fee application

could be amended, after the 30-day filing period, to includethe "not substantially justified" allegation: The amended application "arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrenceset forth or attempted to be set forth" in the initial applica5 See, e. g., Fed. Equity Rule 19 (1912) ("The court may at any time, in
furtherance of justice, upon such terms as may be just, permit any process,
proceeding, pleading or record to be amended, or material supplemental
matter to be set forth in an amended or supplemental pleading. The
court, at every stage of the proceeding, must disregard any error or defect
in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties."); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, $$ 170(1)-(2) (Smith-Hurd 1935) ("At any time
before final judgment in a civil action, amendments may be allowed . . . in
any process, pleading or proceedings . . . . The cause of action, cross
demand or defense set up in any amended pleading shall not be barred by,

the original pleading was filed, and if . . . the amended pleading grew out
of the same transaction or occurrence set up in the original pleading . . . .");

tion. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2). Just as failure initiallyto verify a charge or sign a "pleading, written motion, [or]

other paper," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a), was not fatal to thepetitioners' cases in Edelman and Becker, so here, counsel's
initial omission of the assertion that the Government's posi-tion lacked substantial justification is not beyond repair.

C
The Government insists most strenuously that $ 2412'swaiver of sovereign immunity from liability for fees is condi6 Scarborough also urges that, regardless of the availability of "relation
back," $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s 30-day deadline does not apply to the nosubstantial-justification-allegation requirement. Brief for Petitioner 36-
39. In support, Scarborough points out that Congress easily could have
placed the allegation requirement in the first sentence of $ 2412(d)(1)(B),
together with the 30-day deadline and the other application-content specifications. Congress' decision, instead, to set forth the allegation requirement in a separate, second sentence, which contains no time limitation,
Scarborough asserts, is significant. Id., at 39. Moreover, Scarborough
contends, the fact that $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s second sentence is structured differently from the section's first sentence (requiring the "party" to "allege,"
rather than directing "the application" to "sho[w]") further indicates that
Congress viewed the "not substantially justified" allegation as separate
from the fee application's requirements more closely linked to the filing
deadline. Id., at 38. We do not think that this question, as the Government suggests, was answered in Commissioner, INS v. Jean, 496 U. S. 154
(1990). See Brief for Respondent 15, 24; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28, 45. In Jean,
we held that a party who prevails in fee litigation under EAJA may recover fees for legal services rendered during the fee litigation even if some
of the Government's positions regarding the proper fee were "substantially justified," i. e., the district court need not make a second finding of
no substantial justification before awarding fees for the fee contest itself.
496 U. S., at 160-162. The sentence in Jean on which the Government
relies, stating that "[a] fee application must contain an allegation `that the
position of the United States was not substantially justified,' " id., at 160,
like Jean's holding, did not concern the timing question we here confront.
In any event, because our decision rests on the applicability of the
relation-back doctrine, we do not further explore the debatable question
whether $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s 30-day deadline even applies to the "not substantially justified" allegation requirement.

tioned on the fee applicant's meticulous compliance with each
and every requirement of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) within 30 days of
final judgment. Brief for Respondent 18-19; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 28, 31; see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991)
("EAJA renders the United States liable for attorney's fees
for which it would otherwise not be liable, and thus amounts
to a partial waiver of sovereign immunity."). In the Government's view, a failure to allege that the position of the
United States "was not substantially justified" before the
30-day clock has run is as fatal as an omission of any other

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) specification. Brief for Respondent 15; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 45.7

We observe, first, that the Federal Circuit's reading of

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) is not as unyielding as the Government's. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that a fee application may
be amended, out of time, to show that the applicant "is eligible to receive an award," $ 2412(d)(1)(B). See Bazalo, 150
F. 3d, at 1383-1384 (amendment made after 30-day filing period cured failure initially to establish that fee applicant's net
worth did not exceed $2 million). As earlier noted, see
supra, at 412, the dissenting judge in Scarborough's case
found Bazalo indistinguishable. 319 F. 3d, at 1355-1356
(opinion of Mayer, C. J.).

Our decisions in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,
498 U. S. 89 (1990), and Franconia Associates v. United
States, 536 U. S. 129 (2002), are enlightening on this issue.
Irwin involved an untimely filed Title VII employment discrimination complaint against the Government. Although
the petitioner had missed the filing deadline, we held that
Title VII's statutory time limits are subject to equitable

7 The question whether a fee application may be amended after the 30-
day filing period to cure an initial failure to make the "show[ings]" set
forth in the first sentence of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) is not before us. We offer no
view on the applicability of "relation back" in that situation.

tolling, even against the Government. 498 U. S., at 95.8Similarly, in Franconia, we rejected an "unduly restrictive"

construction of the statute of limitations for claims filedagainst the United States under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1491. See 536 U. S., at 145 (internal quotation marks andbrackets omitted); ibid. (refusing to adopt "special accrual
rule" for commencement of limitations period against theGovernment).

In those decisions, we recognized that "limitations princi-ples should generally apply to the Government `in the same
way that' they apply to private parties." Ibid. (quoting
Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95). Once Congress waives sovereignimmunity, we observed, judicial application of a time prescription to suits against the Government, in the same waythe prescription is applicable to private suits, "amounts
to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver."Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95. We further stated in Irwin that
holding the Government responsible "is likely to be a realis-tic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically
useful principle of interpretation." Ibid.9The Government nevertheless maintains that

Irwin andFranconia do not bear on this case, for "[$] 2412(d) author8 Although we held that equitable tolling could be applied in Title VII
claims against the Government, we further determined that the doctrine's
requirements were not met on the specific facts of Irwin. The Irwin petitioner's excuse for the late complaint--his lawyer's absence from the office
when the EEOC notice that triggered the complaint-filing deadline was
received--ranked "at best [as] a garden variety claim of excusable neglect." 498 U. S., at 96. In this case, we note, the Government extensively argues against recourse to Irwin's "rebuttable presumption" that
equitable tolling is available in litigation Congress has authorized against
the United States. Id., at 95; see Brief for Respondent 32-41. Because
our decision rests on other grounds, we express no opinion on the applicability of equitable tolling in the circumstances here presented.

9 Indeed, in enacting EAJA, Congress expressed its belief that "at a

Opinion of the Court
izes fee awards against the government under rules thathave no analogue in private litigation." Brief for Respondent 39. But it is hardly clear that Irwin demands a preciseprivate analogue. Litigation against the United States exists because Congress has enacted legislation creating rightsagainst the Government, often in matters peculiar to the
Government's engagements with private persons--matters
such as the administration of benefit programs. Becausemany statutes that create claims for relief against the United

States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants,
Irwin's reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable privatelitigation equivalent.

In any event, $ 2412(d) is analogous to other fee-shifting
provisions abrogating the general rule that each party to a
lawsuit pays his own legal fees. The provision resembles
"prevailing party" fee-shifting statutes that are applicable
to suits between private litigants. See, e. g., 15 U. S. C.

$ 1692k(a)(3) (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act); 29 U. S. C.

$ 2617(a)(3) (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993); 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(k) (Title VII); cf. Franconia, 536 U. S., at
145 (comparing Tucker Act statute of limitations to "contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties [that] also tie the commencement of
the limitations period to the date a claim `first accrues' ").

We note, finally, that the Government has never argued
that it will be prejudiced if Scarborough's "not substantially
justified" allegation is permitted to relate back to his timely
filed fee application. Moreover, a showing of prejudice
should preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in the
first place. See Singleton, 231 F. 3d, at 858 ("The interests
of the government and the courts will be served, however,
if district courts are empowered to . . . outright deny a request to supplement [a fee application] if the government
would be prejudiced."). In addition, EAJA itself has a
built-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A) disallows fees where

"special circumstances make an award unjust." See H. R.
Rep. No. 96-1418, p. 11 (1980) ($ 2412(d)(1)(A)'s "safety valve"
gives "the court discretion to deny awards where equitable
considerations dictate an award should not be made"). Our
conclusion that a timely filed EAJA fee application may
be amended, out of time, to allege "that the position of

the Uni ted St ates was not subst antia l ly justified,"

$ 2412(d)(1)(B), therefore will not expose the Government to
any unfair imposition.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

Without deciding that the statutorily mandated 30-day
deadline "even applies to the `not substantially justified' allegation requirement," ante, at 419, n. 6, the Court, nonetheless, applies the relation-back doctrine to cure the omitted
no-substantial-justification allegation in petitioner's Equal
Access to Justice Act (EAJA) fee application. The Court
should have first addressed whether, as a textual matter, the
no-substantial-justification allegation must be made within
the 30-day deadline. I conclude that it must. The question then becomes whether the judicial application of the
relation-back doctrine is appropriate in a case such as this
where the statute defines the scope of the Government's
waiver of sovereign immunity. Because there is no express
allowance for relation back in EAJA, I conclude that the sovereign immunity canon applies to construe strictly the scope
of the Government's waiver. The Court reaches its holding
today by distorting the scope of Irwin v. Department of Vet541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

erans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89 (1990), and by eviscerating thatcase's doctrinal underpinnings.

I
In my view, the better reading of the text of the statuteis that the 30-day deadline applies to the no-substantialjustification-allegation requirement. The first sentence of28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B) states that "[a] party seeking an
award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days offinal judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees . . . which shows": (1) the applicant's status as aprevailing party; (2) that the applicant is eligible to receive
fees under $ 2412(d)(2)(B); and (3) the itemized amountsought. The second sentence of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) provides:
"The party shall also allege that the position of the UnitedStates was not substantially justified."

Ibid. In statingthat the applicant "shall also" make the no-substantialjustification allegation, the second sentence links the allega-tion requirement with the timing and other content requirements of the first sentence.1 Indeed, there is only onedeadline expressly contained in the provision. That 30-
day deadline imposes a limitation on a set of requirementsthat petitioner must satisfy in order to receive an EAJA
fee award. Immediately following the deadline is anothersentence that requires the petitioner to make the nosubstantial-justification allegation. Taking the provision asa whole, it is quite natural to read it as applying the 30-day
deadline to all of its requirements.2 And, this reading is

tion becomes whether the relation-back doctrine shouldapply here. The EAJA requirement for filing a timely fee

application with the statutorily prescribed content is a condi-tion on the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity in

$ 2412(d)(1)(A). See Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137(1991). As such, the scope of the waiver must be strictly
construed. See, e. g., Irwin, 498 U. S., at 94; United States
v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (stating that awaiver of sovereign immunity "must be construed strictly in

favor of the sovereign" and "not enlarge[d] . . . beyond whatthe language requires" (internal quotation marks omitted));
Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 318 (1986) (same);
Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 161 (1981) ("[L]imitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to
be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto
are not to be implied" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Since the relation-back doctrine relied upon by the Court is
not present in the text of the statute, under a simple application of the sovereign immunity canon, petitioner is not
entitled to "relate-back" his allegation beyond the 30-day
deadline.

The only way the Court avoids this straightforward conclusion is by applying Irwin. Ante, at 420-422. Although
Irwin does perhaps narrow the scope of the sovereign immunity canon, it does so only in limited circumstances. In particular, where the Government is made subject to suit to the
same extent and in the same manner as private parties are,
Irwin holds that the Government is subject to the rules that
are "applicable to private suits." 498 U. S., at 95. The
Court in Irwin, addressing equitable tolling, explained that
"[t]ime requirements in lawsuits between private litigants
are customarily subject to `equitable tolling,' " and that
"[o]nce Congress has made . . . a waiver [of sovereign immunity], . . . making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to
suits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable to private suits, amounts to little, if any, broadening

of the congressional waiver." Ibid. The Court determinedthat "[s]uch a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment

of legislative intent as well as a practically useful principleof interpretation." Ibid.

Notwithstanding Irwin's limited scope, the Court con-cludes: "Irwin's reasoning would be diminished were it
instructive only in situations with a readily identifiableprivate-litigation equivalent."

Ante, at 422. The existenceof this "private-litigation equivalent," however, formed the

very basis for the Court's holding in Irwin.I agree with the Government that there is "no analogue in
private litigation," Brief for Respondent 39, for the EAJAfee awards at issue here. Section 2412(d) authorizes fee
awards against the Government when there is no basis forrecovery under the rules for private litigation.

5 Irwin's

analysis simply cannot apply to a proceeding against theGovernment when there is no analogue for it in private litigation. Accordingly, I would apply the sovereign immunitycanon to construe strictly the scope of the Government's
waiver and, therefore, against allowing an applicant to avoidthe express statutory limitation through judicial application
of the relation-back doctrine. For these reasons, I respect-fully dissent.

5 Compare 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(A) ("Except as otherwise specifically
provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than
the United States fees and other expenses . . . incurred by that party in
any civil action . . . brought by or against the United States in any court
having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position
of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust") with $ 2412(b) ("The United States shall
be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other
party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any
statute which specifically provides for such an award").

JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the sureme court of california

No. 03-6539. Argued March 30, 2004--Decided May 3, 2004
In reversing petitioner's conviction, the California Court of Appeal held

that he was entitled to relief under California v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d
258, 583 P. 2d 748, and Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, but did not
determine whether his separate evidentiary and prosecutorial misconduct claims would independently support the conviction's reversal. The
State Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim in reversing and remanding the case for further proceedings.

$ 1257. The instant case falls outside of the exceptional categories of
cases that can be regarded as "final" under $ 1257 despite the ordering
of further proceedings. Because compliance with $ 1257 is an essential
prerequisite to this Court's deciding a case's merits, the Court has an
obligation to raise any such compliance question on its own. However,
the Court is not always successful in policing this gatekeeping function
without counsel's aid. Part of the problem here was that the portion of
the State Court of Appeal's decision certified for publication addressed
the Wheeler/Batson claim, but the unpublished portion addressed petitioner's evidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court on
retrial. Petitioner appended only the opinion's published portion to his
certiorari petition. Had the full opinion been brought to this Court's
attention, it might have been more evident that the State Supreme
Court's decision was not final under $ 1257. Attention to whether a
decision is indeed a "[f]inal judgmen[t]" is mandated by this Court's
Rules and will avoid expenditure of resources of both counsel and the

"where the federal issue has been finally decided in the
state courts with further proceedings pending in whichthe party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessaryreview of the federal issue by this Court, and where
reversal of the state court on the federal issue would bepreclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause
of action rather than merely controlling the nature and
character of, or determining the admissibility of evi-dence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these

circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review thestate-court decision might seriously erode federal policy,
the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue,which itself has been finally determined by the state
courts for purposes of the state litigation." Id., at482-483.

Here, petitioner can make no convincing claim of erosion offederal policy that is not common to all decisions rejecting a
defendant's Batson claim. The fourth category thereforedoes not apply. See

Florida v. Thomas, 532 U. S. 774, 780

Court of Appeal on remand affirms the judgment of convic-tion, petitioner could once more seek review of his

Compliance with the provisions of $ 1257 is an essentialprerequisite to our deciding the merits of a case brought here
under that section. It is our obligation to raise any question

Part of the problem was that the California Court of Appeal's decision was certified by that court for partial publication. It addressed the Wheeler/Batson claim in the published portion. 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). In the
unpublished portion, the court briefly addressed petitioner's
evidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court on
retrial, and noted that it would not address whether petitioner's objections were properly preserved or consider petitioner's prosecutorial misconduct claim. App. 58. Petitioner
appended only the published portion of the California Court
of Appeal's decision to his petition for a writ of certiorari.
This Court's Rule 14.1(i) instructs petitioners to include,

the appendix to the petition for certiorari. The full opinion
of the California Court of Appeal was not filed in this Court
until the joint appendix to the briefs on the merits was filed.
App. 58-112. Had the full opinion been brought to this

the Supreme Court of California's decision was not final for
the purposes of $ 1257.

that it has jurisdiction to review the judgment. This

MIDDLETON, WARDEN v. McNEIL
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 03-1028. Decided May 3, 2004
Respondent was charged with murdering her husband after an argument.

Under California law, the malice element needed for a murder conviction
is negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril. If that fear is
unreasonable but genuine, California's "imperfect self-defense" doctrine
reduces the crime to voluntary manslaughter. The voluntary manslaughter jury instruction in this case erroneously defined imminent
peril, but the prosecutor's closing statement correctly stated the law.
Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder. In affirming, the
California Court of Appeal acknowledged the erroneous instruction, but
found that the instructions as a whole and the prosecutor's argument
made the correct standard clear. The Federal District Court later denied respondent federal habeas relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.

Held: The Ninth Circuit erred in finding that the erroneous instruction

eliminated respondent's imperfect self-defense claim and that the state
appellate court unreasonably applied federal law by ignoring the unchallenged and uncorrected instruction. A state prisoner is entitled to federal habeas relief if a state court's adjudication of his constitutional
claim was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). When a jury
instruction fails to give effect to the requirement that a State prove
every element of a criminal offense, the question is whether the instruction so infected the entire trial that the conviction violates due process.
Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72. Here, the question is whether
there is a " `reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the . . . [ambiguous] instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Ibid.
Given that there were three correct instructions and one contrary one,
the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it found no
reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled by the erroneous instruction. Though the Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying
on the prosecutor's argument, nothing in Boyde v. California, 494 U. S.
370, precludes a state court from assuming that counsel's arguments
clarified an ambiguous jury charge, particularly when they resolve the
ambiguity in the defendant's favor.

Certiorari granted; 344 F. 3d 988, reversed and remanded.

434 MIDDLETON v. McNEIL

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.

I

Respondent Sally Marie McNeil killed her husband after
an argument over his infidelity and spending habits. The
State of California charged her with murder. Respondent's
theory at trial was that her husband had tried to strangle
her during the argument, but that she had escaped, fetched
a shotgun from the bedroom, and killed him out of fear for
her life. Fingernail marks were indeed found on her neck
after the shooting. She testified that her husband had been
abusive, and a defense expert opined that she suffered from
Battered Women's Syndrome. The State countered with forensic evidence showing that the fingernail marks were not
her husband's and may have been self-inflicted, and with the
testimony of a 911 operator who overheard respondent tell
her husband she had shot him because she would no longer
tolerate his behavior.

Under California law, "[m]urder is the unlawful killing of
a human being . . . with malice aforethought." Cal. Penal
Code Ann. $ 187(a) (West 1999). The element of malice is
negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril. In re
Christian S., 7 Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P. 2d 574, 576 (1994).
Where that fear is unreasonable (but nevertheless genuine),
it reduces the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter--a doctrine known as "imperfect self-defense." Ibid.
At respondent's trial, the judge instructed the jury on these
concepts as follows:

" `The specific intent for voluntary manslaughter, as
opposed to murder, must arise upon one of [the] following circumstances:. . . . .

" `[A]n honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity
to defend oneself against imminent peril to life or great
bodily injury. That would be imperfect self-defense.. . . . .

Per Curiam
" `To establish that a killing is murder [and] not manslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt each of the elements of murder and
that the act which caused the death was not done . . .
in the honest, even though unreasonable, belief in the
necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or to
great bodily injury.. . . . .

" `A person, who kills another person in the actual but
unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against
imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, kills unlawfully, but is not guilty of murder. This would be so even
though a reasonable person in the same situation, seeing
and knowing the same facts, would not have had the
same belief. Such an actual but unreasonable belief is
not a defense to the crime of voluntary manslaughter.

" `An "imminent" peril is one that is apparent, present,
immediate and must be instantly dealt with, or must so
appear at the time to the slayer as a reasonable person.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-33.

The last four words of this instruction--" `as a reasonable
person' "--are not part of the relevant form instruction,
1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 5.17 (6th ed.
1996), and were apparently included in error. The prosecutor's closing argument, however, correctly stated the law.

Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder and
appealed on the basis of the erroneous jury instruction. The
California Court of Appeal acknowledged the error but upheld her conviction, reasoning:

"[R]eversal is not required because `[e]rror cannot be
predicated upon an isolated phrase, sentence or excerpt
from the instructions since the correctness of an instruction is to be determined in its relation to the other instructions and in light of the instructions as a whole.'

Per Curiam
Here, when all of the jury instructions on voluntarymanslaughter and imperfect self-defense, are considered

in their entirety, it is not reasonably likely that the jurywould have misunderstood the requirements of the imperfect self-defense component of voluntary manslaugh-ter. On the contrary, these instructions repeatedly informed the jury that if the defendant had an honest (or
actual) but unreasonable belief in the need to act inself-defense, then the offense would be manslaughter

and the defendant could not be convicted of murder.Furthermore, in arguing to the jury, the prosecutor set
forth the appropriate standard, stating `[i]f you believeit is an imperfect self-defense, that she actually believed
but that a reasonable person would not believe in thenecessity for self-defense, that lessens the crime to what
is called, "voluntary manslaughter." ' " App. to Pet. forCert. 33-34 (citations omitted).

Respondent then sought federal habeas relief. The Dis-trict Court denied her petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 344 F. 3d 988 (2003). We now grant the State's pe-tition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.

A federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner
if a state court's adjudication of his constitutional claim was
"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).
"Where, as here, the state court's application of governing
federal law is challenged, it must be shown to be not only
erroneous, but objectively unreasonable." Yarborough v.
Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 5 (2003) (per curiam); see Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000).

In a criminal trial, the State must prove every element of
the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it
fails to give effect to that requirement. See Sandstrom v.
Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 520-521 (1979). Nonetheless, not
every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation. The
question is " `whether the ailing instruction . . . so infected
the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due
process.' " Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)). " `[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall
charge.' " Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 378 (1990)
(quoting Cupp, supra, at 146-147). If the charge as a whole
is ambiguous, the question is whether there is a " `reasonable
likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Estelle,
supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).

The Ninth Circuit held that the erroneous imminent-peril
instruction "eliminated" respondent's imperfect self-defense
claim, and that the state court unreasonably applied federal
law by "completely ignor[ing] unchallenged and uncorrected
instructions to the jury." 344 F. 3d, at 999. It acknowledged that it was bound to consider the jury charge as a
whole, but held that the other instructions were irrelevant
because "[t]he only time that the trial judge actually defined
imminent peril for the jury was in the erroneous instruction
on imperfect self-defense." Id., at 997.

This conclusion failed to give appropriate deference to the
state court's decision. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's description, the state court did not "ignor[e]" the faulty instruction. It merely held that the instruction was not reasonably likely to have misled the jury given the multiple
other instances (at least three, see supra, at 434-435) where
the charge correctly stated that respondent's belief could be

541US2 Unit: $U45 [05-08-06 20:38:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
438 MIDDLETON v. McNEIL

Per Curiam
unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34. Given three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court did
not unreasonably apply federal law when it found that there
was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.

The Ninth Circuit thought that the other references to unreasonableness were irrelevant because they were not part
of the definition of "imminent peril." That alone does not
make them irrelevant; whether one defines imminent peril in
terms of an unreasonable belief or instead describes imperfect self-defense as allowing an unreasonable belief in imminent peril, the import of the instruction is the same. Perhaps the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the erroneous definition
of "imminent peril" caused the jury to believe that the earlier, correct instructions ("actual but unreasonable belief in
the necessity to defend against imminent peril") meant that,
although the belief in the necessity to defend may be unreasonable, the belief in the existence of the "imminent peril"
may not. This interpretation would require such a rare
combination of extremely refined lawyerly parsing of an instruction, and extremely gullible acceptance of a result that
makes no conceivable sense, that the state court's implicit
rejection of the possibility was surely not an unreasonable
application of federal law.

The Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying
on the prosecutor's argument, noting that instructions from
a judge are presumed to have more influence than arguments
of counsel. 344 F. 3d, at 999 (citing Boyde, supra, at 384).
But this is not a case where the jury charge clearly says one
thing and the prosecutor says the opposite; the instructions
were at worst ambiguous because they were internally inconsistent. Nothing in Boyde precludes a state court from
assuming that counsel's arguments clarified an ambiguous
jury charge. This assumption is particularly apt when it is
the prosecutor's argument that resolves an ambiguity in
favor of the defendant.

TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCECORPORATION

v. HOOD

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-1606. Argued March 1, 2004--Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent Hood had an outstanding balance on student loans guaranteed

by petitioner Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC), a
state entity, at the time she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.
Hood's general discharge did not cover her student loans, as she did not
list them and they are only dischargeable if a bankruptcy court determines that excepting the debt from the order would be an "undue hardship" on the debtor, 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(8). Hood subsequently reopened
the petition, seeking an "undue hardship" determination. As prescribed by Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7001(6), 7003, and
7004, she filed a complaint and, later, an amended complaint, and served
them with a summons on TSAC and others. The Bankruptcy Court
denied TSAC's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,
holding that 11 U. S. C. $ 106(a) abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. The Sixth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate
Panel affirmed, as did the Sixth Circuit, which held that the Bankruptcy
Clause gave Congress the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity in $ 106(a). This Court granted certiorari to determine whether
the Bankruptcy Clause grants Congress such authority.

Held: Because the Bankruptcy Court's discharge of a student loan debt

does not implicate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity, this
Court does not reach the question on which certiorari was granted.
Pp. 446-455.

(a) States may be bound by some judicial actions without their consent. For example, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over in rem admiralty actions when the State does not possess
the res. California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523 U. S. 491, 507-508.
A debt's discharge by a bankruptcy court is similarly an in rem proceeding. The court has exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor's property,
wherever located, and over the estate. Once debts are discharged, a
creditor who did not submit a proof of claim will be unable to collect on
his unsecured loans. A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtor
a fresh start, even if all of his creditors do not participate, because the
court's jurisdiction is premised on the debtor and his estate, not on the
creditors. Because the court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipating creditor cannot be personally liable. States,

Syllabus
whether or not they choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound
by a bankruptcy court's discharge order no less than other creditors,
see, e. g., New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329, 333. And when
the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the res is unquestioned, the
exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge the debt does not infringe
a State's sovereignty. TSAC argues, however, that the individualized
process by which student loan debts are discharged unconstitutionally
infringes its sovereignty. If a debtor does not affirmatively secure

$ 523(a)(8)'s "undue hardship" determination, States choosing not to submit themselves to the court's jurisdiction might receive some benefit:
The debtor's personal liability on the loan may survive the discharge.
TSAC misunderstands the proceeding's fundamental nature when it
claims that Congress, by making a student loan debt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out for an individualized determination,
has authorized a suit against a State. The bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, not the persona; that States were granted
the presumptive benefit of nondischargeability does not alter the court's
underlying authority. A debtor does not seek damages or affirmative
relief from a State or subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial
process by seeking to discharge his debts. Indeed, this Court has endorsed individual determinations of States' interests within the federal
courts' in rem jurisdiction, e. g., Deep Sea Research, supra. Although
bankruptcy and admiralty are specialized areas of the law, there is no
reason why the exercise of federal courts' in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction is more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise of their
in rem admiralty jurisdiction. Pp. 446-451.

(b) With regard to the procedure used in this case, the Bankruptcy
Rules require a debtor to file an adversary proceeding against the State
to discharge student loan debts. While this is part of the original bankruptcy case and within the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction, it
requires the service of a summons and a complaint, see Rules 7001(6),
7003, and 7004. The issuance of process is normally an indignity to a
State's sovereignty, because its purpose is to establish personal jurisdiction; but the court's in rem jurisdiction allows it to adjudicate the debtors' discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State.
Section 523(a)(8) does not require a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6)
a debtor could proceed by motion, which would raise no constitutional
concern. There is no reason why service of a summons, which in this
case is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should be
given dispositive weight. Dismissal of the complaint is not appropriate
here where the court has in rem jurisdiction and has not attempted to
adjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction. This case is unlike
an adversary proceeding by a bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover

property in the State's hands on the grounds that the transfer was a
voidable preference. Even if this Court were to hold that Congress
lacked the ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, the Bankruptcy Court would still have authority to make
the undue hardship determination Hood seeks. Thus, this Court declines to decide whether a bankruptcy court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would be valid under the Eleventh Amendment.
If the Bankruptcy Court on remand exceeds its in rem jurisdiction,
TSAC would be free to challenge the court's authority. Pp. 451-455.

Court.

Article I, $ 8, cl. 4, of the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power "[t]o establish . . . uniform Laws
on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United
States." We granted certiorari to determine whether this
Clause grants Congress the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity from private suits. Because we conclude
that a proceeding initiated by a debtor to determine the dischargeability of a student loan debt is not a suit against the
State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, we affirm
the Court of Appeals' judgment, and we do not reach the
question on which certiorari was granted.

grams. Tenn. Code Ann. $ 49-4-201 (2002). TSAC guaran-tees student loans made to residents of Tennessee and to

nonresidents who are either enrolled in an eligible school inTennessee or make loans through an approved Tennessee
lender. $ 49-4-203.Between July 1988 and February 1990, respondent, Pamela
Hood, a resident of Tennessee, signed promissory notes foreducational loans guaranteed by TSAC. In February 1999,
Hood filed a "no asset" Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in theUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
Tennessee; at the time of the filing, her student loans had anoutstanding balance of $4,169.31. TSAC did not participate
in the proceeding, but Sallie Mae Service, Inc. (Sallie Mae),submitted a proof of claim to the Bankruptcy Court, which
it subsequently assigned to TSAC.1 The Bankruptcy Courtgranted Hood a general discharge in June 1999. See 11
U. S. C. $ 727(a).Hood did not list her student loans in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the general discharge did not cover them. See$ 727(b) (providing that a discharge under $ 727(a) discharges
the debtor from all prepetition debts except as listed in$ 523(a)); $ 523(a)(8) (providing that student loans guaranteed
by governmental units are not included in a general dis-charge order unless the bankruptcy court determines that
excepting the debt from the order would impose an "unduehardship" on the debtor). In September 1999, Hood reopened her bankruptcy petition for the limited purpose ofseeking a determination by the Bankruptcy Court that her
student loans were dischargeable as an "undue hardship"pursuant to $ 523(a)(8). As prescribed by the Federal Rules

each of the named parties. See Rule 7004.In response, TSAC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint
for lack of jurisdiction, asserting Eleventh Amendment sov-ereign immunity.

2 The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion, holding that 11 U. S. C. $ 106(a) was a valid abrogationof TSAC's sovereign immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-62.

TSAC took an interlocutory appeal, see Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S.139, 147 (1993), and a unanimous Bankruptcy Appellate Panel

of the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 262 B. R. 412 (2001). TSACappealed the panel's decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. That court affirmed, holdingthat the States ceded their immunity from private suits in
bankruptcy in the Constitutional Convention, and therefore,the Bankruptcy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 4, provided Congress with the necessary authority to abrogatestate sovereign immunity in 11 U. S. C. $ 106(a). 319 F. 3d
755, 767 (2003). One judge concurred in the judgment, con-cluding that TSAC waived its sovereign immunity when it
accepted Sallie Mae's proof of claim.3 Id., at 768. Wegranted certiorari, 539 U. S. 986 (2003), and now affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals. Because we hold that abankruptcy court's discharge of a student loan debt does not
implicate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity, we donot reach the broader question addressed by the Court of
Appeals.

2 Hood does not dispute that TSAC is considered a "State" for purposes
of the Eleventh Amendment.

3 Hood does not argue in this Court that TSAC waived its sovereign

immunity, and we pass no judgment on the question.

Opinion of the Court

II
By its terms, the Eleventh Amendment precludes suits "inlaw or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the

United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens orSubjects of any Foreign State." For over a century, however, we have recognized that the States' sovereign immu-nity is not limited to the literal terms of the Eleventh
Amendment. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890).Although the text of the Amendment refers only to suits
against a State by citizens of another State, we have repeat-edly held that an unconsenting State also is immune from
suits by its own citizens. See, e. g., id., at 15; Duhne v. NewJersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920); Great Northern Life Ins.
Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944); Employees of Dept. ofPublic Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public
Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 280 (1973); Edel-man v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 662-663 (1974); Seminole Tribe
of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55 (1996).States, nonetheless, may still be bound by some judicial
actions without their consent. In California v. Deep SeaResearch, Inc., 523 U. S. 491 (1998), we held that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over inrem admiralty actions when the State is not in possession of
the property. In that case, a private corporation located ahistoric shipwreck, the S. S.

Brother Jonathan, in Califor-nia's territorial waters. The corporation filed an in rem action in federal court seeking rights to the wreck and itscargo. The State of California intervened, arguing that it
possessed title to the wreck and that its sovereign immunityprecluded the court from adjudicating its rights. While acknowledging that the Eleventh Amendment might constrainfederal courts' admiralty jurisdiction in some instances, id.,

II); Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458U. S. 670 (1982)), we held that the States' sovereign immu541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nity did not prohibit in rem admiralty actions in which theState did not possess the res, 523 U. S., at 507-508 (citing

e. g., The Davis, 10 Wall. 15 (1870); The Pesaro, 255 U. S.216 (1921)).

The discharge of a debt by a bankruptcy court is similarlyan

in rem proceeding. See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S.
565, 574 (1947); Straton v. New, 283 U. S. 318, 320-321 (1931);
Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 192 (1902); New
Lamp Chimney Co. v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 91 U. S.
656, 662 (1876). Bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdic-tion over a debtor's property, wherever located, and over

the estate. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(e). In a typical voluntary
bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 7, the debtor files a
petition for bankruptcy in which he lists his debts or his
creditors, Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 1007(a)(1); the petition
constitutes an order for relief, 11 U. S. C. $ 301. The court
clerk notifies the debtor's creditors of the order for relief,
see Rule 2002(l), and if a creditor wishes to participate in
the debtor's assets, he files a proof of claim, Rule 3002(a); see
11 U. S. C. $ 726. If a creditor chooses not to submit a proof
of claim, once the debts are discharged, the creditor will be
unable to collect on his unsecured loans. Rule 3002(a); see
11 U. S. C. $ 726. The discharge order releases a debtor
from personal liability with respect to any discharged debt
by voiding any past or future judgments on the debt and by
operating as an injunction to prohibit creditors from attempting to collect or to recover the debt. $$ 524(a)(1), (2);
3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice 2d $ 48:1, p. 48-3
(1998) (hereinafter Norton).

A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtor a fresh
start in this manner, despite the lack of participation of all
of his creditors, because the court's jurisdiction is premised
on the debtor and his estate, and not on the creditors. In re
Collins, 173 F. 3d 924, 929 (CA4 1999) ("A federal court's
jurisdiction over the dischargeability of debt . . . derives not

from jurisdiction over debtors and their estates" (internalquotation marks omitted)); see also Gardner, supra, at 572;

In re Ellett, 254 F. 3d 1135, 1141 (CA9 2001); Texas v. Walker,142 F. 3d 813, 822 (CA5 1998). A bankruptcy court's in rem
jurisdiction permits it to "determin[e] all claims that any-one, whether named in the action or not, has to the property or thing in question. The proceeding is `one againstthe world.' " 16 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice

$ 108.70[1], p. 108-106 (3d ed. 2004). Because the court's ju-risdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipating
creditor cannot be subjected to personal liability. See Freeman v. Alderson, 119 U. S. 185, 188-189 (1886) (citing Cooperv. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308 (1870)).

Under our longstanding precedent, States, whether or notthey choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound by a
bankruptcy court's discharge order no less than other credi-tors. In New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329 (1933),
we sustained an order of the Bankruptcy Court which barredthe State of New York's tax claim because it was not filed
within the time fixed for the filing of claims. We held that"[i]f a state desires to participate in the assets of a bankrupt,
she must submit to the appropriate requirements." Id., at333; see also

Gardner, supra, at 574 (holding that a Statewaives its sovereign immunity by filing a proof of claim).

And in Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, 284 U. S. 225, 228-229(1931), we held that the Bankruptcy Court had the authority
to sell a debtor's property "free and clear" of a State's taxlien. At least when the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over
the res is unquestioned, cf. United States v. Nordic Village,Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), our cases indicate that the exercise
of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge a debt does not infringestate sovereignty.

4 Cf. Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of In4 Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18 (1933), is not to the contrary. In that
case, private individuals sought to enjoin the State of Missouri from prosecuting probate proceedings in state court, contending that the Federal
District Court had made a final determination of the ownership of the

come Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 102 (1989) (plurality opinion) (applying Eleventh Amendment analysis where a Bankruptcy Court sought to issue a money judgment against a
nonconsenting State).

TSAC concedes that States are generally bound by a bankruptcy court's discharge order, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, but
argues that the particular process by which student loan
debts are discharged unconstitutionally infringes its sovereignty. Student loans used to be presumptively discharged
in a general discharge. But in 1976, Congress provided a
significant benefit to the States by making it more difficult
for debtors to discharge student loan debts guaranteed by
States. Education Amendments of 1976, $ 439A(a), 90 Stat.
2141 (codified at 20 U. S. C. $ 1087-3 (1976 ed.), repealed by
Pub. L. 95-598, $ 317, 92 Stat. 2678). That benefit is currently governed by 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(8), which provides
that student loan debts guaranteed by governmental units
are not included in a general discharge order unless excepting the debt from the order would impose an "undue hardship" on the debtor. See also $ 727(b) (providing that a
discharge under $ 727(a) discharges the debtor from all prepetition debts except as listed in $ 523(a)).

contested stock. We held the Eleventh Amendment prevented federal
courts from entertaining such a suit because a "[federal] court has no
authority to issue process against the State to compel it to subject itself
to the court's judgment." Id., at 28. Although a discharge order under
the Bankruptcy Code "operates as an injunction" against creditors who
commence or continue an action against a debtor in personam to recover
or to collect a discharged debt, 11 U. S. C. $ 524(a)(2), the enforcement of
such an injunction against the State by a federal court is not before us.
To the extent that Fiske is relevant in the present context, it supports our
conclusion that a discharge order is binding on the State. There, we
noted the State might still be bound by the federal court's adjudication
even if an injunction could not issue. 290 U. S., at 29. It is unlikely that
the Court sub silentio overruled the holdings in Irving Trust and Van
Huffel in Fiske as Justice Thomas implies, see post, at 463 (dissenting
opinion), as Fiske was decided the same year as Irving Trust.

v. HOOD

Opinion of the Court

Section 523(a)(8) is "self-executing." Norton $ 47:52, at47-137 to 47-138; see also S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 79 (1978).

Unless the debtor affirmatively secures a hardship determi-nation, the discharge order will not include a student loan
debt. Norton $ 47:52, at 47-137 to 47-138. Thus, the majordifference between the discharge of a student loan debt and
the discharge of most other debts is that governmental creditors, including States, that choose not to submit themselvesto the court's jurisdiction might still receive some benefit:

The debtor's personal liability on the loan may survive thedischarge.

It is this change that TSAC contends infringes state sovereignty. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16. By making a student loan
debt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out for
an "individualized adjudication," id., at 17, TSAC argues that
Congress has authorized a suit against a State. But TSAC
misunderstands the fundamental nature of the proceeding.

No matter how difficult Congress has decided to make the
discharge of student loan debt, the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, not on the persona; that States
were granted the presumptive benefit of nondischargeability
does not alter the court's underlying authority. A debtor
does not seek monetary damages or any affirmative relief
from a State by seeking to discharge a debt; nor does he
subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial process. He
seeks only a discharge of his debts.

Indeed, we have previously endorsed individualized determinations of States' interests within the federal courts' in
rem jurisdiction. In Van Huffel, we affirmed the bankruptcy courts' power to sell property free from encumbrances, including States' liens, and approvingly noted that
some courts had chosen specifically to discharge States' liens
for taxes. 284 U. S., at 228; cf. Gardner, 329 U. S., at 572-
574 (noting "that the reorganization court had jurisdiction
over the proof and allowance of the tax claims and that the
exercise of that power was not a suit against the State").

Opinion of the Court
Our decision in California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523U. S. 491 (1998), also involved an individualized in rem adjudication in which a State claimed an interest, as have otherin rem admiralty cases involving sovereigns, e. g., The Davis,
10 Wall., at 19; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 159 (1869); The Pesaro,255 U. S., at 219. Although both bankruptcy and admiralty
are specialized areas of the law, we see no reason why theexercise of the federal courts'

in rem bankruptcy jurisdictionis more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise of

their in rem admiralty jurisdiction.We find no authority, in fine, that suggests a bankruptcy
court's exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge a stu-dent loan debt would infringe state sovereignty in the manner suggested by TSAC. We thus hold that the undue hard-ship determination sought by Hood in this case is not a suit
against a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.5

III
Lastly, we deal with the procedure that was used in thiscase. Creditors generally are not entitled to personal service before a bankruptcy court may discharge a debt. Hanover Nat. Bank, 186 U. S., at 192. Because student loandebts are not automatically dischargeable, however, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure provide creditorsgreater procedural protection. See Fed. Rules Bkrtcy. Proc.
7001(6), 7003, and 7004. The current Bankruptcy Rules re-quire the debtor to file an "adversary proceeding" against
the State in order to discharge his student loan debt. The

5 This is not to say, "a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction overrides
sovereign immunity," United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,
38 (1992), as Justice Thomas characterizes our opinion, post, at 462, but
rather that the court's exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge a
student loan debt is not an affront to the sovereignty of the State. Nor
do we hold that every exercise of a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction
will not offend the sovereignty of the State. No such concerns are present here, and we do not address them.

Opinion of the Court

proceeding is considered part of the original bankruptcycase, see 10 Collier on Bankruptcy || 7003.02 (rev. 15th ed.

2003), and still within the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdic-tion as discussed above. But, as prescribed by the Rules,
an "adversary proceeding" requires the service of a sum-mons and a complaint. Rules 7001(6), 7003, and 7004.

Because this "adversary proceeding" has some similarities
to a traditional civil trial, Justice Thomas contends that theBankruptcy Court cannot make an undue hardship determination without infringing TSAC's sovereignty under Federal
Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535
U. S. 743 (2002). See post, at 457-460. In Federal Maritime Comm'n, we held that the Eleventh Amendment precluded a private party from haling an unconsenting State
into a proceeding before the Federal Maritime Commission
(FMC). We noted that we have applied a presumption since
Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), "that the Constitution
was not intended to `rais[e] up' any proceedings against the
States that were `anomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.' " 535 U. S., at 755. Because agency
adjudications were unheard of at the time of the founding,
we had to determine whether the FMC proceeding was "the
type of proceedin[g] from which the Framers would have
thought the States possessed immunity when they agreed
to enter the Union." Id., at 756. Noting the substantial
similarities between a proceeding before the FMC and one
before an Article III court, we concluded that the Hans presumption applied, see 535 U. S., at 756-763, and that the
Eleventh Amendment therefore precluded private suits in
such a forum, id., at 769.

In this case, however, there is no need to engage in a comparative analysis to determine whether the adjudication
would be an affront to States' sovereignty. As noted above,
we have long held that the bankruptcy courts' exercise of in
rem jurisdiction is not such an offense. Supra, at 448-451.
Nor is there any dispute that, if the Bankruptcy Court had

541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

453Cite as: 541 U. S. 440 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
to exercise personal jurisdiction over TSAC, such an adju-dication would implicate the Eleventh Amendment. Our

precedent has drawn a distinction between in rem and in
personam jurisdiction, even when the underlying proceedings are, for the most part, identical. Thus, whether an in
rem adjudication in a bankruptcy court is similar to civil litigation in a district court is irrelevant. If Justice Thomas'
interpretation of Federal Maritime Comm'n were adopted,
Deep Sea Research, Van Huffle, and Irving Trust, all of
which involved proceedings resembling traditional civil adju-dications, would likely have to be overruled. We are not

willing to take such a step.

The issuance of process, nonetheless, is normally an indignity to the sovereignty of a State because its purpose is to
establish personal jurisdiction over the State. We noted in
Seminole Tribe: "The Eleventh Amendment does not exist
solely in order to prevent federal-court judgments that must
be paid out of a State's treasury; it also serves to avoid the
indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties." 517 U. S.,
at 58 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Here, however, the Bankruptcy Court's in rem jurisdiction
allows it to adjudicate the debtor's discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State. See 4A C.
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1070,
pp. 280-281 (3d ed. 2002) (noting jurisdiction over the person
is irrelevant if the court has jurisdiction over the property).
Hood does not argue that the court should exercise personal
jurisdiction; all she wants is a determination of the dischargeability of her debt. The text of $ 523(a)(8) does not
require a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6) a debtor could
proceed by motion, see Rule 9014 ("[I]n a contested matter
. . . not otherwise governed by these rules, relief shall be
requested by motion"), which would raise no constitutional
concern. Hood concedes that even if TSAC ignores the summons and chooses not to participate in the proceeding the

v. HOOD

Opinion of the Court

Bankruptcy Court cannot discharge her debt without makingan undue hardship determination. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.

We see no reason why the service of a summons, which inthis case is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should be given dispositive weight. As we said in
Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 270
(1997), "[t]he real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of cap-tions and pleading." See

New York I, 256 U. S., at 500 (a
suit against a State "is to be determined not by the merenames of the titular parties but by the essential nature and

effect of the proceeding, as it appears from the entire record"). To conclude that the issuance of a summons, which is
required only by the Rules, precludes Hood from exercising
her statutory right to an undue hardship determination
would give the Rules an impermissible effect. 28 U. S. C.

$ 2075 ("[The Bankruptcy Rules] shall not abridge, enlarge,
or modify any substantive right"). And there is no reason
to take such a step. TSAC sought only to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction in the Bankruptcy Court. Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Lack of Jurisdiction in
No. 99-0847 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tenn.), pp. 1-2. Clearly dismissal of the complaint is not appropriate as the court has
in rem jurisdiction over the matter, and the court here has
not attempted to adjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction. The case before us is thus unlike an adversary proceeding by the bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover property in the hands of the State on the grounds that the
transfer was a voidable preference. Even if we were to hold
that Congress lacked the ability to abrogate state sovereign
immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, as TSAC urges us
to do, the Bankruptcy Court would still have the authority
to make the undue hardship determination sought by Hood.

We therefore decline to decide whether a bankruptcy
court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would
be valid under the Eleventh Amendment. See Liverpool,

the sovereignty of a creditor-State. I recognize that, as theCourt concludes today, the in rem nature of bankruptcy proceedings might affect the ability of a debtor to obtain, bymotion, a bankruptcy court determination that affects a
creditor-State's rights, but I would not reach this difficultquestion here. Even if the Bankruptcy Court could have
exercised its in rem jurisdiction to make an undue hardshipdetermination by motion, I cannot ignore the fact that the

Thomas, J., dissenting

South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743 (2002), the
adversary proceeding here clearly constitutes a suit against
the State for sovereign immunity purposes. I would thus
reach the easier question presented and conclude that Congress lacks authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity
under the Bankruptcy Clause.

I
The Court avoids addressing respondent's principal argument--which was the basis for the Court of Appeals' decision
and which this Court granted certiorari in order to address--namely, that Congress possesses the power under the
Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate a State's sovereign immunity
from suit. Instead, the Court affirms the judgment of the
Court of Appeals based on respondent's alternative argument, ante, at 445, that the Bankruptcy Court's decision was
"an appropriate exercise of [its] in rem jurisdiction," Brief
for Respondent 35. Although respondent advanced this argument in the proceedings before the Bankruptcy Appellate
Panel of the Sixth Circuit, Brief for Appellee in No. 00-8062,
p. 8, she declined to do so in the Court of Appeals. Indeed,
before that court, respondent relied entirely on Congress'
ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the
Bankruptcy Clause rather than on any in rem theory because, under her reading of Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18
(1933), "there is no in rem exception to a state's Eleventh
Amendment immunity" in bankruptcy. Brief for Appellee
in No. 01-5769 (CA6), p. 24. Furthermore, respondent did
not raise the in rem argument in her brief in opposition before this Court. Under this Court's Rule 15.2, we may deem
this argument waived. Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S.
61, 75, n. 13 (1996). And, we should do so here both because
the argument is irrelevant to this case, and because the in
rem question is both complex and uncertain, see Baldwin v.
Reese, ante, p. 27.

Thomas, J., dissenting

A
In Federal Maritime Comm'n, South Carolina MaritimeServices, Inc. (SCMS), filed a complaint with the Federal

Maritime Commission (FMC), an independent agency, alleg-ing that a state-run port had violated the Shipping Act of
1984, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1701 et seq. We assumed withoutdeciding that the FMC does not exercise "judicial power,"
535 U. S., at 754, and nonetheless held that state sovereignimmunity barred the adjudication of SCMS' complaint.

Id.,at 769.

Federal Maritime Comm'n turned on the "overwhelming"similarities between FMC proceedings and civil litigation in
federal courts. Id., at 759. For example, FMC's rules gov-erning pleadings and discovery are very similar to the analogous Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Id., at 757-758.Moreover, we noted that "the role of the [administrative law
judge], the impartial officer designated to hear a case, is simi-lar to that of an Article III judge."

Id., at 758 (footnote andcitation omitted). Based on these similarities, we held that,

for purposes of state sovereign immunity, the adjudicationbefore the FMC was indistinguishable from an adjudication
in an Article III tribunal. See id., at 760-761. Thus, Fed-eral Maritime Comm'n recognized that if the Framers
would have found it an "impermissible affront to a State'sdignity to be required to answer the complaints of private
parties in federal courts," the Framers would have found itequally impermissible to compel States to do so simply because the adjudication takes place in an Article I rather thanan Article III court.

Ibid.Although the Court ignores Federal Maritime Comm'n altogether, its reasoning applies to this case. The similaritiesbetween adversary proceedings in bankruptcy and federal
civil litigation are striking. Indeed, the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure govern adversary proceedings in substantial
part. The proceedings are commenced by the filing of acomplaint, Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7003; process is served,

Rule 7005; the opposing party is required to file an answer,Rule 7007; and the opposing party can file counterclaims

against the movant, Rule 7013. Federal Rule of Civil Proce-dure 8 applies to the parties' pleadings. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy.
Proc. 7008. Even the form of the parties' pleadings mustcomply with the federal rules for civil litigation. Rule 7010.
"Likewise, discovery in [adversary proceedings] largely mirrors discovery in federal civil litigation." Federal Maritime
Comm'n, supra, at 758. See Fed. Rules Bkrtcy. Proc. 7026-
7037 (applying Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 26-37 to adversary pro-ceedings). And, when a party fails to answer or appear in

an adversary proceeding, the Federal Rule governing default
judgments applies. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7055 (adopting
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55).

In spite of these similarities, the Court concludes that, because the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is premised on the
res, the issuance of process in this case, as opposed to all
others, does not subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial process. Ante, at 452. The Court also views the adversary proceeding in this case differently than a typical adversary proceeding because, absent Federal Rule of Bankruptcy
Procedure 7001(6), the Court concludes that a debtor could
obtain an undue hardship determination by motion consistent with a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction and consistent with the Constitution. See ante, at 453.

Critically, however, the Court fails to explain why, simply
because it asserts that this determination could have been
made by motion, the adversary proceeding utilized in this
case is somehow less offensive to state sovereignty. After
all, "[t]he very object and purpose of the 11th Amendment
[is] to prevent the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private
parties." In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 505 (1887); Federal
Maritime Comm'n, supra, at 760; Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.
706, 748 (1999); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.

Thomas, J., dissenting
the use of which might not be offensive to state sovereignty,is irrelevant to whether the particular proceeding actually

used subjects a particular State to the indignities of coerciveprocess. Indeed, the dissent in

Federal Maritime Comm'n,
much like the Court today, focused on the fact that the FMCwas not required by statute to evaluate complaints through

agency adjudicati on, 535 U. S., at 774-776 (opinion of
Breyer, J.), and could have opted to evaluate complaints insome other manner. But this fact had no bearing on our

decision in that case, nor should it control here. I simplycannot ignore the fact that respondent filed a complaint in
the Bankruptcy Court "pray[ing] that proper process issue
and that upon a hearing upon the merits that [the court] issue
a judgment for [respondent] and against [petitioner] allowing
[respondent's] debt to be discharged." Complaint for Hardship Discharge in No. 99-22606-K, Adversary No. 99-0847
(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tenn.), p. 1.

More importantly, although the adversary proceeding in
this case does not require the State to "defend itself " against
petitioner in the ordinary sense, the effect is the same,
whether done by adversary proceeding or by motion, and
whether the proceeding is in personam or in rem. In order
to preserve its rights, the State is compelled either to subject
itself to the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction or to forfeit
its rights. And, whatever the nature of the Bankruptcy
Court's jurisdiction, it maintains at least as much control
over nonconsenting States as the FMC, which lacks the
power to enforce its own orders. Federal Mar i time
Comm'n rejected the view that the FMC's lack of enforcement power means that parties are not coerced to participate
in its proceedings because the effect is the same--a State
must submit to the adjudication or compromise its ability
to defend itself in later proceedings. 535 U. S., at 761-764.
Here, if the State does not oppose the debtor's claim of undue
hardship, the Bankruptcy Court is authorized to enter a default judgment without making an undue hardship determi541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nation. See Fed. Rules Bkrtcy. Proc. 7055, 9014 (adoptingFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55 in both adversary proceedings and in

contested matters governed by motion). The Court appar-ently concludes otherwise, but, tellingly, its only support for
that questionable proposition is a statement made at oralargument. See ante, at 453-454.

As I explain in Part I-B, infra, I do not contest the asser-tion that in bankruptcy, like admiralty, there might be a limited in rem exception to state sovereign immunity from suit.Nor do I necessarily reject the argument that this proceeding could have been resolved by motion without offendingthe dignity of the State. However, because this case did not
proceed by motion, I cannot resolve the merits based solelyupon what might have, but did not, occur. I would therefore
hold that the adversary proceeding in this case constituted asuit against the State for sovereign immunity purposes.

B
The difficulty and complexity of the question of the scopeof the Bankruptcy Court's

in rem jurisdiction as it relates toa State's interests is a further reason that the Court should

not address the question here without complete briefing andfull consideration by the Court of Appeals.

Relying on this Court's recent recognition of a limited in
rem exception to state sovereign immunity in certain admi-ralty actions, see California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523

U. S. 491 (1998), the Court recognizes that "States . . . maystill be bound by some judicial actions without their consent," ante, at 446. The Court then acknowledges the undis-puted fact that bankruptcy discharge proceedings are in rem
proceedings. Ante, at 447. These facts, however, standingalone, do not compel the conclusion that the in rem exception
should extend to this case.Deep Sea Research, supra, does not make clear the extent
of the in rem exception in admiralty, much less its potentialapplication in bankruptcy. The Court's recognition of an

Thomas, J., dissenting
rem exception to state sovereign immunity in admiralty ac-tions was informed, in part, by Justice Story's understanding

of the difference between admiralty actions and regular civillitigation. Justice Story doubted whether the Eleventh
Amendment extended to admiralty and maritime suits at allbecause, in admiralty, "the jurisdiction of the [federal] court
is founded upon the possession of the thing; and if the State
should interpose a claim for the property, it does not actmerely in the character of a defendant, but as an actor."

2 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States$ 1689, p. 491 (5th ed. 1891). Justice Story supported this
view by contrasting suits in law or equity with suits in admiralty, which received a separate grant of jurisdiction under
Article III. Id., at 491-492. The Court, however, has since
adopted a more narrow understanding of the in rem maritime exception. See Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497
(1921) ("Nor is the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction exempt from the operation of the rule [that a State may not be
sued without its consent]"). Thus, our holding in Deep Sea
Research was limited to actions where the res is not within
the State's possession. 523 U. S., at 507-508.

Whatever the scope of the in rem exception in admiralty,
the Court's cases reveal no clear principle to govern which,
if any, bankruptcy suits are exempt from the Eleventh
Amendment's bar. In Fiske, 290 U. S., at 28, the Court
stated in no uncertain terms that "[t]he fact that a suit in a
federal court is in rem, or quasi in rem, furnishes no ground
for the issue of process against a non-consenting State."
The Court contends that Fiske supports its argument because there the Court "noted the State might still be bound
by the federal court's adjudication even if an injunction could
not issue." Ante, at 449, n. 4. But the Court in Fiske also
suggested that the State might not be bound by the federal
court's adjudication--a more weighty proposition given the
circumstances of the case. Fiske, in part, involved the validity of a federal-court decree entered in 1927, which deter541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mined that Sophie Franz had only a life interest in certainshares of stock previously held by her deceased husband.

When Franz died in 1930, Franz's executor did not inventorythe shares because the federal-court decree declared Franz
to have only a life interest in them. The dispute arose be-cause the State sought to inventory those shares as assets of
Franz's estate so that it could collect inheritance taxes on
those shares. Although Fiske did not decide whether the1927 federal decree was binding on the State, 290 U. S., at

29, the mere suggestion that the State might not be boundby the decree because it was not a party to an

in rem proceeding in which it had no interest, see ibid., at least leaves
in doubt the extent of any in rem exception in bankruptcy.

Our more recent decision in United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), casts some doubt upon the
Court's characterization of any in rem exception in bankruptcy. Nordic Village explicitly recognized that "we have
never applied an in rem exception to the sovereign-immunity
bar against monetary recovery, and have suggested that no
such exception exists." Id., at 38. Although Nordic Village involved the sovereign immunity of the Federal Government, it also supports the argument that no in rem exception
exists for other types of relief against a State. Nordic Village interpreted 11 U. S. C. $ 106(c) to waive claims for declaratory and injunctive, though not monetary, relief against

interpretation did not render $ 106(c) irrelevant because a
waiver of immunity with respect to claims for declaratory

by "permit[ing] a bankruptcy court to determine the amount
and dischargeability of an estate's liability to the Government . . . whether or not the Government filed a proof of

liability only for declaratory and injunctive relief strongly

tion, the bankruptcy court could not order declaratory or in-junctive relief against a State without the State's consent.

Cf. Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, 553,n. 11 (2002).

To be sure, the Court has previously held that a State canbe bound by a bankruptcy court adjudication that affects a
State's interest. See New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S.329 (1933);

Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, 284 U. S. 225 (1931).But, in neither of those cases did the Court attempt to undertake a sovereign immunity analysis. Irving Trust, for in-stance, rested on Congress' "power to establish uniform laws
on the subject of bankruptcies," 288 U. S., at 331, and theneed for "orderly and expeditious proceedings," id., at 333.
And in Van Huffel, the Court appeared to rest its decisionmore on "the requirements of bankruptcy administration,"
284 U. S., at 228, than the effect of the in rem nature of theproceedings on state sovereign immunity.* Perhaps recognizing that these precedents cannot support the weight of itsreasoning, the Court attempts to limit its holding by explicitly declining to find an in rem exception to every exerciseof a bankruptcy court's

in rem jurisdiction that might offendstate sovereignty, ante, at 451, n. 5. But, I can find no principle in the Court's opinion to distinguish this case from anyother. For this reason, I would not undertake this complicated inquiry. II

Congress has made its intent to abrogate state sovereignimmunity under the Bankruptcy Clause clear. See 11
U. S. C. $ 106(a). The only question, then, is whether theBankruptcy Clause grants Congress the power to do so.

*Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565 (1947), also does not aid the
Court's argument. Although Gardner held that the reorganization court
could entertain objections to the State's asserted claim, the Court also
held that the State waived its immunity by filing a proof of claim, thus
obviating any need to consider the sovereign immunity question in the
context of the in rem proceedings. Id., at 573-574.

TILL et ux. v. SCS CREDIT CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 02-1016. Argued December 2, 2003--Decided May 17, 2004
Under the so-called "cramdown option" permitted by the Bankruptcy

Code, a Chapter 13 debtor's proposed debt adjustment plan must provide each allowed, secured creditor both a lien securing the claim and a
promise of future property disbursements whose total value, as of the
plan's date, "is not less than the [claim's] allowed amount," 11 U. S. C.

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). When such plans provide for installment payments,
each installment must be calibrated to ensure that the creditor receives
disbursements whose total present value equals or exceeds that of the
allowed claim. Respondent's retail installment contract on petitioners'
truck had a secured value of $4,000 at the time petitioners filed a Chapter 13 petition. Petitioners' proposed debt adjustment plan provided
the amount that would be distributed to creditors each month and that
petitioners would pay an annual 9.5% interest rate on respondent's secured claim. This "prime-plus" or "formula rate" was reached by augmenting the national prime rate of 8% to account for the nonpayment
risk posed by borrowers in petitioners' financial position. In confirming
the plan, the Bankruptcy Court overruled respondent's objection that it
was entitled to its contract interest rate of 21%. The District Court
reversed, ruling that the 21% "coerced loan rate" was appropriate because cramdown rates must be set at the level the creditor could have
obtained had it foreclosed on the loan, sold the collateral, and reinvested
the proceeds in equivalent loans. The Seventh Circuit modified that
approach, holding that the original contract rate was a "presumptive
rate" that could be challenged with evidence that a higher or lower rate
should apply, and remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to afford
the parties an opportunity to rebut the presumptive 21% rate. The
dissent proposed adoption of the formula approach, rejecting a "cost of
funds rate" that would simply ask what it would cost the creditor to
obtain the cash equivalent of the collateral from another source.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
301 F. 3d 583, reversed and remanded.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded that the prime-plus or formula rate
best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Pp. 473-485.

466 TILL v. SCS CREDIT CORP.

Syllabus
(a) The Code gives little guidance as to which of the four interest
rates advocated by opinions in this case Congress intended when it
adopted the cramdown provision. A debtor's promise of future payments is worth less than an immediate lump-sum payment because the
creditor cannot use the money right away, inflation may cause the dollar's value to decline before the debtor pays, and there is a nonpayment
risk. In choosing an interest rate sufficient to compensate the creditor
for such concerns, bankruptcy courts must consider that: (1) Congress
likely intended bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the
same approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate under any of
the many Code provisions requiring a court to discount a stream of
deferred payments back to their present dollar value; (2) Chapter 13
expressly authorizes a bankruptcy court to modify the rights of a creditor whose claim is secured by an interest in anything other than the
debtor's principal residence; and (3) from a creditor's point of view, the
cramdown provision mandates an objective rather than a subjective inquiry. Pp. 473-477.

(b) These considerations lead to the conclusion that the coerced loan,
presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches should be rejected, since they are complicated, impose significant evidentiary costs,
and aim to make each individual creditor whole rather than to ensure
that a debtor's payments have the required present value. Pp. 477-478.

(c) The formula approach has none of these defects. Taking its cue
from ordinary lending practices, it looks to the national prime rate,
which reflects the financial market's estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the loan's opportunity costs, the inflation risk, and the relatively
slight default risk. A bankruptcy court is then required to adjust the
prime rate to account for the greater nonpayment risk that bankrupt
debtors typically pose. Because that adjustment depends on such factors as the estate's circumstances, the security's nature, and the reorganization plan's duration and feasibility, the court must hold a hearing to
permit the debtor and creditors to present evidence about the appropriate risk adjustment. Unlike the other approaches proposed in this
case, the formula approach entails a straightforward, familiar, and objective inquiry, and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional
evidentiary hearings. The resulting prime-plus rate also depends only
on the state of financial markets, the bankruptcy estate's circumstances,
and the loan's characteristics, not on the creditor's circumstances or its
prior interactions with the debtor. The risk adjustment's proper scale
is not before this Court. The Bankruptcy Court approved 1.5% in this
case, and other courts have generally approved 1% to 3%, but respondent claims a risk adjustment in this range is inadequate. The issue

Syllabus
need not be resolved here; it is sufficient to note that courts must choose
a rate high enough to compensate a creditor for its risk but not so high
as to doom the bankruptcy plan. Pp. 478-481.

Justice Thomas concluded that the proposed 9.5% rate will sufficiently compensate respondent for the fact that it is receiving monthly
payments rather than a lump sum payment, but that 11 U. S. C.

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not require that the proper interest rate reflect
the risk of nonpayment. Pp. 485-491.

(a) The plain language of $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires a court to determine, first, the allowed amount of the claim; second, what is the property
to be distributed under the plan; and third, the "value, as of the effective
date of the plan," of the property to be distributed. This third requirement, which is at issue here, incorporates the principle of the time value
of money. Section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires valuation of the property,
not valuation of the plan. Thus, a plan need only propose an interest
rate that will compensate a creditor for the fact that had he received
the property immediately rather than at a future date, he could have
immediately made use of the property. In most, if not all, cases, where
the plan proposes simply a stream of cash payments, the appropriate
risk-free rate should suffice. There may be some risk of nonpayment,
but $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not take this risk into account. Respondent's
argument that $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) was crafted to protect creditors rather
than debtors ignores the statute's plain language and overlooks the fact
that secured creditors are compensated in part for the nonpayment risk
through the valuation of the secured claim. Further, the statute's plain
language is by no means debtor protective. Given the presence of multiple creditor-specific protections, it is not irrational to assume that Congress opted not to provide further protection for creditors by requiring
a debtor-specific risk adjustment under $ 1325(a)(5). Pp. 486-490.

(b) Here, the allowed amount of the secured claim is $4,000, and the
property to be distributed under the plan is cash payments. Because
the proposed 9.5% interest rate is higher than the risk-free rate, it is
sufficient to account for the time value of money, which is all the statute
requires. Pp. 490-491.

To qualify for court approval under Chapter 13 of theBankruptcy Code, an individual debtor's proposed debt adjustment plan must accommodate each allowed, securedcreditor in one of three ways: (1) by obtaining the creditor's
acceptance of the plan; (2) by surrendering the property se-curing the claim; or (3) by providing the creditor both a lien
securing the claim and a promise of future property distribu-tions (such as deferred cash payments) whose total "value,
as of the effective date of the plan, . . . is not less than theallowed amount of such claim."

3 In such circumstances, the amount of each

installment must be calibrated to ensure that, over time, thecreditor receives disbursements whose total present value

equals or exceeds that of the allowed claim. The proceed-ings in this case that led to our grant of certiorari identified four different methods of determining the appropriatemethod with which to perform that calibration. Indeed, the
Bankruptcy Judge, the District Court, the Court of Appeals
majority, and the dissenting judge each endorsed a differentapproach. We detail the underlying facts and describe each

of those approaches before setting forth our judgment as towhich approach best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy
Code.

I

On October 2, 1998, petitioners Lee and Amy Till, resi-dents of Kokomo, Indiana, purchased a used truck from Instant Auto Finance for $6,395 plus $330.75 in fees and taxes.

"(B)(i) the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien
securing such claim; and

"(ii) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be
distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the
allowed amount of such claim; or

"(C) the debtor surrenders the property securing such claim to such
holder . . . ."

2 As we noted in Associates Commercial Corp. v. Rash, 520 U. S. 953,

962 (1997), a debtor may also avail himself of the second option (surrender
of the collateral) despite the creditor's objection.

3 See Rake v. Wade, 508 U. S. 464, 472, n. 8 (1993) (noting that property

distributions under $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) may take the form of "a stream of
future payments").

4 In the remainder of the opinion, we use the term "present value" to

refer to the value as of the effective date of the bankruptcy plan.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
They made a $300 downpayment and financed the balance ofthe purchase price by entering into a retail installment contract that Instant Auto immediately assigned to respondent,SCS Credit Corporation. Petitioners' initial indebtedness
amounted to $8,285.24--the $6,425.75 balance of the truckpurchase plus a finance charge of 21% per year for 136 weeks,
or $1,859.49. Under the contract, petitioners agreed tomake 68 biweekly payments to cover this debt; Instant
Auto--and subsequently respondent--retained a purchasemoney security interest that gave it the right to repossess
the truck if petitioners defaulted under the contract.On October 25, 1999, petitioners, by then in default on
their payments to respondent, filed a joint petition for reliefunder Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. At the time
of the filing, respondent's outstanding claim amounted to$4,894.89, but the parties agreed that the truck securing the
claim was worth only $4,000. App. 16-17. In accordancewith the Bankruptcy Code, therefore, respondent's secured
claim was limited to $4,000, and the $894.89 balance wasunsecured.

5 Petitioners' filing automatically stayed debtcollection activity by their various creditors, including theInternal Revenue Service (IRS), respondent, three other

holders of secured claims, and unidentified unsecured credi-tors. In addition, the filing created a bankruptcy estate, administered by a trustee, which consisted of petitioners' prop-erty, including the truck.

"An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which
the estate has an interest . . . is a secured claim to the extent of the value
of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property, . . . and
is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest or the amount so subject to setoff is less than the amount of such
allowed claim. Such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of
the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property, and
in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use or on a plan
affecting such creditor's interest."

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Petitioners' proposed debt adjustment plan called for them
to submit their future earnings to the supervision and control
of the Bankruptcy Court for three years, and to assign $740
of their wages to the trustee each month.7 App. to Pet. for
Cert. 76a-81a. The plan charged the trustee with distributing these monthly wage assignments to pay, in order of priority: (1) administrative costs; (2) the IRS's priority tax
claim; (3) secured creditors' claims; and finally, (4) unsecured
creditors' claims. Id., at 77a-79a.

The proposed plan also provided that petitioners would
pay interest on the secured portion of respondent's claim at
a rate of 9.5% per year. Petitioners arrived at this "primeplus" or "formula rate" by augmenting the national prime
rate of approximately 8% (applied by banks when making
low-risk loans) to account for the risk of nonpayment posed
by borrowers in their financial position. Respondent objected to the proposed rate, contending that the company
was "entitled to interest at the rate of 21%, which is the rate
. . . it would obtain if it could foreclose on the vehicle and
reinvest the proceeds in loans of equivalent duration and risk
as the loan" originally made to petitioners. App. 19-20.

At the hearing on its objection, respondent presented expert testimony establishing that it uniformly charges 21%
interest on so-called "subprime" loans, or loans to borrowers
with poor credit ratings, and that other lenders in the subprime market also charge that rate. Petitioners countered
with the testimony of an Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis economics professor, who acknowledged
that he had only limited familiarity with the subprime auto
lending market, but described the 9.5% formula rate as "very
reasonable" given that Chapter 13 plans are "supposed to be

financially feasible." 8 Id., at 43-44. Moreover, the profes-sor noted that respondent's exposure was "fairly limited because [petitioners] are under the supervision of the court."Id., at 43. The bankruptcy trustee also filed comments supporting the formula rate as, among other things, easily ascer-tainable, closely tied to the "condition of the financial market," and independent of the financial circumstances of anyparticular lender. App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-42a. Accepting petitioners' evidence, the Bankruptcy Court overruledrespondent's objection and confirmed the proposed plan.

The District Court reversed. It understood Seventh Cir-cuit precedent to require that bankruptcy courts set cramdown interest rates at the level the creditor could have ob-tained if it had foreclosed on the loan, sold the collateral, and
reinvested the proceeds in loans of equivalent duration andrisk. Citing respondent's unrebutted testimony about the
market for subprime loans, the court concluded that 21% wasthe appropriate rate.

Id., at 38a.On appeal, the Seventh Circuit endorsed a slightly modified version of the District Court's "coerced" or "forced loan"approach.

In re Till, 301 F. 3d 583, 591 (2002). Specifically,the majority agreed with the District Court that, in a cramdown proceeding, the inquiry should focus on the interestrate "that the creditor in question would obtain in making a
new loan in the same industry to a debtor who is similarlysituated, although not in bankruptcy." Id., at 592. To approximate that new loan rate, the majority looked to the par-ties' prebankruptcy contract rate (21%). The court recognized, however, that using the contract rate would not"duplicat[e] precisely . . . the present value of the collateral
to the creditor" because loans to bankrupt, court-superviseddebtors "involve some risks that would not be incurred in a

majority held that the original contract rate should "serveas a presumptive [cramdown] rate," which either the creditor
or the debtor could challenge with evidence that a higher orlower rate should apply. Ibid. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to afford petition-ers and respondent an opportunity to rebut the presumptive
21% rate.9Dissenting, Judge Rovner argued that the majority's presumptive contract rate approach overcompensates securedcreditors because it fails to account for costs a creditor would
have to incur in issuing a new loan. Rather than focusingon the market for comparable loans, Judge Rovner advocated
the Bankruptcy Court's formula approach. Id., at 596. Al-though Judge Rovner noted that the rates produced by
either the formula or the cost of funds approach might be"piddling" relative to the coerced loan rate, she suggested
courts should "consider the extent to which the creditor hasalready been compensated for . . . the risk that the debtor
will be unable to discharge his obligations under the reorga-nization plan . . . in the rate of interest that it charged to the
debtor in return for the original loan." Ibid. We grantedcertiorari and now reverse. 539 U. S. 925 (2003).

II
The Bankruptcy Code provides little guidance as to whichof the rates of interest advocated by the four opinions in this

case--the formula rate, the coerced loan rate, the presump-tive contract rate, or the cost of funds rate--Congress had
in mind when it adopted the cramdown provision. That pro-vision, 11 U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(5)(B), does not mention the term
"discount rate" or the word "interest." Rather, it simply

9 As 21% is the maximum interest rate creditors may charge for consumer loans under Indiana's usury statute, Ind. Code $ 24-4.5-3-201
(1993), the remand presumably could not have benefited respondent.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
requires bankruptcy courts to ensure that the property to
be distributed to a particular secured creditor over the life
of a bankruptcy plan has a total "value, as of the effective date of the plan," that equals or exceeds the value of
the creditor's allowed secured claim--in this case, $4,000.

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).

That command is easily satisfied when the plan provides
for a lump-sum payment to the creditor. Matters are not so
simple, however, when the debt is to be discharged by a series of payments over time. A debtor's promise of future
payments is worth less than an immediate payment of the
same total amount because the creditor cannot use the
money right away, inflation may cause the value of the dollar
to decline before the debtor pays, and there is always some
risk of nonpayment. The challenge for bankruptcy courts
reviewing such repayment schemes, therefore, is to choose
an interest rate sufficient to compensate the creditor for
these concerns.

Three important considerati ons govern that choice.
First, the Bankruptcy Code includes numerous provisions
that, like the cramdown provision, require a court to "discoun[t] . . . [a] stream of deferred payments back to the[ir]
present dollar value," Rake v. Wade, 508 U. S. 464, 472, n. 8
(1993), to ensure that a creditor receives at least the value
of its claim.10 We think it likely that Congress intended
bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the
same approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate
under any of these provisions. Moreover, we think Congress would favor an approach that is familiar in the financial

community and that minimizes the need for expensive evidentiary proceedings.

Second, Chapter 13 expressly authorizes a bankruptcy
court to modify the rights of any creditor whose claim is
secured by an interest in anything other than "real property that is the debtor's principal residence." 11 U. S. C.

$ 1322(b)(2).11 Thus, in cases like this involving secured interests in personal property, the court's authority to modify
the number, timing, or amount of the installment payments
from those set forth in the debtor's original contract is perfectly clear. Further, the potential need to modify the loan
terms to account for intervening changes in circumstances is
also clear: On the one hand, the fact of the bankruptcy establishes that the debtor is overextended and thus poses a significant risk of default; on the other hand, the postbankruptcy obligor is no longer the individual debtor but the
court-supervised estate, and the risk of default is thus somewhat reduced.12

11 Section 1322(b)(2) provides:
"[T]he plan may . . . modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other
than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the
debtor's principal residence, . . . or leave unaffected the rights of holders of
any class of claims."

12 Several factors contribute to this reduction in risk. First, as noted

below, infra, at 480, a court may only approve a cramdown loan (and the
debt adjustment plan of which the loan is a part) if it believes the debtor
will be able to make all of the required payments. $ 1325(a)(6). Thus,
such loans will only be approved for debtors that the court deems creditworthy. Second, Chapter 13 plans must "provide for the submission" to
the trustee "of all or such portion of [the debtor's] future . . . income . . .
as is necessary for the execution of the plan," $ 1322(a)(1), so the possibility
of nonpayment is greatly reduced. Third, the Bankruptcy Code's extensive disclosure requirements reduce the risk that the debtor has significant
undisclosed obligations. Fourth, as a practical matter, the public nature
of the bankruptcy proceeding is likely to reduce the debtor's opportunities
to take on additional debt. Cf. 11 U. S. C. $ 525 (prohibiting certain Government grant and loan programs from discriminating against applicants
who are or have been bankrupt).

Third, from the point of view of a creditor, the cramdown
provision mandates an objective rather than a subjective inquiry.13 That is, although $ 1325(a)(5)(B) entitles the creditor to property whose present value objectively equals or
exceeds the value of the collateral, it does not require that
the terms of the cramdown loan match the terms to which
the debtor and creditor agreed prebankruptcy, nor does it
require that the cramdown terms make the creditor subjectively indifferent between present foreclosure and future
payment. Indeed, the very idea of a "cramdown" loan precludes the latter result: By definition, a creditor forced to
accept such a loan would prefer instead to foreclose.14 Thus,
a court choosing a cramdown interest rate need not consider
the creditor's individual circumstances, such as its prebankruptcy dealings with the debtor or the alternative loans it

13 We reached a similar conclusion in Associates Commercial Corp. v.
Rash, 520 U. S. 953 (1997), when we held that a creditor's secured interest
should be valued from the debtor's, rather than the creditor's, perspective.
Id., at 963 ("[The debtor's] actual use, rather than a foreclosure sale that
will not take place, is the proper guide . . .").

14 This fact helps to explain why there is no readily apparent Chapter

13 "cramdown market rate of interest": Because every cramdown loan
is imposed by a court over the objection of the secured creditor, there
is no free market of willing cramdown lenders. Interestingly, the same
is not true in the Chapter 11 context, as numerous lenders advertise
financing for Chapter 11 debtors in possession. See, e. g., Balmoral
Financial Corporation, http://www.balmoral.com/ bdip.htm (all Internet
materials as visited Mar. 4, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court's case
file) (advertising debtor in possession lending); Debtor in Possession
Financing: 1st National Assistance Finance Association DIP Division,
http://www.loanmallusa.com/dip.htm (offering "to tailor a financing program . . . to your business' needs and . . . to work closely with your bankruptcy counsel"). Thus, when picking a cramdown rate in a Chapter 11
case, it might make sense to ask what rate an efficient market would
produce. In the Chapter 13 context, by contrast, the absence of any such
market obligates courts to look to first principles and ask only what rate
will fairly compensate a creditor for its exposure.

could make if permitted to foreclose.15 Rather, the courtshould aim to treat similarly situated creditors similarly,

16

and to ensure that an objective economic analysis would sug-gest the debtor's interest payments will adequately compensate all such creditors for the time value of their money andthe risk of default.

III
These considerations lead us to reject the coerced loan,presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches.

Each of these approaches is complicated, imposes significantevidentiary costs, and aims to make each individual creditor
whole rather than to ensure the debtor's payments have therequired present value. For example, the coerced loan approach requires bankruptcy courts to consider evidenceabout the market for comparable loans to similar (though
nonbankrupt) debtors--an inquiry far removed from suchcourts' usual task of evaluating debtors' financial circumstances and the feasibility of their debt adjustment plans.In addition, the approach overcompensates creditors because
the market lending rate must be high enough to cover fac-tors, like lenders' transaction costs and overall profits, that
are no longer relevant in the context of court-administeredand court-supervised cramdown loans.

Like the coerced loan approach, the presumptive contractrate approach improperly focuses on the creditor's potential
use of the proceeds of a foreclosure sale. In addition, al-though the approach permits a debtor to introduce some evidence about each creditor, thereby enabling the court to tai-lor the interest rate more closely to the creditor's financial
circumstances and reducing the likelihood that the creditor

15 See supra, at 472 (noting that the District Court's coerced loan approach aims to set the cramdown interest rate at the level the creditor
could obtain from new loans of comparable duration and risk).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
will be substantially overcompensated, that right comes at acost: The debtor must obtain information about the creditor's

costs of overhead, financial circumstances, and lending prac-tices to rebut the presumptive contract rate. Also, the approach produces absurd results, entitling "inefficient, poorlymanaged lenders" with lower profit margins to obtain higher
cramdown rates than "well managed, better capitalized lend-ers." 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy $ 112.1, p. 112-8
(3d ed. 2000). Finally, because the approach relies heavilyon a creditor's prior dealings with the debtor, similarly situated creditors may end up with vastly different cramdownrates.

17

The cost of funds approach, too, is improperly aimed. Al-though it rightly disregards the now-irrelevant terms of the

parties' original contract, it mistakenly focuses on the credit-worthiness of the

creditor rather than the debtor. In addi-tion, the approach has many of the other flaws of the coerced

loan and presumptive contract rate approaches. For exam-ple, like the presumptive contract rate approach, the cost of
funds approach imposes a significant evidentiary burden, asa debtor seeking to rebut a creditor's asserted cost of borrowing must introduce expert testimony about the creditor'sfinancial condition. Also, under this approach, a creditworthy lender with a low cost of borrowing may obtain alower cramdown rate than a financially unsound, fly-bynight lender. IV

The formula approach has none of these defects. Takingits cue from ordinary lending practices, the approach begins

17 For example, suppose a debtor purchases two identical used cars, buying the first at a low purchase price from a lender who charges high interest, and buying the second at a much higher purchase price from a lender
who charges zero-percent or nominal interest. Prebankruptcy, these two
loans might well produce identical income streams for the two lenders.
Postbankruptcy, however, the presumptive contract rate approach would
entitle the first lender to a considerably higher cramdown interest rate,
even though the two secured debts are objectively indistinguishable.

by looking to the national prime rate, reported daily in thepress, which reflects the financial market's estimate of the

amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthycommercial borrower to compensate for the opportunity
costs of the loan, the risk of inflation, and the relatively slightrisk of default.

18 Because bankrupt debtors typically pose a

greater risk of nonpayment than solvent commercial borrow-ers, the approach then requires a bankruptcy court to adjust

the prime rate accordingly. The appropriate size of thatrisk adjustment depends, of course, on such factors as the
circumstances of the estate, the nature of the security, andthe duration and feasibility of the reorganization plan. The
court must therefore hold a hearing at which the debtor andany creditors may present evidence about the appropriate
risk adjustment. Some of this evidence will be includedin the debtor's bankruptcy filings, however, so the debtor
and creditors may not incur significant additional expense.Moreover, starting from a concededly

low estimate and ad-justing
upward places the evidentiary burden squarely onthe creditors, who are likely to have readier access to any

information absent from the debtor's filing (such as evidenceabout the "liquidity of the collateral market," post, at 499
(Scalia, J., dissenting)). Finally, many of the factors rele-vant to the adjustment fall squarely within the bankruptcy
court's area of expertise.Thus, unlike the coerced loan, presumptive contract rate,
and cost of funds approaches, the formula approach entails astraightforward, familiar, and objective inquiry, and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional evidentiaryproceedings. Moreover, the resulting "prime-plus" rate of
interest depends only on the state of financial markets, thecircumstances of the bankruptcy estate, and the characteristics of the loan, not on the creditor's circumstances or itsprior interactions with the debtor. For these reasons, the

complete his plan, the prime rate would be adequate to compensate any

We do not decide the proper scale for the risk adjustment,as the issue is not before us. The Bankruptcy Court in this

case approved a risk adjustment of 1.5%, App. to Pet. forCert. 44a-73a, and other courts have generally approved adjustments of 1% to 3%, see In re Valenti, 105 F. 3d 55, 64(CA2) (collecting cases), abrogated on other grounds by

As-sociates Commercial Corp. v. Rash, 520 U. S. 953 (1997).

Respondent's core argument is that a risk adjustment in thisrange is entirely inadequate to compensate a creditor for the
real risk that the plan will fail. There is some dispute aboutthe true scale of that risk--respondent claims that more than
60% of Chapter 13 plans fail, Brief for Respondent 25, butpetitioners argue that the failure rate for approved Chapter
13 plans is much lower, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. We need notresolve that dispute. It is sufficient for our purposes to note
that, under 11 U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(6), a court may not approvea plan unless, after considering all creditors' objections and
receiving the advice of the trustee, the judge is persuadedthat "the debtor will be able to make all payments under the
plan and to comply with the plan." Ibid. Together withthe cramdown provision, this requirement obligates the
court to select a rate high enough to compensate the creditorfor its risk but not so high as to doom the plan. If the court
determines that the likelihood of default is so high as to ne19 The fact that Congress considered but rejected legislation that would

confirmed. V

The dissent's endorsement of the presumptive contractrate approach rests on two assumptions: (1) "subprime lending markets are competitive and therefore largely efficient";and (2) the risk of default in Chapter 13 is normally no less
than the risk of default at the time of the original loan.Post, at 492-493. Although the Bankruptcy Code provides
little guidance on the question, we think it highly unlikelythat Congress would endorse either premise.

First, the dissent assumes that subprime loans are negotiated between fully informed buyers and sellers in a classicfree market. But there is no basis for concluding that Congress relied on this assumption when it enacted Chapter13. Moreover, several considerations suggest that the subprime market is not, in fact, perfectly competitive. Tobegin with, used vehicles are regularly sold by means of
tie-in transactions, in which the price of the vehicle is thesubject of negotiation, while the terms of the financing are
dictated by the seller.20 In addition, there is extensive fed20 The dissent notes that "[t]ie-ins do not alone make financing markets
noncompetitive; they only cause prices and interest rates to be considered
in tandem rather than separately." Post, at 495. This statement, while
true, is nonresponsive. If a market prices the cost of goods and the cost
of financing together, then even if that market is perfectly competitive, all
we can know is that the combined price of the goods and the financing is
competitive and efficient. We have no way of determining whether the
allocation of that price between goods and financing would be the same if
the two components were separately negotiated. But the only issue before us is the cramdown interest rate (the cost of financing); the value of
respondent's truck (the cost of the goods) is fixed. See Rash, 520 U. S.,
at 960 (setting the value of collateral in Chapter 13 proceedings at the
"price a willing buyer in the debtor's trade, business, or situation would
pay to obtain like property from a willing seller"). The competitiveness
of the market for cost-cum-financing is thus irrelevant to our analysis.

eral 21 and state 22 regulation of subprime lending, which notonly itself distorts the market, but also evinces regulators'

belief that unregulated subprime lenders would exploit bor-rowers' ignorance and charge rates above what a competitive
market would allow.23 Indeed, Congress enacted the Truthin Lending Act in part because it believed "consumers would
individually benefit not only from the more informed use ofcredit, but also from heightened competition which would result from more knowledgeable credit shopping." S. Rep.No. 96-368, p. 16 (1979).

Second, the dissent apparently believes that the debtor'sprebankruptcy default--on a loan made in a market in which

creditors commonly charge the maximum rate of interest al-lowed by law, Brief for Respondent 16, and in which neither
creditors nor debtors have the protections afforded by Chap-ter 13--translates into a high probability that the same debtor's confirmed Chapter 13 plan will fail. In our view, how-ever, Congress intended to create a program under which
plans that qualify for confirmation have a high probability ofsuccess. Perhaps bankruptcy judges currently confirm too

and credit advertising. 15 U. S. C. $$ 1604-1649, 1661-1665b.

23 Lending practices in Mississippi, "where there currently is no legal

usury rate," support this conclusion: In that State, subprime lenders
charge rates "as high as 30 to 40%"--well above the rates that apparently
suffice to support the industry in States like Indiana. Norberg, Consumer

many risky plans, but the solution is to confirm fewer suchplans, not to set default cramdown rates at absurdly high

levels, thereby increasing the risk of default.Indeed, as

Justice Thomas demonstrates, post, at 487(opinion concurring in judgment), the text of $ 1325(a)(5)

(B)(ii) may be read to support the conclusion that Congressdid not intend the cramdown rate to include

any compensa-tion for the risk of default.
25 That reading is consistent with

a view that Congress believed Chapter 13's protections to beso effective as to make the risk of default negligible. Because our decision in Rash assumes that cramdown interestrates are adjusted to "offset," to the extent possible, the risk
of default, 520 U. S., at 962-963, and because so many judgeswho have considered the issue (including the authors of the
four earlier opinions in this case) have rejected the risk-freeapproach, we think it too late in the day to endorse that
approach now. Of course, if the text of the statute requiredsuch an approach, that would be the end of the matter. We
think, however, that $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii)'s reference to "value,as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan" is better read to incorporate all of thecommonly understood components of "present value," including any risk of nonpayment. Justice Thomas' reading doesemphasize, though, that a presumption that bankruptcy
plans will succeed is more consistent with Congress' statu-tory scheme than the dissent's more cynical focus on bankrupt debtors' "financial instability and . . . proclivity to seeklegal protection," post, at 493.

Furthermore, the dissent's two assumptions do not neces-sarily favor the presumptive contract rate approach. For
one thing, the cramdown provision applies not only to sub25 The United States, too, notes that "[t]he text of Section 1325 is consistent with the view that the appropriate discount rate should reflect only
the time value of money and not any risk premium." Brief for United

brief, however, advocates the formula approach. See, e. g., id., at 19-28.

prime loans but also to prime loans negotiated prior to the
change in circumstance ( job loss, for example) that rendered
the debtor insolvent. Relatedly, the provision also applies
in instances in which national or local economic conditions
drastically improved or declined after the original loan was
issued but before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. In either
case, there is every reason to think that a properly riskadjusted prime rate will provide a better estimate of the
creditor's current costs and exposure than a contract rate set
in different times.

Even more important, if all relevant information about the
debtor's circumstances, the creditor's circumstances, the nature of the collateral, and the market for comparable loans
were equally available to both debtor and creditor, then
in theory the formula and presumptive contract rate approaches would yield the same final interest rate. Thus, we
principally differ with the dissent not over what final rate
courts should adopt but over which party (creditor or debtor)
should bear the burden of rebutting the presumptive rate
(prime or contract, respectively).

Justice Scalia identifies four "relevant factors bearing
on risk premium[:] (1) the probability of plan failure; (2) the
rate of collateral depreciation; (3) the liquidity of the collateral market; and (4) the administrative expenses of enforcement." Post, at 499. In our view, any information debtors
have about any of these factors is likely to be included in
their bankruptcy filings, while the remaining information
will be far more accessible to creditors (who must collect information about their lending markets to remain competitive) than to individual debtors (whose only experience with
those markets might be the single loan at issue in the case).
Thus, the formula approach, which begins with a concededly
low estimate of the appropriate interest rate and requires
the creditor to present evidence supporting a higher rate,
places the evidentiary burden on the more knowledgeable

If the rather sketchy data uncovered by the dissent sup-port an argument that Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code
should mandate application of the presumptive contract rateapproach (rather than merely an argument that bankruptcy
judges should exercise greater caution before approving debt
adjustment plans), those data should be forwarded to Con-gress. We are not persuaded, however, that the data undermine our interpretation of the statutory scheme Congresshas enacted.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and thecase is remanded with instructions to remand the case to the
Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
This case presents the issue of what the proper method is
for discounting deferred payments to present value and what
compensation the creditor is entitled to in calculating the
appropriate discount rate of interest. Both the plurality
and the dissent agree that "[a] debtor's promise of future
payments is worth less than an immediate payment of the
same total amount because the creditor cannot use the
money right away, inflation may cause the value of the dollar
to decline before the debtor pays, and there is always some
risk of nonpayment." Ante, at 474; post, at 491. Thus, the
plurality and the dissent agree that the proper method for
discounting deferred payments to present value should take
into account each of these factors, but disagree over the
proper starting point for calculating the risk of nonpayment.

I agree that a "promise of future payments is worth less
than an immediate payment" of the same amount, in part
because of the risk of nonpayment. But this fact is irrelevant. The statute does not require that the value of the

be no less than the amount of the secured creditor's claim.11 U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Both the
plurality and the dissent ignore the clear text of the statutein an apparent rush to ensure that secured creditors are not

Section 1325(a)(5)(B) provides that "with respect to each al-lowed secured claim provided for by the plan," "the value,
as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distrib-uted under the plan on account of such claim [must] not [be]
less than the allowed amount of such claim." Thus, the stat-ute requires a bankruptcy court to make at least three separate determinations. First, a court must determine the al-lowed amount of the claim. Second, a court must determine
what is the "property to be distributed under the plan."Third, a court must determine the "value, as of the effective

determined "as of the effective date of the plan" incorporatesthe principle of the time value of money. To put it simply,

$4,000 today is worth more than $4,000 to be received 17months from today because if received today, the $4,000 can
be invested to start earning interest immediately.1 See G.Munn, F. Garcia, & C. Woelfel, Encyclopedia of Banking &
Finance 1015 (rev. 9th ed. 1991). Thus, as we explained in
Rake v. Wade, 508 U. S. 464 (1993), "[w]hen a claim is paidoff pursuant to a stream of future payments, a creditor receives the `present value' of its claim only if the total amountof the deferred payments includes the amount of the underlying claim plus an appropriate amount of interest to compen-sate the creditor for the decreased value of the claim caused
by the delayed payments." Id., at 472, n. 8.Respondent argues, and the plurality and the dissent
agree, that the proper interest rate must also reflect the riskof nonpayment. But the statute contains no such requirement. The statute only requires the valuation of the "prop-erty to be distributed," not the valuation of the plan (

i. e.,the promise to make the payments itself). Thus, in order

for a plan to satisfy $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii), the plan need only pro-pose an interest rate that will compensate a creditor for the
fact that if he had received the property immediately ratherthan at a future date, he could have immediately made use
of the property. In most, if not all, cases, where the planproposes simply a stream of cash payments, the appropriate
risk-free rate should suffice.Respondent here would certainly be acutely aware of any
risk of default inherent in a Chapter 13 plan, but it is nonsen-sical to speak of a debtor's risk of default being inherent in
the value of "property" unless that property is a promise or

words, an investor would be indifferent to receiving $3,636.36 today and
receiving $4,000 one year from now because each will equal $4,000 one

a debt. Suppose, for instance, that it is currently time A,the property to be distributed is a house, and it will be

distributed at time B. Although market conditions mightcause the value of the house to fluctuate between time A and
time B, the fluctuating value of the house itself has nothingto do with the risk that the debtor will not deliver the house
at time B. The value of the house, then, can be and is deter-mined entirely without any reference to any possibility that
a promise to transfer the house would not be honored. Sotoo, then, with cash: the value of the cash can be and is determined without any inclusion of any risk that the debtor willfail to transfer the cash at the appropriate time.

The dissent might be correct that the use of the primerate,

2 even with a small risk adjustment, "will systematically

undercompensate secured creditors for the true risks of de-fault."

Post, at 492.3 This systematic undercompensationmight seem problematic as a matter of policy. But, it raises

no problem as a matter of statutory interpretation. Thus,although there is always some risk of nonpayment when A
promises to repay a debt to B through a stream of paymentsover time rather than through an immediate lump-sum payment, $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not take this risk into account.This is not to say that a debtor's risk of nonpayment can
never be a factor in determining the value of the propertyto be distributed. Although "property" is not defined in the
Bankruptcy Code, nothing in $ 1325 suggests that "property"is limited to cash. Rather, " `property' can be cash, notes,
stock, personal property or real property; in short, anythingof value. " 7 Collier on Bankruptcy || 1129.03[7][b][i],

under a Chapter 13 plan is a note (i. e., a promise to pay), forinstance, the value of that note necessarily includes the risk

that the debtor will not make good on that promise. Still,accounting for the risk of nonpayment in that case is not
equivalent to reading a risk adjustment requirement into thestatute, as in the case of a note, the risk of nonpayment is

creditors, not debtors," and thus that the relevant interest ratemust account for the true risks and costs associated with a

Chapter 13 debtor's promise of future payment. Brief for
Respondent 24 (citing Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S.
78, 87-88 (1991)). In addition to ignoring the plain language
of the statute, which requires no such risk adjustment,
respondent overlooks the fact that secured creditors are
already compensated in part for the risk of nonpayment
through the valuation of the secured claim. In Associates
Commercial Corp. v. Rash, 520 U. S. 953 (1997), we utilized a
secured-creditor-friendly replacement-value standard rather
than the lower foreclosure-value standard for valuing secured claims when a debtor has exercised Chapter 13's cramdown option. We did so because the statute at issue in that
case reflected Congress' recognition that "[i]f a debtor keeps
the property and continues to use it, the creditor obtains at
once neither the property nor its value and is exposed to
double risks: The debtor may again default and the property
may deteriorate from extended use." Id., at 962.

Further, the plain language of the statute is by no means
specifically debtor protective. As the Court pointed out in
Johnson, supra, at 87-88, $ 1325 contains a number of provisions to protect creditors: A bankruptcy court can only
authorize a plan that "has been proposed in good faith,"

$ 1325(a)(3); secured creditors must accept the plan, obtain
the property securing the claim, or "retain the[ir] lien[s]" and
receive under the plan distributions of property which equal

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
"not less than the allowed amount of such claim," $ 1325(a)(5);and a bankruptcy court must ensure that "the debtor will be

able to make all payments under the plan and to comply withthe plan," $ 1325(a)(6). Given the presence of multiple
creditor-specific protections, it is by no means irrational toassume that Congress opted not to provide further protection for creditors by requiring a debtor-specific risk adjust-ment under $ 1325(a)(5). Although the dissent may feel that
this is insufficient compensation for secured creditors, giventhe apparent rate at which debtors fail to complete their
Chapter 13 plans, see post, at 493, and n. 1, this is a matterthat should be brought to the attention of Congress rather
than resolved by this Court.

II
The allowed amount of the secured claim is $4,000. App.57. The statute then requires a bankruptcy court to identify

the "property to be distributed" under the plan. Petition-ers' Amended Chapter 13 Plan (Plan) provided:

"The future earnings of DEBTOR(S) are submitted tothe supervision and control of this Court, and DEBTOR(S) shall pay to the TRUSTEE a sum of $740 . . . permonth in weekly installments by voluntary wage assignment by separate ORDER of the Court in an estimatedamount of $170.77 and continuing for a total plan term
of 36 months unless this Court approves an extension ofthe term not beyond 60 months from the date of filing
the Petition herein." App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a.
From the payments received, the trustee would then makedisbursements to petitioners' creditors, pro rata among each

class of creditors. The Plan listed one priority claim andfour secured claims. For respondent's secured claim, petitioners proposed an interest rate of 9.5%. App. 57. Thus,petitioners proposed to distribute to respondent a stream of
cash payments equaling respondent's pro rata share of $740per month for a period of up to 36 months.

Although the Plan does not specifically state that "theproperty to be distributed" under the Plan is cash payments,

the cash payments are the only "property" specifically listedfor distribution under the Plan. Thus, although the plurality and the dissent imply that the "property to be distrib-uted" under the Plan is the mere

promise to make cash payments, the plain language of the Plan indicates that the
"property to be distributed" to respondent is up to 36monthly cash payments, consisting of a pro rata share of $740

per month.The final task, then, is to determine whether petitioners'
proposed 9.5% interest rate will sufficiently compensate re-spondent for the fact that instead of receiving $4,000 today,
it will receive $4,000 plus 9.5% interest over a period of up
to 36 months. Because the 9.5% rate is higher than the
risk-free rate, I conclude that it will. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

My areas of agreement with the plurality are substantial.
We agree that, although all confirmed Chapter 13 plans have
been deemed feasible by a bankruptcy judge, some nevertheless fail. See ante, at 480. We agree that any deferred payments to a secured creditor must fully compensate it for the
risk that such a failure will occur. See ante, at 474. Finally, we agree that adequate compensation may sometimes
require an " `eye-popping' " interest rate, and that, if the rate
is too high for the plan to succeed, the appropriate course is
not to reduce it to a more palatable level, but to refuse to
confirm the plan. See ante, at 480-481.

Our only disagreement is over what procedure will more
often produce accurate estimates of the appropriate interest
rate. The plurality would use the prime lending rate--a
rate we know is too low--and require the judge in every case
to determine an amount by which to increase it. I believe

Scalia, J., dissenting
that, in practice, this approach will systematically undercom-pensate secured creditors for the true risks of default.

I would instead adopt the contract rate--i. e., the rate atwhich the creditor actually loaned funds to the debtor--as a
presumption that the bankruptcy judge could revise on mo-tion of either party. Since that rate is generally a good indicator of actual risk, disputes should be infrequent, and it willprovide a quick and reasonably accurate standard.

I
The contract-rate approach makes two assumptions, bothof which are reasonable. First, it assumes that subprime

lending markets are competitive and therefore largely effi-cient. If so, the high interest rates lenders charge reflect
not extortionate profits or excessive costs, but the actualrisks of default that subprime borrowers present. Lenders
with excessive rates would be undercut by their competitors,and inefficient ones would be priced out of the market. We
have implicitly assumed market competitiveness in otherbankruptcy contexts. See

Bank of America Nat. Trust andSav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U. S.

434, 456-458 (1999). Here the assumption is borne out byempirical evidence: One study reports that subprime lenders
are nearly twice as likely to be unprofitable as banks, sug-gesting a fiercely competitive environment. See J. Lane,
Associate Director, Division of Supervision, Federal DepositInsurance Corporation, A Regulator's View of Subprime
Lending: Address at the National Automotive Finance Asso-ciation Non-Prime Auto Lending Conference 6 (June 18-19,
2002) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). By relying onthe prime rate, the plurality implicitly assumes that the
prime lending market is efficient, see ante, at 478-479; I seeno reason not to make a similar assumption about the

sub-prime lending market.

The second assumption is that the expected costs of de-fault in Chapter 13 are normally no less than those at the

Scalia, J., dissenting
time of lending. This assumption is also reasonable. Chap-ter 13 plans often fail. I agree with petitioners that the relevant statistic is the percentage of confirmed plans that fail,but even resolving that issue in their favor, the risk is still
substantial. The failure rate they offer--which we maytake to be a conservative estimate, as it is doubtless the lowest one they could find--is 37%. See Girth, The Role of Em-pirical Data in Developing Bankruptcy Legislation for Individuals, 65 Ind. L. J. 17, 40-42 (1989) (reporting a 63.1%success rate).

1 In every one of the failed plans making up

that 37%, a bankruptcy judge had found that "the debtor willbe able to make all payments under the plan," 11 U. S. C.

$ 1325(a)(6), and a trustee had supervised the debtor's com-pliance, $ 1302. That so many nonetheless failed proves that
bankruptcy judges are not oracles and that trustees cannotdraw blood from a stone.

While court and trustee oversight may provide some mar-ginal benefit to the creditor, it seems obviously outweighed
by the fact that (1) an already-bankrupt borrower has dem-onstrated a financial instability and a proclivity to seek legal
protection that other subprime borrowers have not, and

1 The true rate of plan failure is almost certainly much higher. The
Girth study that yielded the 37% figure was based on data for a single
division (Buffalo, New York) from over 20 years ago (1980-1982). See 65
Ind. L. J., at 41. A later study concluded that "the Buffalo division ha[d]
achieved extraordinary results, far from typical for the country as a
whole." Whitford, The Ideal of Individualized Justice: Consumer Bankruptcy as Consumer Protection, and Consumer Protection in Consumer
Bankruptcy, 68 Am. Bankr. L. J. 397, 411, n. 50 (1994). Although most
of respondent's figures are based on studies that do not clearly exclude
unconfirmed plans, one study includes enough detail to make the necessary
correction: It finds 32% of filings successful, 18% dismissed without confirmation of a plan, and 49% dismissed after confirmation, for a postconfirmation failure rate of 60% (i. e., 49%\Delta (32%\Theta 49%)). See Norberg, Consumer Bankruptcy's New Clothes: An Empirical Study of Discharge and
Debt Collection in Chapter 13, 7 Am. Bankr. Inst. L. Rev. 415, 440-441
(1999). This 60% failure rate is far higher than the 37% reported by
Girth.

(2) the costs of foreclosure are substantially higher in bankruptcy because the automatic stay bars repossession without
judicial permission. See $ 362. It does not strike me as
plausible that creditors would prefer to lend to individuals
already in bankruptcy than to those for whom bankruptcy is
merely a possibility--as if Chapter 13 were widely viewed
by secured creditors as some sort of godsend. Cf. Dunagan,
Enforcement of Security Interests in Motor Vehicles in
Bankruptcy, 52 Consumer Fin. L. Q. Rep. 191, 197 (1998).
Certainly the record in this case contradicts that implausible
proposition. See App. 48 (testimony of Craig Cook, sales
manager of Instant Auto Finance) ("Q. Are you aware of how
other lenders similar to Instant Auto Finance view credit
applicants who appear to be candidates for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?" "A. Negative[ly] as well"). The better assumption is that bankrupt debtors are riskier than other subprime
debtors--or, at the very least, not systematically less risky.

The first of the two assumptions means that the contract
rate reasonably reflects actual risk at the time of borrowing.
The second means that this risk persists when the debtor
files for Chapter 13. It follows that the contract rate is a
decent estimate, or at least the lower bound, for the appropriate interest rate in cramdown.2

The plurality disputes these two assumptions. It argues
that subprime lending markets are not competitive because
"vehicles are regularly sold by means of tie-in transactions,
in which the price of the vehicle is the subject of negotiation,
while the terms of the financing are dictated by the seller."

2 The contract rate is only a presumption, however, and either party
remains free to prove that a higher or lower rate is appropriate in a particular case. For example, if market interest rates generally have risen or
fallen since the contract was executed, the contract rate could be adjusted
by the same amount in cases where the difference was substantial enough
that a party chose to make an issue of it.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Ante, at 481.3 Tie-ins do not alone make financing markets
noncompetitive; they only cause prices and interest rates to
be considered in tandem rather than separately. The force
of the plurality's argument depends entirely on its claim that
"the terms of the financing are dictated by the seller." Ibid.
This unsubstantiated assertion is contrary to common experience. Car sellers routinely advertise their interest rates,
offer promotions like "zero-percent financing," and engage in
other behavior that plainly assumes customers are sensitive
to interest rates and not just price.4

3 To the extent the plurality argues that subprime lending markets are
not "perfectly competitive," ante, at 481 (emphasis added), I agree. But
there is no reason to doubt they are reasonably competitive, so that pricing in those markets is reasonably efficient.

4 I confess that this is "nonresponsive" to the argument made in the

plurality's footnote (that the contract interest rate may not accurately reflect risk when set jointly with a car's sale price), see ante, at 481, n. 20;
it is in response to the quite different argument made in the plurality's
text (that joint pricing shows that the subprime lending market is not
competitive), see ante, at 481. As to the former issue, the plurality's footnote makes a fair point. When the seller provides financing itself, there
is a possibility that the contract interest rate might not reflect actual risk
because a higher contract interest rate can be traded off for a lower sale
price and vice versa. Nonetheless, this fact is not likely to bias the
contract-rate approach in favor of creditors to any significant degree. If
a creditor offers a promotional interest rate--such as "zero-percent financing"--in return for a higher sale price, the creditor bears the burden of
showing that the true interest rate is higher than the contract rate. The
opposite tactic--inflating the interest rate and decreasing the sale price--
is constrained at some level by the buyer's option to finance through a
third party, thus taking advantage of the lower price while avoiding the
higher interest rate. (If a seller were to condition a price discount on
providing the financing itself, the debtor should be entitled to rely on that
condition to rebut the presumption that the contract rate reflects actual
risk.) Finally, the debtor remains free to rebut the contract rate with
any other probative evidence. While joint pricing may introduce some
inaccuracy, the contract rate is still a far better initial estimate than the
prime rate.

The plurality also points to state and federal regulationof lending markets. Ante, at 481-482. It claims that state

usury laws evince a belief that subprime lending markets arenoncompetitive. While that is one conceivable explanation
for such laws, there are countless others. One statisticaland historical study suggests that usury laws are a "primitive means of social insurance" meant to ensure "low interestrates" for those who suffer financial adversity. Glaeser &
Scheinkman, Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be: An Eco-nomic Analysis of Interest Restrictions and Usury Laws, 41
J. Law & Econ. 1, 26 (1998). Such a rationale does not re-flect a belief that lending markets are inefficient, any more
than rent controls reflect a belief that real estate marketsare inefficient. Other historical rationales likewise shed no
light on the point at issue here. See id., at 27. The mereexistence of usury laws is therefore weak support for any
position.The federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1601

et seq.,not only fails to support the plurality's position; it positively

refutes it. The plurality claims the Act reflects a belief thatfull disclosure promotes competition, see

ante, at 482, andn. 24; the Act itself says as much, see 15 U. S. C. $ 1601(a).

But that belief obviously presumes markets are competitive(or, at least, that they were noncompetitive only because of
the absence of the disclosures the Act now requires). Iflending markets were not competitive--if the terms of financing were indeed "dictated by the seller," ante, at 481--disclosure requirements would be pointless, since consumers
would have no use for the information.5As to the second assumption (that the expected costs of
default in Chapter 13 are normally no less than those at the

5 The plurality also argues that regulatory context is relevant because
it "distorts the market." Ante, at 482. Federal disclosure requirements
do not distort the market in any meaningful sense. And while state usury
laws do, that distortion works only to the benefit of debtors under the
contract-rate approach, since it keeps contract rates artificially low.

time of lending), the plurality responds, not that Chapter 13as currently administered is less risky than subprime lending generally, but that it would be less risky, if only bank-ruptcy courts would confirm fewer risky plans. Ante, at
482-483. Of course, it is often quite difficult to predictwhich plans will fail. See Norberg, Consumer Bankruptcy's
New Clothes: An Empirical Study of Discharge and DebtCollection in Chapter 13, 7 Am. Bankr. Inst. L. Rev. 415, 462
(1999). But even assuming the high failure rate primarilyreflects judicial dereliction rather than unavoidable uncertainty, the plurality's argument fails for want of any reasonto believe the dereliction will abate. While full compensation can be attained either by low-risk plans and low interestrates, or by high-risk plans and high interest rates, it cannot
be attained by high-risk plans and low interest rates, which,absent cause to anticipate a change in confirmation practices,
is precisely what the formula approach would yield.The plurality also claims that the contract rate overcompensates creditors because it includes "transaction costs andoverall profits." Ante, at 477. But the same is true of the
rate the plurality prescribes: The prime lending rate includesbanks' overhead and profits. These are necessary components of any commercial lending rate, since creditors will notlend money if they cannot cover their costs and return a level
of profit sufficient to prevent their investors from going else-where. See Koopmans v. Farm Credit Services of MidAmerica, ACA, 102 F. 3d 874, 876 (CA7 1996). The plural-ity's criticism might have force if there were reason to
believe subprime lenders made exorbitant profits whilebanks did not--but, again, the data suggest otherwise. See
Lane, Regulator's View of Subprime Lending, at 6.6

6 Some transaction costs are avoided by the creditor in bankruptcy--for
example, loan-origination costs such as advertising. But these are likely
only a minor component of the interest rate. According to the record in
this case, for example, the average interest rate on new-car loans was
roughly 8.5%--only about 0.5% higher than the prime rate and 2.5% higher

498 TILL v. SCS CREDIT CORP.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Finally, the plurality objects that similarly situated credi-tors might not be treated alike. Ante, at 478, and n. 17.

But the contract rate is only a presumption. If a judgethinks it necessary to modify the rate to avoid unjustified
disparity, he can do so. For example, if two creditorscharged different rates solely because they lent to the debtor
at different times, the judge could average the rates or usethe more recent one. The plurality's argument might be
valid against an approach that irrebuttably presumes thecontract rate, but that is not what I propose.

II
The defects of the formula approach far outweigh thoseof the contract-rate approach. The formula approach starts

with the prime lending rate--a number that, while objectiveand easily ascertainable, is indisputably too low. It then adthan the risk-free treasury rate. App. 43 (testimony of Professor Steve
Russell). And the 2% difference between prime and treasury rates represented "mostly . . . risk [and] to some extent transaction costs." Id., at 42.
These figures suggest that loan-origination costs included in the new-car
loan and prime rates but not in the treasury rate are likely only a fraction
of a percent. There is no reason to think they are substantially higher in
the subprime auto lending market. Any transaction costs the creditor
avoids in bankruptcy are thus far less than the additional ones he incurs.

7 The plurality's other, miscellaneous criticisms do not survive scrutiny

either. That the cramdown provision applies to prime as well as subprime loans, ante, at 483-484, proves nothing. Nor is there any substance
to the argument that the formula approach will perform better where
"national or local economic conditions drastically improved or declined
after the original loan was issued." Ante, at 484. To the extent such
economic changes are reflected by changes in the prime rate, the contract
rate can be adjusted by the same amount. See n. 2, supra. And to the
extent they are not, they present the same problem under either approach:
When a party disputes the presumption, the court must gauge the significance of the economic change and adjust accordingly. The difference,
again, is that the contract-rate approach starts with a number that (but
for the economic change) is reasonably accurate, while the formula approach starts with a number that (with or without the economic change)
is not even close.

justs by adding a risk premium that, unlike the prime rate,
is neither objective nor easily ascertainable. If the risk premium is typically small relative to the prime rate--as the
1.5% premium added to the 8% prime rate by the court below
would lead one to believe--then this subjective element of
the computation might be forgiven. But in fact risk premiums, if properly computed, would typically be substantial.
For example, if the 21% contract rate is an accurate reflection of risk in this case, the risk premium would be 13%--
nearly two-thirds of the total interest rate. When the risk
premium is the greater part of the overall rate, the formula
approach no longer depends on objective and easily ascertainable numbers. The prime rate becomes the objective
tail wagging a dog of unknown size.

As I explain below, the most relevant factors bearing on
risk premium are (1) the probability of plan failure; (2) the
rate of collateral depreciation; (3) the liquidity of the collateral market; and (4) the administrative expenses of enforcement. Under the formula approach, a risk premium must
be computed in every case, so judges will invariably grapple with these imponderables. Under the contract-rate approach, by contrast, the task of assessing all these risk factors is entrusted to the entity most capable of undertaking
it: the market. See Bank of America, 526 U. S., at 457
("[T]he best way to determine value is exposure to a market"). All the risk factors are reflected (assuming market
efficiency) in the debtor's contract rate--a number readily
found in the loan document. If neither party disputes it, the
bankruptcy judge's task is at an end. There are straightforward ways a debtor could dispute it--for example, by showing that the creditor is now substantially oversecured, or
that some other lender is willing to extend credit at a lower
rate. But unlike the formula approach, which requires difficult estimation in every case, the contract-rate approach
requires it only when the parties choose to contest the issue.

The plurality defends the formula approach on the groundthat creditors have better access to the relevant information.

Ante, at 484-485. But this is not a case where we mustchoose between one initial estimate that is too low and another that is too high. Rather, the choice is between onethat is far too low and another that is generally reasonably
accurate (or, if anything, a bit too low). In these circumstances, consciously choosing the less accurate estimatemerely because creditors have better information smacks

more of policymaking than of faithful adherence to the statu-tory command that the secured creditor receive property
worth "not less than the allowed amount" of its claim, 11
U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Moreover, the
plurality's argument assumes it is plausible--and desirable--
that the issue will be litigated in most cases. But the costs
of conducting a detailed risk analysis and defending it in
court are prohibitively high in relation to the amount at
stake in most consumer loan cases. Whatever approach we
prescribe, the norm should be--and undoubtedly will be--
that the issue is not litigated because it is not worth litigating. Given this reality, it is far more important that the
initial estimate be accurate than that the burden of proving
inaccuracy fall on the better informed party.

There is no better demonstration of the inadequacies of
the formula approach than the proceedings in this case.
Petitioners' economics expert testified that the 1.5% risk premium was "very reasonable" because Chapter 13 plans are
"supposed to be financially feasible" and "the borrowers are
under the supervision of the court." App. 43. Nothing in
the record shows how these two platitudes were somehow
manipulated to arrive at a figure of 1.5%. It bears repeating
that feasibility determinations and trustee oversight do not
prevent at least 37% of confirmed Chapter 13 plans from failing. On cross-examination, the expert admitted that he had
only limited familiarity with the subprime auto lending market and that he was not familiar with the default rates or the

costs of collection in that market. Id., at 44-45. In light ofthese devastating concessions, it is impossible to view the

1.5% figure as anything other than a smallish number pickedout of a hat.

Based on even a rudimentary financial analysis of the factsof this case, the 1.5% figure is obviously wrong--not just off
by a couple percent, but probably by roughly an order ofmagnitude. For a risk premium to be adequate, a hypothetical, rational creditor must be indifferent between accepting(1) the proposed risky stream of payments over time and
(2) immediate payment of its present value in a lump sum.Whether he is indifferent--

i. e., whether the risk premiumadded to the prime rate is adequate--can be gauged by comparing benefits and costs: on the one hand, the expectedvalue of the extra interest, and on the other, the expected
costs of default.Respondent was offered a risk premium of 1.5% on top of
the prime rate of 8%. If that premium were fully paid asthe plan contemplated, it would yield about $60.

8 If the

debtor defaulted, all or part of that interest would not bepaid, so the expected value is only about $50.

9 The prime

rate itself already includes some compensation for risk; as itturns out, about the same amount, yielding another $50.

10

8 Given its priority, and in light of the amended plan's reduced debtor
contributions, the $4,000 secured claim would be fully repaid by about the
end of the second year of the plan. The average balance over that period
would be about $2,000, i. e., half the initial balance. The total interest
premium would therefore be 1.5%\Lambda 2\Lambda $2,000\Xi $60. In this and all following calculations, I do not adjust for time value, as timing effects have
no substantial effect on the conclusion.

9 Assuming a 37% rate of default that results on average in only half the

interest's being paid, the expected value is $60\Lambda (1\Pi 37%\Delta 2), or about $50.

10 According to the record in this case, the prime rate at the time

of filing was 2% higher than the risk-free treasury rate, and the difference represented "mostly . . . risk [and] to some extent transaction
costs." App. 42 (testimony of Professor Steve Russell); see also Federal

Given the 1.5% risk premium, then, the total expected bene-fit to respondent was about $100. Against this we must

weigh the expected costs of default. While precise calcula-tions are impossible, rough estimates convey a sense of
their scale.The first cost of default involves depreciation. If the
debtor defaults, the creditor can eventually repossess andsell the collateral, but by then it may be substantially less
valuable than the remaining balance due--and the debtormay stop paying long before the creditor receives permission
to repossess. When petitioners purchased their truck inthis case, its value was almost equal to the principal balance
on the loan.11 By the time the plan was confirmed, however,the truck was worth only $4,000, while the balance on the
loan was $4,895. If petitioners were to default on their
Chapter 13 payments and if respondent suffered the samerelative loss from depreciation, it would amount to about

$550.12

The second cost of default involves liquidation. The$4,000 to which respondent would be entitled if paid in a

lump sum reflects the replacement value of the vehicle, i. e.,the amount it would cost the debtor to purchase a similar
used truck. See Associates Commercial Corp. v. Rash, 520U. S. 953, 965 (1997). If the debtor defaults, the creditor
cannot sell the truck for that amount; it receives only a lesser
Court's case file) (historical data showing prime rate typically exceeding
3-month constant-maturity treasury rate by 2%-3.5%). If "mostly"
means about three-quarters of 2%, then the risk compensation included in
the prime rate is 1.5%. Because this figure happens to be the same as
the risk premium over prime, the expected value is similarly $50. See

11 The truck was initially worth $6,395; the principal balance on the loan

was about $6,426.

12 On the original loan, depreciation ($6,395\Pi $4,000, or $2,395) exceeded

loan repayment ($6,426\Pi $4,895, or $1,531) by $864, i. e., 14% of the original
truck value of $6,395. Applying the same percentage to the new $4,000
truck value yields approximately $550.

foreclosure value because collateral markets are not per-fectly liquid and there is thus a spread between what a buyer

will pay and what a seller will demand. The foreclosurevalue of petitioners' truck is not in the record, but, using the
relative liquidity figures in Rash as a rough guide, respond-ent would suffer a further loss of about $450.

The third cost of default consists of the administrative ex-penses of foreclosure. While a Chapter 13 plan is in effect,

the automatic stay prevents secured creditors from repos-sessing their collateral, even if the debtor fails to pay. See
11 U. S. C. $ 362. The creditor's attorney must move thebankruptcy court to lift the stay. $ 362(d). In the District
where this case arose, the filing fee for such motions is now$150. See United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Schedule of Bankruptcy Fees (Nov.1, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). And the
standard attorney's fee for such motions, according to onesurvey, is $350 in Indiana and as high as $875 in other States.
See J. Cossitt, Chapter 13 Attorney Fee Survey, AmericanBankruptcy Institute Annual Spring Meeting (Apr. 10-13,
2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). Moreover,bankruptcy judges will often excuse first offenses, so foreclosure may require multiple trips to court. The total ex-pected administrative expenses in the event of default could
reasonably be estimated at $600 or more.I have omitted several other costs of default, but the point
is already adequately made. The three figures above total$1,600. Even accepting petitioners' low estimate of the plan
failure rate, a creditor choosing the stream of future pay-ments instead of the immediate lump sum would be selecting
an alternative with an expected cost of about $590 ($1,600multiplied by 37%, the chance of failure) and an expected

this case had similar liquidity and the truck were repossessed after losing
half its remaining value, the loss would be 22% of $2,000, or about $450.

benefit of about $100 (as computed above). No rational
creditor would make such a choice. The risk premium over
prime necessary to make these costs and benefits equal is in
the neighborhood of 16%, for a total interest rate of 24%.14

Of course, many of the estimates I have made can be disputed. Perhaps the truck will depreciate more slowly now
than at first, perhaps the collateral market is more liquid
than the one in Rash, perhaps respondent can economize on
attorney's fees, and perhaps there is some reason (other than
judicial optimism) to think the Tills were unlikely to default.
I have made some liberal assumptions,15 but also some conservative ones.16 When a risk premium is off by an order of
magnitude, one's estimates need not be very precise to show
that it cannot possibly be correct.

In sum, the 1.5% premium adopted in this case is far below
anything approaching fair compensation. That result is not
unusual, see, e. g., In re Valenti, 105 F. 3d 55, 64 (CA2 1997)
(recommending a 1%-3% premium over the treasury rate--
i. e., approximately a 0% premium over prime); it is the entirely predictable consequence of a methodology that tells
bankruptcy judges to set interest rates based on highly imponderable factors. Given the inherent uncertainty of the
enterprise, what heartless bankruptcy judge can be expected
to demand that the unfortunate debtor pay triple the prime
rate as a condition of keeping his sole means of transportation? It challenges human nature.

14 A 1.5% risk premium plus a 1.5% risk component in the prime rate
yielded an expected benefit of about $100, see supra, at 501-502, so, to
yield $590, the total risk compensation would have to be 5.9 times as high,
i. e., almost 18%, or a 16.5% risk premium over prime.

15 For example, by ignoring the possibility that the creditor might recover some of its undersecurity as an unsecured claimant, that the plan
might fail only after full repayment of secured claims, or that an oversecured creditor might recover some of its expenses under 11 U. S. C. $ 506(b).

16 For example, by assuming a failure rate of 37%, cf. n. 1, supra, and by

ignoring all costs of default other than the three mentioned.

Justice Thomas rejects both the formula approach and
the contract-rate approach. He reads the statutory phrase
"property to be distributed under the plan," 11 U. S. C.

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii), to mean the proposed payments if made
as the plan contemplates, so that the plan need only pay the
risk-free rate of interest. Ante, at 487 (opinion concurring
in judgment). I would instead read this phrase to mean the
right to receive payments that the plan vests in the creditor
upon confirmation. Because there is no guarantee that the
promised payments will in fact be made, the value of this
property right must account for the risk of nonpayment.

Viewed in isolation, the phrase is susceptible of either
meaning. Both the promise to make payments and the proposed payments themselves are property rights, the former
"to be distributed under the plan" immediately upon confirmation, and the latter over the life of the plan. Context,
however, supports my reading. The cramdown option which
the debtors employed here is only one of three routes to confirmation. The other two--creditor acceptance and collateral surrender, $$ 1325(a)(5)(A), (C)--are both creditor protective, leaving the secured creditor roughly as well off as
he would have been had the debtor not sought bankruptcy
protection. Given this, it is unlikely the third option was
meant to be substantially underprotective; that would render it so much more favorable to debtors that few would ever
choose one of the alternatives.

The risk-free approach also leads to anomalous results.
Justice Thomas admits that, if a plan distributes a note
rather than cash, the value of the "property to be distributed" must reflect the risk of default on the note. Ante, at
488-489. But there is no practical difference between obligating the debtor to make deferred payments under a plan
and obligating the debtor to sign a note that requires those
same payments. There is no conceivable reason why Con541US2 Unit: $U47 [05-08-06 21:08:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gress would give secured creditors risk compensation in onecase but not the other.

Circuit authority uniformly rejects the risk-free approach.While Circuits addressing the issue are divided over

how to
calculate risk, to my knowledge all of them require somecompensation for risk, either explicitly or implicitly. See

Collier on Bankruptcy || 1325.06[3][b], p. 1325-37 (rev. 15th
ed. 2004). Justice Thomas identifies no decision adopting
his view.

Nor does our decision in Rash, 520 U. S. 953, support the
risk-free approach. There we considered whether a secured
creditor's claim should be valued at what the debtor would
pay to replace the collateral or at the lower price the creditor
would receive from a foreclosure sale. Justice Thomas
contends that Rash selected the former in order to compensate creditors for the risk of plan failure, and that, having
compensated them once in that context, we need not do so
again here. Ante, at 489. I disagree with this reading of
Rash. The Bankruptcy Code provides that "value shall be
determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the

Scalia, J., dissenting
proposed disposition or use of [the] property." 11 U. S. C.$ 506(a).

Rash held that the foreclosure-value approach
failed to give effect to this language, because it assigned thesame value whether the debtor surrendered the collateral or

was allowed to retain it in exchange for promised payments.520 U. S., at 962. "From the creditor's perspective as well
as the debtor's, surrender and retention are not equivalent
acts." Ibid. We did point out that retention entails risksfor the creditor that surrender does not.

Id., at 962-963.
But we made no effort to correlate that increased risk withthe difference between replacement and foreclosure value.

And we also pointed out that retention benefits the debtor
by allowing him to continue to use the property--a factor
we considered "[o]f prime significance." Id., at 963. Rash
stands for the proposition that surrender and retention are
fundamentally different sorts of "disposition or use," calling
for different valuations. Nothing in the opinion suggests
that we thought the valuation difference reflected the degree
of increased risk, or that we adopted the replacement-value
standard in order to compensate for increased risk. To the
contrary, we said that the debtor's "actual use . . . is the
proper guide under a prescription hinged to the property's
`disposition or use.' " Ibid.

If Congress wanted to compensate secured creditors for
the risk of plan failure, it would not have done so by prescribing a particular method of valuing collateral. A plan may
pose little risk even though the difference between foreclosure and replacement values is substantial, or great risk
even though the valuation difference is small. For example,
if a plan proposes immediate cash payment to the secured
creditor, he is entitled to the higher replacement value under
Rash even though he faces no risk at all. If the plan calls
for deferred payments but the collateral consists of listed
securities, the valuation difference may be trivial, but the
creditor still faces substantial risks. And a creditor oversecured in even the slightest degree at the time of bank541US2 Unit: $U47 [05-08-06 21:08:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
508 TILL v. SCS CREDIT CORP.

Scalia, J., dissenting
ruptcy derives no benefit at all from Rash, but still facessome risk of collateral depreciation.

17

There are very good reasons for Congress to prescribe fullrisk compensation for creditors. Every action in the free

market has a reaction somewhere. If subprime lenders aresystematically undercompensated in bankruptcy, they will
charge higher rates or, if they already charge the legal maxi-mum under state law, lend to fewer of the riskiest borrowers.
As a result, some marginal but deserving borrowers will bedenied vehicle loans in the first place. Congress evidently
concluded that widespread access to credit is worth pre-serving, even if it means being ungenerous to sympathetic
debtors. * * *

Today's judgment is unlikely to burnish the Court's repu-tation for reasoned decisionmaking. Eight Justices are in
agreement that the rate of interest set forth in the debtor'sapproved plan must include a premium for risk. Of those
eight, four are of the view that beginning with the contractrate would most accurately reflect the actual risk, and four
are of the view that beginning with the prime lending ratewould do so. The ninth Justice takes no position on the latter point, since he disagrees with the eight on the formerpoint; he would reverse because the rate proposed here,
being above the risk-free rate, gave respondent no cause forcomplaint. Because I read the statute to require full risk
compensation, and because I would adopt a valuation methodthat has a realistic prospect of enforcing that directive,
I respectfully dissent.

17 It is true that, if the debtor defaults, one of the costs the creditor
suffers is the cost of liquidating the collateral. See supra, at 502-503.
But it is illogical to "compensate" for this risk by requiring all plans to
pay the full cost of liquidation (replacement value minus foreclosure
value), rather than an amount that reflects the possibility that liquidation
will actually be necessary and that full payments will not be made.

TENNESSEE v. LANE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-1667. Argued January 13, 2004--Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief,

alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them
physical access to that State's courts in violation of Title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which provides: "[N]o
qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,
be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services,
programs or activities of a public entity," 42 U. S. C. $ 12132. After the
District Court denied the State's motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance
pending Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356.
This Court later ruled in Garrett that the Eleventh Amendment bars
private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I,
which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled. The
en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its Popovich decision, in which it interpreted Garrett to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal
protection principles, but not those relying on due process, and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the State's
immunity claim. Thereafter, a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case, explaining that respondents' claims were not
barred because they were based on due process principles. In response
to a rehearing petition arguing that Popovich did not control because
respondents' complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel
filed an amended opinion, explaining that due process protects the right
of access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress when it
enacted Title II established, inter alia, that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people
the opportunity for such access.

Held: As it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right

of access to the courts, Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress'
authority under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that
Amendment's substantive guarantees. Pp. 516-534.

(a) Determining whether Congress has constitutionally abrogated a
State's Eleventh Amendment immunity requires resolution of two predicate questions: (1) whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent
to abrogate; and (2), if so, whether it acted pursuant to a valid grant of

constitutional authority. Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62,
73. The first question is easily answered here, since the ADA specifically provides for abrogation. See $ 12202. With regard to the second
question, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to
a valid exercise of its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
E. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456. That power is not, however, unlimited. While Congress must have a wide berth in devising
appropriate remedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional actions, those measures may not work a "substantive change in the governing law." City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 519. In Boerne,
the Court set forth the test for distinguishing between permissible remedial legislation and unconstitutional substantive redefinition: Section
5 legislation is valid if it exhibits "a congruence and proportionality"
between an injury and the means adopted to prevent or remedy it. Id.,
at 520. Applying the Boerne test in Garrett, the Court concluded that
ADA Title I was not a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 power because the
historical record and the statute's broad sweep suggested that Title I's
true aim was not so much enforcement, but an attempt to "rewrite" this
Court's Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence. 531 U. S., at 372-374.
In view of significant differences between Titles I and II, however, Garrett left open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 power, id., at 360, n. 1. Pp. 517-522.

(b) Title II is a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 enforcement power.
Pp. 522-534.

(1) The Boerne inquiry's first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II.
Garrett, 531 U. S., at 365. Like Title I, Title II seeks to enforce the
Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition on irrational disability discrimination. Id., at 366. But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic
constitutional guarantees, including some, like the right of access to the
courts here at issue, infringements of which are subject to heightened
judicial scrutiny. See, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336-337.
Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question
that "must be judged with reference to the historical experience which
it reflects." E. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308.
Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services
and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.
The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the
decisions of this and other courts, which have identified unconstitutional
treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public
programs and services. With respect to the particular services at issue,
Congress learned that many individuals, in many States, were being
excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their dis541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Syllabus
abilities. A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed
that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned
buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons. Congress
also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses. And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs, including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses
with physical disabilities. The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Term's Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v.
Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 728-733, in which the Court approved the familycare leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as
valid $ 5 legislation. Congress' finding in the ADA that "discrimination
against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as . . .
access to public services," $ 12101(a)(3), together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an
appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation. Pp. 522-529.

(2) Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern
of unequal treatment. Unquestionably, it is valid $ 5 legislation as it
applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services. Congress' chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue, Title II's requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to
the courts. The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons
in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several
state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem. Faced with
considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts,
Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable
problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures. Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 737. The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one. Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons
with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright
exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to
remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility. $ 12132. But
Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make
judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria
for public programs. It requires only "reasonable modifications" that
would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and
only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for
the service. Ibid. Title II's implementing regulations make clear that
the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various
ways, including less costly measures than structural changes. This
duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established
due process principle that, within the limits of practicability, a State

affirmative obligations flow from this principle. Cases such as Boddie,
Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335,
make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone
cannot justify a State's failure to provide individuals with a meaningful
right of access to the courts. Judged against this backdrop, Title II's

811-816. The minority concluded that Congress had notvalidly abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity for any Title II claims, id., at 821, while the concurring
opinion concluded that Title II validly abrogated state sover-eign immunity with respect to both equal protection and due

process claims, id., at 818.Following the en banc decision in

Popovich, a panel of the
Court of Appeals entered an order affirming the District
Court's denial of the State's motion to dismiss in this case.
Judgt. order reported at 40 Fed. Appx. 911 (CA6 2002). The
order explained that respondents' claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles. In response to a petition for rehearing arguing that Popovich was
not controlling because the complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion. It explained that the Due Process Clause protects the right of
access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress
when it enacted Title II "established that physical barriers
in government buildings, including courthouses and in the
courtrooms themselves, have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity to access vital services and to
exercise fundamental rights guaranteed by the Due Process
Clause." 315 F. 3d 680, 682 (2003). Moreover, that "record
demonstrated that public entities' failure to accommodate
the needs of qualified persons with disabilities may result
directly from unconstitutional animus and impermissible
stereotypes." Id., at 683. The panel did not, however,
categorically reject the State's submission. It instead noted
that the case presented difficult questions that "cannot be
clarified absent a factual record," and remanded for further
proceedings. Ibid. We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 941
(2003), and now affirm.

Opinion of the Court

II
The ADA was passed by large majorities in both Housesof Congress after decades of deliberation and investigation

into the need for comprehensive legislation to address dis-crimination against persons with disabilities. In the years
immediately preceding the ADA's enactment, Congress held13 hearings and created a special task force that gathered
evidence from every State in the Union. The conclusionsCongress drew from this evidence are set forth in the task
force and Committee Reports, described in lengthy legisla-tive hearings, and summarized in the preamble to the statute.2 Central among these conclusions was Congress' find-ing that

"individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insularminority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequaltreatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that arebeyond the control of such individuals and resulting
from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of theindividual ability of such individuals to participate in,
and contribute to, society." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(7).
Invoking "the sweep of congressional authority, includ-ing the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to

regulate commerce," the ADA is designed "to provide aclear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities."$$ 12101(b)(1), (b)(4). It forbids discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major areas of public life: em-ployment, which is covered by Title I of the statute; public

Opinion of the Court
services, programs, and activities, which are the subject ofTitle II; and public accommodations, which are covered by

Title III.Title II, $$ 12131-12134, prohibits any public entity from
discriminating against "qualified" persons with disabilities inthe provision or operation of public services, programs, or
activities. The Act defines the term "public entity" to in-clude state and local governments, as well as their agencies
and instrumentalities. $ 12131(1). Persons with disabili-ties are "qualified" if they, "with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of archi-tectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the
provision of auxiliary aids and services, mee[t] the essentialeligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public en-tity." $ 12131(2). Title II's enforcement provision incorporates by reference $ 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 92Stat. 2982, as added, 29 U. S. C. $ 794a, which authorizes private citizens to bring suits for money damages. 42 U. S. C.$ 12133.

III
The Eleventh Amendment renders the States immunefrom "any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted . . .

by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects ofany Foreign State." Even though the Amendment "by its
terms . . . applies only to suits against a State by citizensof another State," our cases have repeatedly held that this
immunity also applies to unconsented suits brought by aState's own citizens.

Garrett, 531 U. S., at 363; Kimel v.Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72-73 (2000). Our

cases have also held that Congress may abrogate the State'sEleventh Amendment immunity. To determine whether it
has done so in any given case, we "must resolve two predi-cate questions: first, whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate that immunity; and second, ifit did, whether Congress acted pursuant to a valid grant of
constitutional authority." Id., at 73.

518 TENNESSEE v. LANE

Opinion of the Court
The first question is easily answered in this case. The Actspecifically provides: "A State shall not be immune under the

eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United Statesfrom an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter." 42 U. S. C. $ 12202.As in Garrett, see 531 U. S., at 363-364, no party disputes
the adequacy of that expression of Congress' intent to abro-gate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. The question, then, is whether Congress had the power to give effectto its intent.

In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), we held thatCongress can abrogate a State's sovereign immunity when it
does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under $ 5 ofthe Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment. Id., at 456. This enforcementpower, as we have often acknowledged, is a "broad power
indeed." Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.718, 732 (1982), citing

Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346(1880).
3 It includes "the authority both to remedy and to

deter violation of rights guaranteed [by the FourteenthAmendment] by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of

conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by theAmendment's text."

Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81. We have thusrepeatedly affirmed that "Congress may enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutionalconduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct." Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538U. S. 721, 727-728 (2003). See also City of Boerne v. Flores,

3 In Ex parte Virginia, we described the breadth of Congress' $ 5 power
as follows:

"Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the
objects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the
laws against State denial or invasion, if not prohibited, is brought within
the domain of congressional power." 100 U. S., at 345-346. See also City
of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517-518 (1997).

521 U. S. 507, 518 (1997).4 The most recent affirmation ofthe breadth of Congress' $ 5 power came in Hibbs, in which

we considered whether a male state employee could recovermoney damages against the State for its failure to comply
with the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medi-cal Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 107 Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. $ 2601
et seq. We upheld the FMLA as a valid exercise of Con-gress' $ 5 power to combat unconstitutional sex discrimination, even though there was no suggestion that the State'sleave policy was adopted or applied with a discriminatory
purpose that would render it unconstitutional under the ruleof

Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256

4 In Boerne, we observed:
"Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall
within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the process
it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into
`legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.' Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976). For example, the Court upheld
a suspension of literacy tests and similar voting requirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, $ 2, as a measure to combat racial discrimination in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308
(1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under Lassiter v.
Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U. S. 45 (1959). We have also
concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States. South Carolina
v. Katzenbach, supra (upholding several provisions of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965); Katzenbach v. Morgan, [384 U. S. 641 (1966)] (upholding ban
on literacy tests that prohibited certain people schooled in Puerto Rico
from voting); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970) (upholding 5-year
nationwide ban on literacy tests and similar voting requirements for registering to vote); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 161 (1980)
(upholding 7-year extension of the Voting Rights Act's requirement that
certain jurisdictions preclear any change to a ` "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" '); see also James Everard's Breweries v.
Day, 265 U. S. 545 (1924) (upholding ban on medical prescription of intoxicating malt liquors as appropriate to enforce Eighteenth Amendment ban
on manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage
purposes)." Id., at 518.

520 TENNESSEE v. LANE

Opinion of the Court
(1979). When Congress seeks to remedy or prevent uncon-stitutional discrimination, $ 5 authorizes it to enact prophylactic legislation proscribing practices that are discrim-inatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out the basic
objectives of the Equal Protection Clause.Congress' $ 5 power is not, however, unlimited. While
Congress must have a wide berth in devising appropriate
remedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional ac-tions, those measures may not work a "substantive change

in the governing law." Boerne, 521 U. S., at 519. In
Boerne, we recognized that the line between remedial legislation and substantive redefinition is "not easy to discern,"and that "Congress must have wide latitude in determining

where it lies." Id., at 519-520. But we also confirmed that"the distinction exists and must be observed," and set forth
a test for so observing it: Section 5 legislation is valid if itexhibits "a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted tothat end."

Id., at 520.
In Boerne, we held that Congress had exceeded its $ 5 authority when it enacted the Religious Freedom RestorationAct of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb

et
seq. We began by noting that Congress enacted RFRA "in
direct response" to our decision in Employment Div., Dept.
of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990),
for the stated purpose of "restor[ing]" a constitutional rule
that Smith had rejected. 521 U. S., at 512, 515 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Though the respondent attempted to defend the statute as a reasonable means of enforcing the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith,
we concluded that RFRA was "so out of proportion" to that
objective that it could be understood only as an attempt to
work a "substantive change in constitutional protections."
521 U. S., at 529, 532. Indeed, that was the very purpose
of the law.

This Court further defined the contours of Boerne's "congruence and proportionality" test in Florida Prepaid Post541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
secondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527U. S. 627 (1999). At issue in that case was the validity of

the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarifi-cation Act (hereinafter Patent Remedy Act), a statutory
amendment Congress enacted in the wake of our decision in
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985),
to clarify its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity
from patent infringement suits. Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S.,at 631-632. Noting the virtually complete absence of a history of unconstitutional patent infringement on the part ofthe States, as well as the Act's expansive coverage, the Court
concluded that the Patent Remedy Act's apparent aim wasto serve the Article I concerns of "provid[ing] a uniform remedy for patent infringement and . . . plac[ing] States on thesame footing as private parties under that regime," and not
to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Id., at 647-648. See also Kimel, 528 U. S. 62 (finding that
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act exceeded Con-gress' $ 5 powers under

Boerne); United States v. Morrison,
529 U. S. 598 (2000) (Violence Against Women Act).

Applying the Boerne test in Garrett, we concluded thatTitle I of the ADA was not a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5

power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition
on unconstitutional disability discrimination in public employment. As in Florida Prepaid, we concluded Congress'
exercise of its prophylactic $ 5 power was unsupported by
a relevant history and pattern of constitutional violations.
531 U. S., at 368, 374. Although the dissent pointed out that
Congress had before it a great deal of evidence of discrimination by the States against persons with disabilities, id., at
379 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the Court's opinion noted that
the "overwhelming majority" of that evidence related to "the
provision of public services and public accommodations,
which areas are addressed in Titles II and III," rather than
Title I, id., at 371, n. 7. We also noted that neither the
ADA's legislative findings nor its legislative history reflected
a concern that the States had been engaging in a pattern of

541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG
522 TENNESSEE v. LANE

Opinion of the Court
unconstitutional employment discrimination. We empha-sized that the House and Senate Committee Reports on the

ADA focused on " `[d]iscrimination [in] . . . employment inthe private sector,' " and made no mention of discrimination
in public employment. Id., at 371-372 (quoting S. Rep.No. 101-116, p. 6 (1989), and H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2,
p. 28 (1990)) (emphasis in Garrett). Finally, we concludedthat Title I's broad remedial scheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy or prevent unconstitutional discriminationin public employment. Taken together, the historical record
and the broad sweep of the statute suggested that Title I'strue aim was not so much to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibitions against disability discrimination in publicemployment as it was to "rewrite" this Court's Fourteenth
Amendment jurisprudence. 531 U. S., at 372-374.In view of the significant differences between Titles I and
II, however, Garrett left open the question whether Title IIis a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 enforcement power. It is
to that question that we now turn.

IV
The first step of the Boerne inquiry requires us to identifythe constitutional right or rights that Congress sought to

enforce when it enacted Title II. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 365.In

Garrett we identified Title I's purpose as enforcement ofthe Fourteenth Amendment's command that "all persons

similarly situated should be treated alike." Cleburne v. Cle-burne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 439 (1985). As we
observed, classifications based on disability violate that con-stitutional command if they lack a rational relationship to a
legitimate governmental purpose. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366(citing Cleburne, 473 U. S., at 446).

Title II, like Title I, seeks to enforce this prohibition onirrational disability discrimination. But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, in-fringements of which are subject to more searching judicial

Opinion of the Court
review. See, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336-337 (1972);

Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 634 (1969);
Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541(1942). These rights include some, like the right of access

to the courts at issue in this case, that are protected by theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
Due Process Clause and the Confrontation Clause of the
Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States via the Four-teenth Amendment, both guarantee to a criminal defendant

such as respondent Lane the "right to be present at allstages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings." Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.
806, 819, n. 15 (1975). The Due Process Clause also requires
the States to afford certain civil litigants a "meaningful opportunity to be heard" by removing obstacles to their full
participation in judicial proceedings. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371, 379 (1971); M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S.
102 (1996). We have held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to criminal defendants the right to trial by a jury
composed of a fair cross section of the community, noting
that the exclusion of "identifiable segments playing major
roles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial." Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S.
522, 530 (1975). And, finally, we have recognized that members of the public have a right of access to criminal proceedings secured by the First Amendment. Press-Enterprise
Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside, 478 U. S.
1, 8-15 (1986).

Whether Title II validly enforces these constitutional
rights is a question that "must be judged with reference to
the historical experience which it reflects." South Carolina
v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). See also Florida
Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 639-640; Boerne, 521 U. S., at 530.
While $ 5 authorizes Congress to enact reasonably prophylactic remedial legislation, the appropriateness of the remedy
depends on the gravity of the harm it seeks to prevent.

Opinion of the Court
"Difficult and intractable problems often require powerfulremedies,"

Kimel, 528 U. S., at 88, but it is also true that
"[s]trong measures appropriate to address one harm may bean unwarranted response to another, lesser one,"

Boerne, 521
U. S., at 530.It is not difficult to perceive the harm that Title II is designed to address. Congress enacted Title II against a
backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment in the administra-tion of state services and programs, including systematic

deprivations of fundamental rights. For example, "[a]s of1979, most States . . . categorically disqualified `idiots' from
voting, without regard to individual capacity." 5 The major-ity of these laws remain on the books,

6 and have been the

subject of legal challenge as recently as 2001.7 Similarly, anumber of States have prohibited and continue to prohibit

persons with disabilities from engaging in activities such asmarrying

that Title II reflects is also documented in this Court's cases,

Opinion of the Court
This pattern of disability discrimination persisted despite
several federal and state legislative efforts to address it. In
the deliberations that led up to the enactment of the ADA,
Congress identified important shortcomings in existing laws
that rendered them "inadequate to address the pervasive
problems of discrimination that people with disabilities are
facing." S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 18. See also H. R. Rep.
No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 47.15 It also uncovered further evidence of those shortcomings, in the form of hundreds of examples of unequal treatment of persons with disabilities by
States and their political subdivisions. See Garrett, 531
U. S., at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting). See also id., at 391
(App. C to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting). As the
Court's opinion in Garrett observed, the "overwhelming majority" of these examples concerned discrimination in the
administration of public programs and services. Id., at

Opinion of the Court
With respect to the particular services at issue in this case,Congress learned that many individuals, in many States

across the country, were being excluded from courthousesand court proceedings by reason of their disabilities. A report before Congress showed that some 76% of public serv-ices and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by persons with disabilities, eventaking into account the possibility that the services and programs might be restructured or relocated to other parts ofthe buildings. U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities 39 (1983). Con-gress itself heard testimony from persons with disabilities
who described the physical inaccessibility of local court-houses. Oversight Hearing on H. R. 4498 before the House
Subcommittee on Select Education of the Committee on Edu-cation and Labor, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 40-41, 48 (1988).
And its appointed task force heard numerous examples ofthe exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial
services and programs, including exclusion of persons withvisual impairments and hearing impairments from jury service, failure of state and local governments to provide inter-pretive services for the hearing impaired, failure to permit
the testimony of adults with developmental disabilities inabuse cases, and failure to make courtrooms accessible to
witnesses with physical disabilities. Government's Lodgingin Garrett, O. T. 2000, No. 99-1240. See also Task Force on
the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabili-ties, From ADA to Empowerment (Oct. 12, 1990).

16 The Chief Justice dismisses as "irrelevant" the portions of this evidence that concern the conduct of nonstate governments. Post, at 542-
543 (dissenting opinion). This argument rests on the mistaken premise
that a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 power must always be predicated
solely on evidence of constitutional violations by the States themselves.
To operate on that premise in this case would be particularly inappropriate
because this case concerns the provision of judicial services, an area in
which local governments are typically treated as "arm[s] of the State" for
Eleventh Amendment purposes, Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429

528 TENNESSEE v. LANE

Opinion of the Court
Given the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against
persons with disabilities in the provision of public services,
the dissent's contention that the record is insufficient to justify Congress' exercise of its prophylactic power is puzzling,
to say the least. Just last Term in Hibbs, we approved the
family-care leave provision of the FMLA as valid $ 5 legislation based primarily on evidence of disparate provision of
parenting leave, little of which concerned unconstitutional
state conduct. 538 U. S., at 728-733.17 We explained that

U. S. 274, 280 (1977), and thus enjoy precisely the same immunity from
unconsented suit as the States. See, e. g., Callahan v. Philadelphia, 207
F. 3d 668, 670-674 (CA3 2000) (municipal court is an "arm of the State"
entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity); Kelly v. Municipal Courts,
97 F. 3d 902, 907-908 (CA7 1996) (same); Franceschi v. Schwartz, 57 F. 3d
828, 831 (CA9 1995) (same). Cf. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 368-369.

In any event, our cases have recognized that evidence of constitutional
violations on the part of nonstate governmental actors is relevant to the

$ 5 inquiry. To be sure, evidence of constitutional violations by the States
themselves is particularly important when, as in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627 (1999),
Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62 (2000), and Garrett, the sole
purpose of reliance on $ 5 is to place the States on equal footing with
private actors with respect to their amenability to suit. But much of the
evidence in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 312-315 (1966),
to which The Chief Justice favorably refers, post, at 548, involved the
conduct of county and city officials, rather than the States. Moreover,
what The Chief Justice calls an "extensive legislative record documenting States' gender discrimination in employment leave policies" in Nevada
Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003), post, at 548,
in fact contained little specific evidence of a pattern of unconstitutional
discrimination on the part of the States. Indeed, the evidence before the
Congress that enacted the FMLA related primarily to the practices of
private-sector employers and the Federal Government. See Hibbs, 538
U. S., at 730-735. See also id., at 745-750 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).

17 Specifically, we relied on (1) a Senate Report citation to a Bureau of

Labor Statistics survey revealing disparities in private-sector provision of
parenting leave to men and women; (2) submissions from two sources at a
hearing on the Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986, a predecessor bill

Opinion of the Court
because the FMLA was targeted at sex-based classifications,
which are subject to a heightened standard of judicial scrutiny, "it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state
constitutional violations" than in Garrett or Kimel, both of
which concerned legislation that targeted classifications subject to rational-basis review. 538 U. S., at 735-737. Title
II is aimed at the enforcement of a variety of basic rights,
including the right of access to the courts at issue in this
case, that call for a standard of judicial review at least as
searching, and in some cases more searching, than the standard that applies to sex-based classifications. And in any
event, the record of constitutional violations in this case--
including judicial findings of unconstitutional state action,
and statistical, legislative, and anecdotal evidence of the
widespread exclusion of persons with disabilities from the
enjoyment of public services--far exceeds the record in
Hibbs.

The conclusion that Congress drew from this body of evidence is set forth in the text of the ADA itself: "[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as . . . education, transportation, communication,
recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and
access to public services." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(3) (emphasis added). This finding, together with the extensive record
of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear beyond peradventure that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject
for prophylactic legislation.

from private-sector policies; (3) evidence that 15 States provided women
up to one year of extended maternity leave, while only 4 States provided
for similarly extended paternity leave; and (4) a House Report's quotation
of a study that found that failure to implement uniform standards for parenting leave would " `leav[e] Federal employees open to discretionary and
possibly unequal treatment,' " H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, p. 11 (1993).

530 TENNESSEE v. LANE

Opinion of the Court

V
The only question that remains is whether Title II is anappropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal

treatment. At the outset, we must determine the scope ofthat inquiry. Title II--unlike RFRA, the Patent Remedy
Act, and the other statutes we have reviewed for validityunder $ 5--reaches a wide array of official conduct in an
effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutionalguarantees. Petitioner urges us both to examine the broad
range of Title II's applications all at once, and to treatthat breadth as a mark of the law's invalidity. According to
petitioner, the fact that Title II applies not only to publiceducation and voting-booth access but also to seating at
state-owned hockey rinks indicates that Title II is not appro-priately tailored to serve its objectives. But nothing in our
case law requires us to consider Title II, with its wide vari-ety of applications, as an undifferentiated whole.

18 Whatever might be said about Title II's other applications, thequestion presented in this case is not whether Congress can

18 Contrary to The Chief Justice, post, at 551-552, neither Garrett nor
Florida Prepaid lends support to the proposition that the Boerne test
requires courts in all cases to "measur[e] the full breadth of the statute or
relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce." In fact, the decision in Garrett,
which severed Title I of the ADA from Title II for purposes of the $ 5
inquiry, demonstrates that courts need not examine "the full breadth of
the statute" all at once. Moreover, Garrett and Florida Prepaid, like all
of our other recent $ 5 cases, concerned legislation that narrowly targeted
the enforcement of a single constitutional right; for that reason, neither
speaks to the issue presented in this case.

Nor is The Chief Justice's approach compelled by the nature of the
Boerne inquiry. The answer to the question Boerne asks--whether a
piece of legislation attempts substantively to redefine a constitutional
guarantee--logically focuses on the manner in which the legislation operates to enforce that particular guarantee. It is unclear what, if anything,
examining Title II's application to hockey rinks or voting booths can tell
us about whether Title II substantively redefines the right of access to
the courts.

Opinion of the Court
validly subject the States to private suits for money damagesfor failing to provide reasonable access to hockey rinks,

or even to voting booths, but whether Congress had thepower under $ 5 to enforce the constitutional right of access
to the courts. Because we find that Title II unquestion-ably is valid $ 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases
implicating the accessibility of judicial services, we need go
no further. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 26(1960).

19

Congress' chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion anddiscrimination described above, Title II's requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its objectof enforcing the right of access to the courts. The unequal
treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judi-cial services has a long history, and has persisted despite
several legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disabilitydiscrimination. Faced with considerable evidence of the
shortcomings of previous legislative responses, Congress
was justified in concluding that this "difficult and intractable
proble[m]" warranted "added prophylactic measures in response." Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 737 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.
Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright
exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable
measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility. 42 U. S. C. $ 12131(2). But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial

19 In Raines, a State subject to suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1957
contended that the law exceeded Congress' power to enforce the Fifteenth
Amendment because it prohibited "any person," and not just state actors,
from interfering with voting rights. We rejected that argument, concluding that "if the complaint here called for an application of the statute
clearly constitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment, that should have
been an end to the question of constitutionality." 362 U. S., at 24-25.

Opinion of the Court
services accessible to persons with disabilities, and it does
not require States to compromise their essential eligibility
criteria for public programs. It requires only "reasonable
modifications" that would not fundamentally alter the nature
of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking
modification is otherwise eligible for the service. Ibid. As
Title II's implementing regulations make clear, the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in a number
of ways. In the case of facilities built or altered after 1992,
the regulations require compliance with specific architectural accessibility standards. 28 CFR $ 35.151 (2003). But
in the case of older facilities, for which structural change is
likely to be more difficult, a public entity may comply with
Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including relocating services to alternative, accessible sites and
assigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services. $ 35.150(b)(1). Only if these measures are
ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity
required to make reasonable structural changes. Ibid.
And in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.

$$ 35.150(a)(2), (a)(3).

This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the
well-established due process principle that, "within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a
meaningful opportunity to be heard" in its courts. Boddie,
401 U. S., at 379 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).20 Our cases have recognized a number of affirmative
obligations that flow from this principle: the duty to waive

20 Because this case implicates the right of access to the courts, we need
not consider whether Title II's duty to accommodate exceeds what the
Constitution requires in the class of cases that implicate only Cleburne's
prohibition on irrational discrimination. See Garrett, 531 U. S., at 372.

filing fees in certain family-law and criminal cases,21 the duty
to provide transcripts to criminal defendants seeking review
of their convictions,22 and the duty to provide counsel to certain criminal defendants.23 Each of these cases makes clear
that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone
cannot justify a State's failure to provide individuals with a
meaningful right of access to the courts. Judged against
this backdrop, Title II's affirmative obligation to accommodate persons with disabilities in the administration of justice
cannot be said to be "so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as
responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior." Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 86.24
It is, rather, a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably
targeted to a legitimate end.

For these reasons, we conclude that Title II, as it applies
to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of ac21 Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971) (divorce filing fee);

24 The Chief Justice contends that Title II cannot be understood as

remedial legislation because it "subjects a State to liability for failing to
make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether
the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong." Post, at
553 (emphasis in original). But as we have often acknowledged, Congress
"is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the
precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment," and may prohibit
"a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself
forbidden by the Amendment's text." Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81. Cf. Hibbs,

Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals istherefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,

I join the Court's opinion subject to the same caveats
about the Court's recent cases on the Eleventh Amendmentand $ 5 of the Fourteenth that I noted in

Nevada Dept. of
Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 740 (2003) (Souter, J., concurring).

Although I concur in the Court's approach applying thecongruence-and-proportionality criteria to Title II of the

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as a guarantee of
access to courts and related rights, I note that if the Court
engaged in a more expansive enquiry as The Chief Justice
suggests, post, at 551 (dissenting opinion), the evidence to be
considered would underscore the appropriateness of action
under $ 5 to address the situation of disabled individuals before the courts, for that evidence would show that the judiciary itself has endorsed the basis for some of the very
discrimination subject to congressional remedy under $ 5.
Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200 (1927), was not grudging in sustaining the constitutionality of the once-pervasive practice of
involuntarily sterilizing those with mental disabilities. See
id., at 207 ("It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting
to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them
starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are
manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. . . . Three generations of imbeciles are enough"). Laws compelling sterilization were often accompanied by others indiscriminately
requiring institutionalization, and prohibiting certain individuals with disabilities from marrying, from voting, from
attending public schools, and even from appearing in public.

after eugenics lapsed into discredit.2 See U. S. Commissionon Civil Rights, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual
Abilities 19-20 (1983). Quite apart from the fateful inspira-tion behind them, one pervasive fault of these provisions was

Act--the elimination or reduction of physical and socialstructures that impede people with some present, past, or

perceived impairments from contributing, according to theirtalents, to our Nation's social, economic, and civic life--I join
the Court's opinion.The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act),
42 U. S. C. $$ 12101-12213, is a measure expected to advance
equal-citizenship stature for persons with disabilities. SeeBagenstos, Subordination, Stigma, and "Disability," 86 Va.

L. Rev. 397, 471 (2000) (ADA aims both to "guarante[e] abaseline of equal citizenship by protecting against stigma
and systematic exclusion from public and private opportunities, and [to] protec[t] society against the loss of valuable talents"). As the Court's opinion relates, see ante, at 516-517,
the Act comprises three parts, prohibiting discrimination in
employment (Title I), public services, programs, and activities (Title II), and public accommodations (Title III). This
case concerns Title II, which controls the conduct of administrators of public undertakings.

Including individuals with disabilities among people who
count in composing "We the People," Congress understood in
shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded
equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference,
but accommodation. Central to the Act's primary objective,
Congress extended the statute's range to reach all government activities, $ 12132 (Title II), and required "reasonable
modifications to [public actors'] rules, policies, or practices,"

$$ 12131(2)-12132 (Title II). See also $ 12112(b)(5) (defining
discrimination to include the failure to provide "reasonable

"reasonable modifications in [public accommodations'] policies, practices, or procedures") (Title III); Bagenstos, supra,

ments of individualized accommodation and modification fill
in the gaps on the micro level." (footnote omitted)).

In Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U. S. 581 (1999), this Court responded with fidelity to the ADA's accommodation theme
when it held a State accountable for failing to provide community residential placements for people with disabilities.
The State argued in Olmstead that it had acted impartially,
for it provided no community placements for individuals
without disabilities. Id., at 598. Congress, the Court observed, advanced in the ADA "a more comprehensive view
of the concept of discrimination," ibid., one that embraced
failures to provide "reasonable accommodations," id., at 601.
The Court today is similarly faithful to the Act's demand
for reasonable accommodation to secure access and avoid
exclusion.

Legislation calling upon all government actors to respect
the dignity of individuals with disabilities is entirely compatible with our Constitution's commitment to federalism, properly conceived. It seems to me not conducive to a harmonious federal system to require Congress, before it exercises
authority under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, essentially to indict each State for disregarding the equalcitizenship stature of persons with disabilities. But see
post, at 564 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Congress may impose
prophylactic $ 5 legislation only upon those particular States
in which there has been an identified history of relevant constitutional violations."); Nevada Dept. of Human Resources
v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 743 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (to
be controlled by $ 5 legislation, State "can demand that it be
shown to have been acting in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment" (emphasis in original)). Members of Congress
are understandably reluctant to condemn their own States
as constitutional violators, complicit in maintaining the
isolated and unequal status of persons with disabilities.

adversarial approach to lawmaking better suited to thecourtroom.

As the Court's opinion documents, see ante, at 524-529, Con-gress considered a body of evidence showing that in diverse
parts of our Nation, and at various levels of government,persons with disabilities encounter access barriers to public
facilities and services. That record, the Court rightly holds,
at least as it bears on access to courts, sufficed to warrantthe barrier-lowering, dignity-respecting national solution the

People's representatives in Congress elected to order.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S.356 (2001), we held that Congress did not validly abrogate

States' Eleventh Amendment immunity when it enacted
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA
or Act), 42 U. S. C. $$ 12111-12117. Today, the Court concludes that Title II of that Act, $$ 12131-12165, does validly
abrogate that immunity, at least insofar "as it applies to the
class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to
the courts." Ante, at 533-534. Because today's decision is
irreconcilable with Garrett and the well-established principles it embodies, I dissent.

The Eleventh Amendment bars private lawsuits in federal
court against an unconsenting State. E. g., Nevada Dept. of
Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 726 (2003); Garrett, supra, at 363; Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S.
62, 73 (2000). Congress may overcome States' sovereign immunity and authorize such suits only if it unmistakably expresses its intent to do so, and only if it "acts pursuant to a
valid exercise of its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment." Hibbs, supra, at 726. While the Court correctly holds that Congress satisfied the first prerequisite,
ante, at 518, I disagree with its conclusion that Title II is
valid $ 5 enforcement legislation.

Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congressthe authority "to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the

" `appropriate' " enforcement legislation is not limited to"mere legislative repetition" of this Court's Fourteenth

Amendment jurisprudence. Garrett, supra, at 365. Con-gress may "remedy" and "deter" state violations of constitutional rights by "prohibiting a somewhat broader swath
of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by
the Amendment's text." Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 727 (internal

this Court's responsibility to define the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, valid $ 5 legislation must exhibit " `congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.' "
Hibbs, supra, at 728 (quoting City of Boerne, supra, at 520).
While the Court today pays lipservice to the " `congruence
and proportionality' " test, see ante, at 520, it applies it in a
manner inconsistent with our recent precedents.

In Garrett, we conducted the three-step inquiry first enunciated in City of Boerne to determine whether Title I of the
ADA satisfied the congruence-and-proportionality test. A
faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too
" `substantively redefine[s],' " rather than permissibly enforces, the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

The first step is to "identify with some precision the scopeof the constitutional right at issue."

Garrett, supra, at 365.
This task was easy in Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, and City of
Boerne because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce
only one constitutional right. In Garrett, for example, thestatute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination. 531 U. S., at 365. See also Hibbs, supra, at 728("The [Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)] aims

to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimina-tion in the workplace");

Kimel, supra, at 83 (right to be free
from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment);
City of Boerne, supra, at 529 (right of free exercise of religion). The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to
classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational
basis for doing so. Garrett, supra, at 366-368 (discussing
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432
(1985)); see also ante, at 522.

In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title
II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of
disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against
irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected
by the Due Process Clause. Ante, at 522-523. However,
because the Court ultimately upholds Title II "as it applies
to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts," ante, at 533-534, the proper inquiry focuses on the scope of those due process rights. The Court
cites four access-to-the-courts rights that Title II purportedly enforces: (1) the right of the criminal defendant to be
present at all critical stages of the trial, Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 819 (1975); (2) the right of litigants to have
a "meaningful opportunity to be heard" in judicial proceedings, Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371, 379 (1971); (3) the
right of the criminal defendant to trial by a jury composed

of a fair cross section of the community, Taylor v. Louisiana,419 U. S. 522, 530 (1975); and (4) the public right of access

to criminal proceedings, Press-Enterprise Co. v. SuperiorCourt of Cal., County of Riverside, 478 U. S. 1, 8-15 (1986).
Ante, at 522-523.Having traced the "metes and bounds" of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress "identified a history and pattern" of violations of theseconstitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 368. This step is crucial to de-termining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy
or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States oran illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce. Indeed, "Congress' $ 5 author-ity is appropriately exercised

only in response to state trans-gressions. " Ibid. (emphasis added). But the majority

identifies nothing in the legislative record that shows Con-gress was responding to widespread violations of the due
process rights of disabled persons.Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies,the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal
discrimination against the disabled. Ante, at 524- 526.This digression recounts historical discrimination against the
disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions onmarriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental
hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment inthe administration of public programs and services. Some
of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were consid-ering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the
Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower "as-applied" inquiry.

outdated, generalized evidence in Garrett as unsupportive of

that the "legislative record lacks . . . modern instances of . . .religious bigotry"). The evidence here is likewise irrelevant
to Title II's purported enforcement of due process access-to-the-courts rights.

Even if it were proper to consider this broader categoryof evidence, much of it does not concern

unconstitutionalaction by the States. The bulk of the Court's evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments, rather thanthe States themselves.

evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress hasvalidly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity, a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States. Garrett, supra,at 368-369; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense
Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 640 (1999); Kimel,528 U. S., at 89. Moreover, the majority today cites the

in Garrett, this "unexamined, anecdotal" evidence does notsuffice. 531 U. S., at 370. Most of the brief anecdotes do
not involve States at all, and those that do are not sufficientlydetailed to determine whether the instances of "unequal
treatment" were irrational, and thus unconstitutional underour decision in Cleburne. Gar rett, supra, at 370- 371.

Therefore, even outside the "access to the courts" context,the Court identifies few, if any, constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons.3With respect to the due process "access to the courts"
rights on which the Court ultimately relies, Congress' failureto identify a pattern of actual constitutional violations by the
States is even more striking. Indeed, there is nothing in
the legislative record or statutory findings to indicate thatdisabled persons were systematically denied the right to be

present at criminal trials, denied the meaningful opportunityto be heard in civil cases, unconstitutionally excluded from
jury service, or denied the right to attend criminal trials.4The Court's attempt to disguise the lack of congressional
documentation with a few citations to judicial decisions can-not retroactively provide support for Title II, and in any
event, fails on its own terms. See, e. g., Garrett, 531 U. S.,at 368 ("[W]e examine whether

Congress identified a history
and pattern" of constitutional violations); ibid. ("The legislative record . . . fails to show that Congress did in fact identify

3 The majority obscures this fact by repeatedly referring to congressional findings of "discrimination" and "unequal treatment." Of course,
generic findings of discrimination and unequal treatment vel non are insufficient to show a pattern of constitutional violations where rational-basis
scrutiny applies. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S.
356, 370 (2001).

4 Certainly, respondents Lane and Jones were not denied these constitutional rights. The majority admits that Lane was able to attend the initial hearing of his criminal trial. Ante, at 514. Lane was arrested for
failing to appear at his second hearing only after he refused assistance
from officers dispatched by the court to help him to the courtroom. Ibid.
The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lane's disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered
to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible
courthouse in a nearby town. In light of these facts, it can hardly be said
that the State violated Lane's right to be present at his trial; indeed, it
made affirmative attempts to secure that right. Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

a pattern" of constitutional violations (emphases added)).
Indeed, because this type of constitutional violation occurs
in connection with litigation, it is particularly telling that the
majority is able to identify only two reported cases finding
that a disabled person's federal constitutional rights were
violated.5 See ante, at 525-526, n. 14 (citing Ferrell v. Estelle, 568 F. 2d 1128, 1132-1133 (CA5), opinion withdrawn as
moot, 573 F. 2d 867 (1978); People v. Rivera, 125 Misc. 2d
516, 528, 480 N. Y. S. 2d 426, 434 (Sup. Ct. 1984)).6

Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding
to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily
on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil
Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of "public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were
inaccessible" to persons with disabilities, ante, at 527;
(2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the
"physical inaccessibility" of local courthouses, ibid.; and
(3) evidence submitted to Congress' designated ADA task

5 As two Justices noted in Garrett, if the States were violating the due
process rights of disabled persons, "one would have expected to find in
decisions of the courts . . . extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations." 531 U. S., at 376 (Kennedy, J., joined by O'Connor,
J., concurring).

6 The balance of the Court's citations refer to cases arising after enactment of the ADA or do not contain findings of federal constitutional violations. Ante, at 525-526, n. 14 (citing Layton v. Elder, 143 F. 3d 469 (CA8
1998) (post-ADA case finding ADA violations only); Matthews v. Jefferson,
29 F. Supp. 2d 525 (WD Ark. 1998) (same); Galloway v. Superior Court,
816 F. Supp. 12 (DC 1993) (same); State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St. 3d 51, 600
N. E. 2d 661 (1992) (remanded for hearing on constitutional issue); People

violation of state constitution only); DeLong v. Brumbaugh, 703 F. Supp.
399 (WD Pa. 1989) (statute upheld against facial constitutional challenge;
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 violations only); Pomerantz v. Los Angeles
County, 674 F. 2d 1288 (CA9 1982) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 claim; challenged jury-service statute later amended)). Accordingly, they offer no
support whatsoever for the notion that Title II is a valid response to documented constitutional violations.

force that purportedly contains "numerous examples of the
exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs." Ibid.

On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commission's finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its
report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes
courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part,
contains the testimony of two witnesses, neither of whom
reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.7 Indeed, the witnesses'
testimony, like the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights Report,
concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome
those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings
involving disabled persons. Cf. n. 4, supra (describing alternative means of access offered to respondent Lane).

Based on the majority's description, ante, at 527, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising. But
the report itself says nothing about any disabled person
being denied access to court. The Court thus apparently
relies solely on a general citation to the Government's Lodging in Garrett, O. T. 2000, No. 99-1240, which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten
reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with
no mention of whether States provided alternative means
of access. This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to
Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no

findings regarding disabled persons' access to judicial pro-ceedings. Cf. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 370-371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons). As we notedin Garrett, "had Congress truly understood this [task force]
information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behav-ior by the States, one would expect some mention of that
conclusion in the Act's legislative findings." Id., at 371.Yet neither the legislative findings, nor even the Committee
Reports, contain a single mention of the seemingly vitaltopic of access to the courts.

8 Cf. ibid.; Florida Prepaid,

527 U. S., at 641 (observing that Senate Report on Patent andPlant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Patent

Remedy Act) "contains no evidence that unremedied patentinfringement by States had become a problem of national
import"). To the contrary, the Senate Report on the ADAobserved that "[a]ll states currently mandate accessibility in
newly constructed state-owned public buildings." S. Rep.No. 101-116, p. 92 (1989).

Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statementsrelied on by the majority could be properly considered, the
mere existence of an architecturally "inaccessible" court-house--i. e., one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistance--does not state a constitutional violation. A viola-tion of due process occurs only when a person is actually
denied the constitutional right to access a given judicial pro-ceeding. We have never held that a person has a constitutional right to make his way into a courtroom without any

8 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress' finding that " `discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical
areas as . . . access to public services' " as evidence that Congress sought
to vindicate the due process rights of disabled persons. Ante, at 529
(quoting 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(3) (emphasis added by the Court)). However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding
as "access to [a] public servic[e]." Given the lack of any concern over
courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the
due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

external assistance. Indeed, the fact that the State mayneed to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his dueprocess right to be present at the proceeding. Nor does
an "inaccessible" courthouse violate the Equal ProtectionClause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the
courthouse to make it "accessible." But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State todecline to make those alterations. See

Garrett, 531 U. S., at
372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employerto "conserve scarce financial resources" by hiring employees

who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees). Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence
of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate
States' sovereign immunity.

The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in
the congressional record is reminiscent of Garrett, wherein
we found that the same type of minimal anecdotal evidence
"f[e]ll far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional [state action] on which $ 5 legislation must be based."
Id., at 370. See also Kimel, 528 U. S., at 91 ("Congress' failure to uncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination here confirms that Congress had no reason to
believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary");
Florida Prepaid, supra, at 645 ("The legislative record thus
suggests that the Patent Remedy Act did not respond to a
history of `widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights' of the sort Congress has faced in enacting
proper prophylactic $ 5 legislation" (quoting City of Boerne,
521 U. S., at 526)).

The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majority's holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due
process rights that involve access to the courts. This conclusion gains even more support when Title II's nonexistent
record of constitutional violations is compared with legisla541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

tion that we have sustained as valid $ 5 enforcement leg-islation. See, e. g., Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 729-732 (tracing the

extensive legislative record documenting States' gender dis-crimination in employment leave policies); South Carolina v.
Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 312-313 (1966) (same with respectto racial discrimination in voting rights). Accordingly, Title
II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to "re-write the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this
Court," rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or preventstate violations of that Amendment.

Garrett, supra, at 374.9The third step of our congruence-and-proportionality inquiry removes any doubt as to whether Title II is valid $ 5legislation. At this stage, we ask whether the rights and
remedies created by Title II are congruent and proportionalto the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the
record of constitutional violations adduced by Congress.Hibbs, supra, at 737-739; Garrett, supra, at 372-373.

Title II provides that "no qualified individual with a dis-ability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from
participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, pro-grams, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to dis9 The Court correctly explains that " `it [i]s easier for Congress to show
a pattern of state constitutional violations' " when it targets state action
that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny. Ante, at 529 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 736 (2003)).
However, this Court's precedents attest that Congress may not dispense
with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights. See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 645-646 (1999) (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process
Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 530-531 (1997) (same with
respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)). As the
foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has
sanctioned here. Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-thecourts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of
Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

crimination by any such entity." 42 U. S. C. $ 12132. A dis-abled person is considered "qualified" if he "meets the

essential eligibility requirements" for the receipt of the enti-ty's services or participation in the entity's programs, "

with
or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or
practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or
transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids
and services." $ 12131(2) (emphasis added). The ADA'sfindings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking

"discrimination" in all areas of public services, as well asthe "discriminatory effects" of "architectural, transportation,
and communication barriers." $$ 12101(a)(3), (a)(5). In
sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special
accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

"Despite subjecting States to this expansive liability," the
broad terms of Title II "d[o] nothing to limit the coverage of
the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations." Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 646. By requiring
special accommodation and the elimination of programs that
have a disparate impact on the disabled, Title II prohibits
far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban
on irrational discrimination. We invalidated Title I's similar
requirements in Garrett, observing that "[i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to
come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause." 531 U. S., at 368; id., at 372-373 (contrasting Title I's reasonable accommodation and disparate-impact
provisi ons with the Fourteenth Amendment's requirements). Title II fails for the same reason. Like Title I,
Title II may be laudable public policy, but it cannot be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively "redefine the States' legal obligations" under the Fourteenth
Amendment. Kimel, supra, at 88.

The majority, however, claims that Title II also vindicates
fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clause--

in addition to access to the courts--that are subject toheightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny. Ante, at 522-

523 (citing Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336-337 (1972)(voting); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 634 (1969)
(right to move to a new jurisdiction); Skinner v. Oklahomaex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942) (marriage and
procreation)). But Title II is not tailored to provide prophy-lactic protection of these rights; instead, it applies to any
service, program, or activity provided by any entity. Itsprovisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which areaccorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. A requirement of accommodation for thedisabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports
stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic re-lationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights. Thus, as with Title I in
Garrett, the Patent Remedy Act in Florida Prepaid, theAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in

Kimel,and the RFRA in City of Boerne, all of which we invalidated

as attempts to substantively redefine the FourteenthAmendment, it is unlikely "that many of the [state actions]
affected by [Title II] have [any] likelihood of being unconsti-tutional." City of Boerne, supra, at 532. Viewed as a
whole, then, there is little doubt that Title II of the ADAdoes not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity.

10 Title II's all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic $ 5 legislation. In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was
"narrowly targeted" to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the
availability of family leave. 538 U. S., at 738-739 (distinguishing City of
Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62 (2000), and Garrett
on this ground). Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment, we upheld "limited remedial scheme[s]" that were
narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.
Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383

The majority concludes that Title II's massive overbreadthcan be cured by considering the statute only "as it applies

to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicialservices." Ante, at 531 (citing United States v. Raines, 362
U. S. 17, 26 (1960)). I have grave doubts about importing an"as applied" approach into the $ 5 context. While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally onlyconsiders the application of a statute to a particular case,
the proper inquiry under City of Boerne and its progenyis somewhat different. In applying the congruence-andproportionality test, we ask whether Congress has at-tempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This question canonly be answered by measuring the breadth of a statute's
coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it pur-ports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to
remedy.In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress,that applies only to courthouses. The effect is to rig the
congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constrict-ing the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized
constitutional right. But Title II is not susceptible of beingcarved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all
"services," "programs," or "activities" of any "public entity."Thus, the majority's approach is not really an assessment of
whether Title II is "appropriate legislation" at all, U. S.Const., Amdt. 14, $ 5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether
the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowlytailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.

Our $ 5 precedents do not support this as-applied ap-proach. In each case, we measured the full breadth of the
statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against
. . . is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy." Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.
If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to
match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases
might have come out differently. In Garrett, for example,
Title I might have been upheld "as applied" to irrational employment discrimination; or in Florida Prepaid, the Patent
Remedy Act might have been upheld "as applied" to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements. It is thus not
surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is
Raines, supra, a case decided long before we enunciated the
congruence-and-proportionality test.11

I fear that the Court's adoption of an as-applied approach
eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft $ 5 legislation
for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations. Congress can now simply rely on the
courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against
the States. All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their
Eleventh Amendment rights. The majority's as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.

11 Raines is inapposite in any event. The Court there considered the
constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957--a statute designed to
enforce the Fifteenth Amendment--whose narrowly tailored substantive
provisions could "unquestionably" be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein). 362 U. S., at 25, 26. The only question presented
was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to
constrain nonstate actors as well. Id., at 20. The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge. Id., at 24-26. The situation in this case is much different: The
very question presented is whether Title II's indiscriminate substantive
provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State. Raines
thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an
imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the
congruence-and-proportionality test.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II
does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity. As
demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to
identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings. Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to
hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be
viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state
constitutional violations. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 368 ("Congress' $ 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions").

Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II
requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.
Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, inter alia,
they fail to make "reasonable modifications" to facilities, such as removing "architectural . . . barriers." 42
U. S. C. $$ 12131(2), 12132. Yet the statute is not limited to
occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely
result, in an actual due process violation--i. e., the inability
of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.
Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being "subjected to discrimination"--a term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.

$ 12132.

The majority's reliance on Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S.
371 (1971), and other cases in which we held that due process
requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants,
is unavailing. While these cases support the principle that
the State must remove financial requirements that in fact
prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional
rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects
a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special
accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to
accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

Scalia, J., dissenting
In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent RemedyAct at issue in Florida Prepaid. That statute subjected

States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringe-ment. 527 U. S., at 646-647. Thus, "Congress did nothing
to limit" the Patent Remedy Act's coverage "to cases involv-ing arguable [due process] violations," such as when the
infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated. Ibid.Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages
suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthousethat is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard
to whether a disabled person's due process rights are everviolated. Accordingly, even as applied to the "access to the
courts" context, Title II's "indiscriminate scope offends [thecongruence-and-proportionality] principle," particularly in
light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessiblecourthouses cause actual due process violations.

Id., at647.

Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides thatCongress "shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions" of that Amendment--including, ofcourse, the Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process

unpersuasive. See ante, at 533, n. 24. The Hibbs Court concluded that
"in light of the evidence before Congress" the FMLA's 12-week familyleave provision was necessary to "achiev[e] Congress' remedial object."
538 U. S., at 748. The Court found that the legislative record included
not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a
provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually
perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because
employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely. Ibid. Without
comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title II's
special-accommodation requirements.

decided that Congress could, under this provision, forbidEnglish literacy tests for Puerto Rican voters in New York

State who met certain educational criteria. Though thosetests were not themselves in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment, we held that $ 5 authorizes prophylactic legisla-tion--that is, "legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct," Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,538 U. S. 721, 728 (2003), when Congress determines such
proscription is desirable " `to make the amendments fully ef-fective,' "

Morgan, supra, at 648 (quoting Ex parte Virginia,100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880)). We said that "the measure of

what constitutes `appropriate legislation' under $ 5 of theFourteenth Amendment" is the flexible "necessary and
proper" standard of McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,342, 421 (1819). Morgan, 384 U. S., at 651. We described

$ 5 as "a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Con-gress to exercise its discretion in determining whether and
what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of theFourteenth Amendment."

Ibid.The Morgan opinion followed close upon our decision in

South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301 (1966), whichhad upheld prophylactic application of the similarly worded
"enforce" provision of the Fifteenth Amendment ($ 2) to chal-lenged provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But the
Fourteenth Amendment, unlike the Fifteenth, is not limitedto denial of the franchise and not limited to the denial of
other rights on the basis of race. In City of Boerne v. Flo-res, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), we confronted Congress's inevitable
expansion of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted inMorgan, beyond the field of racial discrimination.

but in three separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of
the Court. See infra, at 563.

Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb et seq., toimpose upon the States an interpretation of the First

Amendment's Free Exercise Clause that this Court had ex-plicitly rejected. To avoid placing in congressional hands
effective power to rewrite the Bill of Rights through the me-dium of $ 5, we formulated the "congruence and proportionality" test for determining what legislation is "appropriate."
When Congress enacts prophylactic legislation, we said,there must be "proportionality or congruence between the

means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved." 521U. S., at 533.

I joined the Court's opinion in Boerne with some misgiving. I have generally rejected tests based on such malleable
standards as "proportionality," because they have a way of
turning into vehicles for the implementation of individual
judges' policy preferences. See, e. g., Ewing v. California,
538 U. S. 11, 31-32 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (declining to apply a "proportionality" test to the
Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment);
Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 954-956 (2000) (Scalia,
J., dissenting) (declining to apply the "undue burden" standard of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,
505 U. S. 833 (1992)); BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,
517 U. S. 559, 599 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (declining to
apply a "reasonableness" test to punitive damages under the
Due Process Clause). Even so, I signed on to the "congruence and proportionality" test in Boerne, and adhered to it
in later cases: Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense
Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627 (1999), where we
held that the provisions of the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, 35 U. S. C. $$ 271(h), 296(a),
were " `so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that [they] cannot be understood as responsive
to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior,' " 527

United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), where we
held that a provision of the Violence Against Women Act of
1994, 42 U. S. C. $ 13981, lacked congruence and proportional-ity because it was "not aimed at proscribing discrimination

by officials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not it-self proscribe," 529 U. S., at 626; and

Board of Trustees of
Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001), where we said
that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA), 104 Stat. 330, 42 U. S. C. $$ 12111-12117, raised "the
same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality
as were found in City of Boerne," 531 U. S., at 372.

But these cases were soon followed by Nevada Dept. of
Human Resources v. Hibbs, in which the Court held that the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 9, 29 U. S. C.

$ 2612 et seq., which required States to provide their employees up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave (for various purposes) annually, was "congruent and proportional to its remedial object [of preventing sex discrimination], and can be
understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior." 538 U. S., at 740 (internal quotation
marks omitted). I joined Justice Kennedy's dissent,
which established (conclusively, I thought) that Congress had
identified no unconstitutional state action to which the statute could conceivably be a proportional response. And now
we have today's decision, holding that Title II of the ADA is
congruent and proportional to the remediation of constitutional violations, in the face of what seems to me a compelling demonstration of the opposite by The Chief Justice's
dissent.

I yield to the lessons of experience. The "congruence and
proportionality" standard, like all such flabby tests, is a

Scalia, J., dissenting
standing invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policy-drivendecisionmaking. Worse still, it casts this Court in the role

of Congress's taskmaster. Under it, the courts (and ulti-mately this Court) must regularly check Congress's homework to make sure that it has identified sufficient consti-tutional violations to make its remedy congruent and
proportional. As a general matter, we are ill advised to
adopt or adhere to constitutional rules that bring us intoconstant conflict with a coequal branch of Government.

And when conflict is unavoidable, we should not come to dobattle with the United States Congress armed only with a
test ("congruence and proportionality") that has no demonstrable basis in the text of the Constitution and cannot objectively be shown to have been met or failed. As I wrote for
the Court in an earlier case, "low walls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict." Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.
211, 239 (1995).

I would replace "congruence and proportionality" with another test--one that provides a clear, enforceable limitation
supported by the text of $ 5. Section 5 grants Congress the
power "to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. U. S. Const., Amdt.
14 (emphasis added). Morgan notwithstanding, one does
not, within any normal meaning of the term, "enforce" a prohibition by issuing a still broader prohibition directed to the
same end. One does not, for example, "enforce" a 55-mileper-hour speed limit by imposing a 45-mile-per-hour speed
limit--even though that is indeed directed to the same end
of automotive safety and will undoubtedly result in many
fewer violations of the 55-mile-per-hour limit. And one does
not "enforce" the right of access to the courts at issue in this
case, see ante, at 531, by requiring that disabled persons be
provided access to all of the "services, programs, or activities" furnished or conducted by the State, 42 U. S. C. $ 12132.
That is simply not what the power to enforce means--or ever

meant. The 1860 edition of Noah Webster's American Dic-tionary of the English Language, current when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, defined "enforce" as: "Toput in execution; to cause to take effect; as, to

enforce the
laws." Id., at 396. See also J. Worcester, Dictionary of theEnglish Language 484 (1860) ("To put in force; to cause to

be applied or executed; as, `To enforce a law' "). Nothing
in $ 5 allows Congress to go beyond the provisions of theFourteenth Amendment to proscribe, prevent, or "remedy"

conduct that does not itself violate any provision of the Four-teenth Amendment. So-called "prophylactic legislation" is
reinforcement rather than enforcement.

Morgan asserted that this commonsense interpretation
"would confine the legislative power . . . to the insignificant
role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial
branch was prepared to adjudge unconstitutional, or of
merely informing the judgment of the judiciary by particularizing the `majestic generalities' of $ 1 of the Amendment."
384 U. S., at 648-649. That is not so. One must remember
"that in 1866 the lower federal courts had no general jurisdiction of cases alleging a deprivation of rights secured by
the Constitution." R. Berger, Government By Judiciary 247
(2d ed. 1997). If, just after the Fourteenth Amendment was
ratified, a State had enacted a law imposing racially discriminatory literacy tests (different questions for different races)
a citizen prejudiced by such a test would have had no means
of asserting his constitutional right to be free of it. Section
5 authorizes Congress to create a cause of action through
which the citizen may vindicate his Fourteenth Amendment
rights. One of the first pieces of legislation passed under
Congress's $ 5 power was the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20,
1871, 17 Stat. 13, entitled "An Act to enforce the Provisions
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, and for other Purposes." Section 1 of that
Act, later codified as Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, authorized a cause of action against "any person who, under

color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, orusage of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected,

any person within the jurisdiction of the United States tothe deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States." 17 Stat.13. Section 5 would also authorize measures that do not
restrict the States' substantive scope of action but imposerequirements directly related to the

facilitation of "enforce-ment"--for example, reporting requirements that would

enable violations of the Fourteenth Amendment to be identi-fied.

2 But what $ 5 does not authorize is so-called "prophylactic" measures, prohibiting primary conduct that is itselfnot forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.

The major impediment to the approach I have suggestedis stare decisis. A lot of water has gone under the bridge
since Morgan, and many important and well-accepted meas-ures, such as the Voting Rights Act, assume the validity of
Morgan and South Carolina. As Prof. Archibald Cox putit in his Supreme Court Foreword: "The etymological meaning of section 5 may favor the narrower reading. Literally,`to enforce' means to compel performance of the obligations
imposed; but the linguistic argument lost much of its forceonce the

South Carolina and Morgan cases decided thatthe power to enforce embraces any measure appropriate to

effectuating the performance of the state's constitutionalduty." Foreword: Constitutional Adjudication and the Promotion of Human Rights, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 91, 110-111 (1966).

2 Professor Tribe's treatise gives some examples of such measures that
facilitate enforcement in the context of the Fifteenth Amendment:

"The Civil Rights Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 634, authorized the Attorney
General to seek injunctions against interference with the right to vote on
racial grounds. The Civil Rights Act of 1960, 74 Stat. 86, permitted joinder of states as parties defendant, gave the Attorney General access to
local voting records, and authorized courts to register voters in areas
of systemic discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241,
expedited the hearing of voting cases before three-judge courts . . . ."

However, South Carolina and Morgan, all of our latercases except Hibbs that give an expansive meaning to "enforce" in $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and all of ourearlier cases that even suggest such an expansive meaning
in dicta, involved congressional measures that were directedexclusively against, or were used in the particular case to
remedy, racial discrimination. See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400U. S. 112 (1970) (see discussion

infra); Ex parte Virginia, 100U. S. 339 (1880) (dictum in a case involving a statute that

imposed criminal penalties for officials' racial discriminationin jury selection); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303,
311-312 (1880) (dictum in a case involving a statute that per-mitted removal to federal court of a black man's claim that
his jury had been selected in a racially discriminatory man-ner); Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880) (dictum in a
racial discrimination case involving the same statute). Seealso City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 173-178
(1980) (upholding as valid legislation under $ 2 of the Fif-teenth Amendment the most sweeping provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392U. S. 409, 439-441 (1968) (upholding a law, 42 U. S. C. $ 1982,
banning public or private racial discrimination in the saleand rental of property as appropriate legislation under $ 2 of
the Thirteenth Amendment).Giving $ 5 more expansive scope with regard to measures
directed against racial discrimination by the States accordsto practices that are distinctively violative of the principal
purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment a priority of at-tention that this Court envisioned from the beginning, and
that has repeatedly been reflected in our opinions. In the
Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873), the Court'sfirst confrontation with the Fourteenth Amendment, we said

the following with respect to the Equal Protection Clause:

"We doubt very much whether any action of a State notdirected by way of discrimination against the negroes as

a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to

Scalia, J., dissenting
come within the purview of this provision. It is soclearly a provision for that race and that emergency,

that a strong case would be necessary for its applicationto any other."

Racial discrimination was the practice at issue in the earlycases (cited in Morgan) that gave such an expansive description of the effects of $ 5. See 384 U. S., at 648 (citingEx parte Virginia); 384 U. S., at 651 (citing Strauder v. West
Virginia and Virginia v. Rives).3 In those early days, bearin mind, the guarantee of equal protection had not been extended beyond race to sex, age, and the many other cat-egories it now covers. Also still to be developed were the
incorporation doctrine (which holds that the FourteenthAmendment incorporates and applies against the States the
Bill of Rights, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 147-148 (1968)) and the doctrine of so-called "substantive due
process" (which holds that the Fourteenth Amendment's DueProcess Clause protects unenumerated liberties, see gener3 A later case cited in Morgan, James Everard's Breweries v. Day, 265
U. S. 545, 558-563 (1924), applied the more flexible standard of McCulloch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), to the Eighteenth Amendment, which,
in $ 1, forbade "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating
liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof
from the United States . . . for beverage purposes" and provided, in $ 2,
that "Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." Congress had provided, in
the Supplemental Prohibition Act of 1921, $ 2, 42 Stat. 222, that "only spirituous and vinous liquor may be prescribed for medicinal purposes." That
was challenged as unconstitutional because it went beyond the regulation
of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and hence beyond "enforcement." In an opinion citing none of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment cases discussed in text, the Court held that the McCulloch v. Maryland test applied. Unlike what is at issue here, that case
did not involve a power to control the States in respects not otherwise
permitted by the Constitution. The only consequence of the Federal Government's going beyond "enforcement" narrowly defined was its arguable
incursion upon powers left to the States--which is essentially the same
issue that McCulloch addressed.

ally Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992)).
Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment did not include the manyguarantees that it now provides. In such a seemingly limited context, it did not appear to be a massive expansion ofcongressional power to interpret $ 5 broadly. Broad interpretation was particularly appropriate with regard to racial
discrimination, since that was the principal evil againstwhich the Equal Protection Clause was directed, and the

principal constitutional prohibition that some of the Statesstubbornly ignored. The former is still true, and the latter
remained true at least as late as Morgan.

When congressional regulation has not been targeted at
racial discrimination, we have given narrower scope to $ 5.
In Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970), the Court upheld,
under $ 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, that provision of the
Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 314, which
barred literacy tests and similar voter-eligibility requirements--classic tools of the racial discrimination in voting
that the Fifteenth Amendment forbids; but found to be beyond the $ 5 power of the Fourteenth Amendment the provision that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 in state elections. See 400 U. S., at 124-130 (opinion of Black, J.); id., at
153-154 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part); id., at 293-296 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and
Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). A
third provision, which forbade States from disqualifying voters by reason of residency requirements, was also upheld--
but only a minority of the Justices believed that $ 5 was
adequate authority. Justice Black's opinion in that case
described exactly the line I am drawing here, suggesting
that Congress's enforcement power is broadest when directed "to the goal of eliminating discrimination on account
of race." Id., at 130. And of course the results reached in
Boerne, Florida Prepaid, Kimel, Morrison, and Garrett are
consistent with the narrower compass afforded congressional

Scalia, J., dissenting
regulation that does not protect against or prevent racial
discrimination.

Thus, principally for reasons of stare decisis, I shall henceforth apply the permissive McCulloch standard to congressional measures designed to remedy racial discrimination by
the States. I would not, however, abandon the requirement
that Congress may impose prophylactic $ 5 legislation only
upon those particular States in which there has been an
identified history of relevant constitutional violations. See
Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 741-743 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Morrison, 529 U. S., at 626-627; Morgan, 384 U. S., at 666-667,
669, 670-671 (Harlan, J., dissenting).4 I would also adhere
to the requirement that the prophylactic remedy predicated
upon such state violations must be directed against the
States or state actors rather than the public at large. See
Morrison, supra, at 625-626. And I would not, of course,
permit any congressional measures that violate other provisions of the Constitution. When those requirements have
been met, however, I shall leave it to Congress, under constraints no tighter than those of the Necessary and Proper
Clause, to decide what measures are appropriate under $ 5
to prevent or remedy racial discrimination by the States.

4 Dicta in one of our earlier cases seemed to suggest that even nonprophylactic provisions could not be adopted under $ 5 except in response to
a State's constitutional violations:

"When the State has been guilty of no violation of [the Fourteenth Amendment's] provisions; when it has not made or enforced any law abridging
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; when no one
of its departments has deprived any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law, or denied to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws; when, on the contrary, the laws of the
State, as enacted by its legislative, and construed by its judicial, and administered by its executive departments, recognize and protect the rights
of all persons, the amendment imposes no duty and confers no power upon
Congress." United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 639 (1883).

I do not see the textual basis for this interpretation.

I shall also not subject to "congruence and proportional-ity" analysis congressional action under $ 5 that is not directed to racial discrimination. Rather, I shall give full ef-fect to that action when it consists of "enforcement" of the
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, within the broadbut not unlimited meaning of that term I have described
above. When it goes beyond enforcement to prophylaxis,however, I shall consider it ultra vires. The present legislation is plainly of the latter sort.

of language where state racial discrimination is at issue donot apply in this field of social policy far removed from the
principal object of the Civil War Amendments. "The seduc-tive plausibility of single steps in a chain of evolutionary development of a legal rule is often not perceived until a third,fourth, or fifth `logical' extension occurs. Each step, when
taken, appeared a reasonable step in relation to that whichpreceded it, although the aggregate or end result is one that
would never have been seriously considered in the first in-stance. This kind of gestative propensity calls for the `line
drawing' familiar in the judicial, as in the legislative process:`thus far but not beyond.' "

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 02-1689. Argued March 3, 2004--Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent Atlas Global Group, L. P., a limited partnership created under

Texas law, filed a state-law suit against petitioner, a Mexican corporation, in federal court, alleging diversity jurisdiction. After the jury
returned a verdict for Atlas, but before entry of judgment, petitioner
moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties were not diverse at the time the complaint was filed. In granting
the motion, the Magistrate Judge found that, as a partnership, Atlas
was a Mexican citizen because two of its partners, also respondents,
were Mexican citizens at the time of filing; and that the requisite diversity was absent because petitioner was also a Mexican citizen. On appeal, Atlas urged the Fifth Circuit to disregard the diversity failure at
the time of filing because the Mexican partners had left Atlas before the
trial began and, thus, diversity existed thereafter. Relying on Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, the Fifth Circuit held that the conclusiveness of citizenship at the time of filing is subject to an exception
where, as here, the jurisdictional error was not identified until after the
jury's verdict and the postfiling change in the partnership cured the
jurisdictional defect before it was identified.

Held: A party's postfiling change in citizenship cannot cure a lack of

subject-matter jurisdiction that existed at the time of filing in a diversity action. This Court has long adhered to the rule that subjectmatter jurisdiction in diversity cases depends on the state of facts that
existed at the time of filing. Caterpillar's statement that "[o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court . . . considerations of finality,
efficiency, and economy become overwhelming," 519 U. S., at 75, did not
augur a new approach to deciding whether a jurisdictional defect has
been cured. The jurisdictional defect Caterpillar addressed had been
cured by the dismissal of the party that had destroyed diversity, a curing method that had long been an exception to the time-of-filing rule.
This Court has never approved a deviation from the longstanding rule
that "[w]here there is no change of party, a jurisdiction depending on
the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the
commencement of the suit." Conolly v. Taylor, 2 Pet. 556, 565 (emphasis added). Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is the only

option available here. Allowing a citizenship change in the partnership
to cure the jurisdictional defect existing at the time of filing would contravene the Conolly principle. Apart from breaking with this Court's
longstanding precedent, holding that "finality, efficiency, and judicial
economy" can justify suspension of the time-of-filing rule would create
an exception of indeterminate scope that is bound to produce costly collateral litigation. Pp. 570-582.

I

Respondent Atlas Global Group, L. P., is a limited partnership created under Texas law. In November 1997, Atlas
filed a state-law suit against petitioner Grupo Dataflux, a
Mexican corporation, in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas. The complaint contained
claims for breach of contract and in quantum meruit, seeking over $1.3 million in damages. It alleged that "[f]ederal
jurisdiction is proper based upon diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a), as this suit is between a Texas
citizen [Atlas] and a citizen or subject of Mexico [Grupo Da541US2 Unit: $U49 [05-10-06 14:38:40] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
taflux]." 1 App. 19a (Complaint || 3). Pretrial motions anddiscovery consumed almost three years. In October 2000,

the parties consented to a jury trial presided over by a Mag-istrate Judge. On October 27, after a 6-day trial, the jury
returned a verdict in favor of Atlas awarding $750,000 indamages.

On November 18, before entry of the judgment, Datafluxfiled a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties were not diverse at the time thecomplaint was filed. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1),
(h)(3). The Magistrate Judge granted the motion. The dis-missal was based upon the accepted rule that, as a partnership, Atlas is a citizen of each State or foreign country ofwhich any of its partners is a citizen. See

Carden v. Ark-oma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 192-195 (1990). Because

Atlas had two partners who were Mexican citizens at thetime of filing, the partnership was a Mexican citizen. (It
was also a citizen of Delaware and Texas based on the citi-zenship of its other partners.) And because the defendant,
Dataflux, was a Mexican corporation, aliens were on bothsides of the case, and the requisite diversity was therefore
absent. See Mossman v. Higginson, 4 Dall. 12, 14 (1800).On appeal, Atlas did not dispute the finding of no diversity
at the time of filing. It urged the Court of Appeals to disre-gard this failure and reverse dismissal because the Mexican
partners had left the partnership in a transaction consum-mated the month before trial began. Atlas argued that,
since diversity existed when the jury rendered its verdict,dismissal was inappropriate. The Fifth Circuit agreed.
312 F. 3d 168, 174 (2002). It acknowledged the general rulethat, for purposes of determining the existence of diversity

jurisdiction, the citizenship of the parties is to be determinedwith reference to the facts as they existed at the time of

filing. Id., at 170. However, relying on our decision in Cat-erpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 (1996), it held that the
conclusiveness of citizenship at the time of filing was subjectto exception when the following conditions are satisfied:

"(1) [A]n action is filed or removed when constitutionaland/or statutory jurisdictional requirements are not
met, (2) neither the parties nor the judge raise the erroruntil after a jury verdict has been rendered, or a dispositive ruling has been made by the court, and (3) beforethe verdict is rendered, or ruling is issued, the jurisdictional defect is cured." 312 F. 3d, at 174.
The opinion strictly limited the exception as follows: "If atany point prior to the verdict or ruling, the issue is raised,

the court must apply the general rule and dismiss regardlessof subsequent changes in citizenship."

Ibid.The jurisdictional error in the present case not having

been identified until after the jury returned its verdict; andthe postfiling change in the composition of the partnership
having (in the Court's view) cured the jurisdictional defect;the Court reversed and remanded with instructions to the
District Court to enter judgment in favor of Atlas. Ibid.We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 944 (2003).

It has long been the case that "the jurisdiction of the courtdepends upon the state of things at the time of the action

Opinion of the Court
taught to first-year law students in any basic course
on federal civil procedure. It measures all challenges to
subject-matter jurisdiction premised upon diversity of citizenship against the state of facts that existed at the time of
filing--whether the challenge be brought shortly after filing,
after the trial, or even for the first time on appeal. (Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised
at any time prior to final judgment. See Capron v. Van
Noorden, 2 Cranch 126 (1804).)

We have adhered to the time-of-filing rule regardless of
the costs it imposes. For example, in Anderson v. Watt, 138
U. S. 694 (1891), two executors of an estate, claiming to be
New York citizens, had brought a diversity-based suit in federal court against defendants alleged to be Florida citizens.
When it later developed that two of the defendants were
New York citizens, the plaintiffs sought to save jurisdiction
by revoking the letters testamentary for one executor and
alleging that the remaining executor was in fact a British
citizen. The Court rejected this attempted postfiling salvage operation, because at the time of filing the executors
included a New Yorker. Id., at 708. It dismissed the case
for want of jurisdiction, even though the case had been filed
about 51/2 years earlier, the trial court had entered a decree
ordering land to be sold 4 years earlier, the sale had been
made, exceptions had been filed and overruled, and the case
had come to the Court on appeal from the order confirming
the land sale. Id., at 698. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Fuller adhered to the principle set forth in Conolly v.
Taylor, 2 Pet. 556, 565 (1829), that "jurisdiction depending
on the condition of the party is governed by that condition,
as it was at the commencement of the suit." "[J]urisdiction," he reasoned, "could no more be given . . . by the
amendment than if a citizen of Florida had sued another in

that court and subsequently sought to give it jurisdiction byremoving from the State." 138 U. S., at 708.

It is uncontested that application of the time-of-filing ruleto this case would require dismissal, but Atlas contends that

this Court "should accept the very limited exception createdby the Fifth Circuit to the time-of-filing principle." Brief
for Respondents 2. The Fifth Circuit and Atlas rely on ourstatement in

Caterpillar, supra, at 75, that "[o]nce a diver-sity case has been tried in federal court . . . considerations

of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming."This statement unquestionably provided the ratio decidendi
in Caterpillar, but it did not augur a new approach to decid-ing whether a jurisdictional defect has been cured.

Caterpillar broke no new ground, because the jurisdic-tional defect it addressed had been cured by the dismissal of
the party that had destroyed diversity. That method of cur-ing a jurisdictional defect had long been an exception to the
time-of-filing rule. "[T]he question always is, or should be,when objection is taken to the jurisdiction of the court by
reason of the citizenship of some of the parties, whether . . .they are indispensable parties, for if their interests are severable and a decree without prejudice to their rights may bemade, the jurisdiction of the court should be retained and
the suit dismissed as to them." Horn v. Lockhart, 17 Wall.570, 579 (1873). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 provides
that "[p]arties may be dropped or added by order of the courton motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage
of the action and on such terms as are just." By now, "it is

3 The dissent asserts that Anderson is "not altogether in tune with Caterpillar and Newman-Green," post, at 591, n. 7 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.),
but the cases can easily be harmonized. Anderson did not, as the dissent
suggests, refuse to give diversity-perfecting effect to the dismissal of an
independent severable party; it refused to give that effect to the alteration of a coexecutorship into a lone executorship--much as we decline
to give diversity-perfecting effect to the alteration of a partnership
with diversity-destroying partners into a partnership without diversitydestroying partners.

Opinion of the Court
well settled that Rule 21 invests district courts with author-ity to allow a dispensable nondiverse party to be dropped

at any time, even after judgment has been rendered."
Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 832
(1989). Indeed, the Court held in Newman-Green thatcourts of appeals also have the authority to cure a jurisdictional defect by dismissing a dispensable nondiverse party.
Id., at 837.

Caterpillar involved an unremarkable application of this
established exception. Complete diversity had been lackingat the time of removal to federal court, because one of the

plaintiffs shared Kentucky citizenship with one of the defendants. Almost three years after the District Court denied a motion to remand, but before trial, the diversitydestroying defendant settled out of the case and was
dismissed. The case proceeded to a 6-day jury trial, resulting in judgment for the defendant, Caterpillar, against
Lewis. This Court unanimously held that the lack of complete diversity at the time of removal did not require dismissal of the case.

The sum of Caterpillar's jurisdictional analysis was an approving acknowledgment of Lewis's admission that there
was "complete diversity, and therefore federal subjectmatter jurisdiction, at the time of trial and judgment." 519
U. S., at 73. The failure to explain why this solved the problem was not an oversight, because there was nothing novel
to explain. The postsettlement dismissal of the diversitydestroying defendant cured the jurisdictional defect just as
the dismissal of the diversity-destroying party had done in
Newman-Green. In both cases, the less-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the action had been
converted to complete diversity between the remaining parties to the final judgment. See also Horn, supra, at 579.

While recognizing that Caterpillar is "technically" distinguishable because the defect was cured by the dismissal of a
diversity-destroying party, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that

574 GRUPO DATAFLUX v. ATLAS GLOBAL GROUP, L. P.

Opinion of the Court
"this factor was not at the heart of the Supreme Court'sanalysis . . . ." 312 F. 3d, at 172-173. The crux of the analysis, according to the Fifth Circuit, was Caterpillar's state-ment that "[o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal
court . . . considerations of finality, efficiency, and economybecome overwhelming." 519 U. S., at 75. This was indeed
the crux of analysis in Caterpillar, but analysis of a differentissue. It related not to cure of the

jurisdictional defect, butto cure of a statutory defect, namely, failure to comply with

the requirement of the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a),that there be complete diversity at the time of removal.

4

The argument to which the statement was directed took asits starting point that subject-matter jurisdiction had been

satisfied: "ultimate satisfaction of the subject-matter juris-diction requirement ought not swallow up antecedent statutory violations." 519 U. S., at 74 (emphasis added). The re-sulting holding of Caterpillar, therefore, is only that a
statutory defect--"Caterpillar's failure to meet the $ 1441(a)requirement that the case be fit for federal adjudication at
the time the removal petition is filed," id., at 73--did notrequire dismissal once there was no longer any jurisdictional defect. III

To our knowledge, the Court has never approved a devia-tion from the rule articulated by Chief Justice Marshall in
1829 that "[w]here there is no change of party, a jurisdictiondepending on the condition of the party is governed by that
condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit." Conolly, 2 Pet., at 565 (emphasis added). Unless the Court is tomanufacture a brand-new exception to the time-of-filing rule,

4 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a) provides, in relevant part:
"Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil
action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United
States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the
defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and
division embracing the place where such action is pending."

575Cite as: 541 U. S. 567 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is the onlyoption available in this case. The purported cure arose not

from a change in the parties to the action, but from a changein the citizenship of a continuing party. Withdrawal of the
Mexican partners from Atlas did not change the fact thatAtlas, the single artificial entity created under Texas law,
remained a party to the action. True, the composition ofthe partnership, and consequently its citizenship, changed.
But allowing a citizenship change to cure the jurisdictionaldefect that existed at the time of filing would contravene the
principle articulated by Chief Justice Marshall in Conolly.5We decline to do today what the Court has refused to do for
the past 175 years.Apart from breaking with our longstanding precedent,
holding that "finality, efficiency, and judicial economy" canjustify suspension of the time-of-filing rule would create an
exception of indeterminate scope. The Court of Appealssought to cabin the exception with the statement that "[i]f
at any point prior to the verdict or ruling, the [absence ofdiversity at the time of filing] is raised, the court must apply
the general rule and dismiss regardless of subsequent

5 The dissent acknowledges that "[t]he Court has long applied [Chief
Justice] Marshall's time-of-filing rule categorically to postfiling changes
that otherwise would destroy diversity jurisdiction," post, at 583-584, but
asserts that "[i]n contrast, the Court has not adhered to a similarly steady
rule for postfiling changes in the party lineup, alterations that perfect
previously defective statutory subject-matter jurisdiction," post, at 584.
The authorities relied upon by the dissent do not call into question the
particular aspect of the time-of-filing rule that is at issue in this case--
the principle (quoted in text) that "[w]here there is no change of party, a
jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that
condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit." Conolly, 2 Pet.,
at 565 (emphasis added). The dissent identifies five cases in which the
Court permitted a postfiling change to cure a jurisdictional defect. Post,
at 584. Every one of them involved a change of party. The dissent does
not identify a single case in which the Court held that a single party's
postfiling change of citizenship cured a previously existing jurisdictional
defect.

Opinion of the Court
changes in citizenship." 312 F. 3d, at 174. This limitationis unsound in principle and certain to be ignored in practice.

It is unsound in principle because there is no basis in rea-son or logic to dismiss preverdict if in fact the change in
citizenship has eliminated the jurisdictional defect. Eitherthe court has jurisdiction at the time the defect is identified
(because the parties are diverse at that time) or it does not
(because the postfiling citizenship change is irrelevant). Ifthe former, then dismissal is inappropriate; if the latter, then

retention of jurisdiction postverdict is inappropriate.Only two escapes from this dilemma come to mind, neither
of which is satisfactory. First, one might say that it is not
any change in party citizenship that cures the jurisdictional
defect, but only a change that remains unnoticed until the
end of trial. That is not so much a logical explanation as a
restatement of the illogic that produces the dilemma. There
is no conceivable reason why the jurisdictional deficiency
which continues despite the citizenship change should suddenly disappear upon the rendering of a verdict. Second,
one might say that there never was a cure, but that the party
who failed to object before the end of trial forfeited his objection. This is logical enough, but comes up against the established principle, reaffirmed earlier this Term, that "a court's
subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account
for the parties' litigation conduct." Kontrick v. Ryan, 540
U. S. 443, 456 (2004). "A litigant generally may raise a
court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the
same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance." Id., at 455. Because the Fifth Circuit's attempted
limitation upon its new exception makes a casualty either of
logic or of this Court's jurisprudence, there is no principled
way to defend it.

And principled or not, the Fifth Circuit's artificial limitation is sure to be discarded in practice. Only 8% of diversity
cases concluded in 2003 actually went to trial, and the median
time from filing to trial disposition was nearly two years.

Opinion of the Court
See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Sta-tistics on Diversity Filings and Terminations in District

Courts for Calendar Year 2003 (on file with the Clerk ofCourt). In such a litigation environment, an approach to jurisdiction that focuses on efficiency and judicial economy can-not possibly be held to the line drawn by the Court of Appeals. As Judge Garza observed in his dissent:

"[T]here is no difference in efficiency terms between thejury verdict and, for example, the moment at which the

jury retires. Nor, for that matter, is there a large dif-ference between the verdict and mid-way through the
trial. . . . Indeed, in complicated cases requiring a greatdeal of discovery, the parties and the court often expend
tremendous resources long before the case goes to trial."312 F. 3d, at 177.

IV
The dissenting opinion rests on two principal propositions:(1) the jurisdictional defect in this case was cured by a

change in the composition of the partnership; and (2) refusingto recognize an exception to the time-of-filing rule in this
case wastes judicial resources, while creating an exceptiondoes not. We discuss each in turn.

A
Unlike the dissent, our opinion does not turn on whetherthe jurisdictional defect here contained at least "minimal

diversity." 6 Regardless of how one characterizes the ac6 The answer to the "minimal diversity" question is not as straightforward as the dissent's analysis suggests. We understand "minimal diversity" to mean the existence of at least one party who is diverse in
citizenship from one party on the other side of the case, even though the
extraconstitutional "complete diversity" required by our cases is lacking.
It is possible, though far from clear, that one can have opposing parties in
a two-party case who are cocitizens, and yet have minimal Article III
jurisdiction because of the multiple citizenship of one of the parties. Although the Court has previously said that minimal diversity requires "two

578 GRUPO DATAFLUX v. ATLAS GLOBAL GROUP, L. P.

Opinion of the Court
knowledged jurisdictional defect, it was never cured. Theonly two ways in which one could conclude that it had been

cured would be either (1) to acknowledge that a party's post-filing change of citizenship can cure a time-of-filing jurisdictional defect, or (2) to treat a change in the composition of apartnership like a change in the parties to the action. The
Court has never, to our knowledge, done the former; and noteven the dissent suggests that it ought to do so in this case.

7

The dissent diverges from our analysis by adopting the latterapproach, stating that "this case seems . . . indistinguishable

from one in which there is a change in the parties to theaction."

Post, at 591 (internal quotation marks omitted).This equation of a dropped partner with a dropped party

is flatly inconsistent with Carden. The dissent in Cardensought to apply a "real party to the controversy" approach
to determine which partners counted for purposes of juris-dictional analysis. The Carden majority rejected that apadverse parties [who] are not co-citizens," State Farm Fire & Casualty
Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 531 (1967), the Court did not have before it a
multiple-citizenship situation.

The dissent contends that the existence of minimal diversity was clear
because the rule of Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185 (1990), is
not required by the Constitution. Post, at 588-590. But neither is the
rule that a corporation is "a citizen of any State by which it has been
incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business."
28 U. S. C. $ 1332(c)(1). We do not understand the inquiry into minimal
diversity to proceed by hypothetically rewriting, to whatever the Constitution might allow that would support Article III jurisdiction in the particular case, all laws bearing upon the diversity question. Whether the
Constitution requires it or not, Carden is the subconstitutional rule by
which we determine the citizenship of a partnership--and in this case it
leads to the conclusion that there were no opposing parties who were
not cocitizens.

7 The dissent appears to leave open the possibility that this line could

be crossed in a future case, contrasting Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S.
61 (1996), not with all cases involving a party's change of citizenship, but
with the polar extreme of "a plaintiff who moves to another State to create
diversity not even minimally present when the complaint was filed,"
post, at 590.

Opinion of the Court
proach, reasoning that "[t]he question presented today is not
which of various parties before the Court should be considered for purposes of determining whether there is complete
diversity of citizenship . . . . There are not . . . multiple
respondents before the Court, but only one: the artificial entity called Arkoma Associates, a limited partnership." 494
U. S., at 188, n. 1. Today's dissent counters that "[w]hile a
partnership may be characterized as a single artificial entity,
a district court determining whether diversity jurisdiction
exists looks to the citizenship of the several persons composing [the entity]." Post, at 591, n. 8 (internal quotation marks
and citations omitted). It is true that the court "looks to"
the citizenship of the several persons composing the entity,
but it does so for the purpose of determining the citizenship
of the entity that is a party, not to determine which citizens
who compose the entity are to be treated as parties. See
Carden, 494 U. S., at 188, n. 1 ("[W]hat we must decide is the
. . . question of how the citizenship of that single artificial
entity is to be determined"); id., at 195 ("[W]e reject the
contention that to determine, for diversity purposes, the citizenship of an artificial entity, the court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity's members").8

There was from the beginning of this action a single plaintiff (Atlas), which, under Carden, was not diverse from the
sole defendant (Dataflux). Thus, this case fails to present
"two adverse parties [who] are not co-citizens." State Farm
Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 531 (1967).
Contrary to the dissent's characterization, then, this is not a

association whose citizenship, for diversity purposes, is determined by aggregating the citizenships of each of its members" could "[w]ith equal plausibility . . . be characterized as an `aggregation' composed of its members,
or an `entity' comprising its members." Post, at 590, n. 6. We think it
evident that Carden decisively adopted an understanding of the limited
partnership as an "entity," rather than an "aggregation," for purposes of
diversity jurisdiction. See 494 U. S., at 188, n. 1.

case like Caterpillar or Newman-Green in which "partylineup changes . . . simply trimmed the litigation down to

an ever-present core that met the statutory requirement."Post, at 591. Rather, this is a case in which a single party
changed its citizenship by changing its internal composition.The incompatibility with prior law of the dissent's attempt
to treat a change in partners like a change in parties is re-vealed by a curious anomaly: It would produce a case unlike
every other case in which dropping a party has cured a ju-risdictional defect, in that no judicial action (such as granting a motion to dismiss) was necessary to get the jurisdic-tional spoilers out of the case. Indeed, judicial action to
that end was not even possible: The court could hardlyhave "dismissed" the partners from the partnership to save
jurisdiction.9 B

We now turn from consideration of the conceptual diffi-culties with the dissent's disposition to consideration of its
practical consequences. The time-of-filing rule is what it isprecisely because the facts determining jurisdiction are subject to change, and because constant litigation in response tothat change would be wasteful. The dissent would have it
that the time-of-filing rule applies to establish that a courthas jurisdiction (and to protect that jurisdiction from later
destruction), but does not apply to establish that a courtlacks jurisdiction (and to prevent postfiling changes that perfect jurisdiction). Post, at 583-584. But whether destruc-tion or perfection of jurisdiction is at issue, the policy goal

9 An additional anomaly, under the particular facts of the present case,
is that the two individual Mexican partners, whom the dissent treats like
parties for purposes of enabling their withdrawal to perfect jurisdiction,
were brought into the litigation personally by the court's granting of Dataflux's motion to add them as parties for purposes of Dataflux's counterclaim. The motion was made and granted under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 13(h), which applies only to "[p]ersons other than those made
parties to the original action." (Emphasis added.)

Opinion of the Court
of minimizing litigation over jurisdiction is thwarted when-ever a new exception to the time-of-filing rule is announced,

arousing hopes of further new exceptions in the future.Cf.

Dretke v. Haley, ante, at 394-395 (recognizing that the
creation of exceptions to judge-made procedural rules willenmesh the federal courts in litigation testing the boundaries

of each new exception). That litigation-fostering effect
would be particularly strong for a new exception derivedfrom such an expandable concept as the "efficiency" rationale

relied upon by the dissent.The dissent argues that it is essential to uphold jurisdiction in this and similar cases because dismissal followed by
refiling condemns the parties to "an almost certain replay of
the case, with, in all likelihood, the same ultimate outcome."
Post, at 595. But if the parties expect "the same ultimate
outcome," they will not waste time and resources slogging
through a new trial. They will settle, with the jury's prior
verdict supplying a range for the award. Indeed, settlement instead of retrial will probably occur even if the parties
do not expect the same ultimate outcome. When the stakes
remain the same and the players have been shown each other's cards, they will not likely play the hand all the way
through just for the sake of the game. And finally, even if
the parties run the case through complete "relitigation in the
very same District Court in which it was first filed in 1997,"
post, at 598, the "waste" will not be great. Having been
through three years of discovery and pretrial motions in the
current case, the parties would most likely proceed promptly
to trial.

Looked at in its overall effect, and not merely in its application to the sunk costs of the present case, it is the dissent's
proposed rule that is wasteful. Absent uncertainty about
jurisdiction (which the dissent's readiness to change settled
law would preserve for the future), the obvious course, for a
litigant whose suit was dismissed as Atlas's was, would have
been immediately to file a new action. That is in fact what

Atlas did, though it later dismissed the new case withoutprejudice. Had that second suit been pursued instead of

this one, there is little doubt that the dispute would havebeen resolved on the merits by now. Putting aside the time
that has passed between the Fifth Circuit's decision andtoday, there were two years of wasted time between dismissal of the action and the Fifth Circuit's reversal of thatdismissal--time that the parties could have spent litigating
the merits (or engaging in serious settlement talks) insteadof litigating jurisdiction.

Atlas and Dataflux have thus far litigated this case formore than 6

1/2 years, including 31/2 years over a conceded jurisdictional defect. Compared with the one month it tookthe Magistrate Judge to apply the time-of-filing rule and

Carden when the jurisdictional problem was brought to herattention, this waste counsels strongly against any course
that would impair the certainty of our jurisdictional rulesand thereby encourage similar jurisdictional litigation.

* * *
We decline to endorse a new exception to a time-of-filingrule that has a pedigree of almost two centuries. Uncertainty regarding the question of jurisdiction is particularlyundesirable, and collateral litigation on the point particularly
wasteful. The stability provided by our time-tested ruleweighs heavily against the approval of any new deviation.
The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

98a; the defendant, Grupo Dataflux (Dataflux), was a Mexi-can corporation with its principal place of business in Mexico,

id., at 18a. In a transaction completed in September 2000unrelated to this lawsuit, all Mexican-citizen partners withdrew from Atlas. Id., at 98a, 122a-123a. Thus, before trialcommenced in October 2000, complete diversity existed.
Only after the jury returned a verdict favorable to Atlas didDataflux, by moving to dismiss the case, draw the initial jurisdictional flaw to the District Court's attention. TheCourt today holds that the initial flaw "still burden[s] and
run[s] with the case," Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61,70 (1996); see

ante, at 572-576; consequently, the entire trialand jury verdict must be nullified. In my view, the initial

defect here--the original absence of complete diversity--"isnot fatal to the ensuing adjudication." Caterpillar, 519
U. S., at 64. In accord with the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit, I would leave intact the results of the six-day
trial between completely diverse citizens, and would not ex-pose Atlas and the courts to the "exorbitant cost" of relitigation, id., at 77. I

Chief Justice Marshall, in a pathmarking 1824 opinion,
Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539, instructed "that thejurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at

this practical time-of-filing rule from any constitutional orstatutory text. In contrast, 18 years earlier, Marshall had
derived the complete-diversity rule from the text of the 1789Judiciary Act, and so stated in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3

ground that jurisdiction, originally present, was thereafterdivested.

In contrast, the Court has not adhered to a similarlysteady rule for postfiling party lineup alterations that

Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 43 (1998), with the complete-diversity rule announced in Strawbridge can operate to preserve an adjudication where (1) neither the parties nor thecourt raised the time-of-filing flaw until after resolution of
the case by jury verdict or dispositive court ruling, and(2) prior to that resolution, the jurisdictional defect was
cured. See Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 64.

App. 98a. At least arguably, the general partner Bahia Management, like
the two limited partners of Mexican citizenship, initially spoiled diversity.
Although the Court has never ruled on the issue, Courts of Appeals have
held the citizenship of each member of an LLC counts for diversity purposes. See, e. g., GMAC Commercial Credit LLC v. Dillard Dept. Stores,

(1990) (federal court must look to citizenship of partnership'slimited, as well as its general, partners to determine whether

there is complete diversity). In addition, one of Atlas' gen-eral partners at least arguably ranked as a Mexican citizen.
See supra, at 585, n. 1.

In September 2000, several weeks before trial, and unre-lated to the claims in suit, Atlas completed a transaction in

which all Mexican-citizen partners withdrew from the part-nership. App. 14a, 122a-123a, 126a-128a; Brief for Appellants in No. 01-20245 (CA5), p. 7. After that reorganization, it is not disputed, complete diversity existed between
the adverse parties. Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Respondents 2.

Prevailing at a six-day trial, Atlas gained a jury verdict of
$750,000. 312 F. 3d, at 170. Dataflux then promptly moved
to dismiss the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,
raising, for the first time, the original, but pretrial-cured,
absence of complete diversity. App. 42a-49a. The District
Court, which had not yet entered judgment on the jury's
verdict, granted Dataflux's motion; simultaneously, the court
"ordered that the statute of limitations for the claims alleged
in this case [be] stayed from November 18, 1997, the date
this case was filed, until ten days after the entry of this order
[December 6, 2000], to allow plaintiff to refile this case in the
appropriate forum." App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-22a (capitalization in original omitted). The Court of Appeals for the

Caterpillar and Newman-Green are indeed the decisionsmost closely on point. In

Caterpillar, plaintiff Lewis, a
Kentucky citizen, filed a civil action in state court againsttwo corporate defendants--Caterpillar Inc., a citizen of both

Delaware and Illinois, and Whayne Supply Company, a Ken-tucky citizen. 519 U. S., at 64-65. Several months later,
Liberty Mutual, a Massachusetts corporation, intervened as
a plaintiff, asserting claims against both defendants. Id.,at 65. After Lewis settled with Whayne Supply, Caterpillar

filed a notice of removal. Ibid. Lewis moved to remandthe case to the state court on the ground that Liberty Mutual
had not settled its claim against Whayne Supply, and that
Whayne Supply's continuing presence as a defendant in the
lawsuit defeated complete diversity. Id., at 65-66. The
District Court denied Lewis' motion to remand. Id., at 66.
Liberty Mutual and Whayne Supply subsequently settled,
and the District Court dismissed Whayne Supply from the
suit. Ibid.

The case proceeded to a jury trial, which yielded a verdict
and corresponding judgment for Caterpillar. Id., at 66-67.
On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
Lewis prevailed. Id., at 67. Observing that, at the time of
removal, diversity was incomplete, the appellate court accepted Lewis' argument that dismissal of the case for want
of subject-matter jurisdiction was obligatory. Ibid. In
turn, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment:
"[A] district court's error in failing to remand a case improperly removed," this Court held unanimously, "is not fatal to
the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is entered." Id., at 64.

States citizen domiciled in Venezuela. 490 U. S., at 828.

sponte, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit inquiredinto the basis for federal jurisdiction over the case, and concluded that the presence of the Venezuela-domiciled UnitedStates citizen spoiled complete diversity.

Id., at 828-829.3
To cure the defect, the three-judge panel granted the plain-tiff 's motion to drop the nondiverse party, citing Federal

Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at
829.4 But the full Seventh Circuit, empaneled en banc, con-cluded that an appellate court lacks such authority.

Id., at
830-831. This Court reversed that determination. Fed-eral appellate courts, the Court held, "posses[s] the authority

to grant motions to dismiss dispensable nondiverse parties."
Id., at 836.5

As in Caterpillar and Newman-Green, minimal diversitywithin Article III's compass existed in this case from the

start. See U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1 ("The judicialPower shall extend to all Cases . . . between a State, or the
Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.");
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 386 U. S., at 531 ("Article
III poses no obstacle to the legislative extension of federal
jurisdiction, founded on diversity, so long as any two adverse
parties are not co-citizens."). The jurisdictional flaw--in
Caterpillar, Newman-Green, and this case--was the absence
of complete diversity, required by the governing statute,

3 A United States citizen with no domicil in any State ranks as a stateless person for purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a)(3), providing for suits between "citizens of different States and in which citizens or subjects of a
foreign state are additional parties," and $ 1332(a)(2), authorizing federal
suit when "citizens of a State" sue "citizens or subjects of a foreign state."
See Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at 828.

4 Rule 21, governing proceedings in district courts, provides in relevant

part: "Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion
of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such
terms as are just."

5 After our decision, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the nondiverse defendant and remanded the case to the District Court. Newman-Green,

$ 1332(a), when the action commenced, a flaw eliminated at alater stage of the proceedings. Cf.

ante, at 573 (describing
Caterpillar and Newman-Green as cases in which "the less-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the

action had been converted to complete diversity between theremaining parties to the final judgment").

It bears clarification why this case, in common with Caterpillar and Newman-Green, met the constitutional require-ment of minimal diversity at the onset of the litigation.

True, Atlas' case involves a partnership, while the diversityspoiler in

Caterpillar was a corporation and in NewmanGreen, an individual. See supra, at 587-588 and this page.
In Carden v. Arkoma Associates, this Court held that, in
determining a partnership's qualification to sue or be sued
under $ 1332, the citizenship of each partner, whether general or limited, must be attributed to the partnership. See
494 U. S., at 195-196.

Notably, however, the Court did not suggest in Carden
that minimal diversity, which is adequate for Article III purposes, would be absent when some, but not all, partners composing the "single artificial entity," id., at 188, n. 1, share
the opposing party's citizenship. To the contrary, the Court
emphasized in Carden that Congress could, "by legislation,"
determine which of the "wide assortment of artificial entities
possessing different powers and characteristics . . . is entitled
to be considered a `citizen' for diversity purposes, and which
of their members' citizenship is to be consulted." Id., at 197.
Congress would be disarmed from making such determinations--for example, from legislating that only the citizenship
of general partners counts for $ 1332 purposes--if Article III
itself commanded that each partner's citizenship, limited and
general partner's alike, inescapably adheres to the partnership entity. See ibid.; cf. Steelworkers v. R. H. Bouligny,
Inc., 382 U. S. 145, 153 (1965) (assimilating unincorporated
labor unions to the status of corporations for diversity
purposes, instead of counting each member's citizenship,

is a matter "suited to the legislative and not the judicialbranch"). Just as Article III did not dictate the Carden decision, so the question here is plainly subconstitutional incharacter.

B
Petitioner Dataflux maintains, and the Court agrees, see
ante, at 573-574, that this case is not properly bracketedwith Caterpillar, where the subtraction of a party yielded

complete diversity; instead, according to Dataflux, this caseshould be aligned with those in which an individual plaintiff
initially shared citizenship with a defendant, and then, post-commencement of the litigation, moved to another State.
See Brief for Petitioner 12-14, and n. 9, 23-24; Tr. of OralArg. 8-11. In my view, this case ranks with

Caterpillar andis not equivalent to the case of a plaintiff who moves to another State to create diversity not even minimally presentwhen the complaint was filed.

It has long been clear that "if a citizen sue[d] a citizen ofthe same state, he [could not] give jurisdiction by removing
himself, and becoming a citizen of a different state." Con-olly, 2 Pet., at 565.

6 When that sole plaintiff files suit in

federal court, there is no semblance of Article III diversity;his move to another State manufactures diversity of citizenship that did not exist even minimally at the outset. Caterpillar and Newman-Green, by contrast, involved parties whowere minimally, but not completely, diverse at the time

federal-court proceedings began. Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at

6 In Conolly, a party "was struck out of the bill before the cause was
brought before the court." 2 Pet., at 564. Since Conolly, the Court has
addressed the time-of-filing rule in a variety of cases in which the party
lineup changed during the pendency of the litigation. See supra, at 584;
ante, at 575, n. 5. The Court, however, has not previously ruled on a case
resembling the controversy at hand, i. e., one involving an association
whose citizenship, for diversity purposes, is determined by aggregating
the citizenships of each of its members. With equal plausibility, such an
association could be characterized as an "aggregation" composed of its
members, or an "entity" comprising its members.

64-65; Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at 828; supra, at 587-589.
The postcommencement party lineup changes in Caterpillar
and Newman-Green simply trimmed the litigation down to
an ever-present core that met the statutory requirement.7

The same holds true for Atlas. No partner moved. Instead, those that spoiled statutory diversity dropped out of
the case as did the nondiverse parties in Caterpillar and
Newman-Green. See supra, at 587-589. In essence, then,
this case seems to me indistinguishable from one in which
there is "a change in the parties to the action." Ante, at
575.8 As the Court correctly states, the crux of our disagreement lies in whether to "treat a change in the composition of a partnership like a change in the parties to the action." Ante, at 578. In common with Dataflux, the Court
draws no distinction between an individual plaintiff who
changes her citizenship and an enterprise composed of diverse persons, like Atlas, from which one or more original

7 Anderson v. Watt, 138 U. S. 694 (1891), see ante, at 571-572, is not
altogether in tune with Caterpillar and Newman-Green. In Anderson,
coexecutors sued for the benefit of an estate. 138 U. S., at 703. One
of the coexecutors, it turned out, shared common citizenship with two of
the defendants. To salvage the adjudication, the nondiverse coexecutor
sought to withdraw both as executor and as plaintiff, but the Court declined to give effect to the postfiling change in the party lineup. Id.,
at 708. The Court would harmonize Anderson with Caterpillar and
Newman-Green by attributing entity, rather than aggregate, status to the
Anderson coexecutors. Ante, at 572, n. 3. But that characterization is
hardly preordained. If, as it seems to me, either characterization would
be plausible, Caterpillar and Newman-Green suggest that the one preserving the adjudication ought to hold sway.

8 While a partnership may be characterized as a "single artificial entity,"

Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 188, n. 1 (1990), a district
court determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists looks "to the citizenship of the several persons composing [the entity]," Great Southern
Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 449, 456 (1900). I. e., the district
court looks to the citizenship of each general and limited partner, just as
in multiparty litigation the court looks to the citizenship of each litigant
joined on the same side. See supra, at 585-586.

members exit. See ante, at 575 ("The purported cure [inthis case] arose not from a change in the parties to the action,

but from a change in the citizenship of a continuing party.").Resisting that far-from-inevitable al ig nment, I would
bracket the multimember enterprise with partially changedmembership together with multiparty litigation from which
some of the originally joined parties drop. I would do soon the ground that in procedural rulings generally, even on
questions of a court's adjudicatory authority in particular,salvage operations are ordinarily preferable to the wrecking ball. C

Petitioner Dataflux sees Caterpillar as a ruling limited toremoval cases, and

Newman-Green as limited to court-ordered dismissals of nondiverse parties. See 312 F. 3d, at

173-174; Brief for Petitioner 23, 26-27; Reply Brief for Peti-tioner 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16. True, the court's attention
may be attracted to the jurisdictional question by a motionto remand a removed case or a motion to drop a party. But,
as the Fifth Circuit observed, "the principle of these casesis [not] limited to only the exact same procedural scenarios."
312 F. 3d, at 173. It would be odd, indeed, to hold, as Da-taflux's argument suggests, that jurisdictional flaws fatal to
original jurisdiction are nonetheless tolerable when removaljurisdiction is exercised. Removal jurisdiction, after all, is
totally dependent on satisfaction of the requirements fororiginal jurisdiction. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a) ("any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts ofthe United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed
by the defendant or the defendants, to [a] district court ofthe United States"). The "considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy" central to the Caterpillar Court'streatment of a failure to satisfy "the [complete-diversity] requirement of the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a)," ante,at 574 (internal quotation marks omitted), have equal force

original), i. e., Atlas' failure initially to satisfy the completediversity requirement of $ 1332(a).

Moreover, by whatever route a case arrives in federal
court, it is the obligation of both district court and counsel
to be alert to jurisdictional requirements. See, e. g., Bender
v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541 (1986)
("every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the
lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties
are prepared to concede it" (quoting Mitchell v. Maurer, 293
U. S. 237, 244 (1934))); United Republic Ins. Co., in Receivership v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 315 F. 3d 168, 170-171 (CA2
2003) ("We have . . . urged counsel and district courts to treat
subject matter jurisdiction as a threshold issue for resolution . . . ."); United States v. Southern California Edison
Co., 300 F. Supp. 2d 964, 972 (ED Cal. 2004) (district courts
have an "independent obligation to address [subject-matter
jurisdiction] sua sponte" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Trawick v. Asbury MS Gray-Daniels, LLC, 244
F. Supp. 2d 697, 699 (SD Miss. 2003) (criticizing counsel for
failing to do the "minimal amount of research" that would
have revealed the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction).
But cf. ante, at 580 (time-of-filing rule should be rigidly applied when "no judicial action . . . was necessary to get the
jurisdictional spoilers out of the case"). That obligation is
equally applicable to cases initially filed in federal court and
cases removed from state court to federal court.

In short, the Fifth Circuit correctly comprehended the essential teaching of Caterpillar and Newman-Green: The generally applicable time-of-filing rule is displaced when (1) a
"jurisdictional requiremen[t] [is] not met, (2) neither the parties nor the judge raise the error until after a jury verdict
has been rendered, or a dispositive ruling [typically, a grant
of summary judgment] has been made by the court, and

U. S., at 75; see Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at 836-837. Seealso Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 191-192, and n. 5 (2000) (not-ing stricter approach to standing than to mootness in view
of "sunk costs" once a "case has been brought and litigated").In

Newman-Green, this Court observed that rigid insistenceon the time-of-filing rule, rather than allowing elimination of

9 According to the majority, it would be "unsound in principle and certain
to be ignored in practice" to decline to apply the time-of-filing rule only
in those cases where the flaw is drawn to a court's attention after a full
adjudication of the case, whether through trial or by a dispositive court
ruling. Ante, at 575-576. Declining to apply the time-of-filing rule only
in those cases, the Court suggests, can be justified only on the theory that
"the party who failed to object before the end of trial [or dispositive court
ruling] forfeited his objection." Ante, at 576 (citing Kontrick v. Ryan,
540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004)). The time-of-filing rule, however, is a courtcreated rule, see supra, at 583; it is therefore incumbent on the Court to
define the contours of that rule's application. The Fifth Circuit's decision
rested not on a forfeiture theory; rather, the decision accurately reflected
the judicial economy underpinnings of the time-of-filing rule. True, as
the Court observes, judicial economy concerns might be pressing even
when a case is not fully adjudicated through trial or summary pretrial
disposition. See ante, at 576-577. When a district court has so fully
adjudicated the case, however, there can be no doubt that the "sunk costs
to the judicial system," Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental
Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 192, n. 5 (2000), have become "overwhelming," Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75 (1996). That the
rule advanced by the Court of Appeals is underinclusive does not make it
"illogic[al]," ante, at 576; instead, the limitation makes the rule readily
manageable. To hold the time-of-filing rule developed by this Court inapplicable here merely abjures mechanical extension of the rule in favor
of responding sensibly to the rule's underlying justifications when those
justifications are indisputably present.

the jurisdictional defect by dropping a dispensable party,
would mean an almost certain replay of the case, with, in all
likelihood, the same ultimate outcome. 490 U. S., at 837.10
Similarly here, given the October 2000 jury verdict of
$750,000 and the unquestioned current existence of complete
diversity, Atlas can be expected "simply [to] refile in the District Court" and rerun the proceedings. See ibid.11 No
legislative prescription, nothing other than this Court's
readiness to cut loose a court-made rule from common sense,
accounts for waste of this large order.

The Court hypothesizes that Atlas and Dataflux will now
settle to avoid fresh litigation costs. Ante, at 581. The majority's forecast, however, ignores the procedural history of

10 In stark contrast to today's decision, see ante, at 580-582, the
Newman-Green Court said: "If the entire suit were dismissed, NewmanGreen would simply refile in the District Court . . . and submit the discovery materials already in hand. . . . Newman-Green should not be compelled
to jump through [such] judicial hoops merely for the sake of hypertechnical
jurisdictional purity." 490 U. S., at 837.

11 The statute of limitations is unlikely to bar the repeat performance

given the representation of counsel for both Atlas and Dataflux that
"a [Texas] savings statute, assuming Texas law applies, . . . would allow
Atlas to refile suit." Tr. of Oral Arg. 22; see id., at 31. See also App. to
Pet. for Cert. 22a (District Court order staying "the statute of limitations
for the claims alleged in this case"); supra, at 586. Although counsel did
not provide a citation to the Texas saving statute, I note a provision of
that State's law, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $ 16.064 (1997), covering cases originally filed in the wrong forum: "The period between the
date of filing an action in a trial court and the date of a second filing of
the same action in a different court suspends the running of the applicable
statute of limitations for the period if" the first action is dismissed for
"lack of jurisdiction." This prescription, described as "remedial in nature," has been "liberally construed." Vale v. Ryan, 809 S. W. 2d 324, 326
(Tex. App. 1991). Counsel for both Atlas and Dataflux also suggested
New York law may apply. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22, 31. New York has a
saving provision that appears to allow refiling just as Texas law would.
See N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law $ 205(a) (West 2003) ("If an action is timely commenced and is terminated," e. g., for lack of jurisdiction, "the plaintiff . . .
may commence a new action . . . within six months . . . .").

this case. Knowing full well the first jury verdict, the parties on two occasions missed clear opportunities to settle:
after the District Court's dismissal and after the Court of
Appeals' reversal. Instead, the parties "waste[d] time and
resources," including 31/2 years on a jurisdictional question.
Ibid. Even with the jurisdictional question resolved in its
favor, Dataflux would now weigh against settlement the possibility that a new panel of jurors, and tactical knowledge
gleaned from the first trial, could yield a different outcome
the second time around. Atlas, too, might decline to settle:
It prevailed once in a jury trial, and committed 61/2 years to
litigation, see ante, at 582, a cost that is rational to ignore,
but, in practice, hard to sideline. In short, settlement,
which depends on the parties' shared estimate of likely litigation outcomes, is hardly guaranteed.

In two respects, there is stronger cause for departure from
the time-of-filing rule in Atlas' case than there was in Caterpillar. See supra, at 587 (discussing Caterpillar). First,
the Caterpillar plaintiff, judgment loser in the federal trial
court, had timely but fruitlessly objected to the defendant's improper removal. 519 U. S., at 74. The plaintiff in
Caterpillar, this Court acknowledged, had done "all that
was required to preserve his objection to removal." Ibid.
Though mindful of the "antecedent statutory violatio[n]," the
Court declined to disturb the District Court's final judgment
on the merits. Id., at 74-75. The defendant in this case,
Dataflux, in seeking to erase the trial and verdict here, resembles the plaintiff in Caterpillar, except that Dataflux
raised its subject-matter jurisdiction objection only after the
parties had become completely diverse. Cf. 312 F. 3d, at
170. It is one thing to preserve jurisdictional objections so
long as the jurisdictional flaw persists, see Kontrick v. Ryan,
540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004); Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch
126 (1804), quite another to tolerate such an objection after
the initial flaw has disappeared from the case.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The Court sustains these outcomes: The Caterpillar plain-tiff, whose prompt resistance to removal would generally

have garnered a remand to the state forum plaintiff had orig-inally selected, is nevertheless bound to an adverse federalcourt judgment; the defendant, Dataflux here, after incor-rectly conceding federal subject-matter jurisdiction in its
answer, see App. 35a, and leaving the record uncorrected
until the jury favored the plaintiff, is allowed to return tosquare one, unburdened by the adverse judgment. There is

no little irony in that juxtaposition, all the more so given theabsence of any charge of manipulation in this case.

Nor would affirmance of the Fifth Circuit judgment entail
a significant risk of manipulation in other cases. Rarely, if
ever, will a plaintiff bring suit in federal district court, invoking diversity jurisdiction under $ 1332(a), with the knowledge
that complete diversity does not exist, but in the hope of
a postfiling jurisdiction-perfecting event. Such a plaintiff 's
anticipation is likely to be thwarted by the court's or the
defendant's swift detection of the jurisdictional impediment.
Furthermore, a plaintiff who ignores threshold jurisdictional
requirements risks sanctions and "the displeasure of a district court whose authority has been improperly invoked."
Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 77-78. The Court's fears about the
"litigation-fostering effect" of exceptions to the time-of-filing
rule, ante, at 581, thus appear more imaginary than real.
No wave of new jurisdictional litigation is likely, as the
federal courts' experience after Caterpillar and NewmanGreen shows.

Also distinguishing the two cases, in Caterpillar, the removing defendant "satisfied with only a day to spare the
statutory requirement that a diversity-based removal take
place within one year of a lawsuit's commencement." 519
U. S., at 65 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(b)). Had that defendant
remained in state court pending the settlement that left only
completely diverse parties in the litigation, the one-year limitation on removal would have barred the way to federal

court. Nothing in the record or briefing here, however, sug-gests that Atlas filed precipitously in federal court in the

hope of outpacing a fast-running limitations period; on thecontrary, Atlas' complaint rested on events that occurred
only ten months prior to the commencement of the action,see App. 18a, 22a-23a, and therefore fell comfortably within
any applicable time bar.12 This case thus presents no riskthat refusal to treat an initial jurisdictional flaw as determinative will de facto extend a limitations period. Cf. 13BWright, Miller, & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure

$ 3608, p. 459.In sum, the Court's judgment effectively returns this case
for relitigation in the very same District Court in which itwas first filed in 1997. Having lost once, Dataflux now gets
an unmerited second chance, never mind "just how muchtime will be lost along the way."

SABRI v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 03-44. Argued March 3, 2004--Decided May 17, 2004
After petitioner Sabri offered three separate bribes to a Minneapolis councilman to facilitate construction in the city, Sabri was charged with violating 18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(2), which proscribes bribery of state and local
officials of entities, such as Minneapolis, that receive at least $10,000 in
federal funds. Before trial, Sabri moved to dismiss the indictment on
the ground that $ 666(a)(2) is unconstitutional on its face for failure to
require proof of a connection between the federal funds and the alleged
bribe, as an element of liability. The District Court agreed, but the
Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the absence of such an express
requirement was not fatal, and that the statute was constitutional under
the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause in serving the objects
of the congressional spending power.

Held: Section 666(a)(2) is a valid exercise of Congress's Article I authority. Pp. 604-610.

(a) Sabri's "facial" challenge that $ 666(a)(2) must, as an element of
the offense, require proof of connection with federal money is readily
rejected. This Court does not presume the unconstitutionality of all
federal criminal statutes from the absence of an explicit jurisdictional
hook, and there is no occasion even to consider the need for such a
requirement where there is no reason to suspect that enforcing a criminal statute would extend beyond a legitimate interest cognizable under
Article I, $ 8. Congress has Spending Clause authority to appropriate
federal moneys to promote the general welfare, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and
corresponding Necessary and Proper Clause authority, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18,
to assure that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in
fact spent for the general welfare, rather than frittered away in graft
or upon projects undermined by graft. See, e. g., McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. Congress does not have to accept the risk of getting poor performance for its money, owing to local and state administrators' improbity. See, e. g., id., at 417. Section 666(a)(2) addresses
the problem at the sources of bribes, by rational means, to safeguard
the integrity of federal dollar recipients. Although not every bribe offered or paid to covered government agents will be traceably skimmed
from specific federal payments, or be found in the guise of a quid pro
quo for some dereliction in spending a federal grant, these facts do not

Syllabus
portend enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the simple
reason that corruption need not be so limited in order to affect that
interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not deliver dollar-fordollar value. It is enough that the statute condition the offense on a
threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, such
as that provided here. The legislative history confirms that $ 666(a)(2)
is an instance of necessary and proper legislation. Neither of Sabri's
arguments against $ 666(a)(2)'s constitutionality helps him. First, his
claim that $ 666 is of a piece with the legislation ruled unconstitutional
in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v. Morrison,
529 U. S. 598, is unavailing because these precedents do not control here.
In them, the Court struck down federal statutes regulating gun possession near schools and gender-motivated violence, respectively, because it
found the effects of those activities on interstate commerce insufficiently
robust. Here, in contrast, Congress was within its prerogative to ensure that the objects of spending are not menaced by local administrators on the take. Cf. Lopez, supra, at 561. Second, contrary to Sabri's
argument, $ 666(a)(2) is not an unduly coercive, and impermissibly
sweeping, condition on the grant of federal funds, but is authority to
bring federal power to bear directly on individuals who convert public
spending into unearned private gain. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S.
203, distinguished. Pp. 604-608.

(b) The Court disapproves Sabri's technique for challenging his indictment by facial attack on the underlying statute. If Sabri was making any substantive constitutional claim, it had to be seen as an overbreadth challenge; the most he could seriously say was that the statute
could not be enforced against him, because it could not be enforced
against someone else whose behavior would be outside the scope of Congress's Article I authority to legislate. Facial challenges of this sort
are to be discouraged because they invite judgments on fact-poor records and entail a departure from the norms of federal-court adjudication
by calling for relaxation of familiar standing requirements to allow a
determination that the law would be unconstitutionally applied to different parties and different circumstances from those at hand. See, e. g.,
Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 55-56, n. 22. Thus, the Court has
recognized the validity of facial attacks alleging overbreadth (though
not necessarily using that term) in relatively few settings, and, generally, only on the strength of a specific reason, such as free speech, that
is weighty enough to overcome the Court's well-founded reticence.
See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601. Pp. 608-610.

land near the site Sabri had in mind, at which Herron wouldthreaten to use the city's eminent domain authority to seize
their property if they were troublesome to Sabri, id., at A-65to A-66. Count 3 alleged that Sabri offered Herron a commission of 10% on some $800,000 in community economicdevelopment grants that Sabri sought from the city, the
MCDA, and other sources. Id., at A-66.The charges were brought under 18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(2),
which imposes federal criminal penalties on anyone who

"corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything ofvalue to any person, with intent to influence or reward

an agent of an organization or of a State, local or Indiantribal government, or any agency thereof, in connection
with any business, transaction, or series of transactionsof such organization, government, or agency involving
anything of value of $5,000 or more."
For criminal liability to lie, the statute requires that

such a standard" because Sabri's alleged actions related tofederal dollars. Id., at A-6. Although Sabri did not contradict this factual claim, the District Court agreed with himthat the law was facially invalid. A divided panel of the
Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that there was nothing fatalin the absence of an express requirement to prove some connection between a given bribe and federally pedigreed dol-lars, and that the statute was constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause in serving the objects of thecongressional spending power. 326 F. 3d 937 (2003). Judge
Bye dissented out of concern about the implications of thelaw for dual sovereignty.

Id., at 953-957.We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 944 (2003), to resolve a

split among the Courts of Appeals over the need to requireconnection between forbidden conduct and federal funds;
compare, e. g., United States v. Grossi, 143 F. 3d 348 (CA71998) (no nexus requirement), and

United States v. Lips-comb, 299 F. 3d 303 (CA5 2002) (same), with United States

v. Zwick, 199 F. 3d 672 (CA3 1999) (nexus requirement), andUnited States v. Santopietro, 166 F. 3d 88 (CA2 1999) (same).
We now affirm. II

Sabri raises what he calls a facial challenge to $ 666(a)(2):the law can never be applied constitutionally because it fails
to require proof of any connection between a bribe or kick-back and some federal money. It is fatal, as he sees it, that
the statute does not make the link an element of the crime,to be charged in the indictment and demonstrated beyond a
reasonable doubt. Thus, Sabri claims his attack meets thedemanding standard set out in United States v. Salerno, 481
U. S. 739, 745 (1987), since he says no prosecution can satisfythe Constitution under this statute, owing to its failure to

Opinion of the Court
require proof that its particular application falls within Con-gress's jurisdiction to legislate. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12

("This statute cannot be properly applied in any case").We can readily dispose of this position that, to qualify as
a valid exercise of Article I power, the statute must requireproof of connection with federal money as an element of the
offense. We simply do not presume the unconstitutionality
of federal criminal statutes lacking explicit provision of ajurisdictional hook, and there is no occasion even to consider

the need for such a requirement where there is no reason tosuspect that enforcement of a criminal statute would extend
beyond a legitimate interest cognizable under Article I, $ 8.

Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and it has corresponding authority under the
Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18, to see to it
that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in
fact spent for the general welfare, and not frittered away in
graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned off
or corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding value
for dollars. See generally McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316 (1819) (establishing review for means-ends rationality under the Necessary and Proper Clause). See also
Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981) (same); Hanna v. Plumer, 380
U. S. 460, 472 (1965) (same). Congress does not have to sit
by and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local and
state improbity. See, e. g., McCulloch, supra, at 417 (power
to " `establish post-offices and post-roads' " entails authority
to "punish those who steal letters"). Section 666(a)(2) addresses the problem at the sources of bribes, by rational
means, to safeguard the integrity of the state, local, and
tribal recipients of federal dollars.

It is true, just as Sabri says, that not every bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments covered by

$ 666(b) will be traceably skimmed from specific federal pay541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ments, or show up in the guise of a quid pro quo for somedereliction in spending a federal grant. Cf.

Salinas v.
United States, 522 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1997) (The "expansive,unqualified" language of the statute "does not support the

interpretation that federal funds must be affected to violate$ 666(a)(1)(B)"). But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the reason that
corruption does not have to be that limited to affect the fed-eral interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contrac-tors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value. Liquidity is not
a financial term for nothing; money can be drained off here
because a federal grant is pouring in there. And officials
are not any the less threatening to the objects behind federal
spending just because they may accept general retainers.
See Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 (1927) (majority opinion by Holmes, J.) (upholding federal law criminalizing fraud on a state bank member of federal system, even
where federal funds not directly implicated). It is certainly
enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold
amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, such
as that provided here.

For those of us who accept help from legislative history,
it is worth noting that the legislative record confirms that

$ 666(a)(2) is an instance of necessary and proper legislation.
The design was generally to "protect the integrity of the
vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs
from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery," see
S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 370 (1983), in contrast to prior federal
law affording only two limited opportunities to prosecute
such threats to the federal interest: 18 U. S. C. $ 641, the federal theft statute, and $ 201, the federal bribery law. Those
laws had proven inadequate to the task. The former went
only to outright theft of unadulterated federal funds, and
prior to this Court's opinion in Dixson v. United States, 465
U. S. 482 (1984), which came after passage of $ 666, the brib541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

607Cite as: 541 U. S. 600 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
ery statute had been interpreted by lower courts to barprosecution of bribes directed at state and local officials.

See, e. g., United States v. Del Toro, 513 F. 2d 656, 661-663(CA2 1975) (overturning federal bribery conviction); see generally Salinas, 522 U. S., at 58-59 (recounting the limitationsof the pre-existing statutory framework). Thus we said that

$ 666 "was designed to extend federal bribery prohibitions to
bribes offered to state and local officials employed by agen-cies receiving federal funds,"

id., at 58, thereby filling the
regulatory gaps. Congress's decision to enact $ 666 onlyafter other legislation had failed to protect federal interests

is further indication that it was acting within the ambit of
the Necessary and Proper Clause.

Petitioner presses two more particular arguments against
the constitutionality of $ 666(a)(2), neither of which helps
him. First, he says that $ 666 is all of a piece with the legislation that a majority of this Court held to exceed Congress's
authority under the Commerce Clause in United States v.
Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison,
529 U. S. 598 (2000). But these precedents do not control
here. In Lopez and Morrison, the Court struck down federal statutes regulating gun possession near schools and
gender-motivated violence, respectively, because it found the
effects of those activities on interstate commerce insufficiently robust. The Court emphasized the noneconomic nature of the regulated conduct, commenting on the law at
issue in Lopez, for example, "that by its terms [it] has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise,
however broadly one might define those terms." 514 U. S.,
at 561. The Court rejected the Government's contentions
that the gun law was valid Commerce Clause legislation because guns near schools ultimately bore on social prosperity and productivity, reasoning that on that logic, Commerce Clause authority would effectively know no limit.
Cf. Morrison, supra, at 615-616 (rejecting comparable congressional justification for Violence Against Women Act of

Opinion of the Court
1994). In order to uphold the legislation, the Court con-cluded, it would be necessary "to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressionalauthority under the Commerce Clause to a general police
power of the sort retained by the States." Lopez, 514U. S., at 567.

No piling is needed here to show that Congress was withinits prerogative to protect spending objects from the menace
of local administrators on the take. The power to keep awatchful eye on expenditures and on the reliability of those
who use public money is bound up with congressional author-ity to spend in the first place, and Sabri would be hard
pressed to claim, in the words of the Lopez Court, that$ 666(a)(2) "has nothing to do with" the congressional spending power. Id., at 561.Sabri next argues that $ 666(a)(2) amounts to an unduly
coercive, and impermissibly sweeping, condition on the grantof federal funds as judged under the criterion applied in
South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987). This is not so.Section 666(a)(2) is authority to bring federal power to bear
directly on individuals who convert public spending into un-earned private gain, not a means for bringing federal economic might to bear on a State's own choices of publicpolicy.*

III
We add an afterword on Sabri's technique for challenginghis indictment by facial attack on the underlying statute, and

begin by recalling that facial challenges are best when infre-quent. See,

e. g., United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22(1960) (laws should not be invalidated by "reference to hypothetical cases"); Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Jack-son Vinegar Co., 226 U. S. 217, 219-220 (1912) (same). Al*In enacting $ 666, Congress addressed a legitimate federal concern by
licensing federal prosecution in an area historically of state concern. In
upholding the constitutionality of the law, we mean to express no view as
to its soundness as a policy matter.

Opinion of the Court
though passing on the validity of a law wholesale may beefficient in the abstract, any gain is often offset by losing the

lessons taught by the particular, to which common lawmethod normally looks. Facial adjudication carries too
much promise of "premature interpretatio[n] of statutes" onthe basis of factually barebones records.

Raines, supra,
at 22.

As exemplified here, facial challenge can carry a furtherrisk that a skeptical approach by district courts may avoid.

Sabri was able to call his challenge a facial one in the strict-est sense of saying that no application of the statute could
be constitutional, only by claiming that proof of the congressional jurisdictional basis must be an element of the statute,
a position that is of course not generally true at all. If that
particular claim had been peeled away, it would have been
obvious that the acts charged against Sabri himself were
well within the limits of legitimate congressional concern.
It would have been correspondingly clear that if Sabri was
making any substantive constitutional claim, it had to be
seen as an overbreadth challenge; the most he could say was
that the statute could not be enforced against him, because
it could not be enforced against someone else whose behavior
would be outside the scope of Congress's Article I authority
to legislate.

Facial challenges of this sort are especially to be discouraged. Not only do they invite judgments on fact-poor records, but they entail a further departure from the norms of
adjudication in federal courts: overbreadth challenges call
for relaxing familiar requirements of standing, to allow a determination that the law would be unconstitutionally applied
to different parties and different circumstances from those
at hand. See, e. g., Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 55-56,
n. 22 (1999) (plurality opinion). Accordingly, we have recognized the validity of facial attacks alleging overbreadth
(though not necessarily using that term) in relatively few
settings, and, generally, on the strength of specific reasons

541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN
610 SABRI v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
weighty enough to overcome our well-founded reticence.See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973) (free

speech); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 (1964)(right to travel); Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 938-946
(2000) (abortion); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 532-535 (1997) (legislation under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). See generally Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Chal-lenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321,
1351 (2000) (emphasizing role of various doctrinal tests indetermining viability of facial attack); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 24 (observing that overbreadthis a function of substantive First Amendment law). Outside
these limited settings, and absent a good reason, we do notextend an invitation to bring overbreadth claims.

We remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is

Affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con-curring in part.

I join all but Part III of the Court's opinion. I do not joinPart III but do make this comment with reference to it.
The Court in Part III does not specifically question the prac-tice we have followed in cases such as

United States v. Lopez,514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.

598 (2000). In those instances the Court did resolve thebasic question whether Congress, in enacting the statutes
challenged there, had exceeded its legislative power underthe Constitution.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

precedent. Cf. Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 154(1971). I continue to doubt that we have correctly interpreted the Commerce Clause. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring);
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584-585 (1995)(

Thomas, J., concurring). But until this Court reconsiders
its precedents, and because neither party requests us to do
so here, our prior case law controls the outcome of this case.I write further because I find questionable the scope the

Court gives to the Necessary and Proper Clause as appliedto Congress' authority to spend. In particular, the Court
appears to hold that the Necessary and Proper Clause authorizes the exercise of any power that is no more than a
"rational means" to effectuate one of Congress' enumerated
powers. Ante, at 605. This conclusion derives from the
Court's characterization of the seminal case McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), as having established a
"means-ends rationality" test, ante, at 605, a characterization
that I am not certain is correct.

In McCulloch, the Court faced the question whether the
United States had the power to incorporate a national bank.
The Court was forced to navigate between the one extreme
of the "absolute necessity" construction advocated by the
State of Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 387 (argument of counsel),
which would "clog and embarrass" the execution of the enumerated powers "by withholding the most appropriate
means" for its execution, id., at 408, and the other extreme,
an interpretation that would destroy the Framers' purpose
of establishing a National Government of limited and enumerated powers, see id., at 423; cf. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 194-195 (1824). The Court, speaking through
Chief Justice Marshall, carefully and effectively refuted
Maryland's proposed "absolute necessity" test. "It must
have been the intention of those who gave these powers, to
insure, as far as human prudence could insure, their beneficial execution," the Court stated; "[t]his could not be done

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
by confiding the choice of means to such narrow limits as notto leave it in the power of Congress to adopt any which might

be appropriate, and which were conducive to the end." Mc-Culloch, 4 Wheat., at 415. The Court opined that it would
render the Constitution "a splendid bauble" if "the right tolegislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must
be involved in the constitution" were not within the powerof Congress.

Id., at 421.But the Court did not then conclude that the Necessary

and Proper Clause gives unrestricted power to the FederalGovernment. See ibid. ("[T]he powers of the government
are limited, and . . . its limits are not to be transcended").Rather, it set forth the following test:

"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope ofthe constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are notprohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional." Ibid.1
"[A]ppropriate" and "plainly adapted" are hardly synony-mous with "means-end rationality." Indeed, "plain" means

"evident to the mind or senses: OBVIOUS," "CLEAR," and"characterized by simplicity: not complicated." Webster's
Ninth New Colleg iate Dictionary 898 (1991); see alsoN. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language
(1828) (facsimile edition) (defining "plainly" as "[i]n a mannerto be easily seen or comprehended," and "[e]vidently; clearly;
not obscurely"). A statute can have a "rational" connectionto an enumerated power without being obviously or clearly
tied to that enumerated power. To show that a statute is

1 We have recently used a very similar formulation in describing the
appropriate test under the Necessary and Proper Clause. In Jinks v.
Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003), we upheld the constitutionality of
28 U. S. C. $ 1367(d) only after carefully concluding that the statute was
both "conducive to" Congress' "power to constitute Tribunals inferior to
the supreme Court," and also "plainly adapted" to that end. 538 U. S., at
462, 464 (internal quotation marks omitted).

613Cite as: 541 U. S. 600 (2004)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
"plainly adapted" to a legitimate end, then, one must seem-ingly show more than that a particular statute is a "rational

means," ante, at 605, to safeguard that end; rather, it wouldseem necessary to show some obvious, simple, and direct relation between the statute and the enumerated power. Cf. 8Writings of James Madison 448 (G. Hunt ed. 1908).

Under the McCulloch formulation, I have doubts that

$ 666(a)(2) is a proper use of the Necessary and ProperClause as applied to Congress' power to spend. Section 666

states that, for any "organization, government, or agency[that] receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of
$10,000 under a Federal program," $ 666(b), any person who

"corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything of
value to any person, with intent to influence or rewardan agent of [such] organization or of [such] State, local

or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof,in connection with any business, transaction, or series
of transactions of such organization, government, oragency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more,"

$ 666(a)(2),
commits a federal crime. All that is necessary for $ 666(a)(2)
to apply is that the organization, government, or agency inquestion receives more than $10,000 in federal benefits of any

kind, and that an agent of the entity is bribed regarding asubstantial transaction of that entity. No connection whatsoever between the corrupt transaction and the federal bene-fits need be shown.

The Court does a not-wholly-unconvincing job of tying thebroad scope of $ 666(a)(2) to a federal interest in federal
funds and programs. See ante, at 605-606. But simply
noting that "[m]oney is fungible," ante, at 606, for instance,
does not explain how there could be any federal interest in
"prosecut[ing] a bribe paid to a city's meat inspector in connection with a substantial transaction just because the city's
parks department had received a federal grant of $10,000,"

614 SABRI v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
United States v. Santopietro, 166 F. 3d 88, 93 (CA2 1999).It would be difficult to describe the chain of inferences and

assumptions in which the Court would have to indulge toconnect such a bribe to a federal interest in any federal funds
or programs as being "plainly adapted" to their protection.And, this is just one example of many in which any federal
interest in protecting federal funds is equally attenuated,and yet the bribe is covered by the expansive language of

$ 666(a)(2). Overall, then, $ 666(a)(2) appears to be no moreplainly adapted to protecting federal funds or federally
funded programs than a hypothetical federal statute crimi-nalizing fraud of any kind perpetrated on any individual who
happens to receive federal welfare benefits.2Because I would decide this case on the Court's Commerce
Clause jurisprudence, I do not ultimately decide whetherCongress' power to spend combined with the Necessary and
Proper Clause could authorize the enactment of $ 666(a)(2).But regardless of the particular outcome of this case under
the correct test, the Court's approach seems to greatly andimproperly expand the reach of Congress' power under the
Necessary and Proper Clause. Accordingly, I concur in thejudgment.

2 Criminalizing the theft (by fraud or otherwise) or embezzlement of
federal funds themselves fits comfortably within Congress' powers. See
United States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879) (embezzlement of a soldier's federal pension).

615OCTOBER TERM, 2003
Syllabus

THORNTON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 03-5165. Argued March 31, 2004--Decided May 24, 2004
Before Officer Nichols could pull over petitioner, petitioner parked and

got out of his car. Nichols then parked, accosted petitioner, and arrested him after finding drugs in his pocket. Incident to the arrest,
Nichols searched petitioner's car and found a handgun under the driver's
seat. Petitioner was charged with federal drug and firearms violations.
In denying his motion to suppress the firearm as the fruit of an unconstitutional search, the District Court found, inter alia, the automobile
search valid under New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, in which this Court
held that, when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an
automobile's occupant, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to
search the vehicle's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of arrest, id., at 460. Petitioner appealed his conviction, arguing
that Belton was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact
with an arrestee while he was still in the car. The Fourth Circuit
affirmed.

Held: Belton governs even when an officer does not make contact until

the person arrested has left the vehicle. In Belton, the Court placed
no reliance on the fact that the officer ordered the occupants out of the
vehicle, or initiated contact with them while they remained within it.
And here, there is simply no basis to conclude that the span of the area
generally within the arrestee's immediate control is determined by
whether the arrestee exited the vehicle at the officer's direction, or
whether the officer initiated contact with him while he was in the car.
In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle
presents identical concerns regarding officer safety and evidence destruction as one who is inside. Under petitioner's proposed "contact
initiation" rule, officers who decide that it may be safer and more effective to conceal their presence until a suspect has left his car would be
unable to search the passenger compartment in the event of a custodial
arrest, potentially compromising their safety and placing incriminating
evidence at risk of concealment or destruction. The Fourth Amendment does not require such a gamble. Belton allows police to search a
car's passenger compartment incident to a lawful arrest of both "occupant[s]" and "recent occupant[s]." Ibid. While an arrestee's status as
a "recent occupant" may turn on his temporal or spatial relationship to

Syllabus
the car at the time of the arrest and search, it certainly does not turn
on whether he was inside or outside the car when the officer first initiated contact with him. Although not all contraband in the passenger
compartment is likely to be accessible to a "recent occupant," the need
for a clear rule, readily understood by police and not depending on differing estimates of what items were or were not within an arrestee's
reach at any particular moment, justifies the sort of generalization
which Belton enunciated. Under petitioner's rule, an officer would
have to determine whether he actually confronted or signaled confrontation with the suspect while he was in his car, or whether the suspect
exited the car unaware of, and for reasons unrelated to, the officer's
presence. Such a rule would be inherently subjective and highly fact
specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad hoc determinations
on the part of officers in the field and reviewing courts that Belton
sought to avoid. Pp. 619-624.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt except as to footnote 4.

In New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), we held thatwhen a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an
occupant of an automobile, the Fourth Amendment allowsthe officer to search the passenger compartment of that
vehicle as a contemporaneous incident of arrest. We havegranted certiorari twice before to determine whether

Belton's rule is limited to situations where the officer makescontact with the occupant while the occupant is inside the

vehicle, or whether it applies as well when the officer first
makes contact with the arrestee after the latter has steppedout of his vehicle. We did not reach the merits in either

of those two cases. Arizona v. Gant, 540 U. S. 963 (2003)(vacating and remanding for reconsideration in light of

State
v. Dean, 206 Ariz. 158, 76 P. 3d 429 (2003) (en banc)); Floridav.

Nichols suspected that petitioner knew he was a police officer and for some reason did not want to pull next to him.

and petitioner passed him. After petitioner passed him,Nichols ran a check on petitioner's license tags, which revealed that the tags had been issued to a 1982 Chevy two-door and not to a Lincoln Town Car, the model of car petitioner was driving. Before Nichols had an opportunity topull him over, petitioner drove into a parking lot, parked,
and got out of the vehicle. Nichols saw petitioner leave his
vehicle as he pulled in behind him. He parked the patrolcar, accosted petitioner, and asked him for his driver's license. He also told him that his license tags did not matchthe vehicle that he was driving.

Petitioner appeared nervous. He began rambling and
licking his lips; he was sweating. Concerned for his safety,
Nichols asked petitioner if he had any narcotics or weapons
on him or in his vehicle. Petitioner said no. Nichols then
asked petitioner if he could pat him down, to which petitioner agreed. Nichols felt a bulge in petitioner's left front
pocket and again asked him if he had any illegal narcotics on
him. This time petitioner stated that he did, and he reached
into his pocket and pulled out two individual bags, one containing three bags of marijuana and the other containing a
large amount of crack cocaine. Nichols handcuffed petitioner, informed him that he was under arrest, and placed
him in the back seat of the patrol car. He then searched
petitioner's vehicle and found a BryCo 9-millimeter handgun
under the driver's seat.

A grand jury charged petitioner with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U. S. C.

$ 841(a)(1), possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking
crime, $ 924(c)(1). Petitioner sought to suppress, inter alia,
the firearm as the fruit of an unconstitutional search. After
a hearing, the District Court denied petitioner's motion to
suppress, holding that the automobile search was valid under

Opinion of the Court
New York v. Belton, supra, and alternatively that Nicholscould have conducted an inventory search of the automobile.

A jury convicted petitioner on all three counts; he was sen-tenced to 180 months' imprisonment and 8 years of supervised release.Petitioner appealed, challenging only the District Court's
denial of the suppression motion. He argued that Beltonwas limited to situations where the officer initiated contact
with an arrestee while he was still an occupant of the car.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed. 325 F. 3d 189 (2003). It held that "the historicalrationales for the search incident to arrest doctrine--`the
need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody'and `the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial,' "
id., at 195 (quoting Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 116(1998)), did not require

Belton to be limited solely to situa-tions in which suspects were still in their vehicles when approached by the police. Noting that petitioner concededthat he was in "close proximity, both temporally and spatially," to his vehicle, the court concluded that the car waswithin petitioner's immediate control, and thus Nichols'
search was reasonable under Belton.1 325 F. 3d, at 196.We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 980 (2003), and now affirm.

In Belton, an officer overtook a speeding vehicle on theNew York Thruway and ordered its driver to pull over. 453
U. S., at 455. Suspecting that the occupants possessed mari-juana, the officer directed them to get out of the car and
arrested them for unlawful possession. Id., at 454-455. Hesearched them and then searched the passenger compartment of the car. Id., at 455. We considered the constitu-tionally permissible scope of a search in these circumstances
and sought to lay down a workable rule governing thatsituation.

holding that Nichols could have conducted a lawful inventory search. 325

620 THORNTON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
We first referred to Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752
(1969), a case where the arrestee was arrested in his home,
and we had described the scope of a search incident to a
lawful arrest as the person of the arrestee and the area immediately surrounding him. 453 U. S., at 457 (citing Chimel,
supra, at 763). This rule was justified by the need to remove any weapon the arrestee might seek to use to resist
arrest or to escape, and the need to prevent the concealment
or destruction of evidence. 453 U. S., at 457. Although easily stated, the Chimel principle had proved difficult to apply
in specific cases. We pointed out that in United States v.
Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), a case dealing with the scope
of the search of the arrestee's person, we had rejected a suggestion that " `there must be litigated in each case the issue
of whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority' " to conduct such a search. 453 U. S.,
at 459 (quoting Robinson, supra, at 235). Similarly, because
"courts ha[d] found no workable definition of `the area within
the immediate control of the arrestee' when that area arguably include[d] the interior of an automobile and the arrestee
[wa]s its recent occupant," 453 U. S., at 460, we sought to set
forth a clear rule for police officers and citizens alike. We
therefore held that "when a policeman has made a lawful
custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as
a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile." Ibid. (footnote
omitted).

In so holding, we placed no reliance on the fact that the
officer in Belton ordered the occupants out of the vehicle, or
initiated contact with them while they remained within it.
Nor do we find such a factor persuasive in distinguishing the
current situation, as it bears no logical relationship to Belton's rationale. There is simply no basis to conclude that
the span of the area generally within the arrestee's immediate control is determined by whether the arrestee exited the

541US2 Unit: $U51 [05-10-06 14:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

621Cite as: 541 U. S. 615 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
vehicle at the officer's direction, or whether the officer initiated contact with him while he remained in the car. We
recognized as much, albeit in dicta, in Michigan v. Long, 463
U. S. 1032 (1983), where officers observed a speeding car
swerve into a ditch. The driver exited and the officers met
him at the rear of his car. Although there was no indication
that the officers initiated contact with the driver while he
was still in the vehicle, we observed that "[i]t is clear . . .
that if the officers had arrested [respondent] . . . they could
have searched the passenger compartment under New York
v. Belton." Id., at 1035-1036, and n. 1.

In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next
to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer
safety and the destruction of evidence as the arrest of one
who is inside the vehicle. An officer may search a suspect's
vehicle under Belton only if the suspect is arrested. See
Knowles, supra, at 117-118. A custodial arrest is fluid and
"[t]he danger to the police officer flows from the fact of the
arrest, and its attendant proximity, stress, and uncertainty,"
Robinson, supra, at 234-235, and n. 5 (emphasis added).
See Washington v. Chrisman, 455 U. S. 1, 7 (1982) ("Every
arrest must be presumed to present a risk of danger to the
arresting officer"). The stress is no less merely because the
arrestee exited his car before the officer initiated contact,
nor is an arrestee less likely to attempt to lunge for a weapon
or to destroy evidence if he is outside of, but still in control
of, the vehicle. In either case, the officer faces a highly volatile situation. It would make little sense to apply two different rules to what is, at bottom, the same situation.

In some circumstances it may be safer and more effective
for officers to conceal their presence from a suspect until he
has left his vehicle. Certainly that is a judgment officers
should be free to make. But under the strictures of petitioner's proposed "contact initiation" rule, officers who do so
would be unable to search the car's passenger compartment

622 THORNTON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
in the event of a custodial arrest, potentially compromising
their safety and placing incriminating evidence at risk of concealment or destruction. The Fourth Amendment does not
require such a gamble.

Petitioner argues, however, that Belton will fail to provide
a "bright-line" rule if it applies to more than vehicle "occupants." Brief for Petitioner 29-34. But Belton allows police to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a lawful custodial arrest of both "occupant[s]" and
"recent occupant[s]." 453 U. S., at 460. Indeed, the respondent in Belton was not inside the car at the time of the
arrest and search; he was standing on the highway. In any
event, while an arrestee's status as a "recent occupant" may
turn on his temporal or spatial relationship to the car at the
time of the arrest and search,2 it certainly does not turn on
whether he was inside or outside the car at the moment that
the officer first initiated contact with him.

To be sure, not all contraband in the passenger compartment is likely to be readily accessible to a "recent occupant."
It is unlikely in this case that petitioner could have reached
under the driver's seat for his gun once he was outside of his
automobile. But the firearm and the passenger compartment in general were no more inaccessible than were the
contraband and the passenger compartment in Belton. The

2 Petitioner argues that if we reject his proposed "contact initiation"
rule, we should limit the scope of Belton to "recent occupant[s]" who are
within "reaching distance" of the car. Brief for Petitioner 35-36. We
decline to address petitioner's argument, however, as it is outside the
question on which we granted certiorari, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a), and
was not addressed by the Court of Appeals, see Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U. S. 80, 86 (1988). We note that it is unlikely that
petitioner would even meet his own standard as he apparently conceded
in the Court of Appeals that he was in "close proximity, both temporally
and spatially," to his vehicle when he was approached by Nichols. 325
F. 3d 189, 196 (CA4 2003).

Opinion of the Court
need for a clear rule, readily understood by police officers
and not depending on differing estimates of what items were
or were not within reach of an arrestee at any particular
moment, justifies the sort of generalization which Belton
enunciated.3 Once an officer determines that there is probable cause to make an arrest, it is reasonable to allow officers
to ensure their safety and to preserve evidence by searching
the entire passenger compartment.

Rather than clarifying the constitutional limits of a Belton
search, petitioner's "contact initiation" rule would obfuscate
them. Under petitioner's proposed rule, an officer approaching a suspect who has just alighted from his vehicle
would have to determine whether he actually confronted or
signaled confrontation with the suspect while he remained
in the car, or whether the suspect exited his vehicle unaware
of, and for reasons unrelated to, the officer's presence. This
determination would be inherently subjective and highly fact
specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad hoc determinations on the part of officers in the field and reviewing
courts that Belton sought to avoid. Id., at 459-460. Experience has shown that such a rule is impracticable, and we
refuse to adopt it. So long as an arrestee is the sort of "re3 Justice Stevens contends that Belton's bright-line rule "is not
needed for cases in which the arrestee is first accosted when he is a pedestrian, because Chimel [v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969),] itself provides
all the guidance that is necessary." Post, at 636 (dissenting opinion).
Under Justice Stevens' approach, however, even if the car itself was
within the arrestee's reaching distance under Chimel, police officers and
courts would still have to determine whether a particular object within
the passenger compartment was also within an arrestee's reaching distance under Chimel. This is exactly the type of unworkable and factspecific inquiry that Belton rejected by holding that the entire passenger
compartment may be searched when " `the area within the immediate control of the arrestee' . . . arguably includes the interior of an automobile
and the arrestee is its recent occupant." 453 U. S., at 460.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in part.
I join all but footnote 4 of the Court's opinion. Althoughthe opinion is a logical extension of the holding of New York

v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), I write separately to expressmy dissatisfaction with the state of the law in this area. As
Justice Scalia forcefully argues, post, at 627-629 (opinionconcurring in judgment), lower court decisions seem now to
treat the ability to search a vehicle incident to the arrest ofa recent occupant as a police entitlement rather than as an
exception justified by the twin rationales of Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969). That erosion is a direct conse-quence of Belton's shaky foundation. While the approach

4 Whatever the merits of Justice Scalia's opinion concurring in the
judgment, this is the wrong case in which to address them. Petitioner
has never argued that Belton should be limited "to cases where it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found
in the vehicle," post, at 632, nor did any court below consider Justice
Scalia's reasoning. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey,
524 U. S. 206, 212-213 (1998) (" `Where issues are neither raised before nor
considered by the Court of Appeals, this Court will not ordinarily consider
them' " (quoting Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2
(1970))). The question presented--"[w]hether the bright-line rule announced in New York v. Belton is confined to situations in which the police
initiate contact with the occupant of a vehicle while that person is in the
vehicle," Pet. for Cert.--does not fairly encompass Justice Scalia's analysis. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a) ("Only the questions set out in the
petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court").
And the United States has never had an opportunity to respond to such
an approach. See Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 536 (1992). Under
these circumstances, it would be imprudent to overrule, for all intents and
purposes, our established constitutional precedent, which governs police
authority in a common occurrence such as automobile searches pursuant
to arrest, and we decline to do so at this time.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Scalia proposes appears to be built on firmerground, I am reluctant to adopt it in the context of a case in

which neither the Government nor the petitioner has had achance to speak to its merit.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring in the judgment.
In Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, 762-763 (1969), weheld that a search incident to arrest was justified only as a
means to find weapons the arrestee might use or evidencehe might conceal or destroy. We accordingly limited such
searches to the area within the suspect's " `immediate con-trol' "--i. e., "the area into which an arrestee might reach in
order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m]." Id., at 763.In New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460 (1981), we set forth
a bright-line rule for arrests of automobile occupants, holdingthat, because the vehicle's entire passenger compartment is
"in fact generally, even if not inevitably," within the arrest-ee's immediate control, a search of the whole compartment
is justified in every case.When petitioner's car was searched in this case, he was
neither in, nor anywhere near, the passenger compartmentof his vehicle. Rather, he was handcuffed and secured in
the back of the officer's squad car. The risk that he wouldnevertheless "grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m]" from his
car was remote in the extreme. The Court's effort to applyour current doctrine to this search stretches it beyond
its breaking point, and for that reason I cannot join theCourt's opinion.

I
I see three reasons why the search in this case might havebeen justified to protect officer safety or prevent concealment or destruction of evidence. None ultimately per-suades me.

The first is that, despite being handcuffed and secured inthe back of a squad car, petitioner might have escaped and

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
retrieved a weapon or evidence from his vehicle--a theorythat calls to mind Judge Goldberg's reference to the mythical

arrestee "possessed of the skill of Houdini and the strengthof Hercules."

United States v. Frick, 490 F. 2d 666, 673
(CA5 1973) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting inpart). The United States, endeavoring to ground this seemingly speculative fear in reality, points to a total of seven
instances over the past 13 years in which state or federalofficers were attacked with weapons by handcuffed or formerly handcuffed arrestees. Brief for United States 38-39,and n. 12. These instances do not, however, justify the
search authority claimed. Three involved arrestees whoretrieved weapons concealed

on their own person. See
United States v. Sanders, 994 F. 2d 200, 210, n. 60 (CA5 1993)(two instances); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports: Law Enforcement Of-ficers Killed and Assaulted 49 (2001). Three more involved
arrestees who seized a weapon from the arresting officer.See

Sanders, supra, at 210, n. 60 (two instances); U. S. Dept.
of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime
Reports: Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted 49(1998). Authority to search the arrestee's own person is beyond question; and of course no search could prevent seizure
of the officer's gun. Only one of the seven instances involved a handcuffed arrestee who escaped from a squad car
to retrieve a weapon from somewhere else: In Plakas v.
Drinski, 19 F. 3d 1143, 1144-1146 (CA7 1994), the suspect
jumped out of the squad car and ran through a forest to a
house, where (still in handcuffs) he struck an officer on the
wrist with a fireplace poker before ultimately being shot
dead.

Of course, the Government need not document specific instances in order to justify measures that avoid obvious risks.
But the risk here is far from obvious, and in a context as
frequently recurring as roadside arrests, the Government's
inability to come up with even a single example of a handcuffed arrestee's retrieval of arms or evidence from his vehi541US2 Unit: $U51 [05-10-06 14:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

627Cite as: 541 U. S. 615 (2004)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
cle undermines its claims. The risk that a suspect hand-cuffed in the back of a squad car might escape and recover a

weapon from his vehicle is surely no greater than the riskthat a suspect handcuffed in his residence might escape and
recover a weapon from the next room--a danger we heldinsufficient to justify a search in

Chimel, supra, at 763.
The second defense of the search in this case is that, since
the officer could have conducted the search at the time ofarrest (when the suspect was still near the car), he should

not be penalized for having taken the sensible precaution ofsecuring the suspect in the squad car first. As one Court of
Appeals put it: " `[I]t does not make sense to prescribe aconstitutional test that is entirely at odds with safe and sensible police procedures.' " United States v. Mitchell, 82F. 3d 146, 152 (CA7 1996) (quoting

United States v. Karlin,
852 F. 2d 968, 971 (CA7 1988)); see also United States v. Wesley, 293 F. 3d 541, 548-549 (CADC 2002). The weakness of
this argument is that it assumes that, one way or another,the search must take place. But conducting a

Chimel search
is not the Government's right; it is an exception--justified by
necessity--to a rule that would otherwise render the searchunlawful. If "sensible police procedures" require that suspects be handcuffed and put in squad cars, then police should
handcuff suspects, put them in squad cars, and not conduct
the search. Indeed, if an officer leaves a suspect unrestrained nearby just to manufacture authority to search, one
could argue that the search is unreasonable precisely because
the dangerous conditions justifying it existed only by virtue
of the officer's failure to follow sensible procedures.

The third defense of the search is that, even though the
arrestee posed no risk here, Belton searches in general are
reasonable, and the benefits of a bright-line rule justify upholding that small minority of searches that, on their particular facts, are not reasonable. The validity of this argument
rests on the accuracy of Belton's claim that the passenger
compartment is "in fact generally, even if not inevitably,"
within the suspect's immediate control. 453 U. S., at 460.

541US2 Unit: $U51 [05-10-06 14:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
628 THORNTON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
By the United States' own admission, however, "[t]he prac-tice of restraining an arrestee on the scene before searching

a car that he just occupied is so prevalent that holding that
Belton does not apply in that setting would . . . `largely render Belton a dead letter.' " Brief for United States 36-37(quoting

Wesley, supra, at 548). Reported cases involving
this precise factual scenario--a motorist handcuffed and secured in the back of a squad car when the search takesplace--are legion. See,

e. g., United States v. Doward, 41
F. 3d 789, 791 (CA1 1994); United States v. White, 871 F. 2d41, 44 (CA6 1989);

Mitchell, supra, at 152; United States v.
Snook, 88 F. 3d 605, 606 (CA8 1996); United States v. McLaughlin, 170 F. 3d 889, 890 (CA9 1999); United States v.
Humphrey, 208 F. 3d 1190, 1202 (CA10 2000); Wesley, supra,
at 544; see also 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 7.1(c),
pp. 448-449, n. 79 (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2004) (citing cases).
Some courts uphold such searches even when the squad car
carrying the handcuffed arrestee has already left the scene.
See, e. g., McLaughlin, supra, at 890-891 (upholding search
because only five minutes had elapsed since squad car left).

The popularity of the practice is not hard to fathom. If
Belton entitles an officer to search a vehicle upon arresting
the driver despite having taken measures that eliminate any
danger, what rational officer would not take those measures?
Cf. Moskovitz, A Rule in Search of a Reason: An Empirical
Reexamination of Chimel and Belton, 2002 Wis. L. Rev. 657,
665-666 (citing police training materials). If it was ever
true that the passenger compartment is "in fact generally,
even if not inevitably," within the arrestee's immediate control at the time of the search, 453 U. S., at 460, it certainly
is not true today. As one judge has put it: "[I]n our search
for clarity, we have now abandoned our constitutional moorings and floated to a place where the law approves of purely
exploratory searches of vehicles during which officers with
no definite objective or reason for the search are allowed
to rummage around in a car to see what they might find."

McLaughlin, supra, at 894 (Trott, J., concurring). I agreeentirely with that assessment.

II
If Belton searches are justifiable, it is not because the ar-restee might grab a weapon or evidentiary item from his car,

but simply because the car might contain evidence relevantto the crime for which he was arrested. This more general
sort of evidence-gathering search is not without antecedent.For example, in

United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56(1950), we upheld a search of the suspect's place of business

after he was arrested there. We did not restrict the officers'search authority to "the area into which [the] arrestee might
reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m]," Chi-mel, 395 U. S., at 763, and we did not justify the search as a
means to prevent concealment or destruction of evidence.1Rather, we relied on a more general interest in gathering
evidence relevant to the crime for which the suspect hadbeen arrested. See 339 U. S., at 60-64; see also

Harris v.United States, 331 U. S. 145, 151-152 (1947); Marron v.

United States, 275 U. S. 192, 199 (1927); Agnello v. UnitedStates, 269 U. S. 20, 30 (1925); cf. Weeks v. United States, 232
U. S. 383, 392 (1914).Numerous earlier authorities support this approach, referring to the general interest in gathering evidence related tothe crime of arrest with no mention of the more specific interest in preventing its concealment or destruction. SeeUnited States v. Wilson, 163 F. 338, 340, 343 (CC SDNY

& P. 600, 601 (1829) (same). Bishop's 1872 articulation istypical:

"The officer who arrests a man on a criminal charge
should consider the nature of the charge; and, if he findsabout the prisoner's person, or otherwise in his possession, either goods or moneys which there is reason to
believe are connected with the supposed crime as itsfruits, or as the instruments with which it was committed, or as directly furnishing evidence relating to thetransaction, he may take the same, and hold them to be
disposed of as the court may direct." Bishop, supra,$ 211, at 127.

Only in the years leading up to Chimel did we start consistently referring to the narrower interest in frustrating concealment or destruction of evidence. See Sibron v. New
York, 392 U. S. 40, 67 (1968); Preston v. United States, 376
U. S. 364, 367 (1964).There is nothing irrational about broader police authority

to search for evidence when and where the perpetrator of acrime is lawfully arrested. The fact of prior lawful arrest
distinguishes the arrestee from society at large, and distin-guishes a search for evidence of

his crime from general rummaging. Moreover, it is not illogical to assume that evidence of a crime is most likely to be found where the suspect
was apprehended.

Nevertheless, Chimel's narrower focus on concealment or
destruction of evidence also has historical support. See
Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527, 539-540, 42 S. W. 1090,

S. Welch, Essay on the Office of Constable 17 (1758).2 Andsome of the authorities supporting the broader rule address
only searches of the arrestee's person, as to which Chimel'slimitation might fairly be implicit. Moreover, carried to its
logical end, the broader rule is hard to reconcile with theinfluential case of

Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029,1031, 1063-1074 (C. P. 1765) (disapproving search of plaintiff 's

private papers under general warrant, despite arrest). Butcf. Dillon, supra, at 250-251 (distinguishing Entick); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 303-304(1967).

In short, both Rabinowitz and Chimel are plausible ac-counts of what the Constitution requires, and neither is so
persuasive as to justify departing from settled law. But ifwe are going to continue to allow Belton searches on stare
decisis grounds, we should at least be honest about why weare doing so.

Belton cannot reasonably be explained as amere application of Chimel. Rather, it is a return to the

broader sort of search incident to arrest that we allowed be-fore Chimel--limited, of course, to searches of motor vehicles, a category of "effects" which give rise to a reduced ex-pectation of privacy, see Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S.
295, 303 (1999), and heightened law enforcement needs,see id., at 304; Rabinowitz, supra, at 73 (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting).Recasting Belton in these terms would have at least one
important practical consequence. In United States v. Rob-inson, 414 U. S. 218, 235 (1973), we held that authority to
search an arrestee's person does not depend on the actual

presence of one of Chimel's two rationales in the particularcase; rather, the fact of arrest alone justifies the search.

That holding stands in contrast to Rabinowitz, where we didnot treat the fact of arrest alone as sufficient, but upheld the
search only after noting that it was "not general or explor-atory for whatever might be turned up" but reflected a reasonable belief that evidence would be found. 339 U. S., at62-63; see also

Smith, 47 Misc., at 24, 93 N. Y. S., at 203("This right and duty of search and seizure extend, however,

only to articles which furnish evidence against the accused");cf. Barnett, supra, at 601 (seizure authority limited to relevant evidence); Bishop, supra, $ 211, at 127 (officer should"consider the nature of the charge" before searching). The
two different rules make sense: When officer safety or immi-nent evidence concealment or destruction is at issue, officers
should not have to make fine judgments in the heat of themoment. But in the context of a general evidence-gathering
search, the state interests that might justify any over-breadth are far less compelling. A motorist may be arrested for a wide variety of offenses; in many cases, there isno reasonable basis to believe relevant evidence might be
found in the car. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318,323-324 (2001); cf.

Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 118 (1998).I would therefore limit Belton searches to cases where it is

reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrestmight be found in the vehicle.

In this case, as in Belton, petitioner was lawfully arrestedfor a drug offense. It was reasonable for Officer Nichols to
believe that further contraband or similar evidence relevantto the crime for which he had been arrested might be found
in the vehicle from which he had just alighted and which wasstill within his vicinity at the time of arrest. I would affirm
the decision below on that ground.3

Rule, however, does not constrain our authority to reach issues presented

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

Prior to our decision in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454(1981), there was a widespread conflict among both federal
and state courts over the question "whether, in the course ofa search incident to the lawful custodial arrest of the occupants of an automobile, police may search inside the automo-bile after the arrestees are no longer in it." Id., at 459. In
answering that question, the Court expanded the authorityof the police in two important respects. It allowed the police to conduct a broader search than our decision in Chimelv.

California, 395 U. S. 752, 762-763 (1969), would have per-mitted,

1 and it authorized them to open closed containers

that might be found in the vehicle's passenger compartment.2

by the case, see Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 259, n. 5 (1980); Tennessee
Student Assistance Corporation v. Hood, ante, at 443, and in any event
does not apply when the issue is necessary to an intelligent resolution of
the question presented, see Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996).

1 The Court gleaned from the case law "the generalization that articles

inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an
automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within `the area
into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].' " Belton, 453 U. S., at 460 (quoting Chimel, 395 U. S., at 763).
"In order to establish the workable rule this category of cases require[d],"
the Court then read "Chimel's definition of the limits of the area that
may be searched in light of that generalization." 453 U. S., at 460. Thus,
Belton held "that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of
the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of
that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile." Ibid.
(footnote omitted).

2 Because police lawfully may search the passenger compartment of the

automobile, the Court reasoned, it followed "that the police may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so
also will containers in it be within his reach. . . . Such a container may, of
course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for
the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container,
but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have." Id., at 460-461 (footnote omitted).

634 THORNTON v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
Belton's basic rationale for both expansions rested not ona concern for officer safety, but rather on an overriding desire to hew "to a straightforward rule, easily applied, andpredictably enforced." 453 U. S., at 459.

3 When the case

was decided, I was persuaded that the important interest inclarity and certainty adequately justified the modest extension of the Chimel rule to permit an officer to examine theinterior of a car pursuant to an arrest for a traffic violation.
But I took a different view with respect to the search ofcontainers within the car absent probable cause, because I
thought "it palpably unreasonable to require the driver ofa car to open his briefcase or his luggage for inspection by
the officer." Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 451-452(1981) (dissenting opinion).

4 I remain convinced that this

aspect of the Belton opinion was both unnecessary and erro-neous. Whether one agrees or disagrees with that view,

however, the interest in certainty that supports Belton'sbright-line rule surely does not justify an expansion of the
rule that only blurs those clear lines. Neither the rule inChimel nor Belton's modification of that rule would have allowed the search of petitioner's car.A fair reading of the Belton opinion itself, and of the conflicting cases that gave rise to our grant of certiorari, makes

3 The Court extolled the virtues of " `[a] single, familiar standard . . . to
guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect
on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific
circumstances they confront.' " Id., at 458 (quoting Dunaway v. New
York, 442 U. S. 200, 213-214 (1979)).

4 In Robbins, a companion case to Belton, the Court held that police

officers cannot open closed, opaque containers found in the trunk of a car
during a lawful but warrantless search. 453 U. S., at 428 (plurality opinion). Because the officer in Robbins had probable cause to believe the car
contained marijuana, I would have applied the automobile exception to
sustain the search. Id., at 452 (dissenting opinion). But I expressed concern that authorizing police officers to search containers in the passenger
compartment without probable cause would "provide the constitutional
predicate for broader vehicle searches than any neutral magistrate could
authorize by issuing a warrant." Ibid.

clear that we were not concerned with the situation pre-sented in this case. The Court in Belton noted that the

lower courts had discovered Chimel's reaching-distance prin-ciple difficult to apply in the context of automobile searches
incident to arrest, and that "no straightforward rule ha[d]emerged from the litigated cases." 453 U. S., at 458-459.
None of the cases cited by the Court to demonstrate thedisarray in the lower courts involved a pedestrian who was
in the vicinity, but outside the reaching distance, of his orher car.

5 Nor did any of the decisions cited in the petition

for a writ of certiorari 6 present such a case.7 Thus, Beltonwas demonstrably concerned only with the narrow but common circumstance of a search occasioned by the arrest of asuspect who was seated in or driving an automobile at the
time the law enforcement official approached. Normally,after such an arrest has occurred, the officer's safety is no

Stevens, J., dissenting
longer in jeopardy, but he must decide what, if any, search forincriminating evidence he should conduct.

Belton provided
previously unavailable and therefore necessary guidance forthat category of cases.

The bright-line rule crafted in Belton is not needed forcases in which the arrestee is first accosted when he is a
pedestrian, because Chimel itself provides all the guidance
that is necessary. The only genuine justification for extend-ing

Belton to cover such circumstances is the interest in uncovering potentially valuable evidence. In my opinion, thatgoal must give way to the citizen's constitutionally protected

interest in privacy when there is already in place a welldefined rule limiting the permissible scope of a search of an
arrested pedestrian. The Chimel rule should provide the
same protection to a "recent occupant" of a vehicle as to a
recent occupant of a house.

Unwilling to confine the Belton rule to the narrow class of
cases it was designed to address, the Court extends Belton's
reach without supplying any guidance for the future application of its swollen rule. We are told that officers may search
a vehicle incident to arrest "[s]o long as [the] arrestee is the
sort of `recent occupant' of a vehicle such as petitioner was
here." Ante, at 623-624. But we are not told how recent
is recent, or how close is close, perhaps because in this case
"the record is not clear." 325 F. 3d 189, 196 (CA4 2003). As
the Court cautioned in Belton itself, "[w]hen a person cannot
know how a court will apply a settled principle to a recurring
factual situation, that person cannot know the scope of his
constitutional protection, nor can a policeman know the scope
of his authority." 453 U. S., at 459-460. Without some limiting principle, I fear that today's decision will contribute to
"a massive broadening of the automobile exception," Robbins, 453 U. S., at 452 (Stevens, J., dissenting), when officers
have probable cause to arrest an individual but not to
search his car.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

NELSON v. CAMPBELL, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMADEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 03-6821. Argued March 29, 2004--Decided May 24, 2004
Three days before his scheduled execution by lethal injection, petitioner

filed a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action against respondent Alabama prison officials, alleging that the use of a "cut-down" procedure requiring an incision into his arm or leg to access his severely compromised veins constituted cruel and unusual punishment and deliberate indifference to his
medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Petitioner, who
had already filed an unsuccessful federal habeas application, sought a
permanent injunction against the cut-down's use, a temporary stay of
execution so the District Court could consider his claim's merits, and
orders requiring respondents to furnish a copy of the protocol on the
medical procedures for venous access and directing them to promulgate
a venous access protocol that comports with contemporary standards.
Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction on
the grounds that the $ 1983 claim and stay request were the equivalent
of a second or successive habeas application subject to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)'s gatekeeping requirements. Agreeing, the District Court dismissed the complaint because petitioner had not obtained authorization
to file such an application. In affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that
method-of-execution challenges necessarily sound in habeas, and that it
would have denied a habeas authorization request.

Held: Section 1983 is an appropriate vehicle for petitioner's Eighth

Amendment claim seeking a temporary stay and permanent injunctive
relief. Pp. 643-651.

(a) Section 1983 must yield to the federal habeas statute where an
inmate seeks injunctive relief challenging the fact of his conviction or
the duration of his sentence. Such claims fall within the core of habeas.
By contrast, constitutional claims challenging confinement conditions
fall outside of that core and may be brought under $ 1983 in the first
instance. The Court need not reach here the difficult question of how
method-of-execution claims should be classified generally. Respondents
have conceded that $ 1983 would be the appropriate vehicle for an inmate who is not facing execution to bring a "deliberate indifference"
challenge to the cut-down procedure's constitutionality if used to gain
venous access for medical treatment. There is no reason on the com541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
638 NELSON v. CAMPBELL

Syllabus
plaint's face to treat petitioner's claim differently solely because he has
been condemned to die. Respondents claim that because the cut-down
is part of the execution procedure, petitioner is actually challenging the
fact of his execution. However, that venous access is a necessary prerequisite to execution does not imply that a particular means of gaining
such access is likewise necessary. Petitioner has argued throughout the
proceedings that the cut-down and the warden's refusal to provide reliable information on the cut-down protocol are wholly unnecessary to
gaining venous access. If, after an evidentiary hearing, the District
Court finds the cut-down necessary, it will need to address the broader
method-of-execution question left open here. The instant holding is
consistent with this Court's approach to civil rights damages actions,
which also fall at the margins of habeas. Pp. 643-647.

(b) If a permanent injunction request does not sound in habeas, it
follows that the lesser included request for a temporary stay (or preliminary injunction) does not either. Here, a fair reading of the complaint
leaves no doubt that petitioner sought to enjoin the cut-down, not his
execution by lethal injection. However, his stay request asked to stay
his execution, seemingly without regard to whether the State did or did
not resort to the cut-down. The execution warrant has now expired.
If the State reschedules the execution while this case is pending on
remand and petitioner seeks another similarly broad stay, the District
Court will need to address the question whether a request to enjoin
the execution, rather than merely to enjoin an allegedly unnecessary
precursor medical procedure, properly sounds in habeas. Pp. 647-648.

(c) Respondents are incorrect that a reversal here would open the
floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges and lastminute stay requests. Because this Court does not here resolve the
question of how to treat method-of-execution claims generally, the instant holding is extremely limited. Moreover, merely stating a cognizable $ 1983 claim does not warrant a stay as a matter of right. A court
may consider a stay application's last-minute nature in deciding whether
to grant such equitable relief. And the ability to bring a $ 1983 claim
does not free inmates from the substantive or procedural limitations of
the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Pp. 649-651.

640 NELSON v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court
of the Eleventh Circuit, and remand the case for further pro-ceedings consistent with this opinion.

I
Because the District Court dismissed the suit at the plead-ing stage, we assume the allegations in petitioner's complaint

to be true. Petitioner was found guilty by a jury in 1979of capital murder and sentenced to death. Following two
resentencings, the Eleventh Circuit, on June 3, 2002, affirmedthe District Court's denial of petitioner's first federal habeas
petition challenging the most recent death sentence. Nelson v. Alabama, 292 F. 3d 1291. Up until and at the timeof that disposition, Alabama employed electrocution as its

sole method of execution. On July 1, 2002, Alabama changedto lethal injection, though it still allowed inmates to opt for
electrocution upon written notification within 30 days of theAlabama Supreme Court's entry of judgment or July 1, 2002,
whichever is later. Ala. Code $ 15-18-82.1 (Lexis Supp.2003). Because he failed to make a timely request, petitioner waived his option to be executed by electrocution.This Court denied petitioner's request for certiorari review of the Eleventh Circuit's decision on March 24, 2003.Nelson v. Alabama, 538 U. S. 926. Two weeks later, the Alabama Attorney General's office moved the Alabama Su-preme Court to set an execution date. App. 81. Petitioner
responded by letter that he "ha[d] no plans to contest [the]motion," agreeing "that an execution date should be set
promptly by the court in the immediate future." Id., at 89.Hearing no objection, the Alabama Supreme Court, on September 3, 2003, set petitioner's execution for October 9, 2003.Due to years of drug abuse, petitioner has severely compromised peripheral veins, which are inaccessible by stand-ard techniques for gaining intravenous access, such as a needle. Id., at 7. In August 2003, counsel for petitionercontacted Grantt Culliver, warden of Holman Correctional
Facility where the execution was to take place, to discuss

Opinion of the Court
how petitioner's medical condition might impact the lethalinjection procedure. Counsel specifically requested a copy

of the State's written protocol for gaining venous accessprior to execution, and asked that a privately retained or
prison physician consult with petitioner about the procedure.
Id., at 8-9, 25-26. The warden advised counsel that the
State had such a protocol, but stated that he could not provide it to her. He nevertheless assured counsel that "medi-cal personnel" would be present during the execution and

that a prison physician would evaluate and speak with peti-tioner upon his arrival at Holman Correctional Facility.

Id.,
at 8, 26.

Petitioner was transferred to Holman shortly after the Alabama Supreme Court set the execution date. Warden Culliver and a prison nurse met with and examined petitioner
on September 10, 2003. Id., at 9-10. Upon confirming that
petitioner had compromised veins, Warden Culliver informed
petitioner that prison personnel would cut a 0.5-inch incision
in petitioner's arm and catheterize a vein 24 hours before the
scheduled execution. Id., at 11. At a second meeting on
Friday, October 3, 2003, the warden dramatically altered the
prognosis: prison personnel would now make a 2-inch incision
in petitioner's arm or leg; the procedure would take place
one hour before the scheduled execution; and only local anesthesia would be used. Id., at 12. There was no assurance
that a physician would perform or even be present for the
procedure. Counsel immediately contacted the Alabama
Department of Corrections Legal Department requesting a

Opinion of the Court
sought: a permanent injunction against use of the cut-down;a temporary stay of execution to allow the District Court to

consider the merits of his claim; an order requiring respond-ents to furnish a copy of the protocol setting forth the medical procedures to be used to gain venous access; and an orderdirecting respondents, in consultation with medical experts,
to promulgate a venous access protocol that comports with
contemporary standards of medical care. Id., at 22. Ap-pended to the complaint was an affidavit from Dr. Mark

Heath, a board certified anesthesiologist and assistant pro-fessor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, attesting that the cut-down is a dangerous and antiquated medical procedure to be performed only by a trained
physician in a clinical environment with the patient under
deep sedation. In light of safer and less-invasive contemporary means of venous access, Dr. Heath concluded that
"there is no comprehensible reason for the State of Alabama
to be planning to employ the cut-down procedure to obtain
intravenous access, unless there exists an intent to render
the procedure more painful and risky than it otherwise needs
to be." Id., at 37.

Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint for want of
jurisdiction on the grounds that petitioner's $ 1983 claim and
accompanying stay request were the " `functional equivalent' " of a second or successive habeas application subject to
the gatekeeping provisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b). App. 82.
The District Court agreed and, because petitioner had not
obtained authorization to file a second or successive application as required by $ 2244(b)(3), dismissed the complaint. A
divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Relying on
Fugate v. Department of Corrections, 301 F. 3d 1287 (2002),
in which the Eleventh Circuit had held that $ 1983 claims
challenging the method of execution necessarily sound in habeas, the majority held that petitioner should have sought
authorization to file a second or successive habeas application. 347 F. 3d 910, 912 (2003). The majority also con541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cluded that, even were it to construe petitioner's appeal as arequest for such authorization, it would nevertheless deny

the request because petitioner could not show that, but forthe purported Eighth Amendment violation, " `no reasonable
factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the underly-ing offense.' " Ibid. (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii)).
Thus, the Eleventh Circuit held that petitioner was withoutrecourse to challenge the constitutionality of the cut-down
procedure in Federal District Court. We granted certiorari,540 U. S. 1046 (2003), and now reverse.

A

Section 1983 authorizes a "suit in equity, or other properproceeding for redress," against any person who, under color

of state law, "subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizenof the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution."Petitioner's complaint states such a claim. Despite its literal applicability, however, $ 1983 must yield to the more spe-cific federal habeas statute, with its attendant procedural
and exhaustion requirements, where an inmate seeks injunc-tive relief challenging the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475,489 (1973). Such claims fall within the "core" of habeas corpus and are thus not cognizable when brought pursuantto $ 1983.

Ibid. By contrast, constitutional claims thatmerely challenge the conditions of a prisoner's confinement,

whether the inmate seeks monetary or injunctive relief, falloutside of that core and may be brought pursuant to $ 1983
in the first instance. See Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S.749, 750 (2004) (per curiam); Preiser, supra, at 498-499.

We have not yet had occasion to consider whether civilrights suits seeking to enjoin the use of a particular method
of execution--e. g., lethal injection or electrocution--fallwithin the core of federal habeas corpus or, rather, whether

541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
they are properly viewed as challenges to the conditions ofa condemned inmate's death sentence. Neither the "conditions" nor the "fact or duration" label is particularly apt. Asuit seeking to enjoin a particular means of effectuating a
sentence of death does not directly call into question the"fact" or "validity" of the sentence itself--by simply altering
its method of execution, the State can go forward with the
sentence. Cf. Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32-33, n. 17(1981) (no

ex post facto violation to change method of execution to more humane method). On the other hand, imposi-tion of the death penalty presupposes a means of carrying it

out. In a State such as Alabama, where the legislature has
established lethal injection as the preferred method of execution, see Ala. Code $ 15-18-82 (Lexis Supp. 2003) (lethal injection as default method), a constitutional challenge seeking
to permanently enjoin the use of lethal injection may amount
to a challenge to the fact of the sentence itself. A finding of
unconstitutionality would require statutory amendment or
variance, imposing significant costs on the State and the administration of its penal system. And while it makes little
sense to talk of the "duration" of a death sentence, a State
retains a significant interest in meting out a sentence of
death in a timely fashion. See Calderon v. Thompson, 523
U. S. 538, 556-557 (1998); In re Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236, 238
(1992) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491
(1991) ("[T]he power of a State to pass laws means little if
the State cannot enforce them").

We need not reach here the difficult question of how to
categorize method-of-execution claims generally. Respondents at oral argument conceded that $ 1983 would be an appropriate vehicle for an inmate who is not facing execution
to bring a "deliberate indifference" challenge to the constitutionality of the cut-down procedure if used to gain venous
access for purposes of providing medical treatment. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 40 ("I don't disagree . . . that a cut-down occurring
for purposes of venous access, wholly divorced from an exe541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cution, is indeed a valid conditions of confinement claim");see also

Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104 (1976) ("We
therefore conclude that deliberate indifference to seriousmedical needs of prisoners constitutes the `unnecessary and

wanton infliction of pain' proscribed by the Eighth Amend-ment" (citation omitted)). We see no reason on the face of
the complaint to treat petitioner's claim differently solely because he has been condemned to die.Respondents counter that, because the cut-down is part of

the execution procedure, petitioner's challenge is, in fact, achallenge to the fact of his execution. They offer the following argument: A challenge to the use of lethal injection as a
method of execution sounds in habeas; venous access is a
necessary prerequisite to, and thus an indispensable part of,
any lethal injection procedure; therefore, a challenge to the
State's means of achieving venous access must be brought in
a federal habeas application. Even were we to accept as
given respondents' premise that a challenge to lethal injection sounds in habeas, the conclusion does not follow. That
venous access is a necessary prerequisite does not imply that
a particular means of gaining such access is likewise necessary. Indeed, the gravamen of petitioner's entire claim is
that use of the cut-down would be gratuitous. Merely labeling something as part of an execution procedure is insufficient to insulate it from a $ 1983 attack.

If as a legal matter the cut-down were a statutorily mandated part of the lethal injection protocol, or if as a factual
matter petitioner were unable or unwilling to concede acceptable alternatives for gaining venous access, respondents
might have a stronger argument that success on the merits, coupled with injunctive relief, would call into question
the death sentence itself. But petitioner has been careful
throughout these proceedings, in his complaint and at oral
argument, to assert that the cut-down, as well as the warden's refusal to provide reliable information regarding the
cut-down protocol, are wholly unnecessary to gaining venous

541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
646 NELSON v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court
access. Petitioner has alleged alternatives that, if they hadbeen used, would have allowed the State to proceed with the

execution as scheduled. App. 17 (complaint) (proffering as"less invasive, less painful, faster, cheaper, and safer" the
alternative procedure of "percutaneous central line place-ment");

id., at 37-38 (affidavit of Dr. Mark Heath) (describing
relative merits of the cut-down and percutaneous central line
placement). No Alabama statute requires use of the cut-down, see Ala. Code $ 15-18-82 (Lexis Supp. 2003) (saying

only that method of execution is lethal injection), and re-spondents have offered no duly-promulgated regulations to
the contrary.

If on remand and after an evidentiary hearing the District
Court concludes that use of the cut-down procedure as described in the complaint is necessary for administering the
lethal injection, the District Court will need to address the
broader question, left open here, of how to treat method-ofexecution claims generally. An evidentiary hearing will in
all likelihood be unnecessary, however, as the State now
seems willing to implement petitioner's proposed alternatives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46 ("I think there is no disagreement here that percutaneous central line placement is
the preferred method and will, in fact, be used, a cut-down
to be used only if actually necessary").

We note that our holding here is consistent with our approach to civil rights damages actions, which, like methodof-execution challenges, fall at the margins of habeas. Although damages are not an available habeas remedy, we have
previously concluded that a $ 1983 suit for damages that
would "necessarily imply" the invalidity of the fact of an inmate's conviction, or "necessarily imply" the invalidity of the
length of an inmate's sentence, is not cognizable under $ 1983
unless and until the inmate obtains favorable termination of
a state, or federal habeas, challenge to his conviction or sentence. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 487 (1994); Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, 648 (1997). This "favorable

Opinion of the Court
termination" requirement is necessary to prevent inmatesfrom doing indirectly through damages actions what they

could not do directly by seeking injunctive relief--challengethe fact or duration of their confinement without complying
with the procedural limitations of the federal habeas statute.Muhammad, 540 U. S., at 751. Even so, we were careful in
Heck to stress the importance of the term "necessarily."For instance, we acknowledged that an inmate could bring a
challenge to the lawfulness of a search pursuant to $ 1983 inthe first instance, even if the search revealed evidence used
to convict the inmate at trial, because success on the meritswould not "

necessarily imply that the plaintiff 's convictionwas unlawful." 512 U. S., at 487, n. 7 (noting doctrines such

as inevitable discovery, independent source, and harmlesserror). To hold otherwise would have cut off potentially
valid damages actions as to which a plaintiff might neverobtain favorable termination--suits that could otherwise
have gone forward had the plaintiff not been convicted. Inthe present context, focusing attention on whether petitioner's challenge to the cut-down procedure would necessarilyprevent Alabama from carrying out its execution both protects against the use of $ 1983 to circumvent any limitsimposed by the habeas statute and minimizes the extent
to which the fact of a prisoner's imminent execution willrequire differential treatment of his otherwise cognizable

$ 1983 claims. B

There remains the question whether petitioner's requestfor a temporary stay of execution, subsequently recharacterized by petitioner as a request for a preliminary injunction,App. 49, transformed his conditions of confinement claim into
a challenge to the validity of his death sentence. Normally,it would not. If a request for a permanent injunction does
not sound in habeas, it follows that the lesser included re-quest for a temporary stay (or preliminary injunction) does
not either.

541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
648 NELSON v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court
There is a complication in the present case, however. In
his prayer for relief, petitioner asked the District Court,
among other things, to "[e]nter an order granting injunctive
relief and staying [petitioner's] execution, which is currently
scheduled for October 9, 2003." Id., at 22. Though he did
not specify what permanent injunctive relief he was seeking,
a fair reading of the complaint leaves no doubt that petitioner was asking only to enjoin the State's use of the cutdown, not his execution by lethal injection. The same cannot be said of petitioner's stay request. There, he explicitly
requested that the District Court stay his execution, seemingly without regard to whether the State did or did not
resort to the cut-down. This observation is potentially significant given the fact that the State has maintained, from
the outset of this litigation, that it would attempt other
methods of venous access prior to engaging in the cut-down.
See id., at 51-52; id., at 93-94 (affidavit of Warden Culliver).
By asking for broader relief than necessary, petitioner undermines his assertions that: (1) his $ 1983 suit is not a tactic
for delay, and (2) he is not challenging the fact of his execution, but merely a dispensable preliminary procedure.

Whatever problem this failing might have caused before
this Court entered a stay, the execution warrant has now
expired. If the State reschedules the execution while this
case is pending on remand and petitioner seeks another similarly broad stay, the District Court will need to address the
question whether a request to enjoin the execution, rather
than merely to enjoin an allegedly unnecessary precursor
medical procedure, properly sounds in habeas. See also 18
U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(2) ("Preliminary injunctive relief [in prison
conditions cases] must be narrowly drawn, extend no further
than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires
preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm").

Opinion of the Court

C
Respondents argue that a decision to reverse the judg-ment of the Eleventh Circuit would open the floodgates to

all manner of method-of-execution challenges, as well as lastminute stay requests. But, because we do not here resolve
the question of how to treat method-of-execution claims gen-erally, our holding is extremely limited.

Moreover, as our previous decision in Gomez v. United
States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653(1992) (per curiam), makes clear, the mere fact that an inmate states a cognizable $ 1983 claim does not warrant theentry of a stay as a matter of right.

Gomez came to us ona motion by the State to vacate a stay entered by an en banc

panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thatwould have allowed the District Court time to consider the
merits of a condemned inmate's last-minute $ 1983 actionchallenging the constitutionality of California's use of the gas
chamber. We left open the question whether the inmate'sclaim was cognizable under $ 1983, but vacated the stay
nonetheless. The inmate, Robert Alton Harris, who had al-ready filed four unsuccessful federal habeas applications,
waited until the eleventh hour to file his challenge despitethe fact that California's method of execution had been in
place for years: "This claim could have been brought morethan a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive
delay, which has been compounded by last-minute attempts
to manipulate the judicial process. A court may considerthe last-minute nature of an application to stay execution in

deciding whether to grant equitable relief." Id., at 654.A stay is an equitable remedy, and "[e]quity must take into
consideration the State's strong interest in proceeding withits judgment and . . . attempt[s] at manipulation."

Ibid.
Thus, before granting a stay, a district court must considernot only the likelihood of success on the merits and the relative harms to the parties, but also the extent to which the

541US2 Unit: $U52 [01-30-05 09:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
650 NELSON v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court
inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.
Given the State's significant interest in enforcing its criminal
judgments, see Blodgett, 502 U. S., at 239; McCleskey, 499
U. S., at 491, there is a strong equitable presumption against
the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought
at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without
requiring entry of a stay.

Finally, the ability to bring a $ 1983 claim, rather than a
habeas application, does not entirely free inmates from substantive or procedural limitations. The Prison Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (Act) imposes limits on the scope and
duration of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, including a requirement that, before issuing such relief, "[a]
court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on
. . . the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the
relief." 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(1); accord, $ 3626(a)(2). It requires that inmates exhaust available state administrative
remedies before bringing a $ 1983 action challenging the conditions of their confinement. 110 Stat. 1321-71, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1997e(a) ("No action shall be brought with respect to prison
conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other
correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are
available are exhausted"). The Act mandates that a district
court "shall," on its own motion, dismiss "any action brought
with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this
title . . . if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous,
malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is
immune from such relief." $ 1997e(c)(1). Indeed, if the
claim is frivolous on its face, a district court may dismiss the
suit before the plaintiff has exhausted his state remedies.

YARBOROUGH, WARDEN v. ALVARADO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1684. Argued March 1, 2004--Decided June 1, 2004
Respondent Alvarado helped Paul Soto try to steal a truck, leading to the

death of the truck's owner. Alvarado was called in for an interview
with Los Angeles detective Comstock. Alvarado was 17 years old at
the time, and his parents brought him to the station and waited in the
lobby during the interview. Comstock took Alvarado to a small room
where only the two of them were present. The interview lasted about
two hours, and Alvarado was not given a warning under Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436. Although he at first denied being present at
the shooting, Alvarado slowly began to change his story, finally admitting that he had helped Soto try to steal the victim's truck and to hide
the gun after the murder. Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he needed
a break and, when the interview was over, returned him to his parents,
who drove him home. After California charged Alvarado with murder
and attempted robbery, the trial court denied his motion to suppress
his interview statements on Miranda grounds. In affirming Alvarado's
conviction, the District Court of Appeal (hereinafter state court) ruled
that a Miranda warning was not required because Alvarado had not
been in custody during the interview under the test articulated in
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112, which requires a court to consider the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and then determine whether a reasonable person would have felt at liberty to leave.
The Federal District Court agreed with the state court on habeas review, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court erred
in failing to account for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluating whether a reasonable person in his position would have felt free to
leave the interview. Noting that this Court has considered a suspect's
juvenile status in other criminal law contexts, see, e. g., Haley v. Ohio,
332 U. S. 596, 599, the Court of Appeals held that the state court's error
warranted habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) because it "resulted in a decision that . . .
involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal
law, as determined by [this] Court," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

Held: The state court considered the proper factors and reached a reasonable conclusion that Alvarado was not in custody for Miranda purposes
during his police interview. Pp. 660-669.

Syllabus
(a) AEDPA requires federal courts to consider whether the statecourt decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established law. Clearly established law "refers to the holdings, as opposed
to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant statecourt decision." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412. The Miranda
custody test is an objective test. Two discrete inquiries are essential:
(1) the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, and (2) given those
circumstances, whether a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave. "Once the . . . players' lines and
actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on
freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest."
Thompson, supra, at 112. Pp. 660-663.

(b) The state-court adjudication did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established law when it concluded that Alvarado was
not in custody. The meaning of "unreasonable" can depend in part on
the specificity of the relevant legal rule. If a rule is specific, the range
of reasonable judgment may be narrow. Applications of the rule may
be plainly correct or incorrect. Other rules are more general, and their
meaning must emerge in application over time. The more general the
rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case
determinations. Cf. Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308-309. Fairminded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.
The custody test is general, and the state court's application of this
Court's law fits within the matrix of the Court's prior decisions. Certain facts weigh against a finding that Alvarado was in custody. The
police did not transport him to the station or require him to appear at
a particular time, cf. Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495; they did
not threaten him or suggest he would be placed under arrest, ibid.; his
parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that the
interview would be brief, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 441-
442; Comstock appealed to Alvarado's interest in telling the truth and
being helpful to a police officer, cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495; Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he wanted to take a break; and, at the
end of the interview, Alvarado went home, ibid. Other facts point in
the opposite direction. Comstock interviewed Alvarado at the police
station; the interview lasted four times longer than the 30-minute interview in Mathiason; Comstock did not tell Alvarado that he was free to
leave; he was brought to the station by his legal guardians rather than
arriving on his own accord; and his parents allegedly asked to be present
at the interview but were rebuffed. Given these differing indications,
the state court's application of this Court's custody standard was reasonable. Indeed, a number of the facts echo those in Mathiason, a per

Syllabus
curiam summary reversal in which we found it clear that the suspect
was not in custody. Pp. 663-666.

(c) The state court's failure to consider Alvarado's age and inexperience does not provide a proper basis for finding that the state court's
decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.
The Court's opinions applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect's age, much less mandated its consideration. The
only indications in those opinions relevant to a suspect's experience with
law enforcement have rejected reliance on such factors. See, e. g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, n. 35, 430-432. It was therefore improper for the
Court of Appeals to grant relief on the basis of the state court's failure
to consider them. There is an important conceptual difference between
the Miranda test and the line of cases from other contexts considering
age and experience. The Miranda custody inquiry is an objective test,
see Thompson, supra, at 112, that furthers "the clarity of [Miranda's]
rule," Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, ensuring that the police need not
"gues[s] as to [the circumstances] at issue before deciding how they may
interrogate the suspect," id., at 431. This objective inquiry could reasonably be viewed as different from doctrinal tests that depend on the
actual mindset of a particular suspect, where the Court does consider a
suspect's age and experience. In concluding that such factors should
also apply to the Miranda custody inquiry, the Ninth Circuit ignored
the argument that that inquiry states an objective rule designed to give
clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspect's individual
characteristics--including his age--could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry, cf. Mathiason, supra, at 495-496. Reliance on Alvarado's prior history with law enforcement was improper not only under

$ 2254(d)(1)'s deferential standard, but also as a de novo matter. In
most cases, the police will not know a suspect's interrogation history.
See Berkemer, supra, at 430-431. Even if they do, the relationship
between a suspect's experiences and the likelihood a reasonable person
with that experience would feel free to leave often will be speculative.
Officers should not be asked to consider these contingent psychological
factors when deciding when suspects should be advised of Miranda
rights. See Berkemer, supra, at 431-432. Pp. 666-669.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Actof 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court can grant

an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a per-son held pursuant to a state-court judgment if the statecourt adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contraryto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ofthe United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). The United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled thata state court unreasonably applied clearly established law
when it held that the respondent was not in custody for
Miranda purposes. Alvarado v. Hickman, 316 F. 3d 841(2002). We disagree and reverse.

656 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO

Opinion of the Court
Fe Springs, California. Soto and Alvarado were part of alarger group of teenagers at the mall that night. Soto decided to steal the truck, and Alvarado agreed to help. Sotopulled out a .357 Magnum and approached the driver, Francisco Castaneda, who was standing near the truck emptyingtrash into a dumpster. Soto demanded money and the ignition keys from Castaneda. Alvarado, then five months short
of his 18th birthday, approached the passenger side door ofthe truck and crouched down. When Castaneda refused to

comply with Soto's demands, Soto shot Castaneda, killinghim. Alvarado then helped hide Soto's gun.

Los Angeles County Sheriff 's detective Cheryl Comstock
led the investigation into the circumstances of Castaneda's
death. About a month after the shooting, Comstock left
word at Alvarado's house and also contacted Alvarado's
mother at work with the message that she wished to speak
with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the Pico
Rivera Sheriff 's Station to be interviewed around lunchtime.
They waited in the lobby while Alvarado went with Comstock to be interviewed. Alvarado contends that his parents
asked to be present during the interview but were rebuffed.

Comstock brought Alvarado to a small interview room and
began interviewing him at about 12:30 p.m. The interview
lasted about two hours, and was recorded by Comstock with
Alvarado's knowledge. Only Comstock and Alvarado were
present. Alvarado was not given a warning under Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Comstock began the interview by asking Alvarado to recount the events on the night
of the shooting. On that night, Alvarado explained, he had
been drinking alcohol at a friend's house with some other
friends and acquaintances. After a few hours, part of the
group went home and the rest walked to a nearby mall to
use its public telephones. In Alvarado's initial telling, that
was the end of it. The group went back to the friend's home
and "just went to bed." App. 101.

Unpersuaded, Comstock pressed on:

Opinion of the Court
"Q. Okay. We did real good up until this point and everything you've said it's pretty accurate till this point,
except for you left out the shooting.

"A. The shooting?
"Q. Uh huh, the shooting.
"A. Well I had never seen no shooting.
"Q. Well I'm afraid you did.
"A. I had never seen no shooting.
"Q. Well I beg to differ with you. I've been told quite
the opposite and we have witnesses that are saying
quite the opposite.

"A. That I had seen the shooting?
"Q. So why don't you take a deep breath, like I told you
before, the very best thing is to be honest. . . . You can't
have that many people get involved in a murder and
expect that some of them aren't going to tell the truth,
okay? Now granted if it was maybe one person, you
might be able to keep your fingers crossed and say, god
I hope he doesn't tell the truth, but the problem is is
that they have to tell the truth, okay? Now all I'm simply doing is giving you the opportunity to tell the truth
and when we got that many people telling a story and
all of a sudden you tell something way far fetched different." Id., at 101-102 (punctuation added).

At this point, Alvarado slowly began to change his story.
First he acknowledged being present when the carjacking
occurred but claimed that he did not know what happened or
who had a gun. When he hesitated to say more, Comstock
tried to encourage Alvarado to discuss what happened by
appealing to his sense of honesty and the need to bring the
man who shot Castaneda to justice. See, e. g., id., at 106
("[W]hat I'm looking for is to see if you'll tell the truth"); id.,
at 105-106 ("I know it's very difficult when it comes time to
`drop the dime' on somebody[,] . . . [but] if that had been

Opinion of the Court
your parent, your mother, or your brother, or your sister,you would darn well want [the killer] to go to jail 'cause no

one has the right to take someone's life like that . . ."). Al-varado then admitted he had helped the other man try to
steal the truck by standing near the passenger side door.Next he admitted that the other man was Paul Soto, that he
knew Soto was armed, and that he had helped hide the gun
after the murder. Alvarado explained that he had expectedSoto to scare the driver with the gun, but that he did not

expect Soto to kill anyone. Id., at 127. Toward the end ofthe interview, Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he needed
to take a break. Alvarado declined. When the interviewwas over, Comstock returned with Alvarado to the lobby of
the sheriff 's station where his parents were waiting. Alva-rado's father drove him home.

A few months later, the State of California charged Sotoand Alvarado with first-degree murder and attempted robbery. Citing Miranda, supra, Alvarado moved to suppresshis statements from the Comstock interview. The trial
court denied the motion on the ground that the interview
was noncustodial. App. 196. Alvarado and Soto were triedtogether, and Alvarado testified in his own defense. He offered an innocent explanation for his conduct, testifying that
he happened to be standing in the parking lot of the mall
when a gun went off nearby. The government's crossexamination relied on Alvarado's statement to Comstock.
Alvarado admitted having made some of the statements but
denied others. When Alvarado denied particular statements, the prosecution countered by playing excerpts from
the audio recording of the interview.

During cross-examination, Alvarado agreed that the interview with Comstock "was a pretty friendly conversation,"
id., at 438, that there was "sort of a free flow between
[Alvarado] and Detective Comstock," id., at 439, and that Alvarado did not "feel coerced or threatened in any way" during the interview, ibid. The jury convicted Soto and Alvarado of first-degree murder and attempted robbery. The

Opinion of the Court
trial judge later reduced Alvarado's conviction to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The judge sentenced Soto to life in prison and Alva-rado to 15-years-to-life.

On direct appeal, the Second Appellate District Court ofAppeal (hereinafter state court) affirmed.

People v. Soto,
74 Cal. App. 4th 1099, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 688 (1999) (unpublished in relevant part). The state court rejected Alvarado'scontention that his statements to Comstock should have been

excluded at trial because no Miranda warnings were given.The court ruled Alvarado had not been in custody during
the interview, so no warning was required. The state courtrelied upon the custody test articulated in

Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995), which requires a court to con-sider the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and

then determine whether a reasonable person would have feltat liberty to leave. The state court reviewed the facts of
the Comstock interview and concluded Alvarado was not incustody. App. to Pet. for Cert. C-17. The court emphasized the absence of any intense or aggressive tactics and
noted that Comstock had not told Alvarado that he could notleave. The California Supreme Court denied discretionary

review.

Alvarado filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. The District Court agreed with the state court
that Alvarado was not in custody for Miranda purposes during the interview. Alvarado v. Hickman, No. ED CV-00-

326-VAP(E) (2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. B-1 to B-10. "At
a minimum," the District Court added, the deferential standard of review provided by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) foreclosed relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Alvarado v. Hickman, 316 F. 3d 841 (2002). First, the Court
of Appeals held that the state court erred in failing to account for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluating
whether a reasonable person in his position would have felt

660 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO

Opinion of the Court
free to leave. It noted that this Court has considered a sus-pect's juvenile status when evaluating the voluntariness of

confessions and the waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. See id., at 843 (citing, inter alia, Haley v.
Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599-601 (1948), and In re Gault, 387 U. S.1, 45 (1967)). The Court of Appeals held that in light of
these authorities, Alvarado's age and experience must be afactor in the

Miranda custody inquiry. 316 F. 3d, at 843.A minor with no criminal record would be more likely to feel

coerced by police tactics and conclude he is under arrest thanwould an experienced adult, the Court of Appeals reasoned.
This required extra "safeguards . . . commensurate with theage and circumstances of a juvenile defendant." See id., at
850. According to the Court of Appeals, the effect of Alva-rado's age and inexperience was so substantial that it turned
the interview into a custodial interrogation.The Court of Appeals next considered whether Alvarado
could obtain relief in light of the deference a federal courtmust give to a state-court determination on habeas review.
The deference required by AEDPA did not bar relief, theCourt of Appeals held, because the relevance of juvenile status in Supreme Court case law as a whole compelled the"extension of the principle that juvenile status is relevant"
to the context of Miranda custody determinations. 316F. 3d, at 853. In light of the clearly established law considering juvenile status, it was "simply unreasonable to con-clude that a reasonable 17-year-old, with no prior history of
arrest or police interviews, would have felt that he was atliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave."

Id., at854-855 (internal quotation marks omitted).

We granted certiorari. 539 U. S. 986 (2003).

We begin by determining the relevant clearly establishedlaw. For purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), clearly established law as determined by this Court "refers to the hold-ings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of

Opinion of the Court
the time of the relevant state-court decision." Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000). We look for "the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the SupremeCourt at the time the state court renders its decision."

Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71-72 (2003).

Miranda itself held that preinterrogation warnings are required in the context of custodial interrogations given "the
compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings." 384 U. S.,at 458. The Court explained that "custodial interrogation"

meant "questioning initiated by law enforcement officersafter a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way." Id.,at 444. The

Miranda decision did not provide the Court
with an opportunity to apply that test to a set of facts.After

Miranda, the Court first applied the custody test in
Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492 (1977) (per curiam). In
Mathiason, a police officer contacted the suspect after a burglary victim identified him. The officer arranged to meetthe suspect at a nearby police station. At the outset of the

questioning, the officer stated his belief that the suspect was
involved in the burglary but that he was not under arrest.During the 30-minute interview, the suspect admitted his

guilt. He was then allowed to leave. The Court held that
the questioning was not custodial because there was "no indication that the questioning took place in a context where [the
suspect's] freedom to depart was restricted in any way."
Id., at 495. The Court noted that the suspect had come voluntarily to the police station, that he was informed that he
was not under arrest, and that he was allowed to leave at
the end of the interview. Ibid.

In California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121 (1983) (per curiam), the Court reached the same result in a case with facts
similar to those in Mathiason. In Beheler, the state court
had distinguished Mathiason based on what it described as
differences in the totality of the circumstances. The police
interviewed Beheler shortly after the crime occurred; Beheler had been drinking earlier in the day; he was emotion541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
662 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO

Opinion of the Court
ally distraught; he was well known to the police; and he was
a parolee who knew it was necessary for him to cooperate
with the police. 463 U. S., at 1124-1125. The Court agreed
that "the circumstances of each case must certainly influence" the custody determination, but reemphasized that "the
ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest
or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest." Id., at 1125 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The Court found the case indistinguishable
from Mathiason. It noted that how much the police knew
about the suspect and how much time had elapsed after the
crime occurred were irrelevant to the custody inquiry. 463
U. S., at 1125.

Our more recent cases instruct that custody must be determined based on how a reasonable person in the suspect's
situation would perceive his circumstances. In Berkemer v.
McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), a police officer stopped a suspected drunk driver and asked him some questions. Although the officer reached the decision to arrest the driver
at the beginning of the traffic stop, he did not do so until the
driver failed a sobriety test and acknowledged that he had
been drinking beer and smoking marijuana. The Court held
the traffic stop noncustodial despite the officer's intent to
arrest because he had not communicated that intent to the
driver. "A policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing on
the question whether a suspect was `in custody' at a particular time," the Court explained. Id., at 442. "[T]he only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation." Ibid. In a
footnote, the Court cited a New York state case for the view
that an objective test was preferable to a subjective test in
part because it does not " `place upon the police the burden
of anticipating the frailties or idiosyncrasies of every person
whom they question.' " Id., at 442, n. 35 (quoting People v.
P., 21 N. Y. 2d 1, 9-10, 233 N. E. 2d 255, 260 (1967)).

663Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318 (1994) (per curiam), confirmed this analytical framework. Stansbury explained that "the initial determination of custody depends onthe objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the

subjective views harbored by either the interrogating offi-cers or the person being questioned."

Id., at 323. Courts
must examine "all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation" and determine "how a reasonable person in theposition of the individual being questioned would gauge the

breadth of his or her freedom of action." Id., at 322, 325(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).

Finally, in Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99 (1995), theCourt offered the following description of the

Miranda custody test:

"Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding theinterrogation; and second, given those circumstances,

would a reasonable person have felt he or she was notat liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.
Once the scene is set and the players' lines and actionsare reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test
to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal ar-rest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree
associated with a formal arrest." 516 U. S., at 112 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).

We turn now to the case before us and ask if the state-court adjudication of the claim "involved an unreasonable

application" of clearly established law when it concluded thatAlvarado was not in custody. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). See
Williams, 529 U. S., at 413 ("Under the `unreasonable application' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if
the state court identifies the correct governing principle
from this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that
principle to the facts of the prisoner's case"). The term
" `unreasonable' " is "a common term in the legal world and,

541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
664 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO

Opinion of the Court
accordingly, federal judges are familiar with its meaning."
Id., at 410. At the same time, the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule.If a legal rule is specific, the range may be narrow. Applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect. Otherrules are more general, and their meaning must emerge in
application over the course of time. Applying a general
standard to a specific case can demand a substantial elementof judgment. As a result, evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule'sspecificity. The more general the rule, the more leeway
courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations. Cf. Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308-309 (1992)
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).

Based on these principles, we conclude that the state
court's application of our clearly established law was reasonable. Ignoring the deferential standard of $ 2254(d)(1)
for the moment, it can be said that fairminded jurists could
disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. On one
hand, certain facts weigh against a finding that Alvarado was
in custody. The police did not transport Alvarado to the
station or require him to appear at a particular time.
Cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495. They did not threaten him
or suggest he would be placed under arrest. Ibid. Alvarado's parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that the interview would be brief. See Berkemer,
supra, at 441-442. In fact, according to trial counsel for Alvarado, he and his parents were told that the interview was
" `not going to be long.' " App. 186. During the interview,
Comstock focused on Soto's crimes rather than Alvarado's.
Instead of pressuring Alvarado with the threat of arrest and
prosecution, she appealed to his interest in telling the truth
and being helpful to a police officer. Cf. Mathiason, supra,
at 495. In addition, Comstock twice asked Alvarado if

he wanted to take a break. At the end of the interview,
Alvarado went home. App. 186. All of these objective

541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

665Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
facts are consistent with an interrogation environment inwhich a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate

the interview and leave. Indeed, a number of the facts echothose of

Mathiason, a per curiam summary reversal in
which we found it "clear from these facts" that the suspectwas not in custody. 494 U. S., at 495.

Other facts point in the opposite direction. Comstock interviewed Alvarado at the police station. The interviewlasted two hours, four times longer than the 30-minute

interview in Mathiason. Unlike the officer in Mathiason,Comstock did not tell Alvarado that he was free to leave.
Alvarado was brought to the police station by his legal
guardians rather than arriving on his own accord, making
the extent of his control over his presence unclear. Counsel
for Alvarado alleges that Alvarado's parents asked to be
present at the interview but were rebuffed, a fact that--if
known to Alvarado--might reasonably have led someone in
Alvarado's position to feel more restricted than otherwise.
These facts weigh in favor of the view that Alvarado was
in custody.

These differing indications lead us to hold that the state
court's application of our custody standard was reasonable.
The Court of Appeals was nowhere close to the mark when
it concluded otherwise. Although the question of what an
"unreasonable application" of law might be is difficult in
some cases, it is not difficult here. The custody test is general, and the state court's application of our law fits within
the matrix of our prior decisions. We cannot grant relief
under AEDPA by conducting our own independent inquiry
into whether the state court was correct as a de novo matter.
"[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply
because that court concludes in its independent judgment
that the state-court decision applied [the law] incorrectly."
Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24-25 (2002) (per curiam). Relief is available under $ 2254(d)(1) only if the state
court's decision is objectively unreasonable. See Williams,

Opinion of the Court
529 U. S., at 410; Andrade, 538 U. S., at 75. Under thatstandard, relief cannot be granted.

III
The Court of Appeals reached the opposite result by plac-ing considerable reliance on Alvarado's age and inexperience

with law enforcement. Our Court has not stated that a sus-pect's age or experience is relevant to the Miranda custody
analysis, and counsel for Alvarado did not press the impor-tance of either factor on direct appeal or in habeas proceedings. According to the Court of Appeals, however, ourCourt's emphasis on juvenile status in other contexts demanded consideration of Alvarado's age and inexperiencehere. The Court of Appeals viewed the state court's failure
to " `extend a clearly established legal principle [of the rele-vance of juvenile status] to a new context' " as objectively
unreasonable in this case, requiring issuance of the writ.316 F. 3d, at 853 (quoting

Anthony v. Cambra, 236 F. 3d 568,578 (CA9 2000)).

The petitioner contends that if a habeas court must extenda rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand then the
rationale cannot be clearly established at the time of thestate-court decision. Brief for Petitioner 10-24. See also
Hawkins v. Alabama, 318 F. 3d 1302, 1306, n. 3 (CA11 2003)(asserting a similar argument). There is force to this argument. Section 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeascourts introduced rules not clearly established under the
guise of extensions to existing law. Cf. Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989). At the same time, the difference between
applying a rule and extending it is not always clear. Cer-tain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlierrule will be beyond doubt.

This is not such a case, however. Our opinions applyingthe

Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect'sage, much less mandated its consideration. The only indica541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

667Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
tions in the Court's opinions relevant to a suspect's experi-ence with law enforcement have rejected reliance on such

factors. See Beheler, 463 U. S., at 1125 (rejecting a lowercourt's view that the defendant's prior interview with the
police was relevant to the custody inquiry); Berkemer, 468U. S., at 442, n. 35 (citing

People v. P., 21 N. Y. 2d, at 9-10,
233 N. E. 2d, at 260, which noted the difficulties of a subjective test that would require police to " `anticipat[e] the frail-ties or idiosyncrasies of every person whom they question' ");

468 U. S., at 430-432 (describing a suspect's criminal past andpolice record as a circumstance "unknowable to the police").

There is an important conceptual difference between the
Miranda custody test and the line of cases from other contexts considering age and experience. The Miranda custody inquiry is an objective test. As we stated in Keohane,
"[o]nce the scene is set and the players' lines and actions
are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to
resolve the ultimate inquiry." 516 U. S., at 112 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The objective test furthers "the
clarity of [Miranda's] rule," Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, ensuring that the police do not need "to make guesses as to
[the circumstances] at issue before deciding how they may
interrogate the suspect," id., at 431. To be sure, the line
between permissible objective facts and impermissible subjective experiences can be indistinct in some cases. It is
possible to subsume a subjective factor into an objective test
by making the latter more specific in its formulation. Thus
the Court of Appeals styled its inquiry as an objective test
by considering what a "reasonable 17-year-old, with no prior
history of arrest or police interviews," would perceive. 316
F. 3d, at 854-855 (case below).

At the same time, the objective Miranda custody inquiry
could reasonably be viewed as different from doctrinal tests
that depend on the actual mindset of a particular suspect,
where we do consider a suspect's age and experience. For
example, the voluntariness of a statement is often said to

668 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO

Opinion of the Court
depend on whether "the defendant's will was overborne,"
Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963), a question that
logically can depend on "the characteristics of the accused,"
Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973). The
characteristics of the accused can include the suspect's age,education, and intelligence, see

ibid., as well as a suspect's
prior experience with law enforcement, see Lynumn, supra,
at 534. In concluding that there was "no principled reason"why such factors should not also apply to the

Miranda custody inquiry, 316 F. 3d, at 850, the Court of Appeals ignoredthe argument that the custody inquiry states an objective

rule designed to give clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspect's individual characteristics--including
his age--could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry.
Cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495-496 (noting that facts arguably relevant to whether an environment is coercive may have
"nothing to do with whether respondent was in custody for
purposes of the Miranda rule"). For these reasons, the
state court's failure to consider Alvarado's age does not provide a proper basis for finding that the state court's decision
was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.

Indeed, reliance on Alvarado's prior history with law enforcement was improper not only under the deferential
standard of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), but also as a de novo matter. In most cases, police officers will not know a suspect's
interrogation history. See Berkemer, supra, at 430-431.
Even if they do, the relationship between a suspect's past
experiences and the likelihood a reasonable person with that
experience would feel free to leave often will be speculative.
True, suspects with prior law enforcement experience may
understand police procedures and reasonably feel free to
leave unless told otherwise. On the other hand, they may
view past as prologue and expect another in a string of arrests. We do not ask police officers to consider these contingent psychological factors when deciding when suspects
should be advised of their Miranda rights. See Berkemer,

Breyer, J., dissenting
supra, at 431-432. The inquiry turns too much on the sus-pect's subjective state of mind and not enough on the "objective circumstances of the interrogation." Stansbury, 511U. S., at 323.

The state court considered the proper factors and reacheda reasonable conclusion. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court, but write separately to
express an additional reason for reversal. There may be
cases in which a suspect's age will be relevant to the "custody" inquiry under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436
(1966). In this case, however, Alvarado was almost 18 years
old at the time of his interview. It is difficult to expect police to recognize that a suspect is a juvenile when he is so
close to the age of majority. Even when police do know a
suspect's age, it may be difficult for them to ascertain what
bearing it has on the likelihood that the suspect would feel
free to leave. That is especially true here; 171/2-year-olds
vary widely in their reactions to police questioning, and
many can be expected to behave as adults. Given these difficulties, I agree that the state court's decision in this case
cannot be called an unreasonable application of federal law
simply because it failed explicitly to mention Alvarado's age.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In my view, Michael Alvarado clearly was "in custody"
when the police questioned him (without Miranda warnings)
about the murder of Francisco Castaneda. To put the question in terms of federal law's well-established legal standards: Would a "reasonable person" in Alvarado's "position"
have felt he was "at liberty to terminate the interrogation

and leave"? Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995);Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 325 (1994) (per curiam). A court must answer this question in light of "allof the circumstances surrounding the interrogation." Id., at
322. And the obvious answer here is "no."

I
A

The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcaneor complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense.

Would a reasonable person in Alvarado's position have feltfree simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the
station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarado's circumstances and then answer that question: Alvarado hearsfrom his parents that he is needed for police questioning.
His parents take him to the station. On arrival, a policeofficer separates him from his parents. His parents ask to
come along, but the officer says they may not. App. 185-186. Another officer says, " `What do we have here; we are
going to question a suspect.' " Id., at 189.The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room,
away from the station's public area. A single officer beginsto question him, making clear in the process that the police
have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjack-ing connected with a murder. When he says that he never
saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, whileadding that she is "giving [him] the opportunity to tell the
truth" and "tak[e] care of [him]self." Id., at 102, 105. To-ward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break. After twohours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the
attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it,the questioning ends.

What reasonable person in the circumstances--brought toa police station by his parents at police request, put in a

Breyer, J., dissenting
small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours,and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that

he participated in a serious crime, could have thought tohimself, "Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and
walk out"? If the person harbored any doubts, would hestill think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the
police officer has just refused to let his parents remain withhim during questioning? Would he still think that he,
rather than the officer, controls the situation?There is only one possible answer to these questions. A
reasonable person would not have thought he was free sim-ply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.
I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to holdthe contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding
that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly estab-lished federal law. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

B
What about the Court's view that "fairminded jurists coulddisagree over whether Alvarado was in custody"?

Ante,at 664. Consider each of the facts it says "weigh against a

finding" of custody:(1) "The police did not transport Alvarado to the station
or require him to appear at a particular time." Ibid. (em-phasis added). True. His parents brought him to the station at police request. But why does that matter? The rel-evant question is whether Alvarado came to the station of
his own free will or submitted to questioning voluntarily.Cf.

Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 493-495 (1977) (percuriam); California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1122-1123

(1983) (per curiam); Thompson, supra, at 118 (Thomas, J.,dissenting). And the involvement of Alvarado's parents
suggests involuntary, not voluntary, behavior on Alvarado'spart.

(2) "Alvarado's parents remained in the lobby during the
interview, suggesting that the interview would be brief. In

Breyer, J., dissenting
fact, [Alvarado] and his parents were told that the interview
was ` "not going to be long." ' " Ante, at 664 (citation omitted and emphasis added). Whatever was communicated toAlvarado

before the questioning began, the fact is that the
interview was not brief, nor, after the first half hour or so,would Alvarado have expected it to be brief. And those are

the relevant considerations. See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468
U. S. 420, 441 (1984).(3)

"At the end of the interview, Alvarado went home."
Ante, at 664 (emphasis added). As the majority acknowl-edges, our recent case law makes clear that the relevant

question is how a reasonable person would have gauged his
freedom to leave during, not after, the interview. See ante,
at 663 (citing Stansbury, supra, at 325).

(4) "During the interview, [Officer] Comstock focused on
Soto's crimes rather than Alvarado's." Ante, at 664 (emphasis added). In fact, the police officer characterized Soto
as the ringleader, while making clear that she knew Alvarado had participated in the attempted carjacking during
which Castaneda was killed. See App. 102-103, 109. Her
questioning would have reinforced, not diminished, Alvarado's fear that he was not simply a witness, but also suspected
of having been involved in a serious crime. See Stansbury,
supra, at 325.

(5) "[The officer did not] pressur[e] Alvarado with the
threat of arrest and prosecution . . . [but instead] appealed
to his interest in telling the truth and being helpful to a
police officer." Ante, at 664 (emphasis added). This factor
might be highly significant were the question one of "coercion." But it is not. The question is whether Alvarado
would have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave.
In respect to that question, police politeness, while commendable, does not significantly help the majority.

(6) "Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he wanted to take
a break." Ibid. (emphasis added). This circumstance, emphasizing the officer 's control of Alvarado's movements,

541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

673Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)
Breyer, J., dissenting
makes it less likely, not more likely, that Alvarado would
have thought he was free to leave at will.

The facts to which the majority points make clear what
the police did not do, for example, come to Alvarado's house,
tell him he was under arrest, handcuff him, place him in a
locked cell, threaten him, or tell him explicitly that he was
not free to leave. But what is important here is what the
police did do--namely, have Alvarado's parents bring him to
the station, put him with a single officer in a small room,
keep his parents out, let him know that he was a suspect,
and question him for two hours. These latter facts compel
a single conclusion: A reasonable person in Alvarado's circumstances would not have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave.

C

What about Alvarado's youth? The fact that Alvarado
was 17 helps to show that he was unlikely to have felt free
to ignore his parents' request to come to the station. See
Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 265 (1984) ( juveniles assumed
"to be subject to the control of their parents"). And a 17-
year-old is more likely than, say, a 35-year-old, to take a police officer's assertion of authority to keep parents outside
the room as an assertion of authority to keep their child inside as well.

The majority suggests that the law might prevent a judge
from taking account of the fact that Alvarado was 17. See
ante, at 666-668. I can find nothing in the law that supports
that conclusion. Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply
a "reasonable person" standard. But the "reasonable person" standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middleaged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.
Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado
was the statistically determined "average person"--a working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school de541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gree. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Sta-tistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

Rather, the precise legal definition of "reasonable person"may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for
certain personal characteristics. In negligence suits, for ex-ample, the question is what would a "reasonable person" do
" `under the same or similar circumstances.' " In answering
that question, courts enjoy "latitude" and may make "allow-ance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain

characteristics of the actor himself," including physical dis-ability, youth, or advanced age. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts

$ 32, pp. 174-179 (5th ed. 1984); see id., at 179-181; see also
Restatement (Third) of Torts $ 10, Comment b, pp. 128-130
(Tent. Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions
count a person's childhood as a "relevant circumstance" in
negligence determinations). This allowance makes sense in
light of the tort standard's recognized purpose: deterrence.
Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or
that a blind man can see? See O. Holmes, The Common Law
85-89 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

In the present context, that of Miranda's "in custody" inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a "reasonable
person" to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of
mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect
and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation. See Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 323-
325; Berkemer, supra, at 442, and n. 35. This focus helps
to keep Miranda a workable rule. See Berkemer, supra,
at 430-431.

In this case, Alvarado's youth is an objective circumstance
that was known to the police. It is not a special quality, but
rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception. To
focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not

Breyer, J., dissenting
complicate the "in custody" inquiry. And to say that courtsshould ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like

age, on the ground that only a (large) minority of the popula-tion possesses them would produce absurd results, the present instance being a case in point. I am not surprised thatthe majority points to no case suggesting any such limitation.
Cf. Alvarado v. Hickman, 316 F. 3d 841, 848, 850-851, n. 5(CA9 2002) (case below) (listing 12 cases from 12 different
jurisdictions suggesting the contrary).Nor am I surprised that the majority makes no real argument at all explaining why any court would believe that theobjective fact of a suspect's age could

never be relevant.But see ante, at 669 (O'C
onnor, J., concurring) ("There maybe cases in which a suspect's age will be relevant to the

Mi-randa `custody' inquiry"). The majority does discuss a suspect's "history with law enforcement," ante, at 668--a brightred herring in the present context where Alvarado's youth
(an objective fact) simply helps to show (with the help of alegal presumption) that his appearance at the police station
was not voluntary. See supra, at 673.

II
As I have said, the law in this case is clear. This Court'scases establish that, even if the police do not tell a suspect

he is under arrest, do not handcuff him, do not lock him in acell, and do not threaten him, he may nonetheless reasonably
believe he is not free to leave the place of questioning--andthus be in custody for Miranda purposes. See Stansbury,
supra, at 325-326; Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 440.Our cases also make clear that to determine how a suspect
would have "gaug[ed]" his "freedom of movement," a courtmust carefully examine "all of the circumstances surrounding
the interrogation," Stansbury, supra, at 322, 325 (internalquotation marks omitted), including, for example, how long
the interrogation lasted (brief and routine or protracted?),see,

e. g., Berkemer, supra, at 441; how the suspect came to

Breyer, J., dissenting
be questioned (voluntarily or against his will?), see, e. g., Ma-thiason, 429 U. S., at 495; where the questioning took place

(at a police station or in public?), see, e. g., Berkemer, supra,at 438-439; and what the officer communicated to the individual during the interrogation (that he was a suspect? that hewas under arrest? that he was free to leave at will?), see,
e. g., Stansbury, supra, at 325. In the present case, everyone of these factors argues--and argues strongly--that Alvarado was in custody for Miranda purposes when the po-lice questioned him.

Common sense, and an understanding of the law's basicpurpose in this area, are enough to make clear that Alvarado's age--an objective, widely shared characteristic aboutwhich the police plainly knew--is also relevant to the inquiry.
Cf. Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U. S. 626, 629-631 (2003) (per
curiam). Unless one is prepared to pretend that Alvaradois someone he is not, a middle-aged gentleman, well versed

in police practices, it seems to me clear that the Californiacourts made a serious mistake. I agree with the Ninth Circuit's similar conclusions. Consequently, I dissent.

REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA et al. v. ALTMANN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-13. Argued February 25, 2004--Decided June 7, 2004
Upon evidence that certain of her uncle's valuable art works had either

been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by Austria after World War
II, respondent filed this action in Federal District Court to recover six
of the paintings from petitioners, Austria and its instrumentality, the
Austrian Gallery. She asserts jurisdiction under $ 2 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. $ 1330(a), which
authorizes federal civil suits against foreign states "as to any claim for
relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled
to immunity" under another section of the FSIA or under "any applicable international agreement." She further asserts that petitioners are
not entitled to immunity under the FSIA's "expropriation exception,"

$ 1605(a)(3), which expressly exempts from immunity certain cases involving "rights in property taken in violation of international law."
Petitioners moved to dismiss based on, inter alia, the two-part claim
that (1) as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place,
they would have enjoyed absolute sovereign immunity from suit in
United States courts, and that (2) nothing in the FSIA retroactively
divests them of that immunity. Rejecting this argument, the District
Court concluded, among other things, that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actions. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The FSIA applies to conduct, like petitioners' alleged wrongdoing,

that occurred prior to the Act's 1976 enactment and even prior to the
United States' 1952 adoption of the so-called "restrictive theory" of sovereign immunity. Pp. 688-702.

(a) This Court has long deferred to Executive Branch sovereign immunity decisions. Until 1952, Executive policy was to request immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns. In that year, the State
Department began to apply the "restrictive theory," whereby immunity
is recognized with regard to a foreign state's sovereign or public acts,
but not its private acts. Although this change had little impact on federal courts, which continued to abide by the Department's immunity
suggestions, Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480,
487, the change threw immunity decisions into some disarray: Foreign
nations' diplomatic pressure sometimes prompted the Department to file

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
678 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Syllabus
suggestions of immunity in cases in which immunity would not have
been available under the restrictive theory; and when foreign nations
failed to ask the Department for immunity, the courts had to determine
whether immunity existed, so responsibility for such determinations lay
with two different branches, ibid. To remedy these problems, the
FSIA codified the restrictive principle and transferred primary responsibility for immunity determinations to the Judicial Branch. The Act
grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign
states and carves out the expropriation and other exceptions to its general grant of immunity. In any such action, the district court's subjectmatter jurisdiction depends on the applicability of one of those exceptions. Id., at 493-494. Pp. 688-691.

(b) This case is not controlled by Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511
U. S. 244. In describing the general presumption against retroactive
application of a statute, the Court there declared, inter alia, that, if a
federal law enacted after the events in suit does not expressly prescribe
its own proper reach but does operate retroactively--i. e., would impair
rights a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past
conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed--it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring
that result. Id., at 280. Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer here. None of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned above fits the FSIA's clarification of sovereign immunity law. However, the preliminary conclusion that the
FSIA does not appear to "operate retroactively" within the meaning of
Landgraf's default rule creates some tension with the Court's observation in Verlinden that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute,
but a codification of "the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of substantive federal law." 461 U. S., at 496-497
(emphasis added). And while the FSIA's preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, that statement by itself falls short of the
requisite express prescription. Thus Landgraf's default rule does not
definitively resolve this case. While Landgraf's antiretroactivity presumption aims to avoid unnecessary post hoc changes to legal rules on
which private parties relied in shaping their primary conduct, however,
foreign sovereign immunity's principal purpose is to give foreign states
and their instrumentalities some present protection from the inconvenience of suit, Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 479. In this
sui generis context, it is more appropriate, absent contraindications, to
defer to the most recent decision of the political branches on whether to
take jurisdiction, the FSIA, than to presume that decision inapplicable
merely because it postdates the conduct in question. Pp. 692-696.

Syllabus
(c) Nothing in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that it should not be applied to petitioners' 1948 actions.
Indeed, clear evidence that Congress intended it to apply to preenactment conduct lies in its preamble's statement that foreign states' immunity "[c]laims . . . should henceforth be decided by [American] courts
. . . in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter," $ 1602
(emphasis added). Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy Landgraf's
"express command" requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity "claims"--not actions protected by immunity, but
assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actions--are the relevant conduct regulated by the Act and are "henceforth" to be decided
by the courts. Thus, Congress intended courts to resolve all such
claims "in conformity with [FSIA] principles" regardless of when the
underlying conduct occurred. The FSIA's overall structure strongly
supports this conclusion: Many of its provisions unquestionably apply to
cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976, see, e. g., Dole
Food Co., supra, and its procedural provisions undoubtedly apply to all
pending cases. In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that
an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect. Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending
cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Act's principal purposes: clarifying the rules
judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims. Pp. 697-700.

(d) This holding is extremely narrow. The Court does not review the
lower courts' determination that $ 1605(a)(3) applies here, comment on
the application of the so-called "act of state" doctrine to petitioners'
alleged wrongdoing, prevent the State Department from filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction
in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity, or express
an opinion on whether deference should be granted such filings in cases
covered by the FSIA. The issue here concerns only the interpretation
of the FSIA's reach--a "pure question of statutory construction . . . well
within the province of the Judiciary." INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480

valuable works in the Gallery's collection had not been do-nated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the
Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after WorldWar II. The journalist provided some of that evidence to
respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover posses-sion of six Gustav Klimt paintings. Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatialVienna home of respondent's uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer,
a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts. Respondentclaims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by

Opinion of the Court
Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrong-ful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

The defendants (petitioners here)--the Republic of Aus-tria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality
of the Republic--filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as-serting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity. The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317
F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003). Wegranted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28U. S. C. $ 1602

et seq., which grants foreign states immunityfrom the jurisdiction of federal and state courts but expressly exempts certain cases, including "case[s] . . . in whichrights in property taken in violation of international law are
in issue," $ 1605(a)(3), applies to claims that, like respond-ent's, are based on conduct that occurred before the Act's
enactment, and even before the United States adopted theso-called "restrictive theory" of sovereign immunity in 1952.
539 U. S. 987 (2003). I

Because this case comes to us from the denial of a motionto dismiss on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the following facts alleged in respondent's complaint.Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germanyin 1938. She settled in California in 1942 and became an
American citizen in 1945. She is a niece, and the sole sur-viving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in
Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate,
maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, wherethe six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were
housed. His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paint-ings. She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she "ask[ed]"
her husband "after his death" to bequeath the paintings to

Opinion of the Court
the Gallery.1 App. 187a, || 81. The attorney for her estateadvised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with

his wife's request, but that he was not legally obligated todo so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings. Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownershipof any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery. He remained
their sole legitimate owner until his death. His will be-queathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and
a nephew.On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the "Anschluss," the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria. Fer-dinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist
annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimatelysettling in Zurich. In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis "Aryanized" the sugar company he had di-rected, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many othervaluable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection. A
Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fu" hrer, took possession of the sixKlimts. He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

2 and a third in

1943, kept one for himself, and sold another to the Museumof the City of Vienna. The immediate fate of the sixth is

not known. 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1193.In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions
motivated by Nazi ideology null and void. This did not re-sult in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian

1 Adele's will mentions six Klimt paintings, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele
Bloch-Bauer II, Apple Tree I, Beechwood, Houses in Unterach am Attersee, and Schloss Kammer am Attersee III. The last of these, Schloss
Kammer am Attersee III, is not at issue in this case because Ferdinand

law proscribed export of "artworks . . . deemed to be important to [the country's] cultural heritage" and required anyone
wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency. App. 168a, || 32. Seeking
to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal
Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of "forc[ing]
Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery]
in exchange for export permits for other works." Id., at
168a, || 33.

The next year Robert Bentley, respondent's brother and
fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch,
to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during
the war. In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery
requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from
Dr. Fu" hrer. A Gallery representative responded, asserting--falsely, according to the complaint--that Adele had bequeathed the paintings to the Gallery, and the Gallery had
merely permitted Ferdinand to retain them during his lifetime. Id., at 170a, || 40.

Later the same year Dr. Rinesch enlisted the support of
Gallery officials to obtain export permits for many of Ferdinand's remaining works of art. In exchange, Dr. Rinesch,
purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs,
signed a document "acknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinand's declaration that in the event of his death he wished to
follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate" the Klimt
paintings to the Gallery. Id., at 177a, || 56. In addition,
Dr. Rinesch assisted the Gallery in obtaining both the painting Dr. Fu" hrer had kept for himself and the one he had sold
to the Museum of the City of Vienna.3 At no time during
these transactions, however, did Dr. Rinesch have respondent's permission either "to negotiate on her behalf or to allow

the [Gallery] to obtain the Klimt paintings." Id., at 178a,
|| 61.

In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallery's files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery
officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact,
donated the six Klimts to the Gallery. The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimt's first portrait of Adele, "which all the
[Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to
the museum in 1936," had actually been received in 1941,
accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fu" hrer signed " `Heil Hitler.' " Id., at 181a, || 67.

In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new
restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange
for export permits could reclaim their property. Respondent--who had believed, prior to the journalist's investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had "freely donated" the
Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war--immediately
sought recovery of the paintings and other artworks under
the new law. Id., at 178a-179a, || 61, 182a. A committee of
Austrian Government officials and art historians agreed to
return certain Klimt drawings and porcelain settings that
the family had donated in 1948. After what the complaint
terms a "sham" proceeding, however, the committee declined
to return the six paintings, concluding, based on an allegedly
purposeful misreading of Adele's will, that her precatory request had created a binding legal obligation that required
her husband to donate the paintings to the Gallery on his
death. Id., at 185a.

Respondent then announced that she would file a lawsuit
in Austria to recover the paintings. Because Austrian court
costs are proportional to the value of the recovery sought
(and in this case would total several million dollars, an
amount far beyond respondent's means), she requested a

voluntarily dismissed her suit and filed this action in theUnited States District Court for the Central District of
California. II

Respondent's complaint advances eight causes of actionand alleges violations of Austrian, international, and California law.4 It asserts jurisdiction under $ 2 of the FSIA,which grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states "as to any claim for relief in per-sonam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled
to immunity" under either another provision of the FSIAor "any applicable international agreement." 28 U. S. C.

$ 1330(a). The complaint further asserts that petitioners arenot entitled to immunity under the FSIA because the Act's
"expropriation exception," $ 1605(a)(3), expressly exemptsfrom immunity all cases involving "rights in property taken
in violation of international law," provided the property hasa commercial connection to the United States or the agency

4 As the District Court described these claims:
"[Respondent's] first cause of action is for declaratory relief pursuant to
28 U. S. C. $ 2201; [she] seeks a declaration that the Klimt paintings should
be returned pursuant to the 1998 Austrian law. [Her] second cause of
action is for replevin, presumably under California law; [she] seeks return
of the paintings. [Her] third cause of action seeks rescission of any agreements by the Austrian lawyer with the Gallery or the Federal Monument
Agency due to mistake, duress, and/or lack of authorization. [Her] fourth
cause of action seeks damages for expropriation and conversion, and her
fifth cause of action seeks damages for violation of international law.
[Her] sixth cause of action seeks imposition of a constructive trust, and
her seventh cause of action seeks restitution based on unjust enrichment.
Finally, [her] eighth cause of action seeks disgorgement of profits under
the California Unfair Business Practices law." Id., at 1197.

Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss raising several de-fenses including a claim of sovereign immunity.

6 Their

immunity argument proceeded in two steps. First, theyclaimed that as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place, they would have enjoyed absolute immu-nity from suit in United States courts.

7 Proceeding from

this premise, petitioners next contended that nothing inthe FSIA should be understood to divest them of that immunity retroactively.The District Court rejected this argument, concluding
both that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actionsand that the Act's expropriation exception extends to re5 The provision reads:
"(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of
the United States or of the States in any case--. . . . .

"(3) in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are
in issue and that property or any property exchanged for such property
is present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity
carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or that property or
any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an
agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States."

6 Petitioners claimed (1) "they are immune from suit under the doctrine

of sovereign immunity," and the FSIA, 28 U. S. C. $$ 1602-1611, "does not
strip them of this immunity"; (2) the District Court "should decline to
exercise jurisdiction . . . under the doctrine of forum non conveniens";
(3) respondent "fail[ed] to join indispensable parties under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 19"; and (4) venue in the Central District of California is improper. 142
F. Supp. 2d, at 1197.

7 As the District Court noted, id., at 1201, n. 16, respondent alleges that

petitioners' wrongdoing continued well past 1948 in the form of concealment of the paintings' true provenance and deliberate misinterpretation
of Adele's will. Because we conclude that the FSIA may be applied to
petitioners' 1948 actions, we need not address the District Court's alternative suggestion that petitioners' subsequent alleged wrongdoing would be
sufficient, in and of itself, to establish jurisdiction.

spondent's specific claims. Only the former conclusion con-cerns us here. Presuming that our decision in Landgraf v.

USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994), governed its retro-activity analysis, the court "first consider[ed] whether Congress expressly stated the [FSIA's] reach." 142 F. Supp. 2d,at 1199. Finding no such statement, the court then asked
whether application of the Act to petitioners' 1948 actions"would impair rights [petitioners] possessed when [they]
acted, impose new duties on [them], or increase [their] liabil-ity for past conduct."

Ibid. Because it deemed the FSIA"a jurisdictional statute that does not alter substantive legal

rights," the court answered this second question in the nega-tive and accordingly found the Act controlling. Id., at 1201.
As further support for this finding, the court noted that theFSIA itself provides that " `[c]laims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the UnitedStates . . . in conformity with the principles set forth in this
chapter.' " Ibid. (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 1602) (emphasis inDistrict Court opinion). In the court's view, this language
suggests the Act "is to be applied to all cases decided afterits enactment regardless of when the plaintiff 's cause of action may have accrued." 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1201.The Court of Appeals agreed that the FSIA applies to this
case.8 Rather than endorsing the District Court's relianceon the Act's jurisdictional nature, however, the panel reasoned that applying the FSIA to Austria's alleged wrongdo-ing was not impermissibly retroactive because Austria could
not legitimately have expected to receive immunity for thatwrongdoing even in 1948 when it occurred. The court
rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts'then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that

Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Schooner Exchange v.
McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), is generally viewed as the
source of our foreign sovereign immunity jurisprudence. In
that case, the libellants claimed to be the rightful owners of
a French ship that had taken refuge in the port of Philadelphia. The Court first emphasized that the jurisdiction of
the United States over persons and property within its territory "is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself,"
and thus foreign sovereigns have no right to immunity in
our courts. Id., at 136. Chief Justice Marshall went on to
explain, however, that as a matter of comity, members of the
international community had implicitly agreed to waive the
exercise of jurisdiction over other sovereigns in certain
classes of cases, such as those involving foreign ministers or
the person of the sovereign.9 Accepting a suggestion advanced by the Executive Branch, see id., at 134, the Chief
Justice concluded that the implied waiver theory also served
to exempt the Schooner Exchange--"a national armed ves9 "Th[e] perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and
th[e] common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other, have given rise to a class of cases
in which every sovereign is understood to wave [sic] the exercise of a part
of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to
be the attribute of every nation." Schooner Exchange, 7 Cranch, at 137.

courts' jurisdiction. Id., at 145-146.10

In accordance with Chief Justice Marshall's observation
that foreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and
comity rather than a constitutional requirement, this Court
has "consistently . . . deferred to the decisions of the political
branches--in particular, those of the Executive Branch--on
whether to take jurisdiction" over particular actions against
foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities. Verlinden

of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 33-36 (1945)). Until
1952 the Executive Branch followed a policy of requesting
immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns. 461

concluded that "immunity should no longer be granted in certain types of cases." 11 App. A to Brief for Petitioners 1a.

Adviser for the Secretary of State, Jack B. Tate, explained

10 Chief Justice Marshall noted, however, that the outcome might well
be different if the case involved a sovereign's private property:

"Without indicating any opinion on this question, it may safely be affirmed, that there is a manifest distinction between the private property
of the person who happens to be a prince, and that military force which
supports the sovereign power, and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation. A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign
country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the
territorial jurisdiction; he may be considered as so far laying down the
prince, and assuming the character of a private individual; but this he
cannot be presumed to do with respect to any portion of that armed force,
which upholds his crown, and the nation he is entrusted to govern." Id.,
at 145.

Opinion of the Court
that the Department would thereafter apply the "restrictivetheory" of sovereign immunity:

"A study of the law of sovereign immunity reveals theexistence of two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established. Accord-ing to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, bemade a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.
According to the newer or restrictive theory of sover-eign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) of a state, but not with respect to private acts (juregestionis). . . . [I]t will hereafter be the Department's

policy to follow the restrictive theory . . . in the consider-ation of requests of foreign governments for a grant of
sovereign immunity." Id., at 1a, 4a-5a.
As we explained in our unanimous opinion in Verlinden,the change in State Department policy wrought by the "Tate

Letter" had little, if any, impact on federal courts' approachto immunity analyses: "As in the past, initial responsibility
for deciding questions of sovereign immunity fell primarilyupon the Executive acting through the State Department,"
and courts continued to "abid[e] by" that Department's" `suggestions of immunity.' " 461 U. S., at 487. The change
did, however, throw immunity determinations into some dis-array, as "foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure
on the State Department," and political considerations some-times led the Department to file "suggestions of immunity in
cases where immunity would not have been available underthe restrictive theory."

Id., at 487-488. Complicating mat-ters further, when foreign nations failed to request immunity

from the State Department:

"[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determinewhether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . . Thus,

sovereign immunity determinations were made in twodifferent branches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic considerations. Not surpris-ingly, the governing standards were neither clear nor
uniformly applied." Ibid.
In 1976 Congress sought to remedy these problems byenacting the FSIA, a comprehensive statute containing a

"set of legal standards governing claims of immunity inevery civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities." Id., at 488. TheAct "codifies, as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity," ibid., and transfers primary re-sponsibility for immunity determinations from the Executive
to the Judicial Branch. The preamble states that "hence-forth" both federal and state courts should decide claims of
sovereign immunity in conformity with the Act's principles.28 U. S. C. $ 1602.

The Act itself grants federal courts jurisdiction over civilactions against foreign states, $ 1330(a),

to which a state's property may be subject to attachment orexecution, $$ 1609-1611. Finally, the Act carves out certain
exceptions to its general grant of immunity, including theexpropriation exception on which respondent's complaint relies. See supra, at 685-686, and n. 5. These exceptions arecentral to the Act's functioning: "At the threshold of every
action in a district court against a foreign state, . . . the courtmust satisfy itself that one of the exceptions applies," as
"subject-matter jurisdiction in any such action depends" onthat application.

Opinion of the Court

IV
The District Court agreed with respondent that theFSIA's expropriation exception covers petitioners' alleged

wrongdoing, 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1202, and the Court of Ap-peals affirmed that holding, 317 F. 3d, at 967-969, 974. As
noted above, however, we declined to review this aspect ofthe courts' opinions, confining our grant of certiorari to the
issue of the FSIA's general applicability to conduct that oc-curred prior to the Act's 1976 enactment, and more specifically, prior to the State Department's 1952 adoption of therestrictive theory of sovereign immunity. See

supra, at 681,687-688, and n. 8. We begin our analysis of that issue by

explaining why, contrary to the assumption of the DistrictCourt, 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1199-1201, and Court of Appeals,
317 F. 3d, at 963-967, the default rule announced in our opin-ion in

Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994),does not control the outcome in this case.

In Landgraf we considered whether $ 102 of the CivilRights Act of 1991, which permits a party to seek compensatory and punitive damages for certain types of intentionalemployment discrimination, Rev. Stat. $ 1977A, as added, 105
Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a), and to demand a jury trialif such damages are sought, $ 1981a(c), applied to an employment discrimination case that was pending on appeal whenthe statute was enacted. The issue forced us to confront the
" `apparent tension' " between our rule that " `a court is toapply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,' "
511 U. S., at 264 (quoting Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond,416 U. S. 696, 711 (1974)), and the seemingly contrary "axiom
that `[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law' " and thus that" `congressional enactments . . . will not be construed to have
retroactive effect unless their language requires this re-sult,' " 511 U. S., at 264 (quoting

Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988)).

Acknowledging that, in most cases, the antiretroactivitypresumption is just that--a presumption, rather than a con541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stitutional command 13--we examined the rationales thatsupport it. We noted, for example, that "[t]he Legislature's

. . . responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that itmay be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of
retribution against unpopular groups or individuals," Land-graf, 511 U. S., at 266, and that retroactive statutes may
upset settled expectations by " `tak[ing] away or impair[ing]vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat[ing] a
new obligation, impos[ing] a new duty, or attach[ing] a newdisability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past,' " id., at 269 (quoting Society for Propagation of
the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814) (Story, J.)). We further observed that these antiretroactivity concerns are most pressing in cases involving"new provisions affecting contractual or property rights,
matters in which predictability and stability are of primeimportance." 511 U. S., at 271.

In contrast, we sanctioned the application to all pendingand future cases of "intervening" statutes that merely "confe[r] or ous[t] jurisdiction." Id., at 274. Such application,we stated, "usually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case." Ibid. (in-ternal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, the "diminished
reliance interests in matters of procedure" permit courts toapply changes in procedural rules "in suits arising before
[the rules'] enactment without raising concerns about retro-activity."

Id., at 275.Balancing these competing concerns, we described the presumption against retroactive application in the followingterms:

"When a case implicates a federal statute enacted afterthe events in suit, the court's first task is to determine
13 But see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 266-268 (identifying several constitutional provisions that express the antiretroactivity principle, including the

Attainder," Art. I, $$ 9-10).

Opinion of the Court
whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute'sproper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there

is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When,however, the statute contains no such express command
the court must determine whether the new statutewould have retroactive effect, i. e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase aparty's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties
with respect to transactions already completed. If thestatute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clearcongressional intent favoring such a result."

Id., at280.
14

Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does notprovide a clear answer in this case. Although the FSIA's
preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct,see infra, at 697-698, that statement by itself falls short of
an "expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statute's proper reach."Under Landgraf, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether
the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be imper-missibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or
addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be ap-plied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying
conduct occurred). But the FSIA defies such categoriza-tion. To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIA's clarification of the law of sovereign immunity. Prior to 1976foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter

of comity, United States courts would grant them immunityfor their public acts (provided the State Department did not
recommend otherwise), but they had no "right" to such im14 Applying this rule to the question in the case, we concluded that $ 102
of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 should not apply to cases arising before its
enactment. 511 U. S., at 293.

munity. Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United Statescourts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign

states; the Act neither "increase[s those states'] liability forpast conduct" nor "impose[s] new duties with respect to
transactions already completed." 511 U. S., at 280. Thus,the Act does not at first appear to "operate retroactively"
within the meaning of the Landgraf default rule.That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in Verlinden that the FSIA is notsimply a jurisdictional statute "concern[ing] access to the
federal courts" but a codification of "the standards governingforeign sovereign immunity as an aspect of

substantive fed-eral law." 461 U. S., at 496-497 (emphasis added). Moreover, we noted in Verlinden that in any suit against a foreignsovereign, "the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim
in any court in the United States" unless one of the FSIA'sexceptions applies, id., at 497 (emphasis added), and we have
stated elsewhere that statutes that "creat[e] jurisdiction"where none otherwise exists "spea[k] not just to the power
of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the par-ties as well,"

Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel.Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951 (1997) (emphasis in original).

Such statutes, we continued, "even though phrased in `juris-dictional' terms, [are] as much subject to our presumption
against retroactivity as any other[s]." Ibid.15

15 Of course, the FSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in
Hughes Aircraft. That amendment was attached to the statute that created the cause of action, see former 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(1) (1982 ed.), 96
Stat. 978; 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(1), 100 Stat. 3154, and it prescribed a limitation that any court entertaining the cause of action was bound to apply,
see $ 3730(e)(4)(A), 100 Stat. 3157. When a "jurisdictional" limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashion--when it applies by its terms
regardless of where the claim is brought--the limitation is essentially substantive. In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal
and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns. The Act
does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit

Thus, Landgraf 's default rule does not definitively resolvethis case. In our view, however, Landgraf 's antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involv-ing private rights, is most helpful in that context. Cf. 511
U. S., at 271, n. 25 ("[T]he great majority of our decisionsrelying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties").The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary

post hocchanges to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping

their primary conduct. But the principal purpose of foreignsovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states
and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in relianceon the promise of future immunity from suit in United States
courts. Rather, such immunity reflects current political re-alities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and
their instrumentalities some present "protection from the in-convenience of suit as a gesture of comity." Dole Food Co.
v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 479 (2003). Throughout history,courts have resolved questions of foreign sovereign immunity by deferring to the "decisions of the political branches. . . on whether to take jurisdiction."

Verlinden, 461 U. S.,at 486. In this sui generis context, we think it more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recentsuch decision--namely, the FSIA--than to presume that decision inapplicable merely because it postdates the conductin question.

foreign countries' decisions about what claims against which defendants
their courts will entertain.

Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes
Aircraft, the FSIA "create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before,"
post, at 723 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), however, that characteristic is in
some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act. This tension, in turn, renders the Landgraf approach inconclusive and requires us
to examine the entire statute in light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivity jurisprudence.

16 Between 1952 and 1976 courts and the State Department similarly

presumed that the Tate Letter was applicable even in disputes concerning
conduct that predated the letter. See, e. g., National City Bank of N. Y.

Opinion of the Court

V
This leaves only the question whether anything in theFSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that we should not apply it to petitioners' 1948 actions.Not only do we answer this question in the negative, but we
find clear evidence that Congress intended the Act to applyto preenactment conduct.

To begin with, the preamble of the FSIA expresses Con-gress' understanding that the Act would apply to all postenactment claims of sovereign immunity. That sectionprovides:

"Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforthbe decided by courts of the United States and of the
States in conformity with the principles set forth in thischapter." 28 U. S. C. $ 1602 (emphasis added).

Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy Landgraf 's "expresscommand" requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is
unambiguous: Immunity "claims"--not actions protected byimmunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from
those actions--are the relevant conduct regulated by theAct;

17 those claims are "henceforth" to be decided by the

courts. As the District Court observed, see supra, at 687(citing 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1201), this language suggests Conv. Republic of China, 348 U. S. 356, 361 (1955) (assuming, in dicta, that the
Tate Letter would govern the sovereign immunity analysis in a dispute
concerning treasury notes purchased in 1920 and 1947-1948).

17 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated

by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:

"The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects `vested
rights,' or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant
activity that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement otherwise, only
such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute
is covered. Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and
hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before
their effective date. But other statutes have a different purpose and
therefore a different relevant retroactivity event." 511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

698 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Opinion of the Court
gress intended courts to resolve all such claims "in conform-ity with the principles set forth" in the Act, regardless of

when the underlying conduct occurred.18The FSIA's overall structure strongly supports this conclusion. Many of the Act's provisions unquestionably applyto cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976. In
Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468 (2003), for exam-ple, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an "instrumentality" of a "foreign state" for purposes of the FSIA'sgrant of immunity depends on the relationship between the
entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather thanwhen the conduct occurred. In addition,

Verlinden, whichupheld against constitutional challenge 28 U. S. C. $ 1330's

grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute overa contract that predated the Act. 461 U. S., at 482-483, 497.
And there has never been any doubt that the Act's proce-dural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and
attachment apply to all pending cases. Thus, the FSIA'spreamble indicates that it applies "henceforth," and its body
includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply toclaims based on pre-1976 conduct. In this context, it would
be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such asthe expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of
purely prospective application absent any statutory languageto that effect.

18 The dissent is quite right that " `[a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it
has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.' " Post,
at 719. The provision of the FSIA to which this observation applies, however, is not the preamble but $ 8, which states that the "Act shall take
effect ninety days after the date of its enactment." 90 Stat. 2898, note
following 28 U. S. C. $ 1602. The office of the word "henceforth" is to
make the statute effective with respect to claims to immunity thereafter
asserted. Notably, any such claim asserted immediately after the statute
became effective would necessarily have related to conduct that took place
at an earlier date.

Opinion of the Court
Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardlessof when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent

with two of the Act's principal purposes: clarifying the rulesthat judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity
claims and eliminating political participation in the reso-lution of such claims. We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive
framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:

"We think that the text and structure of the FSIA dem-onstrate Congress' intention that the FSIA be the sole

basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state inour courts. Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem:

$ 1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state is entitled to immunity,and $ 1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to

hear suits brought by United States citizens and byaliens when a foreign state is

not entitled to immunity.
As we said in Verlinden, the FSIA `must be applied bythe district courts in every action against a foreign sovereign, since subject-matter jurisdiction in any such action depends on the existence of one of the specified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.' " Argentine
Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.
428, 434-435 (1989) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 493).

The Amerada Hess respondents' claims concerned conduct
that postdated the FSIA, so we had no occasion to consider
the Act's retroactivity. Nevertheless, our observations
about the FSIA's inclusiveness are relevant in this case:
Quite obviously, Congress' purposes in enacting such a comprehensive jurisdictional scheme would be frustrated if,
in postenactment cases concerning preenactment conduct,
courts were to continue to follow the same ambiguous and
politically charged " `standards' " that the FSIA replaced.
See supra, at 691 (quoting Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487-488).

700 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Opinion of the Court
We do not endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.Indeed, we think it engaged in precisely the kind of detailed

historical inquiry that the FSIA's clear guidelines were in-tended to obviate. Nevertheless, we affirm the panel's judgment because the Act, freed from Landgraf 's antiretroactiv-ity presumption, clearly applies to conduct, like petitioners'
alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to 1976 and, for thatmatter, prior to 1952 when the State Department adopted
the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.19

VI
We conclude by emphasizing the narrowness of this hold-ing. To begin with, although the District Court and Court

of Appeals determined that $ 1605(a)(3) covers this case, wedeclined to review that determination. See supra, at 681,
687-688, and n. 8. Nor do we have occasion to comment onthe application of the so-called "act of state" doctrine to petitioners' alleged wrongdoing. Unlike a claim of sovereignimmunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the
act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substan-tive defense on the merits. Under that doctrine, the courts
of one state will not question the validity of public acts (actsjure imperii) performed by other sovereigns within their
own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction overa controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to
challenge those acts.20 See Underhill v. Hernandez, 168U. S. 250, 252 (1897);

Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,376 U. S. 398, 401 (1964) ("The act of state doctrine in its

19 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked
the first shift in foreign states' expectations concerning the scope of their
immunity. Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraftype analysis of foreign states' settled expectations at various times prior
to the FSIA's enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

20 Under the doctrine, redress of grievances arising from such acts must

be obtained through diplomatic channels.

Opinion of the Court
traditional formulation precludes the courts of this countryfrom inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own ter-ritory"). Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriationsare public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA,
sovereigns expected immunity. Brief for Petitioners 18-20.Applying the FSIA in this case would upset that settled expectation, petitioners argue, and thus the Act "would operateretroactively" under

Landgraf. 511 U. S., at 280. But be-cause the FSIA in no way affects application of the act of

state doctrine, our determination that the Act applies in thiscase in no way affects any argument petitioners may have
that the doctrine shields their alleged wrongdoing.Finally, while we reject the United States' recommendation to bar application of the FSIA to claims based on pre-enactment conduct, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, nothing in our holding prevents the State Departmentfrom filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicatingforeign sovereign immunity.

21 The issue now before us, to

which the Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae isaddressed, concerns interpretation of the FSIA's reach--a

"pure question of statutory construction . . . well within theprovince of the Judiciary."

INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480U. S. 421, 446, 448 (1987). While the United States' views

on such an issue are of considerable interest to the Court,they merit no special deference. See, e. g., ibid. In con21 See, e. g., Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 305 F. 3d 1249, 1251-

trast, should the State Department choose to express itsopinion on the implications of exercising jurisdiction over

particular petitioners in connection with their alleged con-duct,

22 that opinion might well be entitled to deference as the

considered judgment of the Executive on a particular ques-tion of foreign policy.

23 See, e. g., Verlinden, 461 U. S., at

486; American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414(2003) (discussing the President's " `vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations' "). We expressno opinion on the question whether such deference should be
granted in cases covered by the FSIA.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, but add a few thoughts ofmy own.

22 We note that the United States Government has apparently indicated
to the Austrian Federal Government that it will not file a statement of
interest in this case. App. 243a (Letter from Hans Winkler, Legal Adviser, Austrian Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to Deputy Secretary
of the Treasury Stuart E. Eizenstat (Jan. 17, 2001)). The enforceability
of that indication, of course, is not before us.

23 Mislabeling this observation a "constitutional conclusion," the dissent

suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a party's assertion
of sovereign immunity will result in "[u]ncertain prospective application
of our foreign sovereign immunity law." Post, at 734, 737. We do not
hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIA's more neutral principles; we merely note
that the Executive's views on questions within its area of expertise merit
greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional
enactment. Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which
requires that courts apply the FSIA's sovereign immunity rules in all
cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law
than the dissent's approach, which would require, for cases concerning
pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the
time of the offending conduct--including analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

Scalia, J., concurring
In Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 292(1994) (opinion concurring in judgments, joined by

Kennedy
and Thomas, JJ.), I noted our "consistent practice of givingimmediate effect to statutes that alter a court's jurisdiction."

I explained this on the ground that "the purpose of provi-sions conferring or eliminating jurisdiction is to permit or
forbid the exercise of judicial power" rather than to regulate
primary conduct, so that the relevant time for purposes ofretroactivity analysis is not when the underlying conduct occurred, but when judicial power was invoked. Id., at 293.Thus, application of a new jurisdictional statute to cases filed
after its enactment is not "retroactive" even if the conduct
sued upon predates the statute. Ibid. I noted that this
rule applied even when the effect of a jurisdiction-restricting
statute in a particular case is to "deny a litigant a forum for
his claim entirely, or [to] leave him with an alternate forum
that will deny relief for some collateral reason." Id., at 292-
293 (citations omitted). The logical corollary of this last
statement is that a jurisdiction-expanding statute should be
applied to subsequent cases even if it sometimes has the effect of creating a forum where none existed.

The dissent rejects this approach and instead undertakes
a case-specific inquiry into whether United States courts
would have asserted jurisdiction at the time of the underlying conduct. Post, at 720-728 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). It
justifies this approach on the basis of Hughes Aircraft Co.
v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939 (1997). For
reasons noted by the Court, see ante, at 695-696, n. 15,
I think reliance on that case is mistaken. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), and the regime that
it replaced, do not by their own force create or modify substantive rights; respondent's substantive claims are based
primarily on California law, see ante, at 685, n. 4. Federal
sovereign-immunity law limits the jurisdiction of federal and
state courts to entertain those claims, see 28 U. S. C. $$ 1604-
1605, but not respondent's right to seek redress elsewhere.

It is true enough that, as to a claim that no foreign courtwould entertain, the FSIA can have the accidental effect of

rendering enforceable what was previously unenforceable.But unlike a Hughes Aircraft-type statute, which confers or
limits "jurisdiction" in every court where the claim might bebrought, the FSIA affects substantive rights only accidentally, and not as a necessary and intended consequence ofthe law. Statutes like the FSIA do not "

spea[k] . . . to thesubstantive rights of the parties," Hughes Aircraft, supra,

at 951 (emphasis added), even if they happen sometimes toaffect them.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter joins,concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and judgment, but I would restthat judgment upon several additional considerations.

I
A

For present purposes I assume the following:1. Adele Bloch-Bauer died in Vienna in 1925. Her will

asked her husband Ferdinand " `kindly' " to donate, "upon hisdeath," six Klimt paintings to the Austrian Gallery (Gallery).
A year later, Ferdinand "formally assured the Austrian pro-bate court that he would honor his wife's gift." See

ante,at 682; 317 F. 3d 954, 959 (CA9 2002); 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187,

1192-1193 (CD Cal. 2001); Brief for Petitioners 6.2. When the Nazis seized power in Austria in 1938, Ferdinand fled to Switzerland. The Nazis took over Bloch-Bauerassets, and a Nazi lawyer, Dr. Fu" hrer, liquidated Ferdinand's
estate. Dr. Fu" hrer disposed of five of the six Klimt paint-ings as follows: He sold or gave three to the Gallery; he sold
one to the Museum of the City of Vienna; and he kept one.(The sixth somehow ended up in the hands of a private collector who gave it to the Gallery in 1988.) See ante, at 682,683, n. 3; 317 F. 3d, at 959-960.

705Cite as: 541 U. S. 677 (2004)
Breyer, J., concurring
3. Ferdinand died in Switzerland in 1945. His will did notmention the paintings, but it did name a residuary legatee,

namely, Ferdinand's niece, Maria Altmann, by then an Amer-ican citizen. As a residuary legatee Altmann received Ferdinand's rights to the paintings. See ante, at 681; 317 F. 3d,at 960, 968; Brief for Petitioners 6-7.

4. In 1948, Bloch-Bauer family members, including Altmann, asked Austria to return a large number of family art-works. At that time Austrian law prohibited export of "artworks . . . deemed to be important to Austria's culturalheritage." But Austria granted Altmann permission to export some works of art in return for Altmann's recognition,
in a legal agreement, of Gallery ownership of the five Klimt
paintings. (The Gallery already had three, the Museum of
the City of Vienna transferred the fourth, and the BlochBauer family, having recovered the fifth, which Dr. Fu" hrer
had kept, donated it to the Gallery.) See ante, at 683; 317
F. 3d, at 960; 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1193-1195; Brief for Petitioners 6-8; App. 168a.

5. Fifty years later, newspaper stories suggested that in
1948 the Gallery had followed a policy of asserting ownership
of Nazi-looted works of art that it did not own. Austria then
enacted a restitution statute allowing individuals to reclaim
properties that were subject to any such false assertion of
ownership or coerced donation in exchange for export permits. The statute also created an advisory board to determine the validity of restitution claims. See ante, at 684; 142
F. Supp. 2d, at 1195-1196; Brief for Petitioners 8.

6. In 1999, Altmann brought claims for restitution of several items including the five Klimt paintings. She told the
advisory board that, in 1948, her lawyer had wrongly told
her that the Gallery owned the five Klimt paintings irrespective of Nazi looting (title flowing from Adele's will or Ferdinand's statement of donative intent to the probate court).
In her view, her 1948 agreement amounted to a coerced donation. The advisory board ordered some items returned (16

Klimt drawings and 19 porcelain settings), but found that the5 Klimt paintings belonged to the Gallery. See 317 F. 3d, at

960-962; 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1195-1196; Brief for Petitioners8, and n. 4.

7. Altmann then brought this lawsuit against the Gallery,an agency or instrumentality of the Austrian Government,
in federal court in Los Angeles. She seeks return of thefive Klimt paintings.

B
The question before us does not concern the legal validityof title passed through Nazi looting. Austria nowhere condones or bases its claim of ownership upon any such activity.Rather, its legal claim to the paintings rests upon any or all
of the following: Adele's 1925 will, Ferdinand's probate-courtconfirmation, and Altmann's 1948 agreement. Nor does the
locus of the lawsuit in Los Angeles reflect any legal deter-mination about the merits of Austrian legal procedures.
Cf. ante, at 684-685. The Court of Appeals rejected Aus-tria's forum non conveniens claim, not because of the Austrian courts' required posting of a $135,000 filing fee that ispotentially refundable, App. 229a-231a, but mainly because
of Altmann's age, 317 F. 3d, at 973-974.The sole issue before us is whether the "expropriation exception" of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976(FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(3), withdrawing an otherwise applicable sovereign immunity defense, applies to thiscase. The exception applies to "foreign state[s]" and to any
"agency or instrumentality" of a foreign state. $$ 1603,1605(a)(3). The exception deprives the entity of the sovereign immunity that the law might otherwise entitle it "in anycase," $ 1605, where that entity "is engaged in a commercial
activity in the United States" and the case is one "in whichrights in property taken in violation of international law are
in issue," $ 1605(a)(3).It is conceded that the Gallery is an "agency or instrumentality" of a foreign state, namely, the Republic of Austria.

707Cite as: 541 U. S. 677 (2004)
Breyer, J., concurring
Nor can Austria now deny that the Gallery is "engaged ina commercial activity in the United States." The lower

courts held that the Gallery's publishing and advertising ac-tivities satisfy this condition. 317 F. 3d, at 968-969; 142
F. Supp. 2d, at 1204-1205. And our grant of certiorari didnot embrace that aspect of the lower courts' decision. 539
U. S. 987 (2003); see ante, at 692.But what about the last element: Is this a "case . . . in
which rights in property taken in violation of internationallaw are in issue"? Altmann claims that Austria's 1948 actions (falsely asserting ownership of the paintings and ex-torting acknowledgment of its ownership in return for export permits) violated either customary international law ora 1907 Hague Convention. App. 203a-204a; Brief for Respondent 4, 35; Hague Convention (IV) on the Laws and Cus-toms of War on Land, 36 Stat. 2277, 2309, Art. 56 (1907) ("All
seizure of . . . works of art . . . is forbidden, and should bemade the subject of legal proceedings").

Austria replies that, even so, this part of the statute is not"retroactive." Austria means that $ 1605(a)(3), the expropriation exception, does not apply to events that occurredin 1948, almost 30 years before the FSIA's enactment. The
upshot is that if the FSIA's general rule of immunity, $ 1604,applies retroactively to events in 1948 (as is undisputed
here), but the expropriation exception, $ 1605(a)(3), does notapply retroactively, then the Gallery can successfully assert
its sovereign immunity defense, preventing Altmann frompursuing her claim.

II
The question, then, is whether the Act's expropriation ex-ception applies to takings that took place many years before

its enactment. The Court notes that Congress, when enact-ing the FSIA in 1976, wrote that the Act should "henceforth"
apply to any claim brought thereafter. $ 1602; ante, at 697.The dissent believes that there is no logical inconsistency
between an Act that applies "henceforth" and a reading of

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
708 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Breyer, J., concurring

$ 1605(a)(3) that limits it to "rights in property taken after
this Act came into force." See post, at 718-720 (opinion
of Kennedy, J.). I agree with the dissent that the word"henceforth" (and similar words) cannot resolve this disagreement by themselves. Nonetheless several additionalconsiderations convince me that the Court is correct. As
Altmann argues, Congress intended the expropriation exception to apply retroactively, removing a defense of sovereignimmunity where "rights in property" were "taken in violation of international law," irrespective of when that takingoccurred.

First, the literal language of the statute supports Altmann.
Several similar statutes and conventions limit their temporal
reach by explicitly stating, for example, that the Act does
"not apply to proceedings in respect of matters that occurred
before the date of the coming into force of this Act." State
Immunity Act 1978, $ 23(3), 10 Halsbury's Statutes 829, 845
(4th ed. 2001 reissue) (U. K.) (emphasis added); see also State
Immunity Act 1979, $ 1(2) (Singapore); Foreign States Immunities Act 1985, $ 7(1) (Austl.); European Convention on
State Immunity, Art. 35(3). The 1976 Act says nothing explicitly suggesting any such limitation.

Second, the legal concept of sovereign immunity, as traditionally applied, is about a defendant's status at the time of
suit, not about a defendant's conduct before the suit. Thus
King Farouk's sovereign status permitted him to ignore
Christian Dior's payment demand for 11 "frocks and coats"
bought (while king) for his wife; but once the king lost his
royal status, Christian Dior could sue and collect (for clothes
sold before the abdication). See Ex-King Farouk of Egypt
v. Christian Dior, 84 Clunet 717, 24 I. L. R. 228, 229 (CA
Paris 1957) (Christian Dior "is entitled . . . to bring" the
ex-King to court "to answer for debts contracted" before his
abdication "when, as from the date of his abdication, he is no
longer entitled to claim . . . immunity" as "Hea[d] of State");

of state is entitled to the same immunity as the stateitself. . . . He too loses immunity ratione personae on ceasing to be head of state"); cf. Ter K. v. The Netherlands, Surinam & Indonesia, 18 I. L. R. 223 (DC Hague 1951) (affording
Indonesia sovereign immunity after it became independent
while the suit was pending).Indeed, just last Term, we unanimously reaffirmed this

classic principle when we held that a now-private corporationcould not assert sovereign immunity, even though the events
in question took place while a foreign government was its
owner. Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 479
(2003). We added that "[f]oreign sovereign immunity" is
not about "chilling" or not chilling "foreign states or their
instrumentalities in the conduct of their business." Ibid.
(Kennedy, J.). Rather, the objective of the "sovereign immunity" doctrine (in contrast to other conduct-related immunity doctrines) is simply to give foreign states and instrumentalities "some protection," at the time of suit, "from the
inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity." Ibid.; see also
ante, at 694-695, 696. Compare conduct-related immunity
discussed in, e. g., Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 749

U. S. 800, 813 (1982) (qualified official immunity); Pinochet,
supra, at 202 (conduct-related immunity for "public acts").

Third, the State Department's and our courts' own historical practice reflects this classic view. For example, in 1952,
the Department issued the Tate Letter adopting a restrictive
view of sovereign immunity, essentially holding foreign sovereign immunity inapplicable in respect to a foreign state's
commercial activity. Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting
Legal Adviser, U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting U. S. Attorney

Accord, ante, at 696-697, n. 16; see also, e. g., Arias v. S. S.

of United States Practice in International Law 1025-1026(1977) (State Department deferred decision on a request for

Fourth, contrary to the dissent's contention, see post, at724-725, 729-730, neither "reliance" nor "expectation" can
justify nonretroactivity here. Does the dissent mean by
"reliance" and "expectation" something real, i. e., an expropriating nation's actual reliance at the time of taking that
other nations will continue to protect it from future lawsuits
by continuing to apply the same sovereign immunity doctrine? Such actual reliance could not possibly exist in fact.

What taking in violation of international norms is likely tohave been influenced, not by politics or revolution, but by

knowledge of, or speculation about, the likely future shapeof America's law of foreign sovereign immunity? To suggest any such possibility, in respect to the expropriationscarried out by the Nazi or Communist regimes, or any other
such as I am aware, would approach the realm of fantasy.
While the matter is less clear in respect to less dramatic,more individualized, takings, I still find any actual reliance

difficult to imagine.More likely, the dissent is thinking in terms of " `reasonable reliance,' " post, at 723, a legal construct designed to
protect against unfairness. But a sovereign's reliance on future immunity here would have been unreasonable, hence no
such protection is warranted. A legally aware King Farouk
or any of his counterparts would have or should have known
that foreign sovereign immunity respects current status; it
does not protect past conduct. And its application is a matter, not of legal right, but of "grace and comity." Verlinden,
supra, at 486; see also Dole, supra, at 479; supra, at 708-709.

Indeed, the dissent itself ignores "reliance" or "expectation" insofar as it assumes an expropriating nation's awareness that the Executive Branch could intervene and change
the rules, for example, by promulgating the Tate Letter and
applying it retroactively to pre-Tate Letter conduct. Compare post, at 725-726, with Brief for Petitioners 11 (Austria
expected absolute immunity in 1948), and Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 8 (same). Nor does the dissent
convincingly explain why, if the Executive Branch can
change the scope of foreign sovereign immunity with retroactive effect, Congress (with Executive Branch approval)
cannot "codify" Executive Branch efforts. H. R. Rep.

Fifth, an attempt to read into $ 1605(a)(3) a temporal quali-fication related to the time of conduct, based on a theory of

"reliance" or "expectation," creates complications and anom-alies. The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States,
proposes a solution that may, at first glance, seem simple:Choose the date of the FSIA, roughly 1976, as a cutoff date
and apply the $ 1605(a)(3) exception only to property "taken"
after that time. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11-12. But the Solicitor General himself complicates
the proposal by pointing out, correctly, that each of the dif-ferent activities described in each of the separate paragraphs

of $ 1605(a) evolved from different common-law origins and
consequently might demand a different cutoff date. Ibid.
("commercial activity exception" applies to events arising
after 1952; "waiver exception" applies to all events). Moreover, the Solicitor General's limitation on the expropriation
exception would give immunity to some entities that, before
the FSIA, might not have expected immunity at all (say, because they were not then considered "sovereign"). Compare $$ 1603-1604 with Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States $ 66(g), Comment c, and
Reporters' Note 2 (1965) (government corporations only entitled to immunity if exercising public functions); Harvard Research in International Law 483 (1932) ("The use of the term
`State' . . . results in excluding political subdivisions . . .").

The dissent's solution is even more complicated. It does
not choose a cutoff date at all, but would remand for the
lower courts to determine whether Austria's 1948 conduct
would have fallen outside the scope of sovereign immunity
under the Tate Letter's view of the matter. Post, at 727-
728. Of course, Austria in 1948 could not possibly have relied on the Tate Letter, issued four years later. But, more
importantly, consider the historical inquiry the dissent sets
for the courts: Determine in the year 2004 what the State
Department in the years 1952-1976 would have thought
about the Tate Letter as applied to the actions of an Austrian

museum taken in the year 1948. That inquiry does not onlydemand rarified historical speculation, it also threatens to

create the very kind of legal uncertainty that the FSIA'senactors hoped to put to rest. See

ante, at 699.
Sixth, other legal principles, applicable to past conduct,adequately protect any actual past reliance and adequately

prevent (in the dissent's words) "open[ing] foreign nations
worldwide to vast and potential liability for expropriationclaims in regards to conduct that occurred generations ago,

including claims that have been the subject of internationalnegotiation and agreement."

Post, at 730.
For one thing, statutes of limitations, personal jurisdiction
and venue requirements, and the doctrine of forum non conveniens will limit the number of suits brought in American
courts. See, e. g., 317 F. 3d, at 969-974; Dayton v. Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, 672 F. Supp. 7, 13 (DC 1986)
(applying statute of limitations to expropriation claim). The
number of lawsuits will be further limited if the lower courts
are correct in their consensus view that $ 1605(a)(3)'s reference to "violation of international law" does not cover expropriations of property belonging to a country's own nationals.
See 317 F. 3d, at 968; Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States $ 712 (1986) (hereinafter Restatement (3d)).

Moreover, the act of state doctrine requires American
courts to presume the validity of "an official act of a foreign
sovereign performed within its own territory." W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int'l, 493
U. S. 400, 405 (1990); see also ante, at 700-701; Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 423-424 (1964).

which, if at all, the `act of state' doctrine may be applicable."

that doctrine, but only in respect to "a confiscation or other
taking after January 1, 1959." 22 U. S. C. $ 2370(e)(2). The

State Department also has restricted the application of thisdoctrine, freeing courts to " `pass upon the validity of the

acts of Nazi officials.' " Bernstein v. N. V. NederlandscheAmerikaansche Stoomvaart-Maatschappij, 210 F. 2d 375,
375-376 (CA2 1954) (per curiam) (quoting State Departmentpress release). But that is a policy matter for the State Department to decide.

Further, the United States may enter a statement of inter-est counseling dismissal.

Ante, at 701-702; 28 U. S. C. $ 517.
Such a statement may refer, not only to sovereign immunity,but also to other grounds for dismissal, such as the presence

of superior alternative and exclusive remedies, see 22
U. S. C. $$ 1621-1645o (Foreign Claims Settlement Commission); Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 679-683 (1981)
(describing Executive settlement of claims), or the nonjusticiable nature (for that or other reasons) of the matters at
issue. See, e. g., ante, at 701, n. 21 (collecting cases); Hwang
Geum Joo v. Japan, 172 F. Supp. 2d 52, 58, 64-67 (DC 2001)
(finding claims to raise political questions that were settled
by international agreements).

Finally, a plaintiff may have to show an absence of remedies in the foreign country sufficient to compensate for any
taking. Cf. Restatement (3d) $ 713, Comment f ("Under international law, ordinarily a state is not required to consider
a claim by another state for an injury to its national until
that person has exhausted domestic remedies, unless such
remedies are clearly sham or inadequate, or their application
is unreasonably prolonged"); Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes

exhausting available postdeprivation remedies under United
States law); Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. United States,
467 U. S. 1, 10 (1984) (same). A plaintiff who chooses to litigate in this country in disregard of the postdeprivation remedies in the "expropriating" state may have trouble showing
a "tak[ing] in violation of international law." 28 U. S. C.

Because sovereign immunity traditionally concerns status,not conduct, because other legal principles are available to

set forth here and in the Court's opinion, I join the Court.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

This is an important decision for interpreting the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C.$ 1602

et seq. As the Court's careful opinion illustrates, the
case is difficult. In my respectful view, however, its decisionis incorrect.

At the outset, here is a summary of my primary concernswith the majority opinion: To reach its conclusion the Court
must weaken the reasoning and diminish the force of the rule
against the retroactivity of statutes, a rule of fairness based
on respect for expectations; the Court abruptly tells foreign
nations this important principle of American law is unavailable to them in our courts; this is so despite the fact that
treaties and agreements on the subject of expropriation have
been reached against a background of the immunity principles the Court now rejects; as if to mitigate its harsh result,
the Court adds that the Executive Branch has inherent
power to intervene in cases like this; this, however, is inconsistent with the congressional purpose and design of the
FSIA; the suggestion reintroduces, to an even greater degree than before, the same influences the FSIA sought
to eliminate from sovereign immunity determinations; the
Court's reasoning also implies a problematic answer to a
separation-of-powers question that the case does not present
and that should be avoided; the ultimate effect of the Court's
inviting foreign nations to pressure the Executive is to risk
inconsistent results for private citizens who sue, based on
changes and nuances in foreign affairs, and to add prospective instability to the most sensitive area of foreign relations.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The majority's treatment of our retroactivity principles,its rejection of the considered congressional and Executive

judgment behind the FSIA, and its questionable constitu-tional implications require this respectful dissent.

I
The FSIA's passage followed 10 years of academic and leg-islative effort to establish a consistent framework for the determination of sovereign immunity when foreign nations arehaled into our courts. See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 9
(1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). As we explained in Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480 (1983),the preceding 30 years had been marked by an emerging or

common-law regime in which courts followed the principlesset out in the letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser,
U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting U. S. Attorney General PhilipB. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull.
984-985 (1952) (hereinafter Tate Letter or Letter). Seeante, at 689-690. Even after the Tate Letter, however,
courts continued to defer to the Executive's case-specificviews on whether immunity was due. See Verlinden, supra,
at 487-488. This regime created "considerable uncertainty,"H. R. Rep., at 9, and a "troublesome" inconsistency in immunity determinations, 461 U. S., at 487. The inconsistencywas the predictable result of changes in administrations and
shifting political pressures. Congress acted to bring orderto this legal uncertainty: "[U]niformity in decision . . . is
desirable since a disparate treatment of cases involving for-eign governments may have adverse foreign relations consequences." H. R. Rep., at 13. See also id., at 7 (The "[FSIA]is urgently needed legislation"). Congress placed even
greater emphasis on the implications that inconsistency hadfor our citizens, concluding that the Act was needed to "reduc[e] the foreign policy implications of immunity determina-tions and assur[e] litigants that these often crucial decisions
are made on purely legal grounds and under procedures thatinsure due process." Ibid.

There is no dispute that Congress enacted the FSIA to
answer these problems, for the Act's purpose is codified
along with its governing provisions. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1602.
To this end, the Act provides specific principles by which
courts are to decide claims for foreign sovereign immunity.
See ibid. So structured, the Act sought to implement its
objectives by removing the Executive influence from the
standard determination of sovereign immunity questions.
See H. R. Rep., at 7 (under the FSIA "U. S. immunity practice would conform to the practice in virtually every other
country--where sovereign immunity decisions are made exclusively by the courts and not by a foreign affairs agency").

II

A

The question is whether the courts, by applying the statutory principles the FSIA announced, will impose a retroactive effect in a case involving conduct that occurred over 50
years ago, and nearly 30 years before the FSIA's enactment.
It is our general rule not to apply a statute if its application
will impose a retroactive effect on the litigants. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994). This is not
a rule announced for the first time in Landgraf; it is an old
and well-established principle. "It is a principle in the English common law, as ancient as the law itself, that a statute,
even of its omnipotent parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect." Dash v. Van Kleeck, 7 Johns. 477, 503 (N. Y.
1811) (Kent, C. J.); see also Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 265
("[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply
rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine
centuries older than our Republic"). The principle stems
from fundamental fairness concerns. See ibid. ("Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should
have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform
their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be
lightly disrupted").

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The single acknowledged exception to the rule against ret-roactivity is when the statute itself, by a clear statement,

requires it. See id., at 264 (" `[C]ongressional enactments. . . will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless
their language requires this result' " (quoting Bowen v.Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988))).

The FSIA does not meet this exception because it containsno clear statement requiring retroactive effect. The majority concedes this at the outset of its analysis, saying the textof the FSIA "falls short of an `expres[s] prescri[ption of] the
statute's proper reach.' " Ante, at 694 (alterations in origi-nal) (quoting

Landgraf, supra, at 280).In an awkward twist, however, the Court also maintains

that the "[Act's] language is unambiguous," ante, at 697, andthat it "suggests Congress intended courts to resolve all
[foreign sovereign immunity] claims `in conformity with theprinciples set forth' in the Act, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred," ante, at 697-698. If the statutewere in fact this clear, the exception would apply. Nothing
in our cases suggests that statutory language might be "un-ambiguous," yet still "not sufficient to satisfy

Landgraf 's `ex-press command.' " Ante, at 697. If the Court really thinks

the statute is unambiguous, it should rest on that premise.In any event, the Court's suggestion that the FSIA does
command retroactive application unambiguously is not right.The Court's interpretation of $ 1602 takes the pertinent
"henceforth" language in isolation. See ante, at 697-698.When that language instead is read in the context of the full
section, it is quite clear that it does not speak to retroactivity.The section is as follows:

"Congress finds that the determination by United Statescourts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from
the jurisdiction of such courts would serve the interestsof justice and would protect the rights of both foreign
states and litigants in United States courts. Under in-ternational law, states are not immune from the jurisdic541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may
be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial
activities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should
henceforth be decided by courts of the United States
and of the States in conformity with the principles set
forth in this [statute]."

The first two sentences in $ 1602 describe the Act's intention
to replace the former framework for sovereign immunity determinations with a new court-controlled regime. The third
sentence, which contains the "henceforth" phrase, serves to
make clear that the new regime replaces the old regime from
that point on. Compare $ 1602 ("immunity [claims] should
henceforth be decided by [American] courts . . . in conformity
with the [Act's] principles") with Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1056 (1976) (defining "henceforth" as
"from this point on"). That does not address the topic of
retroactivity.

If one of the Act's principles were that "the Act shall govern all claims, whenever filed, and involving conduct that occurred whenever in time," the provision would command retroactive application. A statement like this, however, cannot
be found in the FSIA. The statute says only that it must
be applied "henceforth." That says no more than that the
principles immediately apply from the point of the Act's effective date on, the same type of command that Landgraf
rejected as grounds for an express command of retroactive
application. Cf. 511 U. S., at 257 (analyzing a statutory provision that provided it was to " `take effect upon enactment' "). As Justice Stevens noted for the Court in that
case: "A statement that a statute will become effective on
a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has
any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."

In order for the term "henceforth" to command retroactiv-ity, it would have to be accompanied by reference to specific

proceedings or claims (i. e., specific as to when they werecommenced, if they are pending, or when they were determined). To confirm this one need only compare the FSIA'sisolated use of the term "henceforth" to those statutory provisions that have been interpreted to require retroactive ef-fect. See,

e. g., Carpenter v. Wabash R. Co., 309 U. S. 23, 27(1940) ("The statute applies to `equity receiverships of railroad corporations now . . . pending in any court of the UnitedStates' "); Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, 162 (1865) (" `all
cases of appeal . . . heretofore prosecuted and now pendingin the Supreme Court of the United States . . . may be heard
and determined by the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates' "). See also Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 255-256 (explaining that before the FSIA was enacted, another bill waspassed by Congress but vetoed by the President with "language expressly calling for [retroactive] application of manyof its provisions");

id., at 255, n. 8 (citing the following exam-ple of a provision containing an express command for retroactive applications: " `[These] sections . . . shall apply to allproceedings pending on or commenced after the date of the
enactment of this Act' "). On its own, "henceforth" does notspeak with the precision and clarity necessary to command
retroactivity.

Justice Breyer's suggestion that Congress' intention asto retroactivity can be measured by the fact that the FSIA

does not bear the same language as some other statutes andconventions Congress has authored does not change the analysis. See ante, at 708 (concurring opinion). To accept thatinterpretive approach is to abandon our usual insistence on
a clear statement. B

Because the FSIA does not exempt itself from the usualrule against retroactivity with a clear statement, our cases
require that we consider the character of the statute, and of

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the rights and liabilities it creates, to determine if its appli-cation will impose retroactive effect on the parties. See

Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280 ("When . . . the statute con-tains no such express command, the court must determine
whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i. e.,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he
acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose
new duties with respect to transactions already completed").If it does, we must refuse to apply it in that manner.

Ibid.
The essential character of the FSIA is jurisdictional. Theconclusion that it allows (or denies) jurisdiction follows from

the language of the statute. See $ 1602 (the Act involves
"the determination by United States courts of the claims of
foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such
courts"). By denying immunity in certain classes of cases--
those in the Act's succeeding provisions--the FSIA, in effect,
grants jurisdiction over those disputes. The Court as much
as admits all this, saying that "the FSIA . . . opens United
States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against
foreign states." Ante, at 695.

The statute's mechanism of establishing jurisdictional effects (i. e., either allowing jurisdiction or denying it) has important implications for the retroactivity question. On the
one hand, jurisdictional statutes, as a class, tend not to impose retroactive effect. As the Court explained in Landgraf: "Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually `takes
away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal
that is to hear the case.' Present law normally governs in
such situations because jurisdictional statutes `speak to the
power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of
the parties.' " 511 U. S., at 274 (citations omitted).

On the other hand, there is a subclass of statutes that,
though jurisdictional, do impose retroactive effect. These
are statutes that confer jurisdiction where before there was
none. That is, they altogether create jurisdiction. We explained the distinction in a unanimous opinion in Hughes

Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939,951 (1997) (citations omitted):

"Statutes merely addressing which court shall have ju-risdiction to entertain a particular cause of action can
fairly be said merely to regulate the secondary conductof litigation and not the underlying primary conduct of
the parties. Such statutes affect only where a suit maybe brought, not

whether it may be brought at all. The
1986 amendment, however, does not merely allocate ju-risdiction among forums. Rather, it

creates jurisdiction
where none previously existed; it thus speaks not justto the power of a particular court but to the substantive

rights of the parties as well. Such a statute, even
though phrased in `jurisdictional' terms, is as much sub-ject to our presumption against retroactivity as any

other."
The principles of Hughes Aircraft establish that retroac-tivity analysis of a jurisdictional statute is incomplete unless

it asks whether the provision confers jurisdiction wherethere was none before. Again, this is common ground between the majority and this dissent. The majority recognizes the import of Hughes Aircraft's holding and affirmsthat courts may not apply statutes that confer jurisdiction

over a cause of action for which no jurisdiction existed whenthe sued-upon conduct occurred. "Such statutes," the majority acknowledges, " `even though phrased in "jurisdic-tional" terms, [are] as much subject to our presumption
against retroactivity as any other[s].' " Ante, at 695 (alter-ations in original) (quoting

Hughes Aircraft, supra, at 951).
If the FSIA creates new jurisdiction, Hughes Aircraft controls and instructs us not to apply it to cases involving preenactment conduct. On the other hand, if the FSIA did not
create new jurisdiction--including where it in fact stripped
previously existing jurisdiction from the courts--we may
apply its statutory terms without fear of working any retro541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

active effect. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 342-343,
n. 3 (1997) (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by Scalia, Kennedy,
and Thomas, JJ., dissenting) ("Although in Hughes Aircraft
we recently rejected a presumption favoring retroactivity
for jurisdiction-creating statutes, nothing in Hughes disparaged our longstanding practice of applying jurisdictionousting statutes to pending cases" (citation omitted)).

C
To this point, then, I am in agreement with the Court on
certain relevant points--the FSIA does not contain a clear
retroactivity command; the statute is jurisdictional in nature; and jurisdictional statutes impose retroactive effect
when they confer jurisdiction where none before existed.
Now, however, our paths diverge. For though the majority
concedes these critical issues, it does not address the question to which they lead: Does the FSIA confer jurisdiction
where before there was none? Rather than asking that obvious question, the Court retreats to non sequitur. After
this recitation of the Hughes Aircraft rule and with no causal
reasoning from it, the Court concludes: "Thus, Landgraf 's
default rule does not definitively resolve this case." Ante,
at 696. It requires a few steps to undertake the analysis
the Court omits, but in the end the proper conclusion is that,
assuming the court on remand found immunity existed under
the pre-FSIA regime, the statute does create jurisdiction
where there was none before.

The analysis begins with 1948, when the conduct occurred.
See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321 (2001) ("[T]he judgment
whether a particular statute acts retroactively `should be
informed and guided by "familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations" ' " (quoting Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 358 (1999), in turn quoting Landgraf, supra, at 270)). The parties' expectations
were then formed by an emerging or common-law frame541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
work governing claims of foreign sovereign immunity inAmerican courts.

Parties in 1948 would have expected courts to apply thisgeneral law of foreign sovereign immunity in the future, and
so also to apply whatever rules the courts "discovered" (ifone subscribes to Blackstone's view of common law) or "created" (if one subscribes to Holmes') in the intervening time
between the party's conduct and its being subject to suit.Compare 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *68 ("[T]he only

method of proving, that this or that maxim is a rule of thecommon law, is by shewing that it hath been always the custom to observe it"), with Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10
Harv. L. Rev. 457, 466 (1897) ("Behind the logical form [of
common-law decisionmaking] lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds,
often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true,
and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding").
To conduct the analysis, then, we should ask how the jurisdictional effects the FSIA creates compare to those that
would govern were the prior regime still in force.

There is little dispute that in 1948 foreign sovereigns, and
all other litigants, understood foreign sovereign immunity
law to support three valid expectations. (1) Nations could
expect that a baseline rule of sovereign immunity would
apply. (2) They could expect that if the Executive made a
statement on the issue of sovereign immunity that would be
controlling. And (3), they could expect that they would be
able to petition the Executive for intervention on their behalf. See National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China,
348 U. S. 356, 358-361 (1955) (summing up the Court's approach to sovereign immunity questions); id., at 366-368
(Reed, J., dissenting) (summing up the same principles).

These three expectations were little different in 1976, before the FSIA was passed. The Tate Letter did announce
the policy of restrictive foreign sovereign immunity, and this
was an important doctrinal development. The policy, how541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

725Cite as: 541 U. S. 677 (2004)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
ever, was within the second expectation that the Executivecould shape the framework for foreign sovereign immunity.

Under the second category, a foreign sovereign would haveexpected its immunity to be controlled by such a statement.

The Executive's post-Tate Letter practices and a state-ment by the Court confirm this is the correct way to understand both the operation of the general law of foreign relations and the expectations it built. After the Tate Letter'sissuance, the Executive evaluated suits involving pre-Tate

Letter conduct under the Letter's new standard when deter-mining whether to submit suggestions of immunity to the
courts. The Court, likewise, seems to have understood the
Tate Letter to require this sort of application. In National
City Bank of N. Y., the Court suggested that the Letter governed in a case involving pre-1952 conduct, though careful
consideration of the question was unnecessary there. 348
U. S., at 361.

The governing weight the Tate Letter had as a statement
of Executive policy does not detract from the third expectation foreign sovereigns continued to have--that they could
petition the Executive for case-specific statements. Thus,
in National City Bank of N. Y. the Court took note that the
Government had not submitted a case-specific suggestion as
to immunity. See id., at 364 ("[O]ur State Department neither has been asked nor has it given the slightest intimation
that in its judgment allowance of counterclaims in such a
situation would embarrass friendly relations with the Republic of China").

Today, to measure a foreign sovereign's expectation of liability for conduct committed in 1948, the Court should apply
the three discussed, interlocking principles of law, which the
parties then expected. The Court of Appeals did not address the question in this necessary manner. Rather than
determining how the jurisdictional result produced by the
FSIA differs from the result a court would reach if it applied
the legal principles that governed before the enactment of

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
726 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the FSIA, the court instead asked what the Executive wouldhave done in 1948. See 317 F. 3d 954, 965 (CA9 2002) ("Determining whether the FSIA may properly be applied thusturns on the question whether Austria could legitimately expect to receive immunity from the executive branch of theUnited States"). That is not the appropriate way to measure Austria's expectations. It is an unmanageable inquiry;
and it usurps the authority the Executive, as it is constitutedtoday, has under the pre-FSIA regime. In essence, the

Court of Appeals wrongly assumed responsibility for the po-litical question, rather than confining its judgment to the
legal one.

Answering the legal question, in contrast, requires applying the principles noted above: We assume a baseline of sovereign immunity and then look to see if there is any Executive statement on the sovereign immunity issue that
displaces the presumption of immunity. There is, of course,
at least one Executive statement on the issue that displaces
the immunity presumption to some degree. It is the Tate
Letter itself. By the Tate Letter the Executive established,
as a general rule, that the doctrine of restrictive sovereign
immunity would be followed. In general, the doctrine provided immunity for suits involving public acts and denied it
for suits involving commercial or private acts. 26 Dept.
State Bull., at 984. These principles control, as the Executive has taken no case-specific position in the instant matter.
If petitioners' conduct would not be subject to suit under
the Tate Letter principles, the FSIA cannot alter that result
without imposing retroactive effect, creating new jurisdiction in American courts.

Petitioners and the United States, appearing as amicus
curiae, argue that the Tate Letter doctrine would grant immunity (i. e., deny jurisdiction) for suits involving expropriation. They say the Tate Letter rules contain no principle
that parallels $ 1605(a)(3), the FSIA's expropriation exception on which respondent relies to establish jurisdiction:

"The expropriation exception . . . was a new develop-ment in the doctrine of sovereign immunity when the

FSIA was enacted . . . . [I]n Victory Transport Inc. v.Comisaria General de Abastecimientos y Transportes,

respecting the `nationalization' of property." Brief forUnited States as

Amicus Curiae 12.

This argument may be correct in the end; but, it should benoted, the petitioners' reliance on Victory Transport Inc. v.

Comisaria General, 336 F. 2d 354 (CA2 1964), is not conclu-sive.

Victory Transport does not say that nationalizationsof property are per se exempt under the restrictive theory of

sovereign immunity. The Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit said:

"The purpose of the restrictive theory of sovereign im-munity is to try to accommodate the interest of individuals doing business with foreign governments in havingtheir legal rights determined by the courts, with the interest of foreign governments in being free to performcertain political acts without undergoing the embarrassment or hindrance of defending the propriety of suchacts before foreign courts. . . . Such [immune] acts are
generally limited to the following categories:. . . . .

"(2) legislative acts, such as nationalization." Id., atat 360 (citations omitted).

As the court's language makes clear, the pertinent categoryof exempt action is legislative action, of which nationalization was but one example. The expropriation alleged in thiscase was not a legislative act.

Petitioners can still prevail by showing that there wouldhave been no jurisdiction under the pre-FSIA governing

principles. That could be established by showing that the
conduct at issue was considered a public act under those
principles and that the principles contain no expropriation
exception similar to that codified in $ 1605(a)(3), which would
deny otherwise available immunity. We need not, and ought
not, resolve the question in the first instance. Neither the
District Court nor the Court of Appeals has yet addressed
it. The issue is complex and would benefit from more specific briefing, arguments, and consideration of the international law sources bearing upon the scope of immunity the
Tate Letter announced. I would vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings to consider the question.

D

By declaring that this statute is not subject to the usual
presumption against retroactivity, and so avoiding the critical issue in this case, the Court puts the force and the validity of our precedent in Hughes Aircraft into serious question. The Court, in rejecting the usual analysis, states
three rationales to justify its approach. The arguments neither distinguish this case from Hughes Aircraft nor suffice
to explain rejecting the rule against retroactivity.

The Court suggests the retroactivity analysis should not
apply because the rights at issue are not private rights. See
ante, at 696 ("[The] antiretroactivity presumption, while not
strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most
helpful in that context"). This is unconvincing. First, the
language from Landgraf on which the Court relies undercuts
its position. It confirms, in clear terms, that retroactivity
presumptions work equally in favor of governments. Per
Justice Stevens, the Court said:

"While the great majority of our decisions relying upon
the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties, we have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

729Cite as: 541 U. S. 677 (2004)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
obligations that fell only on the government." 511U. S., at 271, n. 25.

Even if Landgraf 's reference to private rights could beread to establish that retroactivity analysis does not strictly
protect government--and I do not see how that is possible inlight of the above-quoted language--the Landgraf passage
refers to the Federal Government. If the distinction mat-tered for retroactivity purposes, presumably it would have
been on the basis that Congress, by virtue of authoring thelegislation, is itself fully capable of protecting the Federal
Government from having its rights degraded by retroactivelaws. Private parties, it might be said, do not have the same
built-in assurance. Here, of course, the Federal Govern-ment is not a party; instead a foreign government is. Foreign governments are as vulnerable as private parties to thedisruption caused by retroactive laws. Indeed, foreign sovereigns may have less recourse than private parties to pre-vent or remedy retroactive legislation, since they cannot
hold Congress responsible through the election process.The Court's private-rights argument, therefore, does not
sustain its departure from our usual presumption againstretroactivity.

The majority tries to justify departing from our usualprinciples in a second way. It argues that the purposes of
foreign sovereign immunity are not concerned with allowing"foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their
conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity."Ante, at 696.

Justice Breyer takes the suggestion fur-ther. He argues not that foreign sovereign immunity doctrine is not concerned with reliance interests but, even fur-ther, that in fact foreign sovereigns have no reliance
interests in receiving immunity in our courts. See ante, at709-711. This reasoning overlooks the plain fact that there
are reliance interests of vast importance involved, interestssurely as important as those stemming from contract rights
between two private parties. As the Executive has made

541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
730 REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMANN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
clear to us, these interests span a range of time after theconduct, even up to the present day. See Brief for United

States as Amicus Curiae 8. For example, at stake may bepertinent treaty rights and international agreements intended to remedy the earlier conduct. These are mattersin which the negotiating parties may have acted on a likely
assumption of sovereign immunity, as defined and limited by
pre-FSIA expectations: "[The] conduct at issue [has been]extensively addressed through treaties, agreements, and

separate legislation that were all adopted against the back-ground assumption [of the pre-FSIA foreign sovereign immunity regime]." Ibid. Lurking in the Court's and Justice Breyer's contrary suggestions is the implication that
the expectations of foreign powers are minor or infrequent.
Surely that is not the case. By today's decision the Court
opens foreign nations worldwide to vast and potential liability for expropriation claims in regards to conduct that occurred generations ago, including claims that have been the
subject of international negotiation and agreement. There
are, then, reliance interests of magnitude, which support the
usual presumption against retroactivity.

In addition, the statement that the purposes of foreign
sovereign immunity have not much to do with the presumption against retroactivity carries little weight; the presumption against retroactivity has independent justification. The
Court has noted this, saying that the purposes of the underlying substantive law are not conclusive of the retroactivity
analysis. "It will frequently be true . . . that retroactive
application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more
fully. That consideration, however, is not sufficient to rebut
the presumption." Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 285-286. As a
result, diminished concerns of unfair surprise and upset expectations--even assuming they existed--do not displace the
usual presumption. That is why in Landgraf, though "concerns of unfair surprise and upsetting expectations [were]
attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimina541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tion, which ha[d] been unlawful for more than a generation,"
the Court concluded, nevertheless, that it could not give the
statute retroactive effect. Id., at 282-283, n. 35.

The Court, lastly, adds in a footnote that the "FSIA differs
from the statutory amendment at issue in Hughes Aircraft"
because in Hughes Aircraft the jurisdictional limitation
attached directly to the cause of action and so ensured that
suit could be brought only in accordance with the jurisdictional provision (and any changes to it). Ante, at 695, n. 15.
With the FSIA, in contrast, the jurisdictional limitation is
not attached to the cause of action. The result, the Court
implies, is that even if a pre-FSIA jurisdictional bar applied
in American courts, suit on the California cause of action
might still have been able to have been brought in foreign
courts, and such availability of suit would defeat retroactivity concerns. Ante, at 695-696, n. 15 ("The Act does not . . .
purport to limit foreign countries' decisions about what
claims against which defendants their courts will entertain");
see also ante, at 703 (Scalia, J., concurring). What is of
concern in the retroactivity analysis that Hughes Aircraft
sets out, however, is the internal integrity of American statutes, not of whether an American law allows suit where before none was allowed elsewhere in the world. This is unsurprising, as the task of canvassing what causes of action
foreign countries might have allowed before a new jurisdictional regime made such suits also viable in American courts
would be a most difficult task to assign American courts.

In the end, the majority turns away from our usual retroactivity analysis because "this [is a] sui generis context."
Ante, at 696. Having created a new, extra exception that
frees it from the usual analysis, it can conclude simply that
the usual rule "does not control the outcome in this case."
Ante, at 692. The implications of this holding are not entirely clear, for the new exception does not rest on any apparent principle.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
There is a stark contrast between the Court's analysis andthat of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the question. In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit, like every other Court of Appeals to have considered
the question, concluded that the FSIA must be interpretedunder the usual retroactivity principles, just like any other
statute. See 317 F. 3d 954. Accord, Hwang Geum Joo v.
Japan, 332 F. 3d 679 (CADC 2003); Carl Marks & Co. v.
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 841 F. 2d 26 (CA2 1988)
(per curiam); Jackson v. People's Republic of China, 794F. 2d 1490 (CA11 1986).

The conclusion to which the sui generis rule leads the
Court shows the rule lacks a principled basis: "[W]e think it
more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the
most recent [decision by the political branches on the foreign
sovereign immunity question]--namely, the FSIA." Ante,
at 696. The question, however, is not whether the FSIA
governs, but how to interpret the FSIA. The Court seems
to think the FSIA implicitly adopts a presumption of retroactivity, though our cases instruct just the opposite. "[I]n
Hughes Aircraft . . . we . . . rejected a presumption favoring
retroactivity for jurisdiction-creating statutes." Lindh, 521
U. S., at 342, n. 3 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., dissenting).

Justice Breyer would supplement the rationale for the
Court's deciding the case outside the bounds of our usual
mode of retroactivity analysis. He says the Court can take
this path because sovereign immunity "is about a defendant's
status at the time of suit, not about a defendant's conduct
before the suit." Ante, at 708. The argument is a variant
of that made by respondent. See Brief for Respondent 27
("Dole Food controls the result in this case"). Respondent's
argument fails, of course, because in this case the defendants'
status at the time of suit is that of the sovereign, not that
of private parties. That distinction alone makes misplaced
reliance on Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468 (2003)

Kennedy, J., dissenting
(holding that a now-private corporation could not assert sov-ereign immunity in a suit involving events that occurred

when the entity was owned by a foreign sovereign). Justice Breyer's further reasoning, however, is also unaccept-able. When jurisdictional rules are at stake, status and conduct factors will at times intersect. Most assuredly, wewould not disown the usual retroactivity principles in a case
involving a status-based jurisdictional statute that createsjurisdiction over private litigants where before there was
none simply because the creation of jurisdiction turned inpart on the status of one of the litigants.

Justice Breyer'sadditional rationale, however, has this very implication.

We should not ignore the statutory retroactivity analysisjust because the parties and the Court have failed to consider
it before. See ante, at 710 (Breyer, J., concurring) (relyingon the fact that in

Verlinden the Court applied the FSIA toa contract that predated the Act). " `[T]his Court has never

considered itself bound [by prior sub silentio holdings] whena subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.' Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974)."
Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 63, n. 4(1989) (alteration in original). Reliance on the fact that the

immunity principles were applied retroactively in thecommon-law context of the pre-FSIA regime is also irrelevant. See ante, at 709-710 (Breyer, J., concurring). Thiscase concerns the retroactive effect of enacted statutory law,
not of court decisions interpreting the common law.

III
Today's decision contains another proposition difficult tojustify and that itself does considerable damage to the FSIA.

Abandoning standard retroactivity principles, the Court at-tempts to compensate for the harsh results it reaches by
inviting case-by-case intervention by the Executive. Thisdoes serious harm to the constitutional balance between the
political branches.

The Court says that the Executive may make suggestionsof immunity regarding FSIA determinations and implies

that courts should give such suggestions deference. See
ante, at 702 ("[S]hould the State Department choose to express its opinion on the implications of exercising jurisdictionover

particular petitioners in connection with their alleged
conduct, that opinion might well be entitled to deference as
the considered judgment of the Executive" (footnote omit-ted)). That invitation would be justified if the Court recognized that the Executive's role was retrospective only, i. e.,implicated only in suits involving preenactment conduct and
only as a means for resolving the retroactivity analysis.
The law that governed before the FSIA's enactment allowed
unilateral Executive authority in that regard. The Court's
rejection of the Landgraf analysis, however, removes the
possibility of that being the basis for the invitation.

The Court instead reaches its conclusion about the Executive's role by reliance on the general constitutional principle
that the Executive has a " ` "vast share of responsibility for
the conduct of our foreign relations." ' " Ante, at 702 (quoting American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414
(2003)). This prospective constitutional conclusion, which
the Court offers almost as an aside, has fundamental implications for the future of the statute and raises serious
separation-of-powers concerns.

The question the Court seems inclined to resolve--can the
foreign affairs power of the Executive supersede a statutory
scheme set forth by Congress--is simply not presented by
the facts of this case. We would confront the question only
if the case involved postenactment conduct and if the Executive had filed a suggestion of immunity, which, by its insistence, superseded the statute's directive. Those circumstances would present a difficult question. Compare U. S.
Const., Art. II, $ 2, with Art. I, $ 1; id., $ 8, cls. 3, 9-11, 18;

enact the FSIA). See generally International Bancorp,
LLC v. Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers,
329 F. 3d 359, 367-368 (CA4 2003) (noting the complicatedintersection where the Executive's and the Legislature's foreign affairs responsibilities overlap, in a case involving for-eign trade). The separation-of-powers principles at stake
also implicate judicial independence, which is compromised
by case-by-case, selective determinations of jurisdiction bythe Executive.

The Court makes a serious mistake, in my view, to addressthe question when it is not presented. It magnifies this
error by proceeding with so little explanation, particularly
in light of the strong arguments against its conclusion. The
Solicitor General, on behalf of the Executive, agrees that the
statute "presents the sole basis for civil litigants to obtain
jurisdiction over a foreign state in United States courts."
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1. This understanding is supported by the lack of textual support for the
contrary position in the Act and by the majority's own assessment of the Act's purposes.

The Court's abrupt announcement that the FSIA may well
be subject to Executive override undermines the Act's central purpose and structure. As the Court acknowledges, before the Act, "immunity determinations [had been thrown]
into some disarray, as `foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department,' and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file `suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have
been available under the restrictive theory.' " Ante, at 690
(quoting Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487). See also supra, at
716-717. Congress intended the FSIA to replace this old
and unsatisfactory methodology of Executive decisionmaking. Ibid. The President endorsed the objective in
full, recommending the bill upon its introduction in Congress, H. R. Rep., at 6, and signing the bill into law upon its
presentment. The majority's surprising constitutional con541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

clusion suggests that the FSIA accomplished none of theseaims. The Court states that the statute's directives may

well be short circuited by the sole directive of the Executive.The Court adds a disclaimer that it "express[es] no opinion
on the question whether such deference should be granted[to the Executive] in cases covered by the FSIA."

Ante,
at 702. The disclaimer, however, is inadequate to remedy
the harm done by the invitation, for it is belied by theCourt's own terms: Executive statements "suggesting that

courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases im-plicating foreign sovereign immunity . . . might well be entitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Executive on a particular question of foreign policy." Ante, at
701-702 (citing as an example a case in which Executive foreign policy superseded state law). Taking what the Court
says at face value, the Court does express an opinion on the
question: Its opinion is that the Executive statement may
well be entitled to deference, and so may well supersede federal law that gives courts jurisdiction.

If, as it seems, the Court seeks to free the Executive from
the dictates of enacted law because it fears that to do otherwise would consign some litigants to an unfair retroactive
application of the law, it adds illogic to the illogic of its own
creation. Only application of our traditional analysis guards
properly against unfair retroactive effect, "ensur[ing] that
Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness."
Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 268.

Where postenactment conduct is at stake, the majority's
approach promises unfortunate disruption. It promises to
reintroduce Executive intervention in foreign sovereign immunity determinations to an even greater degree than existed before the FSIA's enactment. Before the Act, foreign
nations only tended to need the Executive's protection from
the courts' jurisdiction in instances involving private acts.
The Tate Letter ensured their public acts would remain im541US2 Unit: $U54 [05-20-06 18:31:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
mune from suit, even without Executive intervention. Now,there is a potential for Executive intervention in a much

larger universe of claims. The FSIA has no public act/pri-vate act distinction with respect to certain categories of conduct, such as expropriations. Foreign nations now have in-centive to seek Executive override of the Act's jurisdictional
rules for both public and private acts in those categories ofcases.

With the FSIA, Congress tried to settle foreign sover-eigns' prospective expectations for being subject to suit in
American courts and to ensure fair and evenhanded treat-ment to our citizens who have claims against foreign sovereigns. See supra, at 716-717. This was in keeping withstrengthening the Executive's ability to secure negotiated
agreements with foreign nations against whom our citizensmay have claims. Over time, agreements of this sort have
been an important tool for the Executive. See, e. g., Agree-ment Relating to the Agreement of Oct. 24, 2000, Concerning
the Austrian Fund "Reconciliation, Peace and Cooperation,"Jan. 23, 2001, U. S.-Aus., 2001 WL 935261 (settling claims

with Poland). Uncertain prospective application of our for-eign sovereign immunity law may weaken the Executive's
ability to secure such agreements by compromising foreignsovereigns' ability to predict the liability they face in our
courts and so to assess the ultimate costs and benefits of anyagreement. See supra, at 729-730 (citing Brief for United

this one. The Court's departure from precedent should notbe overlooked. It has disregarded our "widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate," Landgraf,supra, at 272, and treated the principles discussed in Landgraf as if they describe a limited and precise rule that courtsshould apply only in particularized contexts. Our unanimous rejection of this approach in Hughes Aircraft applieshere as well:

"To the extent [the Court] contends that only statuteswith one of [Landgraf 's particularly stated] effects are
subject to our presumption against retroactivity, [it]simply misreads our opinion in

Landgraf. The lan-guage upon which [it] relies does not purport to define

the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity. Rather,our opinion in Landgraf, like that of Justice Story,
merely described that any such effect constituted asufficient, rather than a necessary, condition for invoking the presumption against retroactivity." 520 U. S.,at 947.

The Court's approach further leads to the unprecedentedconclusion that Congress' Article I power might well be insufficient to accomplish the central objective of the FSIA.The Court, in addition, injects great prospective uncertainty
into our relations with foreign sovereigns. Application ofour usual presumption against imposing retroactive effect
would leave powerful precedent intact and avoid thesedifficulties.

With respect, I dissent.

CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 02-891. Argued April 19, 2004--Decided June 7, 2004
Respondents (collectively, Heinz) are retired participants in a multiemployer pension plan (hereinafter Plan) administered by petitioner.
Heinz retired from the construction industry after accruing enough pension credits to qualify for early retirement payments under a "service
only" pension scheme that pays him the same monthly benefit he would
have received had he retired at the usual age. The Plan prohibits such
beneficiaries from certain "disqualifying employment" after they retire,
suspending monthly payments until they stop the forbidden work.
When Heinz retired, the Plan defined "disqualifying employment" to
include a job as a construction worker but not as a supervisor, the job
Heinz took. In 1998, the Plan expanded its definition to include any
construction industry job and stopped Heinz's payments when he did
not leave his supervisor's job. Heinz sued to recover the suspended
benefits, claiming that the suspension violated the "anti-cutback" rule of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which
prohibits any pension plan amendment that would reduce a participant's
"accrued benefit," ERISA $ 204(g), 29 U. S. C. $ 1054(g). The District
Court granted the Plan judgment on the pleadings, but the Seventh
Circuit reversed, holding that imposing new conditions on rights to benefits already accrued violates the anti-cutback rule.

Held: ERISA $ 204(g) prohibits a plan amendment expanding the categories of postretirement employment that triggers suspension of the payment of early retirement benefits already accrued. Pp. 743-751.

(a) The anti-cutback provision is crucial to ERISA's central object of
protecting employees' justified expectations of receiving the benefits
that they have been promised, see Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S.
882, 887. The provision prohibits plan amendments that have "the effect of . . . eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit." 29
U. S. C. $ 1054(g)(2). The question here is whether the Plan's amendment had such an effect. Although the statutory text is not as helpful
as it might be, it is clear as a matter of common sense that a benefit has
suffered under the amendment. Heinz accrued benefits under a plan
allowing him to supplement his retirement income, and he reasonably
relied on that plan's terms in planning his retirement. The 1998 amend541US2 Unit: $U55 [05-21-06 17:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
740 CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

Syllabus
ment undercut that reliance, paying benefits only if he accepted a substantial curtailment of his opportunity to do the kind of work he knew.
There is no way that, in any practical sense, this change of terms could
not be viewed as shrinking the value of Heinz's pension rights and reducing his promised benefits. Pp. 743-745.

(b) The Plan's technical responses are rejected. To give the anticutback rule the constricted reading urged by the Plan--applying it only
to amendments directly altering the monthly payment's nominal dollar
amount and not to a suspension when the amount that would be paid is
unaltered--would take textual force majeure, and certainly something
closer to irresistible than language in 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(23)(A) to the
effect that accrued benefits are ordinarily "expressed in the form of an
annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age." And the Plan's
argument that $ 204(g)'s "eliminat[e] or reduc[e]" language does not
apply to mere suspensions misses the point. ERISA permits conditions
that are elements of the benefit itself but the question here is whether
a new condition may be imposed after a benefit has accrued. The right
to receive certain money on a certain date may not be limited by a new
condition narrowing that right. Pp. 745-746.

(c) This Court's conclusion is confirmed by an Internal Revenue Service regulation that adopts the reading of $ 204(g) approved here.
Pp. 746-748.

(d) ERISA $ 203(a)(3)(B), 29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a)(3)(B)--which provides
that the right to an accrued benefit "shall not be treated as forfeitable
solely because the plan" suspends benefit payments when beneficiaries
like respondents are employed in the same industry and the same geographic area covered by the plan--is irrelevant to the question here.
Section 203(a) addresses the entirely distinct concept of benefit forfeitures. And read most simply and in context, $ 203(a)(3)(B) is a statement about the terms that can be offered to plan participants up front,
not as an authorization to adopt retroactive amendments. Pp. 748-751.

Opinion of the Court
he would have received if he had retired at the usual age,and is thus a form of subsidized benefit, since monthly payments are not discounted even though they start earlier andare likely to continue longer than the average period.

Heinz's entitlement is subject to a condition on which thiscase focuses: the Plan prohibits beneficiaries of service only
pensions from certain "disqualifying employment" after theyretire. The Plan provides that if beneficiaries accept such
employment their monthly payments will be suspended untilthey stop the forbidden work.

1 When Heinz retired in 1996,

the Plan defined "disqualifying employment" as any job as"a union or non-union construction worker." Brief for Respondents 6. This condition did not cover employment in asupervisory capacity, however, and when Heinz took a job in
central Illinois as a construction supervisor after retiring,the Plan continued to pay out his monthly benefit.

In 1998, the Plan's definition of disqualifying employmentwas expanded by amendment to include any job " `in any capacity in the construction industry (either as a union or non-union construction worker).' " Ibid. The Plan took the
amended definition to cover supervisory work and warnedHeinz that if he continued on as a supervisor, his monthly
pension payments would be suspended. Heinz kept work-ing, and the Plan stopped paying.

Heinz sued to recover the suspended benefits on theground that applying the amended definition of disqualifying

1 This suspension provision was adopted on the authority of ERISA

$ 203(a)(3)(B), 29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a)(3)(B). In authorizing such suspensions,
Congress seems to have been motivated at least in part by a desire "to
protect participants against their pension plan being used, in effect, to
subsidize low-wage employers who hire plan retirees to compete with, and
undercut the wages and working conditions of employees covered by the
plan." 120 Cong. Rec. 29930 (1974) (statement of Sen. Williams regarding

$ 203(a)(3)(B)). That explains why ERISA permits multiemployer plans
to suspend a retiree's benefits only if he accepts work "in the same industry, in the same trade or craft, and the same geographic area covered by
the plan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a)(3)(B)(ii).

employment so as to suspend payment of his accrued benefitsviolated ERISA's anti-cutback rule. On cross-motions for

judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 12(c), the District Court granted judgment for the
Plan, only to be reversed by a divided panel of the SeventhCircuit, which held that imposing new conditions on rights
to benefits already accrued was a violation of the anti-cutback rule. 303 F. 3d 802 (CA7 2002). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1045 (2003), in order to resolve the resultingCircuit split, see

A

There is no doubt about the centrality of ERISA's objectof protecting employees' justified expectations of receiving

the benefits their employers promise them.

"Nothing in ERISA requires employers to establish em-ployee benefits plans. Nor does ERISA mandate what

kind of benefits employers must provide if they chooseto have such a plan. ERISA does, however, seek to ensure that employees will not be left emptyhanded onceemployers have guaranteed them certain benefits. . . .
[W]hen Congress enacted ERISA, it `wanted to . . .mak[e] sure that if a worker has been promised a defined
pension benefit upon retirement--and if he has fulfilledwhatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit--he actually will receive it.' " Lockheed Corp. v.
Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887 (1996) (quoting Nachman Corp.v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S. 359,

375 (1980); citations omitted).
See also J. Langbein & B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Bene-fit Law 121 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Langbein & Wolk)

("The central problem to which ERISA is addressed is theloss of pension benefits previously promised").

744 CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

Opinion of the Court
ERISA's anti-cutback rule is crucial to this object, and(with two exceptions of no concern here

2) provides that

"[t]he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may notbe decreased by an amendment of the plan . . . ." 29 U. S. C.

$ 1054(g)(1). After some initial question about whether theprovision addressed early retirement benefits, see Langbein & Wolk 164, a 1984 amendment made it clear that itdoes. Retirement Equity Act of 1984, $ 301(a)(2), 98 Stat.
1451. Now $ 204(g) provides that "a plan amendment whichhas the effect of . . . eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit . . . with respect to benefits attributable to serv-ice before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits." 29 U. S. C. $ 1054(g)(2).Hence the question here: did the 1998 amendment to the
Plan have the effect of "eliminating or reducing an earlyretirement benefit" that was earned by service before the
amendment was passed? The statute, admittedly, is notas helpful as it might be in answering this question; it
does not explicitly define "early retirement benefit," and itrather circularly defines "accrued benefit" as "the individual's accrued benefit determined under the plan . . . ."$ 1002(23)(A). Still, it certainly looks as though a benefit has
suffered under the amendment here, for we agree with theSeventh Circuit that, as a matter of common sense, "[a] participant's benefits cannot be understood without reference tothe conditions imposed on receiving those benefits, and an
amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the re-ceipt of the benefit `reduces' the benefit just as surely as a
decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment." 303F. 3d, at 805. Heinz worked and accrued retirement benefits
under a plan with terms allowing him to supplement retire-ment income by certain employment, and he was being reasonable if he relied on those terms in planning his retire2 ERISA $ 204(g) allows the reduction of accrued benefits by amendment
in cases where a plan faces "substantial business hardship," 29 U. S. C.

$ 1082(c)(8), and in cases involving terminated multiemployer plans, $ 1441.

Opinion of the Court
ment. The 1998 amendment undercut any such reliance,paying retirement income only if he accepted a substantial

curtailment of his opportunity to do the kind of work heknew. We simply do not see how, in any practical sense, this
change of terms could not be viewed as shrinking the valueof Heinz's pension rights and reducing his promised benefits.

B
The Plan's responses are technical ones, beginning withthe suggestion that the "benefit" that may not be devalued

is actually nothing more than a "defined periodic benefit theplan is legally obliged to pay," Brief for Petitioner 28, so that

$ 204(g) applies only to amendments directly altering thenominal dollar amount of a retiree's monthly pension payment. A retiree's benefit of $100 a month, say, is not re-duced by a postaccrual plan amendment that suspends payments, so long as nothing affects the figure of $100 definingwhat he would be paid, if paid at all. Under the Plan's reading, $ 204(g) would have nothing to say about an amendmentthat resulted even in a permanent suspension of payments.
But for us to give the anti-cutback rule a reading that con-stricted would take textual

force majeure, and certainlysomething closer to irresistible than the provision quoted in

the Plan's observation that accrued benefits are ordinarily"expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at
normal retirement age," 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(23)(A).The Plan also contends that, because $ 204(g) only prohibits amendments that "eliminat[e] or reduc[e] an early retire-ment benefit," the anti-cutback rule must not apply to mere
suspensions of an early retirement benefit. This argumentseems to rest on a distinction between "eliminat[e] or reduc[e]" on the one hand, and "suspend" on the other, but itjust misses the point. No one denies that some conditions
enforceable by suspending benefit payments are permissibleunder ERISA: conditions set before a benefit accrues can
survive the anti-cutback rule, even though their sanction is

541US2 Unit: $U55 [05-21-06 17:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
746 CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

Opinion of the Court
a suspension of benefits. Because such conditions are ele-ments of the benefit itself and are considered in valuing it at

the moment it accrues, a later suspension of benefit pay-ments according to the Plan's terms does not eliminate the
benefit or reduce its value. The real question is whether anew condition may be imposed after a benefit has accrued;
may the right to receive certain money on a certain date belimited by a new condition narrowing that right? In a given
case, the new condition may or may not be invoked to justifyan actual suspension of benefits, but at the moment the new
condition is imposed, the accrued benefit becomes less valu-able, irrespective of any actual suspension.

C
Our conclusion is confirmed by a regulation of the InternalRevenue Service (IRS) that adopts just this reading of

$ 204(g). When Title I of ERISA was enacted to imposesubstantive legal requirements on employee pension plans
(including the anti-cutback rule), Title II of ERISA amendedthe Internal Revenue Code to condition the eligibility of pension plans for preferential tax treatment on compliance withmany of the Title I requirements. Employee Benefits Law
47, 171-173 (S. Sacher et al. eds., 2d ed. 2000). The resultwas a "curious duplicate structure" with nearly verbatim
replication in the Internal Revenue Code of whole sectionsof text from Title I of ERISA. Langbein & Wolk 91, || 6.
The anti-cutback rule of ERISA $ 204(g) is one such section,showing up in substantially identical form as 26 U. S. C.

$ 411(d)(6).3 This duplication explains the provision of theReorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978, $ 101, 43 Fed. Reg. 47713
(1978), 92 Stat. 3790, giving the Secretary of the Treasury

3 "A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment
of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(c)(8) [of
this Code], or [29 U. S. C. $ 1441]." 26 U. S. C. $ 411(d)(6)(A); see also

$ 411(d)(6)(B) (clarifying that the anti-cutback rule applies to early retirement benefits). Cf. n. 2, supra, and accompanying text (detailing
ERISA $ 204(g)).

Opinion of the Court
the ultimate authority to interpret these overlapping anti-cutback provisions. See also Langbein & Wolk 92, || 7 ("The

IRS has [regulatory] jurisdiction over . . . benefit accrua[l]and vesting"). Although the pertinent regulations refer
only to the Internal Revenue Code version of the anti-cutback rule, they apply with equal force to ERISA $ 204(g).
See 53 Fed. Reg. 26050, 26053 (1988) ("The regulations under
section 411 are also applicable to provisions of [ERISA]Title I").

The IRS has formally taken the position that the anti-cutback rule does not keep employers from specifying in
advance of accrual that "[t]he availability of a section411(d)(6) protected benefit [is] limited to employees who satisfy certain objective conditions . . . ." 26 CFR $ 1.411(d)-4,A-6(a)(1) (2003). Without running afoul of the rule, for example, plans may say from the outset that a single sumdistribution of benefits is conditioned on the execution of a
covenant not to compete. $ 1.411(d)-4, A-6(a)(2). And em-ployers are perfectly free to modify the deal they are offering their employees, as long as the change goes to the terms
of compensation for continued, future employment: a plan"may be amended to eliminate or reduce section 411(d)(6)

protected benefits with respect to benefits not yet accrued . . . ." $ 1.411(d)-4, A-2(a)(1). The IRS regulations
treat such conditions very differently, however, when they
turn up as part of an amendment adding new conditions to
the receipt of benefits already accrued. The rule in that
case is categorical: "[t]he addition of . . . objective conditions
with respect to a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit that has
already accrued violates section 411(d)(6). Also, the addition of conditions (whether or not objective) or any change
to existing conditions with respect to section 411(d)(6) protected benefits that results in any further restriction violates
section 411(d)(6)." $ 1.411(d)-4, A-7. So far as the IRS
regulations are concerned, then, the anti-cutback provision
flatly prohibits plans from attaching new conditions to benefits that an employee has already earned.

748 CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

Opinion of the Court
The IRS has, however, told two stories. The Plan points
to a provision of the Internal Revenue Manual that supports
its position: "[a]n amendment that reduces IRC 411(d)(6) protected benefits on account of [a plan's disqualifying employment provision] does not violate IRC 411(d)(6)." Internal
Revenue Manual 4.72.14.3.5.3(7) (May 4, 2001), available at
http://www.irs.gov/ irm/part4 /ch50s19.html. And the
United States as amicus curiae says that the IRS has routinely approved amendments to plan definitions of disqualifying employment, even when they apply retroactively to
accrued benefits. But neither an unreasoned statement in
the manual nor allegedly longstanding agency practice can
trump a formal regulation with the procedural history necessary to take on the force of law. See generally Note, Omnibus Taxpayers' Bill of Rights Act: Taxpayers' Remedy or
Political Placebo? 86 Mich. L. Rev. 1787, 1799-1801 (1988)
(discussing legal status of the Internal Revenue Manual).
Speaking in its most authoritative voice, the IRS has long
since approved the interpretation of $ 204(g) that we adopt
today.4

III

In criticizing the Seventh Circuit's reading of $ 204(g), the
Plan and the United States rely heavily on an entirely
separate section of ERISA $ 203(a)(3)(B), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1053(a)(3)(B). Here they claim to find specific authoriza4 Nothing we hold today requires the IRS to revisit the tax-exempt status in past years of plans that were amended in reliance on the agency's
representations in its manual by expanding the categories of work that
would trigger suspension of benefit payments as to already-accrued benefits. The Internal Revenue Code gives the Commissioner discretion
to decline to apply decisions of this Court retroactively. 26 U. S. C.

$ 7805(b)(8) ("The Secretary may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any
ruling (including any judicial decision or any administrative determination
other than by regulation) relating to the internal revenue laws shall be
applied without retroactive effect"). This would doubtless be an appropriate occasion for exercise of that discretion.

Opinion of the Court
tion to amend suspension provisions retroactively, in termsspecific enough to trump any general prohibition imposed by

$ 204(g). Section 203(a)(3)(B) provides that

"[a] right to an accrued benefit derived from employer
contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solelybecause the plan provides that the payment of benefits

is suspended for such period as [beneficiaries like re-spondents are] employed . . . in the same industry, in the
same trade or craft, and the same geographic area cov-ered by the plan, as when such benefits commenced."
29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a)(3)(B).
The Plan's arguments notwithstanding, $ 203(a)(3)(B) is irrelevant to the question before us, for at least two reasons.First, as a technical matter, $ 203(a) addresses the entirely

different question of benefit forfeitures. This is a distinctconcept: $ 204(g) belongs to the section of ERISA that sets
forth requirements for benefit accrual (the rate at whichan employee earns benefits to put in his pension account),
see 29 U. S. C. $ 1054, whereas $ 203(a)(3)(B) is in the sectionthat regulates vesting (the process by which an employee's
already-accrued pension account becomes irrevocably his
property), see 29 U. S. C. $ 1053. See generally Nachman
Corp., 446 U. S., at 366, n. 10 ("Section 203(a) is a central
provision in ERISA. It requires generally that a plan treatan employee's benefits, to the extent that they have vested

by virtue of his having fulfilled age and length of servicerequirements no greater than those specified in $ 203(a)(2),
as not subject to forfeiture"). To be sure, the concepts over-lap in practical effect, and a single act by a plan might raise
both vesting and accrual concerns. But it would be a non
sequitur to conclude that, because an amendment does
not constitute a prohibited forfeiture under $ 203, it must
not be a prohibited reduction under $ 204. Just because

$ 203(a)(3)(B) failed to forbid it would not mean that $ 204(g)
allowed it.

750 CENTRAL LABORERS' PENSION FUND v. HEINZ

Opinion of the Court
Second, read most simply and in context, $ 203(a)(3)(B) isa statement about the terms that can be offered to plan participants up front and enforced without amounting to forfeit-ure, not as an authorization to adopt retroactive amendments. Section 203(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a), reads that"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that an employee's right
to his normal retirement benefit is nonforfeitable upon theattainment of normal retirement age." This is a global directive that regulates the substantive content of pensionplans; it adds a mandatory term to all retirement packages
that a company might offer. Section 203(a)(3)(B), in turn, isnothing more than an explanation of this substantive requirement. Congress wanted to allow employers to con-dition future benefits on a plan participant's agreement not
to accept certain kinds of postretirement employment, seen. 1,

supra, and it recognized that a plan provision to thiseffect might be seen as rendering vested benefits improperly forfeitable. Accordingly, adding $ 203(a)(3)(B) made itclear that such suspension provisions were permissible in
narrow circumstances. But critically for present purposes,$ 203(a)(3)(B) speaks only to the permissible substantive
scope of existing ERISA plans, not to the procedural permis-sibility of plan amendments. The fact that ERISA allows
plans to include a suspension provision going to benefits notyet accrued has no logical bearing on the analysis of how
ERISA treats the imposition of such a condition on (implic-itly) bargained-for benefits that have accrued already.

5 Section 203(a)(3)(B) is no help to the Plan.6

5 This is not to say that $ 203(a)(3)(B) does not authorize some amendments. Plans are free to add new suspension provisions under

$ 203(a)(3)(B), so long as the new provisions apply only to the benefits that
will be associated with future employment. The point is that this section
regulates the contents of the bargain that can be struck between employer
and employees as part of the complete benefits package for future
employment.

6 For analogous reasons, the Plan's reliance on 26 CFR $ 1.411(c)-1(f)

I join the opinion of the Court on the assumption that itdoes not foreclose a reading of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that allows the Secretary ofLabor, or the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue regulations
explicitly allowing plan amendments to enlarge the scope ofdisqualifying employment with respect to benefits attributable to already-performed services. Cf. Christensen v. Har-ris County, 529 U. S. 576, 589 (2000) (

Souter, J., concurring).

"[n]o adjustment to an accrued benefit is required on account of any suspension of benefits if such suspension is permitted under section
203(a)(3)(B)." We read this provision as simply establishing that the actual suspension of benefit payments pursuant to an existing suspension
provision does not affect the actuarial value of a beneficiary's total benefits
package for the purpose of allocation calculations, since the suspension
provision has already been accounted for in the initial valuation. Cf. n. 3,
supra. Far from helping the Plan, this regulation tends to support our
larger proposition that it is the addition of a suspension condition, not the
actual suspension of a benefit, that reduces an employee's accrued benefit.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-358. Argued April 21, 2004--Decided June 7, 2004
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal

agencies to analyze the environmental impact of their proposals and
actions in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), but Council of
Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations allow an agency to prepare a
more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) if the agency's proposed
action neither is categorically excluded from the EIS production requirement nor would clearly require production of an EIS. An agency
that decides, pursuant to an EA, that no EIS is required must issue a
"finding of no significant impact" (FONSI). The Clean Air Act (CAA
or Act) leaves States to develop "implementation plan[s]" to comply with
national air quality standards mandated by the Act, and requires federal agencies' actions to "conform" to those state plans, 42 U. S. C.

$ 7506(c)(1). In 1982, Congress enacted a moratorium, prohibiting, inter
alia, Mexican motor carriers from obtaining operating authority within
the United States and authorizing the President to lift the moratorium.
In 2001, the President announced his intention to lift the moratorium
once new regulations were prepared to grant operating authority to
Mexican motor carriers. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) published one proposed rule addressing the application form for such carriers and another addressing the establishment of
a safety-inspection regime for carriers receiving operating authority.
Congress subsequently provided, in $ 350 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, that no funds
appropriated could be obligated or expended to review or process any
Mexican motor carrier's applications until FMCSA implemented specific
application and safety-monitoring requirements. Acting pursuant to
NEPA, FMCSA issued an EA for its proposed rules. The EA did not
consider the environmental impact that might be caused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks in the United States, concluding
that any such impact would be an effect of the moratorium's modification, not the regulations' implementation. Concluding that the regulations' issuance would have no significant environmental impact, FMCSA
issued a FONSI. In subsequent interim rules, FMCSA relied on the
EA and FONSI to demonstrate compliance with NEPA, and determined

Syllabus
that any emissions increase from the regulations would fall below the
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) threshold levels needed to
trigger a conformity review under the CAA. Before the moratorium
was lifted, respondents sought judicial review of the proposed rules,
arguing that their promulgation violated NEPA and the CAA. The
Court of Appeals agreed, finding the EA deficient because it did not
consider the environmental impact of lifting the moratorium, when that
action was reasonably foreseeable at the time FMCSA prepared the EA
and directing FMCSA to prepare an EIS and a full CAA conformity
determination for the regulations.

Held: Because FMCSA lacks discretion to prevent cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, neither NEPA nor the CAA requires
FMCSA to evaluate the environmental effects of such operations.
Pp. 763-773.

(a) FMCSA did not violate NEPA or the relevant CEQ regulations.
Pp. 763-770.

(1) An agency's decision not to prepare an EIS can be set aside
only if it is arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). Respondents argue that the issuance of a FONSI was arbitrary and capricious because the EA did not take into account the environmental
effects of an increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor
carriers. The relevant question, under NEPA, is whether that increase,
and the correlative release of emissions, is an "effect," 40 CFR $ 1508.8,
of FMCSA's rules; if not, FMCSA's failure to address these effects in
the EA did not violate NEPA, and the FONSI's issuance cannot be
arbitrary and capricious. Pp. 763-764.

(2) Respondents have forfeited any objection to the EA on the
ground that it did not adequately discuss potential alternatives to the
proposed action because respondents never identified in their comments to the rules any alternatives beyond those the EA evaluated.
Pp. 764-765.

(3) Respondents argue that the EA must take the increased crossborder operations' environmental effects into account because $ 350's expenditure bar makes it impossible for any Mexican truck to operate in
the United States until the regulations are issued, and hence the trucks'
entry is a "reasonably foreseeable" indirect effect of the issuance of the
regulations. 40 CFR $ 1508.8. Critically, that argument overlooks
FMCSA's inability to countermand the President's lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to exclude Mexican trucks from operating in the United States. While $ 350 restricted FMCSA's ability to
authorize such operations, FMCSA remains subject to 49 U. S. C.

$ 13902(a)(1)'s mandate that it register any motor carrier willing and

able to comply with various safety and financial responsibility rules.
Only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican trucks
before 2001. Respondents must rest on "but for" causation, where an
agency's action is considered a cause of an environmental effect even
when the agency has no authority to prevent the effect. However, "but
for" causation is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA and the relevant regulations. NEPA requires a
"reasonably close causal relationship" akin to proximate cause in tort
law. Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460
U. S. 766, 774. Also, inherent in NEPA and its implementing regulations is a "rule of reason," which ensures that agencies determine
whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness
of any new potential information to the decisionmaking process. The
underlying policies behind NEPA and Congress' intent, as informed by
the "rule of reason," make clear that the causal connection between the
proposed regulations and the entry of Mexican trucks is insufficient to
make FMCSA responsible under NEPA to consider the environmental
effects of entry. Neither of the purposes of NEPA's EIS requirement--
to ensure both that an agency has information to make its decision and
that the public receives information so it might also play a role in the
decisionmaking process--will be fulfilled by requiring FMCSA to consider the environmental impact at issue. Since FMCSA has no ability
to prevent such cross-border operations, it lacks the power to act on
whatever information might be contained in an EIS and could not act
on whatever input the public could provide. This analysis is not
changed by the CEQ regulation requiring an agency to evaluate the
"cumulative impact" of its action, 40 CFR $ 1508.7, since that rule does
not require FMCSA to treat the lifting of the moratorium itself or the
consequences from that lifting as an effect of its rules promulgation.
Pp. 765-770.

(b) FMCSA did not act improperly by not performing a full conformity analysis pursuant to the CAA and relevant regulations. To ensure
that its actions are consistent with 42 U. S. C. $ 7506, a federal agency
must undertake "a conformity determination . . . where the total of
direct and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or maintenance area
caused by [the] action would equal or exceed" certain threshold levels
established by the EPA. 40 CFR $ 93.153(b). "Direct emissions" "are
caused or initiated by the Federal action and occur at the same time
and place as the action," $ 93.152; and "indirect emissions" are "caused
by the Federal action" but may occur later in time, and may be practicably controlled or maintained by the federal agency, ibid. Some sort of
"but for" causation is sufficient for evaluating causation in the conformity review process. See ibid. Because it excluded emissions attribut541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
able to the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the United
States, FMCSA concluded that its regulations would not exceed EPA
thresholds. Although arguably FMCSA's proposed regulations would
be "but for" causes of the entry of Mexican trucks into the United
States, such trucks' emissions are not "direct" because they will not
occur at the same time or place as the promulgation of the regulations.
And they are not "indirect" because FMCSA cannot practicably control
or maintain control over the emissions: FMCSA has no ability to countermand the President's decision to lift the moratorium or to act categorically to prevent Mexican carriers from registering and Mexican
trucks from entering the country; and once the regulations are promulgated, FMCSA will not be able to regulate any aspect of vehicle exhaust
from those trucks. Pp. 771-773.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we confront the question whether the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat.

852 (codified, as amended, at 42 U. S. C. $$ 4321-4370f), andthe Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U. S. C. $$ 7401-7671q, require
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)to evaluate the environmental effects of cross-border operations of Mexican-domiciled motor carriers, where FMCSA'spromulgation of certain regulations would allow such crossborder operations to occur. Because FMCSA lacks discre-tion to prevent these cross-border operations, we conclude
that these statutes impose no such requirement on FMCSA.

I
Due to the complex statutory and regulatory provisionsimplicated in this case, we begin with a brief overview of the

relevant statutes. We then turn to the factual and proce-dural background.

Signed into law on January 1, 1970, NEPA establishes a"national policy [to] encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment," and was intendedto reduce or eliminate environmental damage and to promote
"the understanding of the ecological systems and natural re-sources important to" the United States. 42 U. S. C. $ 4321.
"NEPA itself does not mandate particular results" in orderto accomplish these ends.

Robertson v. Methow Valley Citi-zens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989). Rather, NEPA imposes only procedural requirements on federal agencies witha particular focus on requiring agencies to undertake analtion et al. by Hope M. Babcock; for Defenders of Wildlife et al. by Pamela
S. Karlan and Sanjay Narayan; for the Eagle Forum Education & Legal

yses of the environmental impact of their proposals andactions. See

id., at 349-350. At the heart of NEPA is a
requirement that federal agencies

"include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions sig-nificantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible officialon--

"(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,"(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot
be avoided should the proposal be implemented,"(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,

"(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of
man's environment and the maintenance and enhance-ment of long-term productivity, and

"(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments ofresources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented." 42 U. S. C. $ 4332(2)(C).
This detailed statement is called an Environmental ImpactStatement (EIS). The Council of Environmental Quality

(CEQ), established by NEPA with authority to issue regulations interpreting it, has promulgated regulations to guidefederal agencies in determining what actions are subject to

that statutory requirement. See 40 CFR $ 1500.3 (2003).The CEQ regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited document, an Environmental Assessment (EA), if theagency's proposed action neither is categorically excluded
from the requirement to produce an EIS nor would clearlyrequire the production of an EIS. See $$ 1501.4(a)-(b).
The EA is to be a "concise public document" that "[b]riefly
provide[s] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining
whether to prepare an [EIS]." $ 1508.9(a). If, pursuant to
the EA, an agency determines that an EIS is not required
under applicable CEQ regulations, it must issue a "finding
of no significant impact" (FONSI), which briefly presents

What is known as the CAA became law in 1963, 77 Stat.
392. In 1970, Congress substantially amended the CAA into
roughly its current form. 84 Stat. 1713. The 1970 amendments mandated national air quality standards and deadlines
for their attainment, while leaving to the States the development of "implementation plan[s]" to comply with the federal
standards. Ibid.

In 1977, Congress again amended the CAA, 91 Stat. 749,
to prohibit the Federal Government and its agencies from
"engag[ing] in, support[ing] in any way or provid[ing] financial assistance for, licens[ing] or permit[ting], or approv[ing],
any activity which does not conform to [a state] implementation plan." 42 U. S. C. $ 7506(c)(1). The definition of "conformity" includes restrictions on, for instance, "increas[ing]
the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any
standard in any area," or "delay[ing] timely attainment
of any standard . . . in any area." $ 7506(c)(1)(B). These
safeguards prevent the Federal Government from interfering with the States' abilities to comply with the CAA's
requirements.

FMCSA, an agency within the Department of Transportation (DOT), is responsible for motor carrier safety and
registration. See 49 U. S. C. $ 113(f). FMCSA has a variety of statutory mandates, including "ensur[ing]" safety,

$ 31136, establishing minimum levels of financial responsibility for motor carriers, $ 31139, and prescribing federal
standards for safety inspections of commercial motor vehicles, $ 31142. Importantly, FMCSA has only limited discretion regarding motor vehicle carrier registration: It must
grant registration to all domestic or foreign motor carriers

Opinion of the Court
that are "willing and able to comply with" the applicablesafety, fitness, and financial-responsibility requirements.

$ 13902(a)(1). FMCSA has no statutory authority to imposeor enforce emissions controls or to establish environmental
requirements unrelated to motor carrier safety.

B
We now turn to the factual and procedural background ofthis case. Before 1982, motor carriers domiciled in Canada

and Mexico could obtain certification to operate within theUnited States from the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC).1 In 1982, Congress, concerned about discriminatorytreatment of United States motor carriers in Mexico and
Canada, enacted a 2-year moratorium on new grants of oper-ating authority. Congress authorized the President to extend the moratorium beyond the 2-year period if Canada orMexico continued to interfere with United States motor carriers, and also authorized the President to lift or modify themoratorium if he determined that doing so was in the national interest. 49 U. S. C. $ 10922(l) (1982 ed.). Althoughthe moratorium on Canadian motor carriers was quickly
lifted, the moratorium on Mexican motor carriers remained,and was extended by the President.

In December 1992, the leaders of Mexico, Canada, and theUnited States signed the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), 32 I. L. M. 605 (1993). As part ofNAFTA, the United States agreed to phase out the moratorium and permit Mexican motor carriers to obtain operatingauthority within the United States' interior by January 2000.
On NAFTA's effective date (January 1, 1994), the Presidentbegan to lift the trade moratorium by allowing the licensing

1 In 1995, Congress abolished the ICC and transferred most of its responsibilities to the Secretary of Transportation. See ICC Termination
Act of 1995, $ 101, 109 Stat. 803. In 1999, Congress transferred responsibility for motor carrier safety within DOT to the newly created FMCSA.
See Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, 113 Stat. 1748.

Opinion of the Court

of Mexican carriers to provide some bus services in the
United States. The President, however, did not continue to
ease the moratorium on the timetable specified by NAFTA,
as concerns about the adequacy of Mexico's regulation of
motor carrier safety remained.

The Government of Mexico challenged the United States'
implementation of NAFTA's motor carrier provisions under
NAFTA's dispute-resolution process, and in February 2001,
an international arbitration panel determined that the
United States' "blanket refusal" of Mexican motor carrier
applications breached the United States' obligations under
NAFTA. App. 279, || 295. Shortly thereafter, the President made clear his intention to lift the moratorium on Mexican motor carrier certification following the preparation of
new regulations governing grants of operating authority to
Mexican motor carriers.

In May 2001, FMCSA published for comment proposed
rules concerning safety regulation of Mexican motor carriers. One rule (the Application Rule) addressed the establishment of a new application form for Mexican motor carriers that seek authorization to operate within the United
States. Another rule (the Safety Monitoring Rule) addressed the establishment of a safety-inspection regime for
all Mexican motor carriers that would receive operating authority under the Application Rule.

In December 2001, Congress enacted the Department of
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2002, 115 Stat. 833. Section 350 of this Act, id., at 864, provided that no funds appropriated under the Act could be obligated or expended to review or to process any application
by a Mexican motor carrier for authority to operate in the
interior of the United States until FMCSA implemented specific application and safety-monitoring requirements for
Mexican carriers. Some of these requirements went beyond
those proposed by FMCSA in the Application and Safety

Opinion of the Court
Monitoring Rules. Congress extended the $ 350 conditionsto appropriations for Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004.

In January 2002, acting pursuant to NEPA's mandates,FMCSA issued a programmatic EA for the proposed Application and Safety Monitoring Rules. FMCSA's EA eval-uated the environmental impact associated with three
separate scenarios: where the President did not lift the
moratorium; where the President did but where (contrary towhat was legally possible) FMCSA did not issue any new

regulations; and the Proposed Action Alternative, where thePresident would modify the moratorium and where FMCSA
would adopt the proposed regulations. The EA considered
the environmental impact in the categories of traffic and congestion, public safety and health, air quality, noise, socioeconomic factors, and environmental justice. Vital to the EA's
analysis, however, was the assumption that there would be
no change in trade volume between the United States and
Mexico due to the issuance of the regulations. FMCSA did
note that $ 350's restrictions made it impossible for Mexican
motor carriers to operate in the interior of the United States
before FMCSA's issuance of the regulations. But, FMCSA
determined that "this and any other associated effects in
trade characteristics would be the result of the modification of the moratorium" by the President, not a result of
FMCSA's implementation of the proposed safety regulations.
App. 60. Because FMCSA concluded that the entry of the
Mexican trucks was not an "effect" of its regulations, it did
not consider any environmental impact that might be caused
by the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the
United States.

The particular environmental effects on which the EA focused, then, were those likely to arise from the increase in
the number of roadside inspections of Mexican trucks and
buses due to the proposed regulations. The EA concluded
that these effects (such as a slight increase in emissions,
noise from the trucks, and possible danger to passing motor541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
762 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION v. PUBLIC

CITIZEN

Opinion of the Court

ists) were minor and could be addressed and avoided in theinspections process itself. The EA also noted that the increase of inspection-related emissions would be at least par-tially offset by the fact that the safety requirements would
reduce the number of Mexican trucks operating in the UnitedStates. Due to these calculations, the EA concluded that
the issuance of the proposed regulations would have no significant impact on the environment, and hence FMCSA, onthe same day as it released the EA, issued a FONSI.

On March 19, 2002, FMCSA issued the two interim rules,delaying their effective date until May 3, 2002, to allow
public comment on provisions that FMCSA added to satisfy
the requirements of $ 350. In the regulatory preambles,
FMCSA relied on its EA and its FONSI to demonstrate compliance with NEPA. FMCSA also addressed the CAA in
the preambles, determining that it did not need to perform
a "conformity review" of the proposed regulations under 42
U. S. C. $ 7506(c)(1) because the increase in emissions from
these regulations would fall below the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) threshold levels needed to trigger
such a review.

In November 2002, the President lifted the moratorium on
qualified Mexican motor carriers. Before this action, however, respondents filed petitions for judicial review of the
Application and Safety Monitoring Rules, arguing that the
rules were promulgated in violation of NEPA and the CAA.
The Court of Appeals agreed with respondents, granted the
petitions, and set aside the rules. 316 F. 3d 1002 (CA9 2003).

The Court of Appeals concluded that the EA was deficient
because it failed to give adequate consideration to the overall environmental impact of lifting the moratorium on the
cross-border operation of Mexican motor carriers. According to the Court of Appeals, FMCSA was required to consider the environmental effects of the entry of Mexican
trucks because "the President's rescission of the moratorium
was `reasonably foreseeable' at the time the EA was pre541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
pared and the decision not to prepare an EIS was made."Id., at 1022 (quoting 40 CFR $$ 1508.7, 1508.8(b) (2003)).

Due to this perceived deficiency, the Court of Appeals re-manded the case for preparation of a full EIS.

The Court of Appeals also directed FMCSA to prepare afull CAA conformity determination for the challenged regulations. It concluded that FMCSA's determination thatemissions attributable to the challenged rules would be
below the threshold levels was not reliable because theagency's CAA determination reflected the "illusory distinction between the effects of the regulations themselves andthe effects of the presidential rescission of the moratorium
on Mexican truck entry." 316 F. 3d, at 1030.We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1088 (2003), and now
reverse. II

An agency's decision not to prepare an EIS can be setaside only upon a showing that it was "arbitrary, capricious,
an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance withlaw." 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). See also

Marsh v. Oregon Nat-ural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 375-376 (1989);

Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U. S. 390, 412 (1976). Here,FMCSA based its FONSI upon the analysis contained within
its EA; respondents argue that the issuance of the FONSIwas arbitrary and capricious because the EA's analysis was
flawed. In particular, respondents criticize the EA's failureto take into account the various environmental effects caused
by the increase in cross-border operati ons of Mexicanmotor carriers.

Under NEPA, an agency is required to provide an EISonly if it will be undertaking a "major Federal actio[n],"
which "significantly affect[s] the quality of the human envi-ronment." 42 U. S. C. $ 4332(2)(C). Under applicable CEQ
regulations, "[m]ajor Federal action" is defined to "includ[e]actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility." 40

Opinion of the Court

CFR $ 1508.18 (2003). "Effects" is defined to "include: (a)
Direct effects, which are caused by the action and occur at
the same time and place," and "(b) Indirect effects, which
are caused by the action and are later in time or farther
removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable."

$ 1508.8. Thus, the relevant question is whether the increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers,
with the correlative release of emissions by Mexican trucks,
is an "effect" of FMCSA's issuance of the Application and
Safety Monitoring Rules; if not, FMCSA's failure to address
these effects in its EA did not violate NEPA, and so
FMCSA's issuance of a FONSI cannot be arbitrary and
capricious.

A

To answer this question, we begin by explaining what this
case does not involve. What is not properly before us, despite respondents' argument to the contrary, see Brief for
Respondents 38-41, is any challenge to the EA due to its
failure properly to consider possible alternatives to the proposed action (i. e., the issuance of the challenged rules) that
would mitigate the environmental impact of the authorization of cross-border operations by Mexican motor carriers.
Persons challenging an agency's compliance with NEPA
must "structure their participation so that it . . . alerts the
agency to the [parties'] position and contentions," in order to
allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration.
Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 553 (1978). None of
the respondents identified in their comments any rulemaking
alternatives beyond those evaluated in the EA, and none
urged FMCSA to consider alternatives. Because respondents did not raise these particular objections to the EA,
FMCSA was not given the opportunity to examine any proposed alternatives to determine if they were reasonably
available. Respondents have therefore forfeited any objec541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion to the EA on the ground that it failed adequately todiscuss potential alternatives to the proposed action.

Admittedly, the agency bears the primary responsibility toensure that it complies with NEPA, see ibid., and an EA's
or an EIS' flaws might be so obvious that there is no needfor a commentator to point them out specifically in order to
preserve its ability to challenge a proposed action. But thatsituation is not before us. With respect to FMCSA's ability
to mitigate, respondents can argue only that FMCSA couldregulate emissions from Mexican trucks indirectly, through
making the safety-registration process more onerous or byremoving older, more polluting trucks through more effective enforcement of motor carrier safety standards. But re-spondents fail to identify any evidence that shows that any
effect from these possible actions would be significant, oreven noticeable, for air-quality purposes. The connection
between enforcement of motor carrier safety and the envi-ronmental harms alleged in this case is also tenuous at best.
Nor is it clear that FMCSA could, consistent with its limitedstatutory mandates, reasonably impose on Mexican carriers
standards beyond those already required in its proposedregulations.

B
With this point aside, respondents have only one complaintwith respect to the EA: It did not take into account the

environmental effects of increased cross-border operationsof Mexican motor carriers. Respondents' argument that
FMCSA was required to consider these effects is simple.Under $ 350, FMCSA is barred from expending any funds to
process or review any applications by Mexican motor carri-ers until FMCSA implemented a variety of specific application and safety-monitoring requirements for Mexican car-riers. This expenditure bar makes it impossible for any
Mexican motor carrier to receive authorization to operatewithin the United States until FMCSA issued the regulations challenged here. The promulgation of the regulations,

Opinion of the Court

the argument goes, would "caus[e]" the entry of Mexicantrucks (and hence also cause any emissions such trucks

would produce), and the entry of the trucks is "reasonablyforeseeable." 40 CFR $ 1508.8 (2003). Thus, the argument
concludes, under the relevant CEQ regulations, FMCSAmust take these emissions into account in its EA when evaluating whether to produce an EIS.

Respondents' argument, however, overlooks a critical fea-ture of this case: FMCSA has no ability to countermand the

President's lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categor-ically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from operating
within the United States. To be sure, $ 350 did restrict
the ability of FMCSA to authorize cross-border operations
of Mexican motor carriers, but Congress did not otherwise modify FMCSA's statutory mandates. In particular,
FMCSA remains subject to the mandate of 49 U. S. C.

$ 13902(a)(1), that FMCSA "shall register a person to provide transportation . . . as a motor carrier if [it] finds that
the person is willing and able to comply with" the safety and
financial responsibility requirements established by DOT.
(Emphasis added.) Under FMCSA's entirely reasonable
reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier
that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the
various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers
before 2001. App. 51-55. Thus, upon the lifting of the moratorium, if FMCSA refused to authorize a Mexican motor
carrier for cross-border services, where the Mexican motor
carrier was willing and able to comply with the various substantive safety and financial responsibilities rules, it would
violate $ 13902(a)(1).

If it were truly impossible for FMCSA to comply with both

$ 350 and $ 13902(a)(1), then we would be presented with an
irreconcilable conflict of laws. As the later enacted provision, $ 350 would quite possibly win out. See Posadas v. Na541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tional City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936). But FMCSAcan easily satisfy both mandates: It can issue the application

and safety inspection rules required by $ 350, and start proc-essing applications by Mexican motor carriers and authorize
those that satisfy $ 13902(a)(1)'s conditions. Without a con-flict, then, FMCSA must comply with all of its statutory
mandates.

Respondents must rest, then, on a particularly unyieldingvariation of "but for" causation, where an agency's action is

considered a cause of an environmental effect even when theagency has no authority to prevent the effect. However, a
"but for" causal relationship is insufficient to make an agency
responsible for a particular effect under NEPA and the relevant regulations. As this Court held in Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U. S. 766, 774
(1983), NEPA requires "a reasonably close causal relationship" between the environmental effect and the alleged
cause. The Court analogized this requirement to the "familiar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law." Ibid. In
particular, "courts must look to the underlying policies or
legislative intent in order to draw a manageable line between
those causal changes that may make an actor responsible for
an effect and those that do not." Id., at 774, n. 7. See also
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts 264, 274-275 (5th ed. 1984) (proximate cause analysis turns on policy considerations and considerations of the "legal responsibility" of actors).

Also, inherent in NEPA and its implementing regulations
is a " `rule of reason,' " which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based
on the usefulness of any new potential information to the
decisionmaking process. See Marsh, 490 U. S., at 373-374.
Where the preparation of an EIS would serve "no purpose"
in light of NEPA's regulatory scheme as a whole, no rule of
reason worthy of that title would require an agency to prepare an EIS. See Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co. v. Students

Opinion of the Court

Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 422U. S. 289, 325 (1975); see also 40 CFR $$ 1500.1(b)-(c) (2003).

In these circumstances, the underlying policies behindNEPA and Congress' intent, as informed by the "rule of
reason," make clear that the causal connection betweenFMCSA's issuance of the proposed regulations and the entry
of the Mexican trucks is insufficient to make FMCSA responsible under NEPA to consider the environmental effects ofthe entry. The NEPA EIS requirement serves two purposes. First, "[i]t ensures that the agency, in reaching itsdecision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts." Robertson, 490 U. S., at 349. Second, it "guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to
the larger audience that may also play a role in both the
decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision." Ibid. Requiring FMCSA to consider the environmental effects of the entry of Mexican trucks would fulfill
neither of these statutory purposes. Since FMCSA has no
ability categorically to prevent the cross-border operations
of Mexican motor carriers, the environmental impact of the
cross-border operations would have no effect on FMCSA's
decisionmaking--FMCSA simply lacks the power to act on
whatever information might be contained in the EIS.

Similarly, the informational purpose is not served. The
"informational role" of an EIS is to "giv[e] the public the
assurance that the agency `has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process,' Baltimore
Gas & Electric Co. [v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 462 U. S. 87, 97 (1983)], and, perhaps more significantly,
provid[e] a springboard for public comment" in the agency
decisionmaking process itself, ibid. The purpose here is to
ensure that the "larger audience," ibid., can provide input as
necessary to the agency making the relevant decisions. See
40 CFR $ 1500.1(c) (2003) ("NEPA's purpose is not to generate paperwork--even excellent paperwork--but to foster ex541US2 Unit: $U56 [05-09-06 14:32:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cellent action. The NEPA process is intended to help publicofficials make decisions that are based on understanding of

environmental consequences, and take actions that protect,restore, and enhance the environment"); $ 1502.1 ("The primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is toserve as an action-forcing device to insure that the policies
and goals defined in the Act are infused into the ongoingprograms and actions of the Federal Government"). But
here, the "larger audience" can have no impact on FMCSA'sdecisionmaking, since, as just noted, FMCSA simply could
not act on whatever input this "larger audience" couldprovide.

2

It would not, therefore, satisfy NEPA's "rule of reason" torequire an agency to prepare a full EIS due to the environmental impact of an action it could not refuse to perform.Put another way, the legally relevant cause of the entry of
the Mexican trucks is not FMCSA's action, but instead theactions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those
of Congress in granting the President this authority whilesimultaneously limiting FMCSA's discretion.

Consideration of the CEQ's "cumulative impact" regula-tion does not change this analysis. An agency is required
to evaluate the "[c]umulative impact" of its action, which isdefined as "the impact on the environment which results
from the incremental impact of the action when added toother past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) orperson undertakes such other actions." $ 1508.7. The "cumulative impact" regulation required FMCSA to considerthe "incremental impact" of the safety rules themselves,
in the context of the President's lifting of the moratorium

2 Respondents are left with arguing that an EIS would be useful for
informational purposes entirely outside FMCSA's decisionmaking process.
See Brief for Respondents 42. But such an argument overlooks NEPA's
core focus on improving agency decisionmaking. See 40 CFR $$ 1500.1,
1500.2, 1502.1 (2003).

and other relevant circumstances. But this is exactly whatFMCSA did in its EA. FMCSA appropriately and reasonably examined the incremental impact of its safety rules as-suming the President's modification of the moratorium (and,
hence, assuming the increase in cross-border operations ofMexican motor carriers). The "cumulative impact" regulation does not require FMCSA to treat the lifting of the mora-torium itself, or consequences from the lifting of the moratorium, as an effect of its promulgation of its Application andSafety Monitoring Rules.

3

C
We hold that where an agency has no ability to prevent acertain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the

relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legallyrelevant "cause" of the effect. Hence, under NEPA and the
implementing CEQ regulations, the agency need not con-sider these effects in its EA when determining whether its
action is a "major Federal action." Because the President,not FMCSA, could authorize (or not authorize) cross-border
operations from Mexican motor carriers, and becauseFMCSA has no discretion to prevent the entry of Mexican
trucks, its EA did not need to consider the environmentaleffects arising from the entry.

4

3 The Court of Appeals and respondents contend that the EA contained
numerous other errors, but their contentions are premised on the conclusion that FMCSA was required to take into account the increased
cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.

4 Respondents argue that Congress ratified the Court of Appeals' decision when it, after the lower court's opinion, reenacted $ 350 in two appropriations bills. The doctrine of ratification states that "Congress is presumed to be aware of [a] . . . judicial interpretation of a statute and to
adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change."
Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978). But this case involves the
interpretation of NEPA and the CAA, not $ 350. Indeed, the precise requirements of $ 350 were not below, and are not here, in dispute. Hence,
congressional reenactment of $ 350 tells us nothing about Congress' view

Under the CAA, a federal "department, agency, or instru-mentality" may not, generally, "engage in, support in any

way or provide financial assistance for, license or permit, orapprove, any activity" that violates an applicable state airquality implementation plan. 42 U. S. C. $ 7506(c)(1); 40CFR $ 93.150(a) (2003). Federal agencies must, in many circumstances, undertake a conformity determination withrespect to a proposed action, to ensure that the action
is consistent with $ 7506(c)(1). See 40 CFR $$ 93.150(b),93.153(a)-(b). However, an agency is exempt from the general conformity determination under the CAA if its actionwould not cause new emissions to exceed certain threshold
emission rates set forth in $ 93.153(b). FMCSA determinedthat its proposed regulations would not cause emissions to
exceed the relevant threshold amounts and therefore con-cluded that the issuance of its regulations would comply with
the CAA. App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a-66a, 155a. Critical toits calculations was its consideration of only those emissions
that would occur from the increased roadside inspectionsof Mexican trucks; like its NEPA analysis, FMCSA's CAA
analysis did not consider any emissions attributable to theincreased presence of Mexican trucks within the United
States.

The EPA's rules provide that "a conformity determinationis required for each pollutant where the total of direct

and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or maintenancearea caused by a Federal action would equal or exceed"
the threshold levels established by the EPA. 40 CFR$ 93.153(b) (2003). "Direct emissions" are defined as those
covered emissions "that are caused or initiated by the Fed-eral action and occur at the same time and place as the

as to the requirements of NEPA and the CAA, and so, on the legal issues
involved in this case, Congress has been entirely silent.

action." $ 93.152. The term "[i]ndirect emissions" means
covered emissions that

"(1) Are caused by the Federal action, but may occur
later in time and/or may be further removed in distance
from the action itself but are still reasonably foreseeable; and

"(2) The Federal agency can practicably control and
will maintain control over due to a continuing program
responsibility of the Federal agency." Ibid.

Unlike the regulations implementing NEPA, the EPA's
CAA regulations have defined the term "[c]aused by." Ibid.
In particular, emissions are "[c]aused by" a federal action if
the "emissions . . . would not . . . occur in the absence of the
Federal action." Ibid. Thus, the EPA has made clear that
for purposes of evaluating causation in the conformity review
process, some sort of "but for" causation is sufficient.

Although arguably FMCSA's proposed regulations would
be "but for" causes of the entry of Mexican trucks into the
United States, the emissions from these trucks are neither
"direct" nor "indirect" emissions. First, the emissions from
the Mexican trucks are not "direct" because they will not
occur at the same time or at the same place as the promulgation of the regulations.

Second, FMCSA cannot practicably control, nor will it
maintain control, over these emissions. As discussed above,
FMCSA does not have the ability to countermand the President's decision to lift the moratorium, nor could it act categorically to prevent Mexican carriers from being registered
or Mexican trucks from entering the United States. Once
the regulations are promulgated, FMCSA would have no
ability to regulate any aspect of vehicle exhaust from these
Mexican trucks. FMCSA could not refuse to register Mexican motor carriers simply on the ground that their trucks
would pollute excessively. FMCSA cannot determine

Opinion of the Court
whether registered carriers actually will bring trucks intothe United States, cannot control the routes the carriers

take, and cannot determine what the trucks will emit. Anyreduction in emissions that would occur at the hands of
FMCSA would be mere happenstance. It cannot be saidthat FMCSA "practicably control[s]" or "will maintain control" over the vehicle emissions from the Mexican trucks, andit follows that the emissions from the Mexican trucks are not
"indirect emissions." Ibid.; see also Determining Conform-ity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans, 58 Fed. Reg. 63214, 63221 (1993) ("The EPAdoes not believe that Congress intended to extend the prohibitions and responsibilities to cases where, although licensingor approving action is a required initial step for a subsequent
activity that causes emissions, the agency has no control overthat subsequent activity").

The emissions from the Mexican trucks are neither "di-rect" nor "indirect" emissions caused by the issuance of
FMCSA's proposed regulations. Thus, FMCSA did not vio-late the CAA or the applicable regulations by failing to consider them when it evaluated whether it needed to performa full "conformity determination."

IV
FMCSA did not violate NEPA or the relevant CEQ regu-lations when it did not consider the environmental effect of

the increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor car-riers in its EA. Nor did FMCSA act improperly by not performing, pursuant to the CAA and relevant regulations, afull conformity review analysis for its proposed regulations.
We therefore reject respondents' challenge to the proceduresused in promulgating these regulations. Accordingly, the
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

CITY OF LITTLETON, COLORADO v. Z. J. GIFTS D-4,L. L. C.,

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 02-1609. Argued March 24, 2004--Decided June 7, 2004
Under petitioner city's "adult business license" ordinance, the city's decision to deny a license may be appealed to the state district court pursuant to Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Respondent Z. J. Gifts D-4,
L. L. C. (hereinafter ZJ), opened an adult bookstore in a place not zoned
for adult businesses. Instead of applying for a license, ZJ filed suit
attacking the ordinance as facially unconstitutional. The Federal District Court rejected ZJ's claims, but the Tenth Circuit held, as relevant here, that state law does not assure the constitutionally required
"prompt final judicial decision."

Held: The ordinance meets the First Amendment's requirement that such

a licensing scheme assure prompt judicial review of an administrative
decision denying a license. Pp. 778-784.

(a) The Court rejects the city's claim that its licensing scheme need
only provide prompt access to judicial review, but not a "prompt judicial
determination," of an applicant's legal claim. The city concedes that
Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 59, in listing constitutionally necessary "safeguards" applicable to a motion picture censorship statute,
spoke of the need to assure a "prompt final judicial decision," but adds
that Justice O'Connor's controlling plurality opinion in FW/PBS, Inc.
v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, which addressed an adult business licensing
scheme, did not use the word "decision," instead speaking only of the
"possibility of prompt judicial review," id., at 228 (emphasis added).
Justice O'Connor's FW/PBS opinion, however, points out that Freedman's "judicial review" safeguard is meant to prevent "undue delay,"
493 U. S., at 228, which includes judicial, as well as administrative,
delay. A delay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in
obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being "issued
within a reasonable period of time." Ibid. Nothing in the opinion suggests the contrary. Pp. 778-781.

(b) However, the Court accepts the city's claim that Colorado law satisfies any "prompt judicial determination" requirement, agreeing that
the Court should modify FW/PBS, withdrawing its implication that
Freedman's special judicial review rules--e. g., strict time limits--apply
in this case. Colorado's ordinary "judicial review" rules suffice to as541US2 Unit: $U57 [05-09-06 14:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
sure a prompt judicial decision, as long as the courts remain sensitive
to the need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer those
procedures accordingly. And whether the courts do so is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination rather than a facial challenge.
Four considerations support this conclusion. First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices give reviewing courts judicial tools sufficient
to avoid delay-related First Amendment harm. Indeed, courts may arrange their schedules to "accelerate" proceedings, and higher courts
may grant expedited review. Second, there is no reason to doubt state
judges' willingness to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm. And federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve in the event of any such
problem. Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here differs from that at issue in Freedman, diminishing the need in the typical
case for procedural rules imposing special decisionmaking time limits.
Unlike in Freedman, this ordinance does not seek to censor material.
And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary
criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an
adult business may sell or display. These criteria are simple enough to
apply and their application simple enough to review that their use is
unlikely in practice to suppress totally any specific item of adult material in the community. And the criteria's simple objective nature means
that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should prove simple, hence
expeditious. Finally, nothing in FW/PBS or Freedman requires a city
or State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that
sets forth a licensing scheme. Pp. 781-784.

II

The city of Littleton's claims rest essentially upon two arguments. First, this Court, in applying the First Amendment's procedural requirements to an "adult business"
licensing scheme in FW/PBS, found that the First Amendment required such a scheme to provide an applicant with
"prompt access" to judicial review of an administrative denial of the license, but that the First Amendment did not
require assurance of a "prompt judicial determination" of
the applicant's legal claim. Second, in any event, Colorado
law satisfies any "prompt judicial determination" requirement. We reject the first argument, but we accept the
second.

A

The city's claim that its licensing scheme need not provide
a "prompt judicial determination" of an applicant's legal
claim rests upon its reading of two of this Court's cases,
Freedman and FW/PBS. In Freedman, the Court considered the First Amendment's application to a "motion picture

Opinion of the Court
censorship statute"--a statute that required an " `owner orlessee' " of a film, prior to exhibiting a film, to submit the

film to the Maryland State Board of Censors and obtain itsapproval. 380 U. S., at 52, and n. 1 (quoting Maryland statute). It said, "a noncriminal process which requires theprior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional
infirmity only if it takes place under procedural safeguards
designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system."
Id., at 58. The Court added that those safeguards must include (1) strict time limits leading to a speedy administrativedecision and minimizing any "prior restraint"-type effects,

(2) burden of proof rules favoring speech, and (3) (using
language relevant here) a "procedure" that will "assure a
prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license."
Id., at 58-59 (emphasis added).

In FW/PBS, the Court considered the First Amendment's
application to a city ordinance that "regulates sexually oriented businesses through a scheme incorporating zoning, licensing, and inspections." 493 U. S., at 220-221. A Court
majority held that the ordinance violated the First Amendment because it did not impose strict administrative time
limits of the kind described in Freedman. In doing so, three
Members of the Court wrote that "the full procedural protections set forth in Freedman are not required," but that nonetheless such a licensing scheme must comply with Freedman's "core policy"--including (1) strict administrative time
limits and (2) (using language somewhat different from
Freedman's) "the possibility of prompt judicial review in
the event that the license is erroneously denied." 493 U. S.,
at 228 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (emphasis added). Three
other Members of the Court wrote that all Freedman's safeguards should apply, including Freedman's requirement that
"a prompt judicial determination must be available." 493
U. S., at 239 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). Three
Members of the Court wrote in dissent that Freedman's re541US2 Unit: $U57 [05-09-06 14:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
780 CITY OF LITTLETON v. Z. J. GIFTS D-4, L. L. C.

Opinion of the Court
quirements did not apply at all. See 493 U. S., at 244-245
(White, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part); id., at 250 (Scalia, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part).

The city points to the differing linguistic descriptions of
the "judicial review" requirement set forth in these opinions.
It concedes that Freedman, in listing constitutionally necessary "safeguards," spoke of the need to assure a "prompt
final judicial decision." 380 U. S., at 59. But it adds that
Justice O'Connor's controlling plurality opinion in FW/
PBS did not use the word "decision," instead speaking only
of the "possibility of prompt judicial review." 493 U. S., at
228 (emphasis added); see also id., at 229 ("an avenue for
prompt judicial review"); id., at 230 ("availability of prompt
judicial review"). This difference in language between
Freedman and FW/PBS, says the city, makes a major difference: The First Amendment, as applied to an "adult business" licensing scheme, demands only an assurance of speedy
access to the courts, not an assurance of a speedy court
decision.

In our view, however, the city's argument makes too much
of too little. While Justice O'Connor's FW/PBS plurality
opinion makes clear that only Freedman's "core" requirements apply in the context of "adult business" licensing
schemes, it does not purport radically to alter the nature
of those "core" requirements. To the contrary, the opinion,
immediately prior to its reference to the "judicial review"
safeguard, says:

"The core policy underlying Freedman is that the license for a First Amendment-protected business must
be issued within a reasonable period of time, because
undue delay results in the unconstitutional suppression
of protected speech. Thus, the first two [Freedman]
safeguards are essential . . . ." 493 U. S., at 228.

781Cite as: 541 U. S. 774 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
These words, pointing out that Freedman's "judicial review"safeguard is meant to prevent "undue delay," 493 U. S., at

228, include judicial, as well as administrative, delay. Adelay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in
obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being"issued within a reasonable period of time." Ibid. Nothing
in the opinion suggests the contrary. Thus we read thatopinion's reference to "prompt judicial review," together
with the similar reference in Justice Brennan's separateopinion ( joined by two other Justices), see

id., at 239, as en-compassing a prompt judicial decision. And we reject the

city's arguments to the contrary.

B
We find the second argument more convincing. In effectthat argument concedes the constitutional importance of assuring a "prompt" judicial decision. It concedes as well thatthe Court, illustrating what it meant by "prompt" in

Freed-man, there set forth a "model" that involved a "hearing one

day after joinder of issue" and a "decision within two daysafter termination of the hearing." 380 U. S., at 60. But the
city says that here the First Amendment nonetheless doesnot require it to impose 2- or 3-day time limits; the First
Amendment does not require special "adult business" judicialreview rules; and the First Amendment does not insist that
Littleton write detailed judicial review rules into the ordi-nance itself. In sum, Colorado's ordinary "judicial review"
rules offer adequate assurance, not only that access to thecourts can be promptly obtained, but also that a judicial

deci-sion will be promptly forthcoming.

Littleton, in effect, argues that we should modify FW/PBS, withdrawing its implication that Freedman's special
judicial review rules apply in this case. And we accept thatargument. In our view, Colorado's ordinary judicial review
procedures suffice as long as the courts remain sensitive tothe need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer

782 CITY OF LITTLETON v. Z. J. GIFTS D-4, L. L. C.

Opinion of the Court
those procedures accordingly. And whether the courts doso is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination

rather than a facial challenge. We reach this conclusion forseveral reasons.

First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices, inColorado as elsewhere, provide reviewing courts with judicial tools sufficient to avoid delay-related First Amendment
harm. Indeed, where necessary, courts may arrange theirschedules to "accelerate" proceedings. Colo. Rule Civ. Proc.

106(a)(4)(VIII) (2003). And higher courts may quickly re-view adverse lower court decisions. See,

e. g., Goebel v. Colorado Dept. of Institutions, 764 P. 2d 785, 792 (Colo. 1988)
(en banc) (granting "expedited review").

Second, we have no reason to doubt the willingness of Colorado's judges to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid
serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm.
We presume that courts are aware of the constitutional need
to avoid "undue delay result[ing] in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech." FW/PBS, supra, at 228; see
also, e. g., Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 756
(1975). There is no evidence before us of any special Colorado court-related problem in this respect. And were there
some such problems, federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve. See Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here
differs from that at issue in Freedman, diminishing the need
in the typical case for special procedural rules imposing special 2- or 3-day decisionmaking time limits. Freedman considered a Maryland statute that created a Board of Censors,
which had to decide whether a film was " `pornographic,' "
tended to " `debase or corrupt morals,' " and lacked " `whatever other merits.' " 380 U. S., at 52-53, n. 2 (quoting Maryland statute). If so, it denied the permit and the film could
not be shown. Thus, in Freedman, the Court considered a
scheme with rather subjective standards and where a denial
likely meant complete censorship.

783Cite as: 541 U. S. 774 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
In contrast, the ordinance at issue here does not seek to
censor material. And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to thecontent of the expressive materials that an adult business

may sell or display. The ordinance says that an adult busi-ness license

"shall" be denied if the applicant (1) is underage;
(2) provides false information; (3) has within the prior year
had an adult business license revoked or suspended; (4) hasoperated an adult business determined to be a state law

"public nuisance" within the prior year; (5) (if a corporation)is not authorized to do business in the State; (6) has not
timely paid taxes, fees, fines, or penalties; (7) has not obtained a sales tax license (for which zoning compliance is required, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17); or (8) has been convicted
of certain crimes within the prior five years. $ 3-14-8(A),
App. to Brief for Petitioner 28a-29a (emphasis added).

These objective criteria are simple enough to apply and
their application simple enough to review that their use is
unlikely in practice to suppress totally the presence of any
specific item of adult material in the Littleton community.
Some license applicants will satisfy the criteria even if others
do not; hence the community will likely contain outlets that
sell protected adult material. A supplier of that material
should be able to find outlets; a potential buyer should be
able to find a seller. Nor should zoning requirements suppress that material, for a constitutional zoning system seeks
to determine where, not whether, protected adult material
can be sold. See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475
U. S. 41, 46 (1986). The upshot is that Littleton's "adult
business" licensing scheme does "not present the grave `dangers of a censorship system.' " FW/PBS, 493 U. S., at 228
(opinion of O'Connor, J.) (quoting Freedman, supra, at 58).
And the simple objective nature of the licensing criteria
means that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should
prove simple, hence expeditious. Where that is not so--
where, for example, censorship of material, as well as delay

784 CITY OF LITTLETON v. Z. J. GIFTS D-4, L. L. C.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
in opening an additional outlet, is improperly threatened--the courts are able to act to prevent that harm.

Fourth, nothing in FW/PBS or in Freedman requires acity or a State to place judicial review safeguards all in the
city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme. Freedmanitself said: "How or whether Maryland is to incorporate the
required procedural safeguards in the statutory scheme is,of course, for the State to decide." 380 U. S., at 60. This
statement is not surprising given the fact that many citiesand towns lack the state-law legal authority to impose deadlines on state courts.These four sets of considerations, taken together, indicate
that Colorado's ordinary rules of judicial review are ade-quate--at least for purposes of this facial challenge to the
ordinance. Where (as here and as in FW/PBS) the regu-lation simply conditions the operation of an adult business
on compliance with neutral and nondiscretionary criteria,cf.

post, at 785 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment), and does not seek to censor content, an

adult business is not entitled to an unusually speedy judicialdecision of the

Freedman type. Colorado's rules provide fora flexible system of review in which judges can reach a decision promptly in the ordinary case, while using their judicialpower to prevent significant harm to First Amendment interests where circumstances require. Of course, those de-nied licenses in the future remain free to raise special problems of undue delay in individual cases as the ordinance isapplied.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Tenth Circuit is

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

There is an important difference between an ordinanceconditioning the operation of a business on compliance with
certain neutral criteria, on the one hand, and an ordinance

541US2 Unit: $U57 [05-09-06 14:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

785Cite as: 541 U. S. 774 (2004)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
conditioning the exhibition of a motion picture on the consent
of a censor. The former is an aspect of the routine operation of a municipal government. The latter is a species of
content-based prior restraint. Cf. Graff v. Chicago, 9 F. 3d
1309, 1330-1333 (CA7 1993) (Flaum, J., concurring).

The First Amendment is, of course, implicated whenever
a city requires a bookstore, a newsstand, a theater, or an
adult business to obtain a license before it can begin to operate. For that reason, as Justice O'Connor explained in
her plurality opinion in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S.
215, 226 (1990), a licensing scheme for businesses that engage
in First Amendment activity must be accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards to avert "the possibility that
constitutionally protected speech will be suppressed." But
Justice O'Connor's opinion also recognized that the full
complement of safeguards that are necessary in cases that
"present the grave `dangers of a censorship system' " are
"not required" in the ordinary adult-business licensing
scheme. Id., at 228 (quoting Freedman v. Maryland, 380
U. S. 51, 58 (1965)). In both contexts, "undue delay results
in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech," 493
U. S., at 228, and FW/PBS therefore requires both that the
licensing decision be made promptly and that there be "the
possibility of prompt judicial review in the event that the
license is erroneously denied," ibid. But application of
neutral licensing criteria is a "ministerial action" that regulates speech, rather than an exercise of discretionary judgment that prohibits speech. Id., at 229. The decision to
deny a license for failure to comply with these neutral criteria is therefore not subject to the presumption of invalidity
that attaches to the "direct censorship of particular expressive material." Ibid. Justice O'Connor's opinion accordingly declined to require that the licensor, like the censor,
either bear the burden of going to court to effect the denial
of a license or otherwise assume responsibility for ensuring

786 CITY OF LITTLETON v. Z. J. GIFTS D-4, L. L. C.

Opinion of Souter, J.
a prompt judicial determination of the validity of its deci-sion.

Ibid.
The Court today reinterprets FW/PBS's references to
" `the possibility of prompt judicial review' " as the equivalent of Freedman's " `prompt' judicial decision" requirement.
Ante, at 780-781. I fear that this misinterpretation of FW/
PBS may invite other, more serious misinterpretations with
respect to the content of that requirement. As the Courtapplies it in this case, assurance of a " `prompt' judicial decision" means little more than assurance of the possibility ofa prompt decision--the same possibility of promptness that
is available whenever a person files suit subject to "ordinarycourt procedural rules and practices."

Ante, at 781-782.
That possibility will generally be sufficient to guard against
the risk of undue delay in obtaining a remedy for the erroneous application of neutral licensing criteria. But the
mere possibility of promptness is emphatically insufficient
to guard against the dangers of unjustified suppression of
speech presented by a censorship system of the type at issue
in Freedman, and is certainly not what Freedman meant by
" `prompt' judicial decision."

Justice O'Connor's opinion in FW/PBS recognized that
differences between ordinary licensing schemes and censorship systems warrant imposition of different procedural protections, including different requirements with respect to
which party must assume the burden of taking the case to
court, as well as the risk of judicial delay. I would adhere
to the views there expressed, and thus do not join Part II-A
of the Court's opinion. I do, however, join the Court's judgment and Parts I and II-B of its opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join the Court's opinion, except for Part II-B. I agree
that this scheme is unlike full-blown censorship, ante, at 782-
784, so that the ordinance does not need a strict timetable of

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
the kind required by Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51(1965), to survive a facial challenge. I write separately to

emphasize that the state procedures that make a prompt ju-dicial determination possible need to align with a state judicial practice that provides a prompt disposition in the statecourts. The emphasis matters, because although Littleton's
ordinance is not as suspect as censorship, neither is it as
innocuous as common zoning. It is a licensing scheme trig-gered by the content of expressive materials to be sold. See

Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 448 (2002)(

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) ("These ordinances
are content based, and we should call them so"); id., at 455-457 (

Souter, J., dissenting). Because the sellers may be unpopular with local authorities, there is a risk of delay in the
licensing and review process. If there is evidence of foot
dragging, immediate judicial intervention will be required,
and judicial oversight or review at any stage of the proceedings must be expeditious.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
Were the respondent engaged in activity protected by the
First Amendment, I would agree with the Court's disposition
of the question presented by the facts of this case (though
not with all of the Court's reasoning). Such activity, when
subjected to a general permit requirement unrelated to censorship of content, has no special claim to priority in the
judicial process. The notion that media corporations have
constitutional entitlement to accelerated judicial review of
the denial of zoning variances is absurd.

I do not believe, however, that Z. J. Gifts is engaged in
activity protected by the First Amendment. I adhere to the
view I expressed in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215,
250 (1990) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part):
the pandering of sex is not protected by the First Amendment. "The Constitution does not require a State or municipality to permit a business that intentionally specializes in,

and holds itself forth to the public as specializing in, perform-ance or portrayal of sex acts, sexual organs in a state of

arousal, or live human nudity." Id., at 258. This representsthe Nation's long understanding of the First Amendment,
recognized and adopted by this Court's opinion in Ginzburgv. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 470-471 (1966). Littleton's
ordinance targets sex-pandering businesses, see LittletonCity Code $ 3-14-2 (2003); to the extent it could apply to
constitutionally protected expression its excess is not sogreat as to render it substantially overbroad and thus subject to facial invalidation, see FW/PBS, 493 U. S., at 261-262.Since the city of Littleton "could constitutionally have proscribed the commercial activities that it chose instead to li-cense, I do not think the details of its licensing scheme had
to comply with First Amendment standards." Id., at 253.

Memorandum of Scalia, J. 541 U. S.
The other private respondent, Judicial Watch, Inc., does not jointhe motion and has publicly stated that it "does not believe the
presently-known facts about the hunting trip satisfy the legalstandards requiring recusal." Judicial Watch Statement 2 (Feb.
13, 2004) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). (The DistrictCourt, a nominal party in this mandamus action, has of course
made no appearance.) Since the cases have been consolidated,however, recusal in the one would entail recusal in the other.

I
The decision whether a judge's impartiality can " `reasonably bequestioned' " is to be made in light of the facts as they existed,

and not as they were surmised or reported. See Microsoft Corp.v. United States, 530 U. S. 1301, 1302 (2000) (Rehnquist, C. J.,
respecting recusal). The facts here were as follows:For five years or so, I have been going to Louisiana during the
Court's long December-January recess, to the duck-hunting campof a friend whom I met through two hunting companions from
Baton Rouge, one a dentist and the other a worker in the field ofhandicapped rehabilitation. The last three years, I have been
accompanied on this trip by a son-in-law who lives near me. Ourfriend and host, Wallace Carline, has never, as far as I know,
had business before this Court. He is not, as some reports havedescribed him, an "energy industry executive" in the sense that
summons up boardrooms of ExxonMobil or Con Edison. He runshis own company that provides services and equipment rental to
oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.During my December 2002 visit, I learned that Mr. Carline was
an admirer of Vice President Cheney. Knowing that the VicePresident, with whom I am well acquainted (from our years serving together in the Ford administration), is an enthusiastic duckhunter, I asked whether Mr. Carline would like to invite him to
our next year's hunt. The answer was yes; I conveyed the invita-tion (with my own warm recommendation) in the spring of 2003
and received an acceptance (subject, of course, to any supersedingdemands on the Vice President's time) in the summer. The Vice
President said that if he did go, I would be welcome to fly downto Louisiana with him. (Because of national security requirements, of course, he must fly in a Government plane.) That invi-tation was later extended--if space was available--to my son-inlaw and to a son who was joining the hunt for the first time;

they accepted. The trip was set long before the Court grantedcertiorari in the present case, and indeed before the petition for
certiorari had even been filed.We departed from Andrews Air Force Base at about 10 a.m.
on Monday, January 5, flying in a Gulfstream jet owned by theGovernment. We landed in Patterson, Louisiana, and went by
car to a dock where Mr. Carline met us, to take us on the 20-minute boat trip to his hunting camp. We arrived at about 2
p.m., the 5 of us joining about 8 other hunters, making about 13hunters in all; also present during our time there were about 3
members of Mr. Carline's staff, and, of course, the Vice President'sstaff and security detail. It was not an intimate setting. The
group hunted that afternoon and Tuesday and Wednesday morn-ings; it fished (in two boats) Tuesday afternoon. All meals were
in common. Sleeping was in rooms of two or three, except forthe Vice President, who had his own quarters. Hunting was in
two- or three-man blinds. As it turned out, I never hunted inthe same blind with the Vice President. Nor was I alone with
him at any time during the trip, except, perhaps, for instances sobrief and unintentional that I would not recall them--walking to
or from a boat, perhaps, or going to or from dinner. Of coursewe said not a word about the present case. The Vice President
left the camp Wednesday afternoon, about two days after ourarrival. I stayed on to hunt (with my son and son-in-law) until
late Friday morning, when the three of us returned to Washingtonon a commercial flight from New Orleans.

Let me respond, at the outset, to Sierra Club's suggestion thatI should "resolve any doubts in favor of recusal." Motion to

Recuse 8. That might be sound advice if I were sitting on aCourt of Appeals. But see In re Aguinda, 241 F. 3d 194, 201
(CA2 2001). There, my place would be taken by another judge,and the case would proceed normally. On the Supreme Court,
however, the consequence is different: The Court proceeds witheight Justices, raising the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote,
it will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue pre-sented by the case. Thus, as Justices stated in their 1993 Statement of Recusal Policy: "We do not think it would serve thepublic interest to go beyond the requirements of the statute, and
to recuse ourselves, out of an excess of caution, whenever a rela541ORD Unit: $PT1 [04-12-06 15:56:00] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

tive is a partner in the firm before us or acted as a lawyer at anearlier stage. Even one unnecessary recusal impairs the functioning of the Court." (Available in Clerk of Court's case file.)Moreover, granting the motion is (insofar as the outcome of the
particular case is concerned) effectively the same as casting avote against the petitioner. The petitioner needs five votes to
overturn the judgment below, and it makes no difference whetherthe needed fifth vote is missing because it has been cast for the
other side, or because it has not been cast at all.Even so, recusal is the course I must take--and will take--
when, on the basis of established principles and practices, I havesaid or done something which requires that course. I have recused for such a reason this very Term. See Elk Grove UnifiedSchool Dist. v. Newdow, 540 U. S. 945 (cert. granted, Oct. 14,
2003). I believe, however, that established principles and prac-tices do not require (and thus do not permit) recusal in the present case. A

My recusal is required if, by reason of the actions describedabove, my "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." 28
U. S. C. $ 455(a). Why would that result follow from my being ina sizable group of persons, in a hunting camp with the Vice President, where I never hunted with him in the same blind or hadother opportunity for private conversation? The only possibility
is that it would suggest I am a friend of his. But while friendshipis a ground for recusal of a Justice where the personal fortune or
the personal freedom of the friend is at issue, it has traditionally
not been a ground for recusal where official action is at issue, nomatter how important the official action was to the ambitions or

the reputation of the Government officer.A rule that required Members of this Court to remove themselves from cases in which the official actions of friends were atissue would be utterly disabling. Many Justices have reached
this Court precisely because they were friends of the incumbentPresident or other senior officials--and from the earliest days
down to modern times Justices have had close personal relation-ships with the President and other officers of the Executive.

no-friends rule would have disqualified much of the Court inYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952), the
case that challenged President Truman's seizure of the steel mills.Most of the Justices knew Truman well, and four had been appointed by him. A no-friends rule would surely have requiredJustice Holmes's recusal in Northern Securities Co. v. United
States, 193 U. S. 197 (1904), the case that challenged PresidentTheodore Roosevelt's trust-busting initiative. See S. Novick,
Honorable Justice: The Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes 264 (1989)("Holmes and Fanny dined at the White House every week or
two . . .").It is said, however, that this case is different because the federal officer (Vice President Cheney) is actually a named party.That is by no means a rarity. At the beginning of the current
Term, there were before the Court (excluding habeas actions) nofewer than 83 cases in which high-level federal Executive officers
were named in their official capacity--more than 1 in every 10federal civil cases then pending. That an officer is named has
traditionally made no difference to the proposition that friendshipis not considered to affect impartiality in official-action suits. Regardless of whom they name, such suits, when the officer is theplaintiff, seek relief not for him personally but for the Government; and, when the officer is the defendant, seek relief notagainst him personally, but against the Government. That is why
federal law provides for automatic substitution of the new officerwhen the originally named officer has been replaced. See Fed.

official capacity as Vice President of the United States and Chair-man of the National Energy Policy Development Group." App.
139 (emphasis added). The body of the complaint repeats (inparagraph 6) that "Defendant Richard Cheney is sued in his official capacity as the Vice President of the United States andChairman of the Cheney Energy Task Force." Id., at 143 (emphasis added). Sierra Club has relied upon the fact that this isan official-action rather than a personal suit as a basis for denying
the petition. It asserted in its brief in opposition that if therewas no Presidential immunity from discovery in Clinton v. Jones,
520 U. S. 681 (1997), which was a private suit, "[s]urely . . . theVice President and subordinate White House officials have no
greater immunity claim here, especially when the lawsuit relatesto their official actions while in office and the primary relief
sought is a declaratory judgment." Brief in Opposition 13.Richard Cheney's name appears in this suit only because he
was the head of a Government committee that allegedly did notcomply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5
U. S. C. App. $ 2, p. 1, and because he may, by reason of his office,have custody of some or all of the Government documents that
the plaintiffs seek. If some other person were to become headof that committee or to obtain custody of those documents, the
plaintiffs would name that person and Cheney would be dismissed.Unlike the defendant in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683
(1974), or Clinton v. Jones, supra, Cheney is represented here, notby his personal attorney, but by the United States Department of
Justice in the person of the Solicitor General. And the courts atall levels have referred to his arguments as (what they are) the
arguments of "the government." See In re Cheney, 334 F. 3d1096, 1100 (CADC 2003); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy
Policy Development Group, 219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 25 (DC 2002).The recusal motion, however, asserts the following:

"Critical to the issue of Justice Scalia's recusal is understand-ing that this is not a run-of-the-mill legal dispute about an
administrative decision. . . . Because his own conduct is cen-tral to this case, the Vice President's `reputation and his
integrity are on the line.' (Chicago Tribune.)" Motion toRecuse 9.

I think not. Certainly as far as the legal issues immediatelypresented to me are concerned, this is "a run-of-the-mill legal

dispute about an administrative decision." I am asked to deter-mine what powers the District Court possessed under FACA, and
whether the Court of Appeals should have asserted mandamusor appellate jurisdiction over the District Court.

1 Nothing this

Court says on those subjects will have any bearing upon thereputation and integrity of Richard Cheney. Moreover, even if

this Court affirms the decision below and allows discovery toproceed in the District Court, the issue that would ultimately
present itself still would have no bearing upon the reputation andintegrity of Richard Cheney. That issue would be, quite simply,
whether some private individuals were de facto members of theNational Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG). It matters not whether they were caused to be so by Cheney or someoneelse, or whether Cheney was even aware of their de facto status;
if they were de facto members, then (according to D. C. Circuitlaw) the records and minutes of NEPDG must be made public.

The recusal motion asserts, however, that Richard Cheney's" `reputation and his integrity are on the line' " because

"respondents have alleged, inter alia, that the Vice Presi-dent, as the head of the Task Force and its sub-groups, was
responsible for the involvement of energy industry executivesin the operations of the Task Force, as a result of which the
Task Force and its sub-groups became subject to FACA."Ibid.

As far as Sierra Club's complaint is concerned, it simply is nottrue that Vice President Cheney is singled out as having caused
the involvement of energy executives. But even if the allegationhad been made, it would be irrelevant to the case. FACA assertedly requires disclosure if there were private members of the task

force, no matter who they were--"energy industry executives"or Ralph Nader; and no matter who was responsible for their
membership--the Vice President or no one in particular. I donot see how the Vice President's " `reputation and . . . integrity
are on the line' " any more than the agency head's reputation andintegrity are on the line in virtually all official-action suits, which
accuse his agency of acting (to quote the Administrative Pro-cedure Act) "arbitrar[ily], capricious[ly], [with] an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U. S. C.$ 706(2)(A). Beyond that always-present accusation, there is
nothing illegal or immoral about making "energy industry execu-tives" members of a task force on energy; some people probably
think it would be a good idea. If, in doing so, or in allowing itto happen, the Vice President went beyond his assigned powers,
that is no worse than what every agency head has done when hisaction is judicially set aside.

To be sure, there could be political consequences from disclosureof the fact (if it be so) that the Vice President favored business
interests, and especially a sector of business with which he wasformerly connected. But political consequences are not my concern, and the possibility of them does not convert an official suitinto a private one. That possibility exists to a greater or lesser
degree in virtually all suits involving agency action. To expectjudges to take account of political consequences--and to assess
the high or low degree of them--is to ask judges to do preciselywhat they should not do. It seems to me quite wrong (and quite
impossible) to make recusal depend upon what degree of politicaldamage a particular case can be expected to inflict.

In sum, I see nothing about this case which takes it out of thecategory of normal official-action litigation, where my friendship,
or the appearance of my friendship, with one of the named officersdoes not require recusal.

B
The recusal motion claims that "the fact that Justice Scalia andhis daughter

[sic] were the Vice President's guest on Air ForceTwo on the flight down to Louisiana" means that I "accepted a

sizable gift from a party in a pending case," a gift "measured inthe thousands of dollars." Motion to Recuse 6 (footnote omitted).

Let me speak first to the value, though that is not the princi-pal point. Our flight down cost the Government nothing, since

541ORD Unit: $PT1 [04-12-06 15:56:00] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

921ORDERS
Memorandum of Scalia, J.913
space-available was the condition of our invitation. And, thoughour flight down on the Vice President's plane was indeed free,
since we were not returning with him we purchased (becausethey were least expensive) round-trip tickets that cost precisely
what we would have paid if we had gone both down and back oncommercial flights. In other words, none of us saved a cent by
flying on the Vice President's plane. The purpose of going withhim was not saving money, but avoiding some inconvenience to
ourselves (being taken by car from New Orleans to Morgan City)and considerable inconvenience to our friends, who would have
had to meet our plane in New Orleans, and schedule separateboat trips to the hunting camp, for us and for the Vice President's
party. (To be sure, flying on the Vice President's jet was morecomfortable and more convenient than flying commercially; that
accommodation is a matter I address in the next paragraph.) 2The principal point, however, is that social courtesies, provided
at Government expense by officials whose only business beforethe Court is business in their official capacity, have not hitherto
been thought prohibited. Members of Congress and others arefrequently invited to accompany Executive Branch officials on
Government planes, where space is available. That this is notthe sort of gift thought likely to affect a judge's impartiality is
suggested by the fact that the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,5 U. S. C. App. $ 101 et seq., p. 38, which requires annual reporting
of transportation provided or reimbursed, excludes from this re-quirement transportation provided by the United States. See

$ 109(5)(C); Committee on Financial Disclosure, AdministrativeOffice of the U. S. Courts, Financial Disclosure Report: Filing
Instructions for Judicial Officers and Employees 25 (Jan. 2003).I daresay that, at a hypothetical charity auction, much more
would be bid for dinner for two at the White House than for aone-way flight to Louisiana on the Vice President's jet. Justices
accept the former with regularity. While this matter was pend-ing, Justices and their spouses were invited (all of them, I believe)

2 As my statement of the facts indicated, by the way, my daughter did not
accompany me. My married son and son-in-law were given a ride--not be-cause they were relatives and as a favor to me; but because they were other

hunters leaving from Washington, and as a favor to them (and to those whowould have had to go to New Orleans to meet them). Had they been unrelated invitees to the hunt, the same would undoubtedly have occurred. Fi-nancially, the flight was worth as little to them as it was to me.

to a December 11, 2003, Christmas reception at the residence ofthe Vice President--which included an opportunity for a photograph with the Vice President and Mrs. Cheney. Several of theJustices attended, and in doing so they were fully in accord with
the proprieties. III

When I learned that Sierra Club had filed a recusal motion inthis case, I assumed that the motion would be replete with citations of legal authority, and would provide some instances of casesin which, because of activity similar to what occurred here, Justices have recused themselves or at least have been asked to doso. In fact, however, the motion cites only two Supreme Court
cases assertedly relevant to the issue here discussed,3 and nineCourt of Appeals cases. Not a single one of these even involves
an official-action suit.4 And the motion gives not a single in-stance in which, under even remotely similar circumstances, a
Justice has recused or been asked to recuse. Instead, the argument section of the motion consists almost entirely of referencesto, and quotations from, newspaper editorials.

The core of Sierra Club's argument is as follows:
3 The motion cites a third Supreme Court case, Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440 (1989), as a case involving FACA in which Irecused myself. It speculates (1) that the reason for recusal was that as

Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel I had providedan opinion which concluded that applying FACA to presidential advisory
committees was unconstitutional; and asserts (2) that this would also begrounds for my recusal here. My opinion as Assistant Attorney General
addressed the precise question presented in Public Citizen: whether theAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which
provided advice to the President concerning judicial nominees, could be reg-ulated as an "advisory committee" under FACA. I concluded that my withdrawal from the case was required by 28 U. S. C. $ 455(b)(3), which mandatesrecusal where the judge "has served in governmental employment and in
such capacity . . . expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particu-lar case in controversy." I have never expressed an opinion concerning the
merits of the present case.

4 United States v. Murphy, 768 F. 2d 1518 (CA7 1985), at least involved a

judge's going on vacation--but not with the named defendant in an official-action suit. The judge had departed for a vacation with the prosecutor of

Murphy's case, immediately after sentencing Murphy. Obviously, the prose-cutor is personally involved in the outcome of the case in a way that the
nominal defendant in an official-action suit is not.

"Sierra Club makes this motion because . . . damage [to theintegrity of the system] is being done right now. As of today,
8 of the 10 newspapers with the largest circulation in theUnited States, 14 of the largest 20, and 20 of the 30 largest
have called on Justice Scalia to step aside . . . . Of equalimport, there is no counterbalance or controversy: not a single newspaper has argued against recusal. Because theAmerican public, as reflected in the nation's newspaper editorials, has unanimously concluded that there is an appearanceof favoritism, any objective observer would be compelled to
conclude that Justice Scalia's impartiality has been ques-tioned. These facts more than satisfy Section 455(a), which
mandates recusal merely when a Justice's impartiality `mightreasonably be questioned.' " Motion to Recuse 3-4.

The implications of this argument are staggering. I must recusebecause a significant portion of the press, which is deemed to be
the American public, demands it.The motion attaches as exhibits the press editorials on which
it relies. Many of them do not even have the facts right. Thelength of our hunting trip together was said to be several days
(San Francisco Chronicle), four days (Boston Globe), or nine days(San Antonio Express-News). We spent about 48 hours together
at the hunting camp. It was asserted that the Vice Presidentand I "spent time alone in the rushes," "huddled together in a
Louisiana marsh," where we had "plenty of time . . . to talkprivately" (Los Angeles Times); that we "spent . . . quality time
bonding [together] in a duck blind" (Atlanta Journal-Constitution);and that "[t]here is simply no reason to think these two did not
discuss the pending case" (Buffalo News). As I have described,the Vice President and I were never in the same blind, and never
discussed the case. (Washington officials know the rules, andknow that discussing with judges pending cases--their own or
anyone else's--is forbidden.) The Palm Beach Post stated thatour "transportation [was] provided, appropriately, by an oil services company," and Newsday that a "private jet . . . whiskedScalia to Louisiana." The Vice President and I flew in a Government plane. The Cincinnati Enquirer said that "Scalia was Chen-ey's guest at a private duck-hunting camp in Louisiana." Cheney
and I were Wallace Carline's guests. Various newspapers de-scribed Mr. Carline as "an energy company official" (Atlanta

Journal-Constitution), an "oil industrialist" (Cincinnati Enquirer),an "oil company executive" (Contra Costa Times), an "oilman"
(Minneapolis Star Tribune), and an "energy industry executive"(Washington Post). All of these descriptions are misleading.

And these are just the inaccuracies pertaining to the facts.With regard to the law, the vast majority of the editorials display
no recognition of the central proposition that a federal officer isnot ordinarily regarded to be a personal party in interest in an
official-action suit. And those that do display such recognitionfacilely assume, contrary to all precedent, that in such suits mere
political damage (which they characterize as a destruction ofCheney's reputation and integrity) is ground for recusal. Such a
blast of largely inaccurate and uninformed opinion cannot deter-mine the recusal question. It is well established that the recusal
inquiry must be "made from the perspective of a reasonable ob-server who is informed of all the surrounding facts and circumstances." Microsoft Corp. v. United States, 530 U. S., at 1302(Rehnquist, C. J., respecting recusal) (emphases added) (citing
Liteky v. United States, 510 U. S. 540, 548 (1994)).

IV
While Sierra Club was apparently unable to summon forth asingle example of a Justice's recusal (or even motion for a Justice's

recusal) under circumstances similar to those here, I have beenable to accomplish the seemingly more difficult task of finding a
couple of examples establishing the negative: that recusal or mo-tion for recusal did not occur under circumstances similar to
those here.
Justice White and Robert Kennedy

The first example pertains to a Justice with whom I have sat,and who retired from the Court only 11 years ago, Byron R.

White. Justice White was close friends with Attorney GeneralRobert Kennedy from the days when White had served as Kennedy's Deputy Attorney General. In January 1963, the Justice wenton a skiing vacation in Colorado with Robert Kennedy and his
family, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and his family,and other members of the Kennedy family. Skiing Not The Best;
McNamara Leaves Colorado, Terms Vacation "Marvelous," Den-ver Post, Jan. 2, 1963, p. 22; D. Hutchinson, The Man Who Once
Was Whizzer White 342 (1998). (The skiing in Colorado, like my

541ORD Unit: $PT1 [04-12-06 15:56:00] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

925ORDERS
Memorandum of Scalia, J.913
hunting in Louisiana, was not particularly successful.) At thetime of this skiing vacation there were pending before the Court
at least two cases in which Robert Kennedy, in his official capacityas Attorney General, was a party. See Gastelum-Quinones v.
Kennedy, 374 U. S. 469 (1963); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372U. S. 144 (1963). In the first of these, moreover, the press might
have said, as plausibly as it has said here, that the reputationand integrity of the Attorney General were at issue. There the
Department of Justice had decreed deportation of a resident alienon grounds that he had been a member of the Communist Party.
(The Court found that the evidence adduced by the Departmentwas inadequate.)

Besides these cases naming Kennedy, another case pending atthe time of the skiing vacation was argued to the Court by Kennedy about two weeks later. See Gray v. Sanders, 372 U. S. 368(1963). That case was important to the Kennedy administration,
because by the time of its argument everybody knew that theapportionment cases were not far behind, and Gray was a significant step in the march toward Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533(1964). When the decision was announced, it was front-page
news. See High Court Voids County Unit Vote, N. Y. Times,Mar. 19, 1963, p. 1, col. 2; Georgia's Unit Voting Voided, Washington Post, Mar. 19, 1963, p. A1, col. 5. Attorney General Kennedyargued for affirmance of a three-judge District Court's ruling that
the Georgia Democratic Party's county-unit voting system vio-lated the one-person, one-vote principle. This was Kennedy's
only argument before the Court, and it certainly put "on the line"his reputation as a lawyer, as well as an important policy of his
brother's administration.
Justice Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt

The second example pertains to a Justice who was one of themost distinguished occupants of the seat to which I was appointed, Robert Jackson. Justice Jackson took the recusal obliga-tion particularly seriously. See, e. g., Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v.
United Mine Workers, 325 U. S. 897 (1945) (Jackson, J., concurringin denial of rehearing) (oblique criticism of Justice Black's decision
not to recuse himself from a case argued by his former law part-ner). Nonetheless, he saw nothing wrong with maintaining a
close personal relationship, and engaging in " `quite frequen[t]' "socializing with the President whose administration's acts came

before him regularly. R. Jackson, That Man: An Insider's Por-trait of Franklin D. Roosevelt 74 (J. Barrett ed. 2003) (footnote
omitted).In April 1942, the two "spent a weekend on a very delightful
house party down at General Watson's in Charlottesville, Virginia.I had been invited to ride down with the President and to ride
back with him." Id., at 106 (footnote omitted). Pending at thetime, and argued the next month, was one of the most important
cases concerning the scope of permissible federal action underthe Commerce Clause, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942).
Justice Jackson wrote the opinion for the Court. Roosevelt's Sec-retary of Agriculture, rather than Roosevelt himself, was the
named federal officer in the case, but there is no doubt that itwas important to the President.

I see nothing wrong about Justice White's and Justice Jackson'ssocializing--including vacationing and accepting rides--with their
friends. Nor, seemingly, did anyone else at the time. (The Den-ver Post, which has been critical of me, reported the WhiteKennedy-McNamara skiing vacation with nothing but enthusi-asm.) If friendship is basis for recusal (as it assuredly is when
friends are sued personally) then activity which suggests closefriendship must be avoided. But if friendship is no basis for
recusal (as it is not in official-capacity suits) social contacts thatdo no more than evidence that friendship suggest no impropriety whatever.Of course it can be claimed (as some editorials have claimed)
that "times have changed," and what was once consideredproper--even as recently as Byron White's day--is no longer so.
That may be true with regard to the earlier rare phenomenon ofa Supreme Court Justice's serving as advisor and confidant to the
President--though that activity, so incompatible with the separa-tion of powers, was not widely known when it was occurring, and
can hardly be said to have been generally approved before it wasproperly abandoned. But the well-known and constant practice
of Justices' enjoying friendship and social intercourse with Mem-bers of Congress and officers of the Executive Branch has not
been abandoned, and ought not to be.

V
Since I do not believe my impartiality can reasonably be ques-tioned, I do not think it would be proper for me to recuse. See

927ORDERS
Memorandum of Scalia, J.913
Microsoft, 530 U. S., at 1302. That alone is conclusive; but an-other consideration moves me in the same direction: Recusal
would in my judgment harm the Court. If I were to withdrawfrom this case, it would be because some of the press has argued
that the Vice President would suffer political damage if he shouldlose this appeal, and if, on remand, discovery should establish
that energy industry representatives were de facto members ofNEPDG--and because some of the press has elevated that possible political damage to the status of an impending stain on thereputation and integrity of the Vice President. But since political
damage often comes from the Government's losing official-actionsuits; and since political damage can readily be characterized as
a stain on reputation and integrity; recusing in the face of suchcharges would give elements of the press a veto over participation
of any Justices who had social contacts with, or were even knownto be friends of, a named official. That is intolerable.

My recusal would also encourage so-called investigative journal-ists to suggest improprieties, and demand recusals, for other inappropriate (and increasingly silly) reasons. The Los AngelesTimes has already suggested that it was improper for me to sit
on a case argued by a law school dean whose school I had visitedseveral weeks before--visited not at his invitation, but at his
predecessor's. See New Trip Trouble for Scalia, Feb. 28, 2004,p. B22. The same paper has asserted that it was improper for
me to speak at a dinner honoring Cardinal Bevilacqua given bythe Urban Family Council of Philadelphia because (according to
the Times's false report) 5 that organization was engaged in litiga5 The Times's reporter had interviewed the former president of the Urban
Family Council, who told him categorically that the council was neither aparty to, nor had provided financial support for, the civil-union litigation.

The filed papers in the case, publicly available, showed that the council wasnot a party. The Los Angeles Times nonetheless devoted a lengthy frontpage article to the point that (in the words of the lead sentence) "JusticeAntonin Scalia gave a keynote dinner speech in Philadelphia for an advocacy
group waging a legal battle against gay rights." Serrano & Savage, ScaliaAddressed Advocacy Group Before Key Decision, Mar. 8, 2004, at A1. Five
days later, in a weekend edition, the paper printed (at the insistence of thecouncil) a few-line retraction acknowledging that this asserted fact was
wrong--as though it was merely one incidental fact in a long piece, ratherthan the central fact upon which the long piece was based, and without
which there was no story. See For the Record, Mar. 13, 2004, at A2. Otherinaccurate facts and insinuations in the article, brought to the paper's atten541ORD Unit: $PT1 [04-12-06 15:56:00] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

Memorandum of Scalia, J. 541 U. S.
tion seeking to prevent same-sex civil unions, and I had beforeme a case presenting the question (whether same-sex civil unions
were lawful?--no) whether homosexual sodomy could constitution-ally be criminalized. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558
(2003). While the political branches can perhaps survive the con-stant baseless allegations of impropriety that have become the
staple of Washington reportage, this Court cannot. The peoplemust have confidence in the integrity of the Justices, and that
cannot exist in a system that assumes them to be corruptible bythe slightest friendship or favor, and in an atmosphere where the
press will be eager to find foot-faults.

* * *
As I noted at the outset, one of the private respondents in thiscase has not called for my recusal, and has expressed confidence

that I will rule impartially, as indeed I will. Counsel for theother private respondent seek to impose, it seems to me, a standard regarding friendship, the appearance of friendship, and theacceptance of social favors, that is more stringent than what they
themselves observe. Two days before the brief in opposition tothe petition in this case was filed, lead counsel for Sierra Club, a
friend, wrote me a warm note inviting me to come to StanfordLaw School to speak to one of his classes. (Available in Clerk of
Court's case file.) (Judges teaching classes at law schools nor-mally have their transportation and expenses paid.) I saw nothing amiss in that friendly letter and invitation. I surely wouldhave thought otherwise if I had applied the standards urged in
the present motion.There are, I am sure, those who believe that my friendship
with persons in the current administration might cause me tofavor the Government in cases brought against it. That is not
the issue here. Nor is the issue whether personal friendship withthe Vice President might cause me to favor the Government in
cases in which he is named. None of those suspicions regardingmy impartiality (erroneous suspicions, I hasten to protest) bears
upon recusal here. The question, simply put, is whether someonewho thought I could decide this case impartially despite my

tion by the council, were not corrected. See e-mail from Betty Jean Wolfe,President, Urban Family Council, to Richard Serrano, Los Angeles Times
(Mar. 8, 2004) (available in Clerk of Court's case file).

friendship with the Vice President would reasonably believe thatI cannot decide it impartially because I went hunting with that
friend and accepted an invitation to fly there with him on a Gov-ernment plane. If it is reasonable to think that a Supreme Court
Justice can be bought so cheap, the Nation is in deeper troublethan I had imagined.

As the newspaper editorials appended to the motion make clear,I have received a good deal of embarrassing criticism and adverse
publicity in connection with the matters at issue here--even tothe point of becoming (as the motion cruelly but accurately states)
"fodder for late-night comedians." Motion to Recuse 6. If Icould have done so in good conscience, I would have been pleased
to demonstrate my integrity, and immediately silence the criti-cism, by getting off the case. Since I believe there is no basis
for recusal, I cannot. The motion is Denied.

Opinion of Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburgand Justice Breyer join, respecting the denial of certiorari.
The "perceived procedural tangle" described by JusticeScalia's dissent, post, at 1022, is a byproduct of an unwise judgemade rule under which courts must decide whether the plaintiffhas alleged a constitutional violation before addressing the question whether the defendant state actor is entitled to qualifiedimmunity. Justice Breyer and I both questioned the wisdom
of an inflexible rule requiring the premature adjudication of con-stitutional issues when the Court adopted it. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 858, 859 (1998). Relaxing thatrule could solve the problem that Justice Scalia addresses in
his dissent. Justice Scalia is quite wrong, however, when hestates that the "procedural tangle" created by our constitutionalquestion-first procedure explains our denial of certiorari in thiscase. Post, at 1022. Indeed, it is only one of three reasons for
not granting review. The other two are, first, that we have nojurisdiction, and second, that the alleged conflict of authority is
more apparent than real.Respondents have graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The Court of Appeals accordingly held that respond-ents' "claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot" and
vacated the District Court's judgment insofar as it awarded suchrelief. 327 F. 3d 355, 360 (CA4 2003). That leaves respondents'

Opinion of Stevens, J. 541 U. S.
claim for damages against Bunting in his individual capacity. TheCourt of Appeals concluded that Bunting is entitled to qualified
immunity, id., at 376, and respondents have not challenged thatruling. All that remains, therefore, is the parties' dispute over
the constitutionality of VMI's supper prayer.Whether or not such a dispute would be sufficient to support
jurisdiction in different circumstances, it plainly falls short in thiscase. Bunting has retired from his position as Superintendent of
VMI, see id., at 360, and will suffer no direct injury if VMI isunable to continue the prayer. Thus, there no longer is a live
controversy between Bunting and respondents regarding the con-stitutionality of the prayer. As for the other named petitioner,
new Superintendent Peay, there never was a live controversy.Peay was added to the case (apparently in error) after the Court
of Appeals issued its decision vacating the District Court's awardof injunctive and declaratory relief. At that point, the only issue
was Bunting's individual-capacity liability--an issue in whichPeay obviously has no interest. VMI itself is not a party.

The jurisdictional issue in this case differs from that presentedin Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277 (2000). The respondent in
Erie, which operated a nude dancing establishment, obtained aninjunction barring the city from enforcing an ordinance banning
public nudity. After we granted the city's petition for certiorarito review the state court's decision, respondent submitted an affidavit stating that it had "ceased to operate a nude dancing estab-lishment in Erie." Id., at 287 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We concluded, nevertheless, that the case was not moot. Weobserved that respondent had "an interest in preserving the judgment" of the state court," id., at 288, because it was "still incorpo-rated under Pennsylvania law, and it could again decide to operate
a nude dancing establishment in Erie," id., at 287, notwithstand-ing the owner's " `advanced age' " of 72, id., at 288. Meanwhile,
the city had "an ongoing injury because it [was] barred fromenforcing the public nudity provisions of its ordinance." Ibid.
"If the challenged ordinance is found constitutional," we ex-plained, "then Erie can enforce it, and the availability of such
relief is sufficient to prevent the case from being moot." Ibid.Finally, we emphasized that the case did not involve "run of the
mill voluntary cessation" because respondent was seeking to havethe case declared moot after prevailing in state court. Ibid.
Respondent's argument, if successful, would have resulted in dis541ORD Unit: $PT1 [04-12-06 15:56:00] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

1021ORDERS
Opinion of Stevens, J.1019
missal of the petition, leaving intact the state court's ruling. Wenoted that "[o]ur interest in preventing litigants from attempting
to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable deci-sion from review further counsel[ed] against a finding of mootness." Ibid.In this case, by contrast, none of the parties has a present
stake in the outcome. There is no reason to believe that Bun-ting ever will return to VMI in an official capacity, and even if
there were, we have made clear that such speculation cannot"shield [a] case from a mootness determination."

City News &
Novelty, Inc. v. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283 (2001) (explainingthat the possibility that the respondent in Erie would reopen or

reinvest in the business was not sufficient to explain our rejec-tion of mootness in that case). Unlike the situation in Erie,
moreover, there is no injunction presently barring VMI fromreinstituting the supper prayer. This case also lacks the potential for gamesmanship that concerned us in Erie. Respondents
are not seeking to have the case declared moot after prevailingbelow (respondents lost on the issue of damages), and their

graduation from VMI obviously is distinguishable from the voluntary cessation of a business enterprise.The second reason justifying a denial of certiorari is the absence of a direct conflict among the Circuits. The Courts ofAppeals for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have rejected constitutional challenges to state universities' inclusion of a nondenomi-national prayer or religious invocation in their graduation ceremonies, reasoning that college-age students are not particularly
"susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity,"
Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 593 (1992). See Chaudhuri v.
Tennessee, 130 F. 3d 232 (CA6 1997); Tanford v. Brand, 104F. 3d 982 (CA7 1997). The Fourth Circuit endorsed that principle

in theory, but found it unhelpful in this case because of the
features of VMI that distinguish it from more traditional institu-tions of higher education--for example, its use of the "adversative" method and its emphasis on submission and conformity.327 F. 3d, at 371-372. Given the unique features of VMI, we
do not know how the Fourth Circuit would resolve a case involv-ing prayer at a state university, or, indeed, how the Sixth or
Seventh Circuits would analyze the supper prayer at issue in
this case. Thus, while the importance of this case might have

Scalia, J., dissenting 541 U. S.
justified a decision to grant, it is not accurate to suggest that aconflict of authority would have mandated such a decision.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.
In this case, the current and former Superintendents of theVirginia Military Institute have asked this Court to review the
conclusion, reached by a panel of the Fourth Circuit, that aninvocation of God during VMI's Supper Roll Call ceremony is
unconstitutional. See 327 F. 3d 355 (2003). The prayer was vol-untary, but nonparticipating cadets were required to remain respectfully "at rest" for its duration. Id., at 362. This, the panelconcluded, amounted to unconstitutional religious coercion of the
sort prohibited by our precedent--principally Lee v. Weisman,505 U. S. 577 (1992), a case that involved public high school prayer.
The weighty questions raised by petitioners--about the properapplication of Lee where adults rather than children are the subjects, and about the constitutionality of traditional religious ob-servance in military institutions--deserve this Court's attention,
particularly since the decisions of two other Circuits are in appar-ent contradiction as to whether Lee can extend so far. The only
explanation for the Court's refusal to resolve a Circuit conflict ofsuch consequence is a perceived procedural tangle of the Court's
own making. Far from finding that tangle a justification for re-jecting the petition, I find it an additional reason for granting.

This Court has established a mandatory order of priority forresolution of the two standard issues that arise in damages suits
brought against government officers under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983, or Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,
403 U. S. 388 (1971). A court must ask, first, whether "the factsalleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right";
if so, "the next, sequential step" is to resolve the qualified-immunity claim by asking "whether the right was clearly established." Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). See Wilsonv. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 609 (1999); Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U. S. 286,
290 (1999). "[T]he requisites of a qualified immunity defensemust be considered in proper sequence." Saucier, supra, at 200
(emphasis added).The Saucier constitutional-question-first procedure played a
central role in the proceedings below. Two cadets filed suitagainst Josiah Bunting, then-Superintendent of VMI, challenging

1023ORDERS
Scalia, J., dissenting1019
the constitutionality of the prayer, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief, nominal damages, costs, and attorney's fees.
The District Court entered summary judgment for the cadets.That judgment was appealed, and by the time the Fourth Circuit
panel ruled, the cadets had graduated. This mooted the declara-tory and injunctive relief claims (the only claims the current
Superintendent might have inherited when he succeeded Bun-ting), but the money damages claim against Bunting in his personal capacity remained, and raised the same constitutional ques-tion. In accordance with its obligation under Saucier, the panel
first considered whether the Establishment Clause forbade theprayer, concluding after lengthy analysis that it did. 327 F. 3d,
at 365-376. Turning to the second step, the panel quickly deter-mined that the relevant constitutional right was not clearly established because, among other things, several Circuits had pre-viously approved prayer at university functions. See id., at 376
(citing earlier discussion of Tanford v. Brand, 104 F. 3d 982 (CA71997), and Chaudhuri v. Tennessee, 130 F. 3d 232 (CA6 1997)).
The court therefore granted qualified immunity, and judgment,to Bunting.

The Fourth Circuit's determination that a state military col-lege's grace before meals violates the Establishment Clause, creating a conflict with Circuits upholding state-university prayers,would normally make this case a strong candidate for certiorari.
But it is questionable whether Bunting's request for review canbe entertained, since he won judgment in the court below. For
although the statute governing our certiorari jurisdiction permitsapplication by "any party" to a case in a federal court of appeals,
28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1), our practice reflects a "settled refusal" toentertain an appeal by a party on an issue as to which he prevailed. R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, SupremeCourt Practice 79 (8th ed. 2002). We sit, after all, not to correct
errors in dicta; "[t]his Court reviews judgments, not statementsin opinions." California v. Rooney, 483 U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per
curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).I think it plain that this general rule should not apply where a
favorable judgment on qualified-immunity grounds would deprivea party of an opportunity to appeal the unfavorable (and often
more significant) constitutional determination. That constitu-tional determination is not mere dictum in the ordinary sense,
since the whole reason we require it to be set forth (despite the

Scalia, J., dissenting 541 U. S.
availability of qualified immunity) is to clarify the law and thusmake unavailable repeated claims of qualified immunity in future cases.In areas other than this, we have in the past entertained two
appeals on collateral issues by parties who won below. See De-posit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333-336 (1980);
Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U. S. 241(1939). That these exceptions have been few is simply a consequence of the fact that suitable candidates seldom present them-selves. Cf. Partmar Corp. v. Paramount Pictures Theatres
Corp., 347 U. S. 89, 99, n. 6 (1954). But the Saucier proceduregives rise to--and is designed to give rise to--constitutional rulings (such as this one) with precedential effect. It seems to methis sort of situation is exactly what we had in mind when we
said, in Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank, that "[i]n an appropriatecase" a petitioner may appeal an adverse collateral ruling despite
having secured a favorable judgment, 445 U. S., at 334. Not onlyis the denial of review unfair to the litigant (and to the institution
that the litigant represents) but it undermines the purpose servedby initial consideration of the constitutional question, which is to
clarify constitutional rights without undue delay. See, e. g., Wil-son, supra, at 609; County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,
841-842, n. 5 (1998).This problem has attracted the attention of lower courts. Two
Circuits have noticed that if the constitutional determination re-mains locked inside a $ 1983 suit in which the defendant received
a favorable judgment on qualified immunity grounds, then "gov-ernment defendants, as the prevailing parties, will have no opportunity to appeal for review of the newly declared constitutionalright in the higher courts." Horne v. Coughlin, 191 F. 3d 244,
247 (CA2 1999) (quoted in Kalka v. Hawk, 215 F. 3d 90, 96 (CADC2000)); see Horne, supra, at 247, n. 1 (concluding that this Court
could not have reviewed the judgment in County of Sacramentov. Lewis, supra, if the Ninth Circuit had not believed the right
clearly established). As both Circuits recognized, the mess uphere is replicated below. See Horne, supra, at 247 (noting the
parallel between unreviewability of district court and court ofappeals decisions); Kalka, 215 F. 3d, at 96, and n. 9 (similar).
This understandable concern has led some courts to conclude (mis-takenly) that the constitutional-question-first rule is customary,
not mandatory. See id., at 96, 98; Horne, supra, at 247, 250; see

also Pearson v. Ramos, 237 F. 3d 881, 884 (CA7 2001) (doubtingthat the Saucier rule is "absolute," for the reasons given in Kalka
and Horne). The perception of unreviewability undermines ad-herence to the sequencing rule we have created. Cf. Koch v.
Brattleboro, 287 F. 3d 162, 166 (CA2 2002) (citing Horne for theproposition that "[a]lthough we normally apply this two-step test,
where we are convinced that the purported constitutional rightviolated is not `clearly established,' we retain the discretion to
refrain from determining whether, under the first step of the test,a constitutional right was violated at all").

This situation should not be prolonged. We should either makeclear that constitutional determinations are not insulated from
our review (for which purpose this case would be an appropriatevehicle), or else drop any pretense at requiring the ordering in
every case. * * *

In sum, we have before us in this petition a constitutional issueof considerable consequence on which the Courts of Appeals are in
disagreement. The only apparent obstacle to our review* is infact an additional incentive to our review, so that we might eliminate the confusion spawned by our civil-rights constitutional-issue-first jurisprudence. VMI has previously seen another of its
traditions abolished by this Court. See United States v. Vir*There is another concern for me, though it is not one that should affectthe majority of the Court: Bunting is now retired from VMI. Whether he
retains the requisite Article III stake in resolution of the constitutionalquestion after his retirement seems dubious to me, but not to the Court
majority, which has upheld standing in a case where the party who hadchallenged regulation of a nude dancing establishment had retired from that
business but could (barely conceivably) return. See Erie v. Pap's A. M.,529 U. S. 277, 287-289 (2000). Even if the majority has had a change of
heart about this standing point, the case should still be taken, to clarify theordinary availability of appeal, as discussed above, and to specify that, in
the unusual situation such as this where lack of standing precludes appeal,resolution of the constitutional question does not have stare decisis effect.
Cf. 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure$ 4421, p. 559 (2d ed. 2002) (issue preclusive effect denied to nonappealable
findings; "[s]ince appellate review is an integral part of the system, there isstrong reason to insist that preclusion should be denied to findings that
could not be tested by the appellate procedure ordinarily available"); 18Aid., $ 4433, at 98 ("If ordinary opportunities to appeal are thwarted by the
circumstances of a particular case . . . preclusion may prove unwise").

Scalia, J., dissenting 541 U. S.
ginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996). This time, however, its cause hasbeen ignored rather than rejected--though the consequence will
be just the same.Justice Stevens disagrees that certiorari should be granted
for three reasons. Ante, p. 1019 (opinion respecting denial ofcertiorari). The first is that he would prefer to take the course
we have repeatedly rejected, viz., to repudiate the Saucier proce-dure. Apart from the unlikelihood that that preference will ever
be satisfied, it speaks neither to the feasibility of my proposal norto the desirability of giving it a thorough airing by this Court.
The second reason, that "we have no jurisdiction," ante, at 1019,because this case is different from Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S.
277 (2000), seems to me both erroneous and beside the point. Acourt always has jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction, which is
the precise issue I would consider on certiorari. See UnitedStates v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 291 (1947). If the Court
ultimately concluded that the case is moot (presumably becausethe prospect that Bunting will return to VMI is significantly more
remote than was the prospect that the 72-year-old, retired formerowner of Pap's, who swore in an affidavit that he had no plans to
reenter the nude dancing business, would nonetheless do so), itwould still have established that an appeal is ordinarily available.

The final reason pertains to the merits. Ante, at 1021-1022.Although

Justice Stevens concedes the importance of this case,he relies upon the fact that there is no "direct conflict among the

Circuits," ante, at 1021 (emphasis added). That conclusion restsupon factual differences of the sort that ordinarily exist between
judgments that evaluate specific practices at specific institutions.It is no surprise that, as Justice Stevens notes, the Fourth
Circuit distinguished cases from other Circuits; that is whatcourts ordinarily do. But the basis for the distinguishing--that
this was a supper prayer at a state military college, whereasthe other cases involved graduation prayers at state nonmilitary
colleges--is, to put it mildly, a frail one. (In fact, it might besaid that the former is more, rather than less, likely to be constitutional, since group prayer before military mess is more tradi-tional than group prayer at ordinary state colleges.) In any
event, the absence of a direct conflict is perhaps a reason whycertiorari need not be granted, but hardly a reason why it should
not be. It is surely ironic to invoke, as the basis for denyingreview of the judgment unfavorable to VMI in this case, the fact

April 26, 2004541 U. S.
that VMI is in some sense, as we said in United States v. Vir-ginia, supra, at 519, "an incomparable military college"--inasmuch as that incomparability did not insulate its favorable judg-ment from our review and reversal in United States v. Virginia
itself. Justice Stevens's comforting observation that "there isno injunction presently barring VMI from reinstituting the supper
prayer," ante, at 1021, simply ignores the reality that, if it shouldchoose that course, the present judgment of the Court of Appeals
with jurisdiction over the Commonwealth would deny VMI offi-cials a good-faith, qualified-immunity defense against suits for
damages.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia andJustice Thomas join, dissenting.

As a result of the 2000 census, Congress allotted an additionalseat in the House of Representatives to Colorado. The Colorado
General Assembly failed to pass a congressional redistricting planin time for the 2002 elections. In response to a suit brought by
Colorado voters, a Colorado State District Court drew a congres-sional district map for the 2002 elections that took account of
the new census figures and conformed to federal voting rightsrequirements. Avalos v. Davidson, No. 01-CV-2897, 2002 WL
1895406 (Jan. 25, 2002), aff 'd sub nom. Beauprez v. Avalos, 42P. 3d 642 (Colo. 2002) (en banc).

At the end of the 2003 regular session, the newly elected Gen-eral Assembly enacted a redistricting plan, which was signed into
law on May 9, 2003. Shortly thereafter, the Colorado AttorneyGeneral, Ken Salazar, filed an original action in the Supreme
Court of Colorado, seeking an injunction to prevent the ColoradoSecretary of State, Donetta Davidson, from implementing the
General Assembly's redistricting plan and requesting a writ ofmandamus requiring Davidson to return to the 2002 redistricting
plan. The General Assembly intervened on the respondents' sideto join Davidson.

The Supreme Court of Colorado held, inter alia, that ArticleV, $ 44, of the Colorado Constitution limits redistricting to once
per decade, to be completed in the time between the decennialcensus and the first election of the decade. People ex rel. Salazar
v. Davidson, 79 P. 3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc). The courtstated:

"We recognize and emphasize that the General Assembly hasprimary responsibility for drawing congressional districts.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting 541 U. S.
But we also hold that when the General Assembly fails toprovide a constitutional redistricting plan in the face of an
upcoming election and courts are forced to step in, thesejudicially-created districts are just as binding and permanent
as districts created by the General Assembly. We furtherhold that regardless of the method by which the districts are
created, the state constitution prohibits redrawing the dis-tricts until after the next decennial census." Ibid.

The court ordered Davidson to employ the judicially created planthrough the 2010 elections. While purporting to decide the issues presented exclusively on state-law grounds, the court madean express and necessary interpretation of the term "Legislature"
in the Federal Elections Clause in concluding that "[n]othing instate or federal law contradicts this limitation." Id., at 1232.
The General Assembly and Davidson have asked this Court toreview the Colorado Supreme Court's conclusion that Article V,

$ 44, of the Colorado Constitution (as construed by the SupremeCourt of Colorado) does not violate Article I, $ 4, cl. 1, of the
Federal Constitution. While not disputing state courts' remedialauthority to impose temporary redistricting plans "so long as the
legislature does not fulfill its duty to redistrict," Pet. for Cert.22, they argue that the

permanent use of a court-ordered plan,despite the legislature's proposal of a valid alternative, violates

the Federal Constitution.Article I, $ 4, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution provides:

"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Sena-tors and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State
by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any timeby Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the
Places of chusing Senators."
By interpreting "general assembly" in Article V, $ 44, of theColorado Constitution to include the state courts, the Supreme

Court of Colorado held that the Colorado Constitution makes thestate courts part of the legislative process. The court relies on
Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355 (1932), for the proposition that theStates have the right to define "Legislature" under Article I, $ 4.

In Smiley, the Supreme Court of Minnesota had interpretedArticle I, $ 4, as vesting the power to redistrict solely in the
legislative body of Minnesota, without the need for gubernatorial

1095ORDERS
June 7, 2004541 U. S.
approval. We first noted that there was no question as to what"body" the term "legislature" describes:

"As this Court said in Hawke v. Smith, No. 1, 253 U. S. 221,227 [(1920)], the term was not one `of uncertain meaning when
incorporated into the Constitution. What it meant whenadopted it still means for the purpose of interpretation. A
Legislature was then the representative body which madethe laws of the people.' " 285 U. S., at 365.

We next explained that the focus of our inquiry was not the"body" but the function to be performed. We concluded that the
function referred to by Article I, $ 4, was the lawmaking process,which is defined by state law. 285 U. S., at 372. In Minnesota,
the lawmaking process, as defined by the State, included the par-ticipation of the Governor. Id., at 372-373.

And in Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565 (1916),we examined referenda to approve or disapprove by popular vote
any law enacted by the Ohio General Assembly. In each of thesedecisions, we concluded that the lawmaking mechanisms were consistent with Article I, $ 4. Conspicuously absent from the Colo-rado lawmaking regime, under the Supreme Court of Colorado's
construction of the Colorado Constitution to include state-courtorders as part of the lawmaking, is participation in the process
by a body representing the people, or the people themselves ina referendum.

Generally the separation of powers among branches of a State'sgovernment raises no federal constitutional questions, subject to
the requirement that the government be republican in character.But the words "shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof " operate as a limitation on the State. Cf.
McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 26 (1892) (discussing ArticleII, $ 1, cl. 2, of the U. S. Constitution). And to be consistent with

Article I, $ 4, there must be some limit on the State's ability todefine lawmaking by excluding the legislature itself in favor of
the courts.We should grant certiorari to review the Colorado state court's
debatable interpretation of this provision of federal law. Idissent from the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.

failure-to-transfer causes of action, which allege violations of 42 U. S. C.

$ 1981, as amended by Civil Rights Act of 1991, are governed by 28 U. S. C.

Congress enacted" after December 1, 1990. Jones v. R. R. Donnelley &
Sons Co., p. 369.

CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1871.

is seeking a temporary stay and permanent injunctive relief for his claim
that Alabama's "cut-down" procedure to access his compromised veins for

I. Apportionment.

Congressional redistricting--Political gerrymandering.--District
Court's dismissal of petitioner voters' claim that Pennsylvania General Assembly's partisan congressional redistricting plan constituted a political
gerrymander in violation of Article I of Federal Constitution is affirmed.
Vieth v. Jubelirer, p. 267.

II. Confrontation of Witnesses.

Testimonial statements--Admission of tape-recorded statement--
Cross-examination opportunity.--Where testimonial statements are at
issue, only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy Sixth Amendment's
demands is confrontation; thus, petitioner's wife's tape-recorded statement
to police could not be admitted in his criminal trial when he had no crossexamination opportunity. Crawford v. Washington, p. 36.

III. Congressional Authority.

Criminal law--Bribery of state, local, and tribal officials.--Title 18
U. S. C. $ 666(a)(2), which proscribes bribery of officials of entities receiving at least $10,000 in federal funds, is a valid exercise of Congress' authority under Article I, which includes Spending Clause authority to appropriate federal moneys to promote general welfare and Necessary and
Proper Clause authority to assure that taxpayer dollars are spent for general welfare. Sabri v. United States, p. 600.

IV. Double Jeopardy.

Lara, p. 193.

V. Due Process.

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990--Right of access to state
courts.--As it applies to class of cases implicating fundamental right of
access to state courts, ADA Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress' authority under $ 5 of Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that
Amendment's substantive guarantees. Tennessee v. Lane, p. 509.

VI. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Congressional redistricting--Political gerrymandering.--District
Court's dismissal of petitioner voters' claim that Pennsylvania General Assembly's partisan congressional redistricting plan constituted a political
gerrymander in violation of Equal Protection Clause, is affirmed. Vieth
v. Jubelirer, p. 267.

VII. Freedom of Expression.

a licensing scheme assure prompt judicial review of an administrative decision denying a license. City of Littleton v. Z. J. Gifts D-4, L. L. C., p. 774.

VIII. Right to Counsel.

Waiver of assistance--Guilty plea.--Neither of two warnings required
by Iowa Supreme Court--that a criminal defendant must be specifically
advised that waiving counsel's assistance in deciding whether to plead
guilty (1) entails risk that a viable defense will be overlooked and
(2) deprives him of opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on
whether it is wise to plead guilty--is mandated by Sixth Amendment,
which is satisfied where trial court informs accused of nature of charges
against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of range
of allowable punishments attendant upon entry of a guilty plea. Iowa v.
Tovar, p. 77.

IX. Searches and Seizures.

1. Automobile occupant's arrest after leaving car--Contemporaneous
passenger compartment search.--When a police officer makes a lawful
custodial arrest of an automobile's occupant, Fourth Amendment allows
officer to search vehicle's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous
incident of arrest even when officer first contacts arrestee after latter has
left vehicle. Thornton v. United States, p. 615.

tank. United States v. Flores-Montano, p. 149.

X. States' Immunity from Suit.

Student loan debt--Discharge in bankruptcy.--Because a bankruptcy
court's discharge of a student loan debt does not implicate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity, Court does not reach question on which certiorari was granted: whether Bankruptcy Clause grants Congress authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity in private suits. Tennessee

Pension Fund v. Heinz, p. 739.

2. Pension plan--Participant--Working owner.--If an ERISAsheltered pension plan covers one or more employees other than a business' working owner and his or her spouse, that owner, in common with

actual innocence, whether of sentence or of crime charged, must first address all nondefaulted claims for comparable relief and other grounds for
cause to excuse a procedural default in state court. Dretke v. Haley,
p. 386.

3. State prisoner--Erroneous jury instructions.--In granting federal
habeas relief, Ninth Circuit erred in holding that California state court
unreasonably applied federal law in concluding that there was no reasonable likelihood that jury in respondent's murder trial was misled by an
erroneous instruction on "imperfect self-defense." Middleton v. McNeil,
p. 433.

4. State prisoner--Exhaustion of state remedies--Presentation of federal claim.--To exhaust state remedies before seeking federal habeas relief, a state prisoner ordinarily does not "fairly present" a federal claim to
a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, brief, or similar
papers to find material that will alert it to such a claim's presence. Baldwin v. Reese, p. 27.
