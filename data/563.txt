tasks.  That  location  prevented  workers  from  receiving credit for the time they spent putting on and taking off their 
work  clothes--contrary  to  the  Act's  requirements.  In  a  re-lated suit the District Court agreed with Kasten, finding that 
Saint-Gobain's  "practice  of  not  compensating  .  .  .  for  time 
spent  donning  and  doffing  certain  required  protective  gear and  walking  to  work  areas"  violated  the  Act.

I  
A  

Through  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Matrixx  develops, manufactures, and markets over-the-counter pharmaceutical 

products.  Its  core  brand  of  products  is  called  Zicam.  All of the products sold under the name Zicam are used to treat 
the  common  cold  and  associated  symptoms.  At  the  time  of the events in question, one of Matrixx's products was Zicam 
Cold  Remedy,  which  came  in  several  forms  including  nasal spray and gel.  The active ingredient in Zicam Cold Remedy 
was  zinc  gluconate.  Respondents  allege  that  Zicam  Cold Remedy  accounted  for  approximately  70  percent  of  Ma-
trixx's sales. Respondents  initiated  this  securities  fraud  class  action 
against  Matrixx on behalf of individuals  who purchased Ma-trixx  securities  between  October  22,  2003,  and  February  6, 
2004.1  The  action  principally  arises  out  of  statements  that Matrixx  made  during  the  class  period  relating  to  revenues 
and product safety.  Respondents claim that Matrixx's state-ments  were  misleading  in  light  of  reports  that  Matrixx  had 
received, but did not disclose, about consumers who had lost their  sense  of  smell  (a  condition  called  anosmia)  after  using 
Zicam  Cold  Remedy.  Respondents'  consolidated  amended

established  in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran-domized  clinical  trials.  In  fact,  in  neither  study  were 

there  any  reports  of  anosmia  related  to  the  use  of  this compound.  The overall incidence of adverse  events as-
sociated with zinc gluconate was extremely low, with no statistically  significant  difference  between  the  adverse 
event rates for the treated and placebo subsets. "A multitude of environmental and biologic influences 
are  known  to  affect  the  sense  of  smell.  Chief  among them  is  the  common  cold.  As  a  result,  the  population 
most  likely  to  use  cold  remedy  products  is  already  at increased  risk  of  developing  anosmia.  Other  common 
causes  of  olfactory  dysfunction  include  age,  nasal  and sinus  infections,  head  trauma,  anatomical  obstructions, 
and  environmental  irritants."  Id.,

requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish materiality.  It  concluded,  to  the  contrary,  that  the  com-

plaint  adequately  alleged  "information  regarding  the  possi-ble  link  between  Zicam  and  anosmia"  that  would  have  been 
significant to a reasonable investor.  585 F. 3d, at 1179, 1180. Turning  to  scienter,  the  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that 
"[w]ithholding reports of adverse effects of and lawsuits con-cerning  the  product  responsible  for  the  company's  remark-
able sales increase is `an extreme departure from the stand-ards  of  ordinary  care,' "  giving  rise  to  a  strong  inference  of

This  case  proves  the  point.  In  2009,  the  FDA  issued  a warning  letter  to  Matrixx  stating  that  "[a]  significant  and 

growing body of evidence substantiates that the Zicam Cold Remedy intranasal products may  pose a serious risk to  con-
sumers who use them."  App. 270a.  The letter cited as evi-dence 130 reports of anosmia the FDA had received, the fact 
that the FDA had received few reports of anosmia associated with  other  intranasal  cold  remedies,  and  "evidence  in  the 
published  scientific  literature  that  various  salts  of  zinc  can damage  olfactory  function  in  animals  and  humans."

Remedy and anosmia.  Consumers likely would have viewed the risk associated with Zicam (possible loss of smell) as sub-

stantially outweighing the benefit of using the product (alle-viating cold symptoms), particularly in light of the existence 
of  many  alternative  products  on  the  market.  Importantly, Zicam  Cold  Remedy  allegedly  accounted  for  70  percent  of 
Matrixx's sales.  Viewing the allegations of the complaint as 
a  whole,  the  complaint  alleges  facts  suggesting  a  significant risk to the commercial viability of Matrixx's leading product. 

It  is  substantially  likely  that  a  reasonable  investor  would have  viewed  this  information  " `as  having  significantly  al-
tered  the  "total  mix"  of  information  made  available.' "

inference that it acted recklessly or knowingly to be at least as compelling as the alternative inferences.  "Rather," it ar-

gues, "the most obvious inference is that petitioners did not disclose  the  [reports]  simply  because  petitioners  believed 
they  were  far  too  few  .  .  .  to  indicate  anything  meaningful about  adverse  reactions  to  use  of  Zicam."  Brief  for  Peti-
tioners 49.  Matrixx's proposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation  of  statistical  significance  to  establish  a  strong 

inference  of  scienter  is  just  as  flawed  as  its  approach  to materiality. 

The  inference  that  Matrixx  acted  recklessly  (or  intention-ally, for that matter) is at least as compelling as, if not more 
compelling  than,  the  inference  that  it  simply  thought  the reports  did  not  indicate  anything  meaningful  about  adverse 
reactions.  According  to  the  complaint,  Matrixx  was  suffi-ciently  concerned  about  the  information  it  received  that  it 
informed Linschoten that it had hired a consultant to review the product,  asked Linschoten to participate in  animal stud-
ies,  and  convened  a  panel  of  physicians  and  scientists  in response  to  Dr.  Jafek's  presentation.  It  successfully  pre-
vented Dr. Jafek from using Zicam's name in his presentation on  the  ground  that  he  needed  Matrixx's  permission  to  do 
so.  Most  significantly,  Matrixx  issued  a  press  release  that suggested  that  studies  had  confirmed  that  Zicam  does  not 
cause anosmia when, in fact, it had not conducted any studies relating  to  anosmia  and  the  scientific  evidence  at  that  time, 
according to the panel of scientists, was insufficient to deter-mine whether Zicam did or did not cause anosmia.

armed robbery to identify Thompson as their attacker.  The district  attorney  charged  Thompson  with  attempted  armed 

robbery. As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene techni-
cian  took  from  one  of  the  victims'  pants  a  swatch  of  fabric stained  with  the  robber's  blood.  Approximately  one  week 
before Thompson's armed robbery trial, the swatch was sent 
to  the  crime  laboratory.  Two  days  before  the  trial,  Assist-ant  District  Attorney  Bruce  Whittaker  received  the  crime 

lab's  report,  which  stated  that  the  perpetrator  had  blood type B.  There is no evidence that the prosecutors ever had 
Thompson's  blood  tested  or  that  they  knew  what  his  blood 
type  was.  Whittaker  claimed  he  placed  the  report  on  As-
sistant District Attorney James Williams' desk, but Williams 
denied seeing it.  The report was never disclosed to Thomp-
son's counsel. 

Williams  tried  the  armed  robbery  case  with  Assistant 
District  Attorney  Gerry  Deegan.  On  the  first  day  of  trial, 
Deegan  checked  all  of  the  physical  evidence  in  the  case  out 
of  the  police  property  room,  including  the  bloodstained 
swatch.  Deegan  then  checked  all  of  the  evidence  but  the 
swatch into the courthouse property room.  The prosecutors 
did  not  mention  the  swatch  or  the  crime  lab  report  at  trial, 
and  the  jury  convicted  Thompson  of  attempted  armed 
robbery. 

A  few  weeks  later,  Williams  and  Special  Prosecutor  Eric 
Dubelier  tried  Thompson  for  the  Liuzza  murder.  Because 
of the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to tes-
tify in his own defense.  He was convicted and sentenced to 
death.  State

Calculation  of  a  manufacturer's  "average"  and  "best" prices,  undertaken  by  the  pharmaceutical  company,  is  a 
complex  enterprise  requiring  recourse  to  detailed  informa-tion  about  the  company's  sales  and  pricing.  $ 1396r-8(k); 
42  CFR  $ 447.500-520  (2010).  To  enable  HHS  to  calculate the rebate rate for each drug, manufacturers submit the rele-
vant  data  to  HHS  on  a  quarterly  basis.  $ 1396r-8(b)(3). With  exceptions  set  out  in  the  legislation,  HHS  is  prohib-
ited  from  disclosing  the  submitted  information  "in  a  form which  discloses  the  identity  of  a  specific  manufacturer 
.  .  .  [or]  prices  charged  for  drugs  by  such  manufacturer." $ 1396r-8(b)(3)(D). 

Under  $ 340B,  added  in  1992,  106  Stat.  4967,  as  amended, 124  Stat.  823,  manufacturers  participating  in  Medicaid  must

$ 256b(a); $ 1396r-8(a)(1) (2006 ed.).  The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, employs a form contract 
as  an  opt-in  mechanism.  The  340B  Program  also  draws  on the larger scheme's pricing methodology.  In their 340B Pro-
gram  contracts  with  HHS,  called  Pharmaceutical  Pricing Agreements (PPAs), see

would  affect  her  personal  tax  liability.  The  Court  rejected those  arguments.  The  "effect  upon  future  taxation,  of  any 
payment out of funds," was too "remote, fluctuating and un-certain"  to  give  rise  to  a  case  or  controversy.

ing  the  total  estimated  "value"  of  STO  tax  credits  claimed 
over a 1-year period).  The education of its young people is, 
of course, one of the State's principal missions and responsi-
bilities;  and  the  consequent  costs  will  make  up  a  significant 
portion  of  the  state  budget.  That,  however,  is  just  the  be-
ginning of the analysis. 

By helping students obtain scholarships to private schools, 
both  religious  and  secular,  the  STO  program  might  relieve 
the  burden  placed  on  Arizona's  public  schools.  The  result 
could  be  an  immediate  and  permanent  cost  savings  for  the 
State.  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  Arizona  Christian  School

the  verdict.  The  "new"  evidence  largely  duplicated  the  mitigation 
evidence  of  his  mother  and  brother  at  trial.  To  the  extent  that  there 
were  new  factual  allegations  or  evidence,  much  of  it  is  of  questionable 
mitigating value.  Dr. Woods' testimony would have opened the door to 
rebuttal  by  a  state  expert;  and  new  evidence  relating  to  Pinholster's 
substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems could lead a jury 
to  conclude  that  he  was  beyond  rehabilitation.  The  remaining  new 
material  in  the  state  habeas  record  is  sparse.  Given  what  little  addi-
tional  mitigating  evidence  Pinholster  presented  in  state  habeas,  the 
Court  cannot  say  that  the  State  Supreme  Court's  determination  was 
unreasonable.  Pp. 200-202.

Lisa  Tapar's  house,  where  Pinholster  put  his  buck  knife through her front door and scratched a swastika into her car 

after she refused  to talk to him.  The three men,  who were all armed  with buck  knives,  found no  one at Kumar's house, 
broke in, and began ransacking the home.  They came across only  a  small  amount  of  marijuana  before  Kumar's  friends, 
Thomas  Johnson  and  Robert  Beckett,  arrived  and  shouted that they were calling the police. 

Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through the rear  door,  but  Johnson  blocked  their  path.  Pinholster 
backed Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and money and  repeatedly  striking  him in  the  chest.  Johnson  dropped 
his  wallet  on  the  ground  and  stopped  resisting.  Beckett then  came  around  the  corner,  and  Pinholster  attacked  him, 
too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.  Pinholster forced Beckett  to  the  ground,  took  both  men's  wallets,  and  began 
kicking  Beckett  in  the  head.  Meanwhile,  Brown  stabbed Johnson  in  the  chest,  " `bury[ing] his  knife  to  the  hilt.' "  35

Opinion of the Court 
Having  presented  Dr.  Stalberg's  declaration  to  the  state court, Pinholster returned to the District Court.  In Novem-

ber  1997,  he  filed  an  amended  petition  for  a  writ  of  habeas corpus.  His  allegations  of  penalty-phase  ineffective  assist-
ance  of  counsel  were  identical  to  those  in  his  second  state habeas  petition.  Both  parties  moved  for  summary  judg-
ment,  and  Pinholster  also  moved,  in  the  alternative,  for  an evidentiary hearing. 

The  District  Court  concluded  that  the  Antiterrorism  and Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996  (AEDPA),  110  Stat. 
1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.  Be-fore the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who stated 
that none of the new material he reviewed altered his origi-nal diagnosis.  Dr.  Stalberg disagreed  with  Dr.  Woods'  con-
clusion  that  Pinholster  suffers  from  bipolar  disorder.  Pin-holster  did  not  call  Dr.  Stalberg  to  testify  at  the  hearing. 
He presented two new medical experts: Dr. Sophia Vinogra-dov,  a  psychiatrist  who  diagnosed  Pinholster  with  organic 
personality  syndrome  and  ruled  out  antisocial  personality disorder,  and  Dr.  Donald  Olson,  a  pediatric  neurologist  who 
suggested  that  Pinholster  suffers  from  partial  epilepsy  and brain injury.  The State called Dr. F. David Rudnick, a psy-
chiatrist  who,  like  Dr.  Stalberg,  diagnosed  Pinholster  with antisocial personality disorder and rejected any diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder.  D 

The  District  Court  granted  habeas  relief.  Applying  pre-AEDPA  standards,  the  court  granted  the  habeas  petition 
"for inadequacy  of  counsel by  failure  to  investigate  and pre-sent  mitigation  evidence  at  the  penalty  hearing."  App.  to

sented  to  the  federal  habeas  court  may  also  be  considered. We agree with the State. 

A 
As  amended  by  AEDPA,  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254  sets  several limits on the power of a federal court to grant an application 

for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  on  behalf  of  a  state  prisoner. Section  2254(a)  permits  a  federal  court  to  entertain  only 
those  applications  alleging  that  a  person  is  in  state  custody "in  violation  of  the  Constitution  or  laws  or  treaties  of 

the  United  States."  Sections  2254(b)  and  (c)  provide  that a  federal  court  may  not  grant  such  applications  unless, 
with  certain  exceptions,  the  applicant  has  exhausted  state remedies. 

If  an  application  includes  a  claim  that  has  been  "adjudi-cated on the merits in State court proceedings," $ 2254(d), an 
additional restriction applies.  Under $ 2254(d), that applica-tion  "shall  not  be  granted  with  respect  to  [such  a]  claim . . .  
unless the adjudication of the claim": 

"(1)  resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in-volved  an  unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  estab-

lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or 

"(2)  resulted in a decision that was based on an unrea-sonable  determination  of  the  facts  in  light  of  the  evi-
dence presented in the State court proceeding."

Opinion of the Court 
Today, we reject that assumption and hold that evidence  in-troduced  in  federal  court  has  no  bearing  on  $ 2254(d)(1)  re-

view.  If  a  claim  has  been  adjudicated  on  the  merits  by  a state  court,  a  federal  habeas  petitioner  must  overcome  the

Pinholster 's  contention  that  our  holding  renders 

$ 2254(e)(2)  superfluous  is  incorrect.  Section  2254(e)(2)  im-poses  a  limitation  on  the  discretion  of  federal  habeas  courts 

to  take  new  evidence  in  an  evidentiary  hearing.  See  Lan-

review of the state-court record. 

III 
The Court of Appeals' alternative holding was also errone-ous.  Pinholster  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the  Califor-

nia Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established federal  law  to  his  penalty-phase  ineffective-assistance  claim 
on  the  state-court  record.  Section  2254(d)  prohibits  habeas relief. 

A 
Section  2254(d)  applies  to  Pinholster's  claim  because  that claim  was  adjudicated  on  the  merits  in  state-court  proceed-

ings.  No  party  disputes  that  Pinholster's  federal  petition alleges  an  ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim  that  had 
been  included  in  both  of  Pinholster's  state  habeas  petitions. The California Supreme Court denied each of those petitions 
"on the substantive ground that it is without merit." 11 Section  2254(d) applies  even where  there has  been  a  sum-
mary  denial.  See  Richter,

Pinholster's mother and brother.  Declarations from Pinhol-ster's siblings support his mother's testimony that his stepfa-

ther  was  abusive  and  explain  that  Pinholster  was  beaten with fists, belts, and even wooden boards. 

To the extent the state habeas record includes new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of questionable mitigat-
ing value.  If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods to testify con-
sistently  with  his  psychiatric  report,  Pinholster  would  have opened  the  door  to  rebuttal  by  a  state  expert.  See,

248  VIRGINIA  OFFICE  FOR  PROTECTION  AND 

ADVOCACY  v.  STEWART 

Syllabus 

(a)  Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a valid 
abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a private per-
son's suit against a State.  Pp. 253-254 

(b)  The  doctrine  of  Ex  parte  Young,  which  establishes  an  important 
limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as necessary 
to  "permit  the  federal  courts  to  vindicate  federal  rights."  Pennhurst 
State School and Hospital v.  Halderman, 465 U. S. 89.  It rests on the 
premise that when a federal court commands a state official to do noth-
ing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for 
sovereign-immunity  purposes.  It  does  not  apply  "when  `the  state  is 
the . . . party in interest.' "  Id., at 101.  Pp. 254-255. 

(c)  Entertaining VOPA's action is consistent with precedent and does 
not  offend  the  distinctive  interests  protected  by  sovereign  immunity. 
Pp. 255-261. 

(1)  Verizon Md. Inc. v.  Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 
held  that,  in  determining  the  Ex  parte  Young  doctrine's  applicability, 
"a court need only conduct a `straightforward inquiry into whether [the] 
complaint  alleges  an  ongoing  violation  of  federal  law  and  seeks  relief 
properly characterized as prospective.' "  Id., at 645.  VOPA's suit sat-
isfies  that  inquiry.  Respondents  concede  that  the  action  would  be 
proper  were  VOPA  a  private  organization  rather  than  a  state  agency. 
The "general criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the 
sovereign  is  the  effect  of  the  relief  sought,"  Pennhurst,  supra,  at  107, 
not  who  is  bringing  the  lawsuit.  This  Court  applied  that  criterion  in 
Idaho v.  Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, which held that an 
Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young to bring what was essen-
tially a quiet title suit that would "extinguish [Idaho's] control over . . .  
lands and waters long deemed . . . an integral part of its territory."  Id., 
at 282.  Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought 
here threatens a similar invasion of Virginia's sovereignty.  Pp. 255-257. 

(2)  Respondents  claim  that  a  State's  dignity  is  diminished  when  a 
federal  court  adjudicates  a  dispute  between  its  components.  But  a 
State's  stature  is  not  diminished  to  any  greater  degree  when  its  own 
agency  sues  to  enforce  its  officers'  compliance  with  federal  law  than 
when  a  private  person does  so.  Moreover, VOPA's  power to  sue state 
officials is a consequence of Virginia's own decision to establish a public 
P&A system.  Not every offense to a State's dignity constitutes a denial 
of sovereign immunity.  The specific indignity against which sovereign 
immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court with-
out  its  consent;  that  does  not  occur  just  because  a  suit  happens  to  be 
brought by another state agency.  Pp. 257-260. 

(3)  The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence of 
past  constitutional  doubts.  In  order  to  invoke  the  Ex  parte  Young

Syllabus 
exception,  a  state  agency  needs  both  a  federal  right  that  it  possesses 
against  its  parent  State  and  authority  to  sue  state  officials  to  enforce 
that  right,  free  from  any  internal  state-government  veto;  such  condi-
tions  rarely  coincide.  In  any  event,  the  principles  undergirding  the 
Ex  parte  Young  doctrine  support  its  extension  to  actions  of  this  kind.

may  have  been  abused,  see  $ 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II);  $ 10805(a) (4)(B)(iii), as well as "other records that are relevant to con-

ducting  an  investigation,"  $ 15043(a)(2)(J)(i).  The  Acts  also require  that  a  P&A  system have  authority  to  "pursue  legal, 
administrative,  and  other  appropriate  remedies  or  ap-proaches to ensure the protection of " its charges.  $ 15043(a) 
(2)(A)(i);  see  $ 10805(a)(1)(B).  And  in  addition  to  pressing 

its  own  rights,  a  P&A  system  may  "pursue  administrative, legal,  and  other  remedies  on  behalf  of "  those  it  protects. 

$ 10805(a)(1)(C); see $ 15044(b). A  participating  State  is  free  to  appoint  either  a  state 
agency  or  a  private  nonprofit  entity  as  its  P&A  system. 

$ 15044(a);  $ 10805(c)(1)(B).  But  in  either  case,  the  desig-
nated  entity  must  have  certain  structural  features  that  en-
sure  its  independence  from  the  State's  government.  The 
DD  Act  prohibits  the  Governor  from  appointing  more  than 
one-third  of  the  members  of  the  system's  governing  board, 

$ 15044(a)(2), and restricts the State's ability to impose hiring 
freezes  or  other  measures  that  would  impair  the  system's 
ability  to  carry  out  its  mission,  $ 15043(a)(2)(K).  Once  a 
State  designates  an  entity  as  its  P&A  system,  it  may  not 
change  its  selection  without  "good  cause."  $ 15043(a)(4)(A). 

Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated a 
government  entity  as  their  P&A  system.  The  Virginia  Of-
fice for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an "independent 
state  agency."  Va.  Code  Ann.  $ 51.5-39.2(A)  (Lexis  2009). 
Its board consists of eleven "nonlegislative citizen members," 
of whom only three are appointed  by the Governor.  $ 51.5- 
39.2(B).  The  remaining  eight  are  appointed  by  components 
of  the  legislature:  five  by  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Dele-
gates,  and  three  by  the  Senate  Committee  on  Rules.  Ibid. 
VOPA itself nominates candidates for consideration, and the 
statute instructs the appointing officials that they "shall seri-
ously  consider  the  persons  nominated  and  appoint  such  per-
sons  whenever  feasible."  Ibid.  Board  members  serve  for

specified reasons.  See $ 51.5-39.2(C) and (F); $ 24.2-233 and 234 (Lexis 2006). 

VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive-branch oversight.  It  operates  independently  of  the  Attorney  Gen-
eral of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who are statu-torily  authorized  to  sue  on  VOPA's  behalf.  $ 51.5-39.2(A); 

$ 2.2-510(5) (Lexis 2008).  And  Virginia law specifically em-powers  VOPA  to  "initiate  any  proceedings  to  secure  the 
rights" of disabled individuals.  $ 51.5-39.2(A). 

B 
In  2006, VOPA  opened  an investigation  into  the  deaths  of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental hos-

pitals.  It  asked  respondents--state  officials  in  charge  of those  institutions--to  produce  any  records  related  to  riskmanagement or mortality reviews conducted by the hospitals with  respect  to  those  patients.  Respondents  refused,  as-
serting that the records were protected by a state-law privi-lege shielding medical peer-review materials from disclosure. 

VOPA  then  brought  this  action  in  the  United  States  Dis-trict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that 
the  DD  and  PAIMI  Acts  entitled  it  to  the  peer-review  rec-ords,  notwithstanding  any  state-law  privilege  that  might 
apply.  It  sought  a  declaration  that  respondents'  refusal  to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI Acts, along 
with  an  injunction  requiring  respondents  to  provide  access to the records and refrain in the future from interfering with 
VOPA's right of access to them.  Respondents moved to dis-miss  the  action  on  the  grounds  that  they  are  immune  from 
suit  under  the  Eleventh  Amendment.  The  District  Court denied  the  motion.  In  its  view,  the  suit  was  permitted  by 
the  doctrine  of  Ex  parte  Young,  which  normally  allows  fed-eral courts to award prospective relief against state officials 
for  violations  of  federal  law.  Virginia  v.  Reinhard,  2008 
WL 2795940, *6 (ED Va., July 18, 2008).

Opinion of the Court 
The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed.  Virginia  v.  Reinhard, 568  F.  3d  110  (CA4  2009).  Believing  VOPA's  lawsuit  to  be 

an  "intramural  contest"  that  "encroaches  more  severely  on the  dignity  and  sovereignty  of  the  states  than  an  Ex  parte 
Young  action  brought  by  a  private  plaintiff,"  the  Court  of Appeals  concluded  it  was  not  authorized  by  that  case.

A 

Sovereign  immunity  is  the  privilege  of  the  sovereign  not to  be  sued  without  its  consent.  The  language  of  the  Elev-

enth Amendment 1 only eliminates the basis for our judgment in the famous case of Chisholm v.  Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), 
which  involved  a  suit  against  a  State  by  a  noncitizen  of  the State.  Since  Hans  v.  Louisiana,  134  U. S.  1  (1890),  how-
ever,  we  have  understood  the  Eleventh  Amendment  to  con-firm  the  structural  understanding  that  States  entered  the 
Union  with  their  sovereign  immunity  intact,  unlimited  by Article  III's jurisdictional grant. 

Blatchford v.  Native Vil-lage of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991); see Pennhurst State 

School  and  Hospital  v.  Halderman,  465  U. S.  89,  98  (1984). Our cases hold that the States have retained their traditional 
immunity  from  suit,  "except  as  altered  by  the  plan  of  the Convention  or  certain  constitutional  amendments."  Alden 
v.  Maine,  527  U. S.  706,  713  (1999).  A  State  may  waive  its sovereign immunity at its pleasure,

1 The Eleventh Amendment reads as follows: 
"The Judicial  power  of the  United  States  shall  not be  construed  to ex-
tend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of 
the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects 
of any Foreign State."

may  abrogate  it  by  appropriate  legislation.2  But  absent waiver or valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain 

a private person's suit against a State. 

B 
In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an impor-tant  limit  on  the  sovereign-immunity  principle.  That  case 

involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reducing the freight rates  that  railroads  could  charge.  A  railroad  shareholder 
claimed that the  new rates were unconstitutionally confisca-tory,  and  obtained  a  federal  injunction  against  Edward 
Young,  the  Attorney  General  of  Minnesota,  forbidding  him in  his  official  capacity  to  enforce  the  state  law.  Perkins  v. 
Northern Pacific R. Co., 155 F. 445 (CC Minn. 1907).  When Young  violated  the  injunction  by  initiating  an  enforcement 
action in state court, the Circuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to federal custody.  In his habeas corpus 
application  in  this  Court,  Young  challenged  his  confinement by  arguing  that  Minnesota's  sovereign  immunity  deprived 
the federal court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from perform-ing his official duties. 

We  disagreed.  We  explained  that  because  an  unconsti-tutional  legislative  enactment  is  "void,"  a  state  official  who 
enforces  that  law  "comes  into  conflict  with  the  superior authority  of  [the]  Constitution,"  and  therefore  is  "stripped 
of  his  official  or  representative  character  and  is  subjected in  his  person  to  the  consequences  of  his  individual  conduct. 
The  State  has  no  power  to  impart  to  him  any  immunity from  responsibility  to  the  supreme  authority  of  the  United 
States."  209 U. S., at 159-160. This  doctrine  has  existed  alongside  our  sovereignimmunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted as

necessary  to  "permit  the  federal  courts  to  vindicate  federal rights."  Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105.  It rests on the prem-

ise--less  delicately  called  a  "fiction,"  id.,  at  114,  n.  25--that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing 
more  than  refrain  from  violating  federal  law,  he  is  not  the State  for  sovereign-immunity  purposes.  The  doctrine  is 
limited  to  that  precise  situation,  and  does  not  apply  "when `the  state  is  the  real,  substantial  party  in  interest,' " 

id.,  at 101  (quoting  Ford  Motor  Co.  v.  Department  of  Treasury  of 

Ind.,  323  U. S.  459,  464  (1945)),  as  when  the  " `judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, 
or  interfere  with  public  administration,' "  465  U. S.,  at  101, n. 11 (quoting 

Dugan v.  Rank, 372 U. S. 609, 620 (1963)). 

C 
This case requires us to decide how to apply the Ex parte 
Young  doctrine  to  a  suit  brought  by  an  independent  state agency  claiming  to  possess  federal  rights.  Although  we 

have  never  encountered  such  a  suit  before,  we  are  satisfied that entertaining VOPA's action is consistent with our prece-
dents and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity. 

1 
In  Verizon  Md.  Inc.  v.  Public  Serv.  Comm'n  of  Md.,  535 U. S. 635  (2002),  we held  that "[i]n determining  whether the 

doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar  to  suit,  a  court  need  only  conduct  a  `straightforward  in-
quiry  into  whether  [the]  complaint  alleges  an  ongoing  viola-tion of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as 
prospective.' "  Id.,  at  645  (quoting  Idaho  v.  Coeur  d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997) (O'Connor, J., concur-
ring  in  part  and  concurring  in  judgment)).  There  is  no doubt VOPA's suit satisfies that straightforward inquiry.  It 
alleges  that  respondents'  refusal  to  produce  the  requested medical  records  violates  federal  law;  and  it  seeks  an  injunc-
tion  requiring  the  production  of  the  records,  which  would

Opinion of the Court 

prospectively abate the alleged violation.  Respondents con-cede  that  were  VOPA  a  private  organization  rather  than 

a  state  agency,  the  doctrine  would  permit  this  action  to proceed.

3 

We  see  no  reason  for  a  different  result  here.  Although respondents  argue  that  VOPA's  status  as  a  state  agency 

changes  the  calculus,  there  is  no  warrant  in  our  cases  for making the validity of an 

Ex parte Young action turn on the identity  of  the  plaintiff.  To  be  sure,  we  have  been  willing 

to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to evade sover-eign  immunity.  To  do  otherwise  "would  be  to  adhere  to  an 
empty  formalism."  Coeur  d'Alene  Tribe,  supra,  at  270. But  (as  the  dissent  concedes,

treasury,  see  Edelman  v.  Jordan,  415  U. S.  651,  666  (1974); 
or an order for specific performance of a State's contract, see 
id., at 666-667; In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443 (1887). 

Coeur d'Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely, is 
an  application  of  this  principle.  There  we  refused  to  allow 
an  Indian  Tribe  to  use  Ex  parte  Young  to  obtain  injunctive 
and  declaratory  relief  establishing  its  exclusive  right  to  the 
use and  enjoyment of certain  submerged  lands  in  Idaho  and 
the invalidity of all state statutes and regulations governing 
that  land.  521  U. S.,  at  265.  We  determined  that  the  suit 
was "the  functional equivalent of "  "a quiet title suit  against 
Idaho," would "extinguish . . . the State's control over a vast 
reach of lands and waters long deemed by the State to be an 
integral part of its territory," and thus was barred by sover-
eign immunity.  Id., at 281, 282. 

Respondents  have  advanced  no  argument  that  the  relief 
sought in  this  case threatens  any similar  invasion  of Virgin-
ia's sovereignty.  Indeed, they concede that the very injunc-
tion VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a federal 
court at the instance of a private P&A system. 

2 
Respondents  and  the  dissent  argue  that  entertaining 
VOPA's  lawsuit  in  a  federal  forum  would  nevertheless  in-
fringe  Virginia's  sovereign  interests  because  it  diminishes 
the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate a dis-
pute  between  its  components.  See  Brief  for  Respondents 
23-26;  post,  at  269-273  (arguing  that  " `special  sovereignty 
interests' " bar VOPA's lawsuit (quoting Coeur d'Alene Tribe, 
supra,  at  281)).  We  disagree.  As  an  initial  matter,  we  do 
not  understand  how  a  State's  stature  could  be  diminished 
to  any  greater  degree  when  its  own  agency  polices  its  offi-
cers'  compliance  with  their  federal  obligations,  than  when 

a private person  hales  those  officers  into  federal  court  for 

258  VIRGINIA  OFFICE  FOR  PROTECTION  AND 

ADVOCACY  v.  STEWART 

Opinion of the Court 

that  same  purpose--something  everyone  agrees  is  proper.4 
And  in  this  case,  of  course,  VOPA's  power  to  sue  state  offi-
cials  is  a consequence  of  Virginia's  own decision to establish 
a public, rather than a private, P&A system.  We fail to per-
ceive  what  Eleventh  Amendment  indignity  is  visited  on  the 
Commonwealth when, by operation of its own laws, VOPA is 
admitted to federal court as a plaintiff.5 

But  even  if  it  were  true  that  the  State's  dignity  were  of-
fended in some way by the maintenance of this action in fed-
eral  court,  that  would  not  prove  respondents'  case.  Denial 
of  sovereign  immunity,  to  be  sure,  offends  the  dignity  of  a 
State; but not every offense to the  dignity of a  State consti-
tutes a denial of sovereign immunity.  The specific indignity 
against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a 
State  of  being  haled  into  court  without  its  consent.  That 
effectively  occurs,  our  cases  reasonably  conclude,  when  (for 
example)  the  object  of  the  suit  against  a  state  officer  is  to 
reach  funds  in  the  state  treasury  or  acquire  state  lands;  it 

4 The dissent compares VOPA's lawsuit to such indignities as "cannibal-
ism" and "patricide," since it is a greater "affront to someone's dignity to 
be sued  by  a  brother than to  be sued  by a  stranger."  Post,  at 274.  We 
think the dissent's principle of familial affront less than universally appli-
cable,  even  with  respect  to  real  families,  never  mind  governmental  sib-
lings.  Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testamentary dispo-
sition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.  And confining one's 
child to his room is called grounding, while confining a stranger's child is 
called kidnaping.  Jurisdiction over this case does not depend on which is 
the most apt comparison. 

5 The dissent accuses us of circular reasoning,  because we "wrongly assum[e]  [that]  Virginia  knew  in  advance  the  answer  to  the  question  pre-
sented in this case."  Ibid.  That would be true if we were relying on the 
Commonwealth's  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity.  We  are  not.  We  rely 
upon  Ex  parte  Young.  We say  that  Virginia  has  only  itself  to  blame  for 
the  position  in  which  it  finds  itself,  not  because  it  consented  to  suit,  but 
because  it  created  a  state  entity  to  sue,  instead  of  leaving  the  task 
to  a  private  entity.  It  did  not  have  to  know  that  this  would  allow  suit 
in  federal  court.  Know  or  not  know,  Ex  parte  Young  produces  that 
result. 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 247 (2011)  259 

Opinion of the Court 
does  not  occur  just  because  the  suit  happens  to  be  brought 
by  another  state  agency.  Respondents'  asserted  dignitary 
harm is simply unconnected to the sovereign-immunity 

interest. 

The  dissent  complains  that  applying  Ex  parte  Young  to 
this lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the opposing 
parties  are  both  creatures  of  the  Commonwealth.  Post,  at 
271-272.  Even if that were a distinctive consequence of let-
ting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have nothing 
to do with the concern of sovereign immunity--whether the 
suit is against an unconsenting State, rather than against its 
officers.  But it is not a consequence of the federal nature of 
the  forum.  The  same  result  will  follow  if  the  federal  claim 
is  sued  upon  in  state  court,  as  the  dissent  would  require. 
There also, "[w]hatever the decision in the litigation, . . . [t]he 
Commonwealth will win[, a]nd the Commonwealth will lose." 
Post,  at  272.  Nor  would  sending  the  matter  to  state  court 
even  avoid  the  prospect  that  "a  federal  judge  will  resolve 
which  part  of  the  Commonwealth  will  prevail,"  ibid.,  since 
the  state-court  loser  could  always  ask  this  Court  to  review 
the matter by certiorari.  (Or is that appeal also to be disal-
lowed  on  grounds  of  sovereign  immunity?  But  see  Cohens 
v.  Virginia,  6  Wheat.  264  (1821).) 6  And  of  course  precisely 
the  same  thing  would  happen  if  respondents  specifically 
waived  their  sovereign  immunity  objections  in  this  very 
case.  Yet  no  one  would  contend  that  despite  the  waiver, 
sovereign  immunity  forbade  the  suit.  So  also  here:  If,  by 
reason  of  Ex  parte  Young,  there  has  been  no  violation  of 

6 The dissent agrees that because of the " `constitutional plan,' " post, at 
272, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v.  Division of Alcoholic Beverages and 
Tobacco,  Fla.  Dept.  of  Business  Regulation,  496  U. S.  18,  30  (1990)),  this 
Court  can  adjudicate  disputes  between  state  agencies  without  offending 
sovereign  immunity.  But  explaining  away  exceptions  to  its  theory  does 
not  advance  the  ball.  It  has  not  demonstrated  that  sovereign  immunity 
has  anything  at all to  say  about  federal  courts'  adjudicating  interagency 
disputes.

Opinion of the Court 

sovereign immunity, the prospect of a federal judge's resolv-ing  VOPA's  dispute  with  respondents  does  not  make  it  so. 

We  do  not  doubt,  of  course,  that  there  are  limits  on  the Federal  Government's  power  to  affect  the  internal  opera-
tions of a State.  See, e. g., Printz v.  United States, 521 U. S. 898  (1997)  (Congress  may  not  commandeer  state  officers); 
Coyle  v.  Smith,  221  U. S.  559,  579  (1911)  (Congress  may  not dictate a State's capital).  But those limits must be found in 
some textual provision or structural premise of the Constitu-tion.  Additional  limits  cannot  be  smuggled  in  under  the 
Eleventh Amendment by barring a suit in federal court that does not violate the State's sovereign immunity.

7 

3 
A  weightier  objection,  perhaps,  is  the  relative  novelty  of this  lawsuit.  Respondents  rightly  observe  that  federal 

courts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by state agencies  against  other  state  officials.  That  does  give  us 
pause.  Lack of historical precedent can indicate  a constitu-tional  infirmity,  see,  e. g.,  Free  Enterprise  Fund  v.  Public 
Company  Accounting  Oversight  Bd.,  561  U. S.  477,  505-506 (2010), and our sovereign-immunity decisions have tradition-
ally warned against " `anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or  suits,' "  Alden,  527  U. S.,  at  727  (quoting  Hans,  134  U. S., 
at 18). Novelty,  however,  is  often  the  consequence  of past consti-
tutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is the case here.  In order to invoke the 

Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two things: first, 

a federal right that it possesses against its parent State; and second,  authority  to  sue  other  state  officials  to  enforce  that 

7 We  have  no  occasion  to  pass  on  other  questions  of  federalism  lurking 
in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper exercise 
of  Congress's  enumerated  powers.  As  Justice

least  the  latter  of  them  cannot  exist  without  the  consent  of the  State  that  created  the  agency  and  defined  its  powers.

ment"  is not an  unequivocal  expression  of state consent.  Pp. 285-289. 

(1)  "Appropriate relief" is open-ended and ambiguous about the re-
lief  it  includes.  "Appropriate"  is  inherently  context  dependent.  And 
the context here--where the defendant is a sovereign--suggests, if any-
thing, that monetary damages are not "suitable" or "proper."  See Fed-
eral  Maritime  Comm'n  v.  South  Carolina  Ports  Authority,  535  U. S. 
743,  765.  Further, where  a  statute  is  susceptible  of multiple  plausible 
interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this Court will not 
consider  a  State  to  have  waived  its  sovereign  immunity.  Sossamon's 
and  Texas'  conflicting  plausible  arguments  about  whether  immunity  is 
preserved here demonstrate that "appropriate relief" in RLUIPA is not 
so free from ambiguity that the Court may conclude that the States, by 
receiving  federal  funds,  have  unequivocally  expressed  intent  to  waive 
their immunity.  Pp. 286-288. 

(2)  The Court's  use of  the phrase "appropriate relief" in Franklin 
v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and Barnes v. Gorman, 
536  U. S.  181,  does  not  compel  a  contrary  conclusion.  In  those  cases, 
where there was no express congressional intent to limit remedies avail-
able  against  municipal  entities  under  an  implied  right  of  action,  the 
Court  presumed  that  compensatory  damages  were  available.  Frank-
lin, supra, at 73.  But that presumption is irrelevant to construing the 
scope  of  an  express  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity,  where  the  question 
is  not  whether  Congress  has  given  clear  direction  that  it  intends  to 
exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has given clear direction that 
it intends to include a damages remedy.  Pp. 288-289. 

(c)  Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress' enactment of 
RLUIPA $ 3 pursuant to  the Spending Clause put  the States  on  notice 
that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legisla-
tion  operates  as  a  contract  and  damages  are  always  available  for  a 
breach of contract.  While acknowledging the contract-law analogy, this 
Court  has  been  clear  "not  [to]  imply  .  .  .  that  suits  under  Spending 
Clause  legislation  are  suits  in  contract,  or  that  contract-law  principles 
apply  to  all  issues  that  they  raise,"  Barnes,  supra,  at  189,  n.  2,  or  to 
rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist under 
nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against the 
States.  Applying  ordinary  contract  principles  here  would  also  make 
little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique: They do not

Syllabus 
traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance. 
More  fundamentally,  Sossamon's  implied-contract  remedy  cannot  be 
squared  with  the  rule  that  a  sovereign  immunity  waiver  must  be  ex-
pressly  and  unequivocally  stated  in  the  relevant  statute's  text. 
Pp. 289-291. 

(d)  Sossamon  also  errs  in  arguing  that Texas  was  put on  notice  that 
it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by $ 1003 of the Rehabilita-
tion  Act  Amendments  of  1986,  which  expressly  waives  state  sovereign 
immunity for violations of "section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination 
Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of 
any  other  Federal  statute  prohibiting  discrimination  by  recipients  of 
Federal financial assistance," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(1).  Even if such a 
residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, RLUIPA 

$ 3--which  prohibits  "substantia[l]  burden[s]"  on  religious  exercise--is 
not unequivocally  a "statute  prohibiting discrimination" within $ 1003's 
meaning.  All  the  statutory  provisions  enumerated  in  $ 1003  explicitly 
prohibit discrimination;  a State might  reasonably conclude that  the  re-
sidual  clause,  strictly construed,  covers  only  provisions using  the  term 
"discrimination."  Pp. 291-292.

Opinion of the Court 

I  
A  

RLUIPA  is  Congress'  second  attempt  to  accord  height-
ened statutory protection to religious exercise in the wake of 
this  Court's  decision  in  Employment  Div.,  Dept.  of  Human 
Resources  of  Ore.  v.  Smith,  494  U. S.  872  (1990).  Congress 
first enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 
(RFRA),  107  Stat.  1488,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb  et  seq.,  with 
which  it  intended  to  "restore  the  compelling  interest  test 

as  set  forth  in  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374  U. S.  398  (1963) 
and  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder, 406  U. S.  205  (1972)  .  . .  in  all  cases 
where  free  exercise  of  religion  is  substantially  burdened." 

$ 2000bb(b)(1).  See generally Gonzales v.  O Centro Espi'rita 
Beneficente Unia~ o do  Vegetal,  546 U. S. 418, 424 (2006).  We 
held  RFRA  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  state  and  local 
governments because it exceeded Congress' power under $ 5 
of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  See  City  of  Boerne  v. 
Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997). 

Congress  responded  by  enacting  RLUIPA  pursuant  to 
its  Spending  Clause  and  Commerce  Clause  authority. 
RLUIPA  borrows  important  elements  from  RFRA--which 
continues  to  apply  to  the  Federal  Government--but 
RLUIPA  is  less  sweeping  in  scope.  See  Cutter  v.  Wilkin-
son, 544  U. S. 709, 715  (2005).  It  targets  two areas of state 
and  local  action:  land-use  regulation,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000cc 
(RLUIPA  $ 2),  and  restrictions  on  the  religious  exercise  of 
institutionalized persons, $ 2000cc-1 (RLUIPA $ 3). 

Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that "[n]o government shall 
impose  a  substantial  burden  on  the  religious  exercise"  of 
an  institutionalized  person  unless,  as  in  RFRA,  the  govern-
ment  demonstrates  that  the  burden  "is  in  furtherance  of 
a  compelling  governmental  interest"  and  "is  the  least  re-
strictive  means  of  furthering"  that  interest.  $ 2000cc-1(a); 
cf. $$ 2000bb-1(a),  (b).  As relevant here, $ 3  applies  "in  any 
case"  in  which  "the  substantial  burden  is  imposed  in  a  pro-

gram or activity that receives Federal financial assist-ance." 

1  $ 2000cc-1(b)(1). 

RLUIPA  also  includes  an  express  private  cause  of  action that  is  taken  from  RFRA:  "A  person  may  assert  a  violation 

of  [RLUIPA]  as  a  claim  or  defense  in  a  judicial  proceed-ing  and  obtain  appropriate  relief  against  a  government." 

$ 2000cc-2(a);  cf.  $ 2000bb-1(c).  For  purposes  of  this  provi-sion, "government" includes, 

inter alia, States, counties, mu-nicipalities,  their  instrumentalities  and  officers,  and  persons 

acting under color of state law.  $ 2000cc-5(4)(A).

Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 

Correctional Institutions  Division.  In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official 
capacities  under  RLUIPA's  private  cause  of  action,  seeking injunctive  and  monetary  relief.  Sossamon  alleged  that  two 
prison  policies  violated  RLUIPA:  (1)  a  policy  preventing  in-mates from attending religious services while on cell restric-
tion  for  disciplinary  infractions;  and  (2)  a  policy  barring  use of  the  prison  chapel  for  religious  worship.  The  District 
Court  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  respondents and  held,  as  relevant  here,  that  sovereign  immunity  barred 
Sossamon's claims for monetary relief.2  See 713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 662-663 (WD Tex. 2007). 

1 No  party  contends  that  the  Commerce  Clause  permitted  Congress  to 
address the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.  See 
42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1(b)(2).  Nor is Congress' authority to enact RLUIPA 
under the Spending Clause challenged here.  We therefore do not address 
those issues. 

2 The District Court also denied injunctive relief.  713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 

668 (WD Tex. 2007).  The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossa-
mon's claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy 
was  moot  because  the  State  had  abandoned  that  policy  after  Sossamon 
filed  a  prison  grievance.  560  F.  3d  316,  326  (CA5  2009).  The  Court  of 
Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon's chapel-use

Opinion of the Court 
The Court of Appeals  for the  Fifth Circuit  affirmed.  560 F. 3d 316, 329 (2009).  Acknowledging that Congress enacted 

RLUIPA  pursuant  to  the  Spending  Clause,  the  court  deter-mined that Texas had not waived its sovereign immunity by 
accepting federal funds.  The Court of Appeals strictly con-strued  the  text  of  RLUIPA's  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  the 
State  and  concluded  that  the  statutory  phrase  "appropriate relief  against  a  government"  did  not  "unambiguously  notif[y]" Texas that its acceptance of funds was conditioned on a  waiver of  immunity  from  claims  for  money  damages. 

Id., at  330-331.  We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  a  division  of 

authority  among  the  Courts  of  Appeals  on  this  question.3 560 U. S. 923 (2010).

"Dual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation's con-stitutional blueprint."

ratification of the Constitution, the States entered the Union "with  their  sovereignty  intact."  Ibid.  (internal  quotation

"central  to  sovereign  dignity."  Alden  v.  Maine,  527  U. S. 706,  715  (1999).  As  was  widely  understood  at  the  time  the

284  SOSSAMON  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
This  is  the  general  sense,  and  the  general  practice  of 
mankind; and the exemption, as one of the  attributes of 
sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every 
State  in  the  Union."  The  Federalist  No.  81,  p.  511 
(B. Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). 

Indeed,  when  this  Court  threatened  state  immunity  from 
private  suits  early  in  our  Nation's  history,  the  people  re-
sponded  swiftly  to  reiterate  that  fundamental  principle. 
See  Hans  v.  Louisiana,  134  U. S.  1,  11  (1890)  (discussing 
Chisholm  v.  Georgia,  2  Dall.  419  (1793),  and  the  Eleventh 
Amendment). 

Sovereign  immunity  principles  enforce  an  important  con-
stitutional  limitation  on  the  power  of  the  federal  courts. 
See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.  Halderman, 465 
U. S.  89,  98  (1984).  For  over  a  century  now,  this  Court  has 
consistently  made  clear  that  "federal  jurisdiction  over  suits 
against  unconsenting  States  `was  not  contemplated  by  the 
Constitution  when  establishing  the  judicial  power  of  the 
United  States.' "  Seminole  Tribe  of  Fla.  v.  Florida,  517 
U. S. 44, 54 (1996) (quoting Hans, supra, at 15); see Seminole 
Tribe, supra, at 54-55, n. 7 (collecting cases).  A State, how-
ever, may choose to waive its immunity in federal court at its 
pleasure.  Clark  v.  Barnard,  108  U. S.  436,  447-448  (1883). 

Accordingly, "our test for determining whether a State has 
waived  its  immunity  from  federal-court  jurisdiction  is  a 
stringent  one."  College  Savings  Bank  v.  Florida  Prepaid 
Postsecondary  Ed.  Expense  Bd.,  527  U. S.  666,  675  (1999) 
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  A  State's  consent  to 
suit  must  be  "unequivocally  expressed"  in  the  text  of  the 
relevant  statute.  Pennhurst  State  School  and  Hospital, 
supra,  at  99;  see  Atascadero  State  Hospital  v.  Scanlon,  473 
U. S.  234,  238,  n.  1,  239-240  (1985).  Only  by  requiring  this 
"clear  declaration"  by  the  State  can  we  be  "certain  that  the 
State  in  fact  consents  to  suit."  College  Savings  Bank,  527 
U. S., at 680.  Waiver may not be implied.  Id., at 682. 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 277 (2011)  285 

Opinion of the Court 
For  these  reasons,  a  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity  "will be  strictly  construed,  in  terms  of  its  scope,  in  favor  of  the 

sovereign."  Lane  v.  Pen~ a,  518  U. S.  187,  192  (1996).4  So, for example, a State's consent to suit in its own courts is not 
a waiver of its immunity from suit in federal court.  College 
Savings  Bank,  supra,  at  676.  Similarly,  a  waiver  of  sover-eign immunity to other types of relief does not waive immu-

nity  to damages:  "[T]he  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  must extend  unambiguously  to  such  monetary  claims."  Lane, 
supra,  at  192;  cf.  United  States  v.  Nordic  Village,  Inc.,  503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an ambiguous waiver of sover-
eign immunity to permit equitable but not monetary claims); Hoffman  v.  Connecticut  Dept.  of  Income  Maintenance,  492 
U. S. 96, 101-102 (1989) (plurality opinion) (construing a stat-ute to authorize injunctive relief but not "monetary recovery 
from  the  States"  because  intent  to  abrogate  immunity  to monetary  recovery  was  not  " `unmistakably  clear  in  the  lan-
guage  of  the  statute' "  (quoting  Atascadero,  supra,  at  242)). 

III 

A 
RLUIPA's  authorization  of  "appropriate  relief  against  a government,"  $ 2000cc-2(a),  is  not  the  unequivocal  expres-

sion of state consent that our precedents require.  "[A]ppro-priate  relief "  does  not  so  clearly  and  unambiguously  waive 
sovereign immunity to private suits for damages that we can 

4 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict construc-
tion principle, which flows logically from the requirement that consent be 
"unequivocally  expressed,"  applies  to  the  sovereign  immunity  of  the 
States as well.  Cf. United States v.  Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37 
(1992)  (equating  the  "unequivocal  expression"  principle  from  "the  Elev-
enth  Amendment  context"  with  the principle  applicable  to  federal  sover-
eign immunity); College Savings Bank v.  Florida Prepaid Postsecondary 
Ed.  Expense  Bd.,  527  U. S.  666,  682  (1999)  (noting  the  "clos[e]  analogy" 
between  federal  and  state  sovereign  immunity);  Belknap  v.  Schild,  161 
U. S.  10,  18  (1896)  ("[A]  State  .  .  .  is  as  exempt  as  the  United  States  [is] 
from private suit").

Opinion of the Court 
"be  certain  that  the  State  in  fact  consents"  to  such  a  suit. College Savings Bank, supra, at 680. 

1 
"[A]ppropriate  relief " is  open-ended and  ambiguous  about what  types  of  relief  it  includes,  as  many  lower  courts  have 

recognized.  See,  e. g.,  560  F.  3d,  at  330-331.5  Far  from clearly  identifying  money  damages,  the  word  "appropriate" 
is inherently context dependent.  See Webster's Third New International  Dictionary  106  (1993)  (defining  "appropriate" 
as  "specially  suitable:  fit,

Opinion of the Court 
Further,  where  a  statute  is  susceptible  of  multiple  plau-
sible  interpretations,  including  one  preserving  immunity, 
we  will  not  consider  a  State  to  have  waived  its  sovereign 
immunity.  See  Dellmuth  v.  Muth,  491  U. S.  223,  232  (1989) 
(holding  that  "a  permissible  inference"  is  not  the  necessary 
"unequivocal  declaration"  that  States  were  intended  to  be 
subject  to  damages  actions);  Nordic  Village,  supra,  at  37 
(holding that the existence of "plausible" interpretations that 
would  not  permit  recovery  "is  enough  to  establish  that  a 
reading  imposing  monetary  liability  on  the  Government  is 
not  `unambiguous'  and  therefore  should  not  be  adopted"). 
That is the case here. 

Sossamon  argues  that,  because  RLUIPA  expressly  limits 
the United States to "injunctive or declaratory relief " to en-
force  the  statute,  the  phrase  "appropriate  relief "  in  the  pri-
vate cause of action necessarily must be broader.  42 U. S. C. 

$ 2000cc-2(f ).  Texas  responds  that,  because  the  State  has 
no  immunity  defense  to  a  suit  brought  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively 
in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Fur-
ther, the  private cause of action provides that a person may 
assert  a  violation  of  the  statute  "as  a  claim  or  defense." 

$ 2000cc-2(a)  (emphasis  added).  Because  an  injunction  or 
declaratory  judgment  is  not  "appropriate  relief "  for  a  suc-
cessful  defense,  Texas  explains,  explicitly  limiting  the  pri-
vate  cause  of  action  to  those  forms  of  relief  would  make  no 
sense. 

Sossamon  also  emphasizes  that  the  statute  requires  that 
it  be  "construed  in  favor  of  a  broad  protection  of  religious 
exercise."  $ 2000cc-3(g).  Texas  responds  that  this  provi-
sion  is  best read  as  addressing  the  substantive  standards  in 
the statute, not the scope of "appropriate relief."  Texas also 
highlights Congress' choice of the word "relief," which it ar-
gues  primarily  connotes  equitable  relief.  See  Black's  Law 
Dictionary  1293  (7th ed.  1999)  (defining  "relief " as  "[t]he  re-

dress  or  benefit,  esp.  equitable  in  nature  . . . ,  that  a  party asks of a court"). 

These  plausible  arguments  demonstrate  that  the  phrase "appropriate relief " in RLUIPA is  not so free from ambigu-
ity  that  we  may  conclude  that  the  States,  by  receiving  fed-eral  funds,  have  unequivocally  expressed  intent  to  waive 
their  sovereign  immunity  to  suits  for  damages.  Strictly construing  that  phrase  in  favor  of  the  sovereign--as  we 
must,  see  Lane,  518  U. S.,  at  192--we  conclude  that  it  does not include suits for damages against a State. 

2 
The  Court's  use  of  the  phrase  "appropriate  relief "  in 
Franklin  v.  Gwinnett  County  Public  Schools,  503  U. S.  60 (1992), and Barnes v.  Gorman, 536 U. S. 181 (2002), does not 

compel a contrary conclusion.  In those cases, the Court ad-dressed  what  remedies  are  available  against  municipal  enti-
ties  under  the  implied  right  of  action  to  enforce  Title  IX  of the  Education  Amendments  of  1972,  $ 202  of  the  Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990, and $ 504  of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  With no statutory text to interpret, the Court 
"presume[d]  the  availability  of  all  appropriate  remedies  un-less Congress ha[d] expressly indicated otherwise." 

Frank-lin,  503  U. S.,  at  66.  The  Court  described  the  presumption 

as  "[t]he  general  rule"  that  "the  federal  courts  have  the power to award any 

appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of  action  brought  pursuant  to  a  federal  statute."  Id.,  at 

70-71  (emphasis  added);  see  Barnes,  supra,  at  185  (quoting Franklin,  supra,  at  73).  Finding  no  express  congressional 
intent to limit the remedies available under the implied right of  action,  the  Court  held  that  compensatory  damages  were 
available.  Franklin, supra, at 73. The  presumption  in 

Franklin  and  Barnes  is  irrelevant  to construing  the  scope  of  an  express  waiver  of  sovereign  im-

munity.  See  Lane,  supra,  at  196  ("[R]eliance  on  Franklin . . . is misplaced" in determining whether damages are avail-

Opinion of the Court 
able  against  the  Federal  Government).  The  question  here is not whether  Congress has given clear direction that it in-

tends to exclude a damages remedy, see Franklin, supra, at 70-71,  but  whether  Congress  has  given  clear  direction  that 
it intends to include a damages remedy.  The text must "es-tablish  unambiguously that  the  waiver  extends  to  monetary 
claims."  Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at 34.  In Franklin and 
Barnes, congressional silence had an entirely different impli-cation  than  it  does  here.  Whatever  "appropriate  relief " 

might  have  meant  in  those  cases  does  not  translate  to  this context.

6 

B 

Sossamon  contends  that,  because  Congress  enacted  $ 3  of RLUIPA  pursuant  to  the  Spending  Clause,  the  States  were 

necessarily on  notice that  they  would  be  liable  for  damages. He  argues  that  Spending  Clause  legislation  operates  as  a 
contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of  contract,  whether  the  contract  explicitly  includes  a  dam-
ages  remedy  or  not.  Relying  on  Barnes  and  Franklin,  he asserts  that  all  recipients  of  federal  funding  are  " `generally 
on notice that [they are] subject . . . to those remedies tradi-tionally  available  in  suits  for  breach  of  contract,' "  including 
compensatory  damages.  Brief  for  Petitioner  27  (quoting Barnes, 536 U. S., at 187; emphasis deleted). 

6 Nor  can  it  be  said  that  this  Court's  use  of  the  phrase  "appropriate 
relief" in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the 
same  phrase  in  RLUIPA  subjected  them  to  suits  for  monetary  relief. 
Those  cases  did  not  involve  sovereign  defendants,  so  the  Court  had  no 
occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns 
could  not  put  the  States  on  notice  that  they  would  be  liable  in  the  same 
manner,  absent  an  unequivocal  textual  waiver.  Moreover,  the  same 
phrase  in  RFRA  had  been  interpreted  not  to  include  damages  relief 
against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled 
to  the  States  that  damages  are  not  "appropriate  relief "  under  RLUIPA.

290  SOSSAMON  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
We  have  acknowledged  the  contract-law  analogy,  but  we have been clear "not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spending 

Clause  legislation  are  suits  in  contract,  or  that  contract-law principles  apply  to  all  issues  that  they  raise."  Id.,  at  189, 
n.  2.  We  have  not  relied  on  the  Spending  Clause  contract analogy  to  expand  liability  beyond  what  would  exist  under 
nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against  the  States,  as  Sossamon would  have  us  do.  In  fact, 
in  Barnes  and  Franklin,  the  Court  discussed  the  Spending Clause  context  only  as  a  potential 

limitation  on  liability. See Barnes, supra, at 187-188; Franklin, supra, at 74-75. 

In  any  event,  applying  ordinary  contract  principles  here would  make  little  sense  because  contracts  with  a  sovereign 
are  unique.  They  do  not  traditionally  confer  a  right  of  ac-tion  for  damages  to  enforce  compliance:  " `The  contracts  be-
tween  a  Nation  and  an  individual  are  only  binding  on  the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to com-
pulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.' " 

Lynch v.  United States, 292 U. S. 571, 580-581  (1934)  (quoting  The  Federalist,  No.  81,  at  511  (A. 

Hamilton)).7 More  fundamentally,  Sossamon's  implied-contract-

remedies  proposal  cannot  be  squared  with  our  longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly 
and  unequivocally  stated  in  the  text  of  the  relevant  statute. It  would  be  bizarre  to  create  an  "unequivocal  statement" 
rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter  what  its  text,  satisfies  that  rule  because  it  includes 
unexpressed,  implied  remedies  against  the  States.  The  re-quirement  of  a  clear  statement  in  the  text  of  the  statute 
ensures  that  Congress  has  specifically  considered  state  sov-ereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the mat-
ter.  Cf.  Spector  v.  Norwegian  Cruise  Line  Ltd.,  545  U. S. 

7 Of  course,  the  Federal  Government  has,  by  statute,  waived  its  sover-
eign immunity to damages for breach of contract in certain contexts.  See, 
e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1).

Opinion of the Court 
119,  139  (2005)  (plurality  opinion)  ("[C]lear  statement  rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, leg-

islate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due delib-eration").  Without  such  a  clear  statement  from  Congress 
and  notice  to  the  States,  federal  courts  may  not  step  in  and abrogate state sovereign immunity.

Sossamon also argues that $ 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments  of  1986,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000d-7,  independently 

put  the  State  on  notice  that  it  could  be  sued  for  damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sov-
ereign immunity for violations of "section 504 of the Rehabil-
itation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil 

Rights  Act  of  1964,  or  the  provisions  of  any  other  Federal 
statute  prohibiting  discrimination  by  recipients  of  Federal 

financial assistance."  $ 2000d-7(a)(1) (emphasis added). 
Section  1003  makes  "remedies  (including  remedies  both  at 
law  and  in  equity)  .  .  .  available  for  such  a  violation  to 
the  same  extent  as  such  remedies  are  available  for  such  a 
violation  in  the  suit  against  any  public  or  private  entity 
other  than  a  State."  $ 2000d-7(a)(2).  Sossamon  contends 
that $ 3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of $ 1003 
and  therefore  $ 1003  waives  Texas'  sovereign  immunity  to 
RLUIPA suits for damages. 

8 The  dissent  finds  our  decision  "difficult  to  understand,"  post,  at  298 
(opinion of Sotomayor,

292  SOSSAMON  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in $ 1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, $ 3 is not un-

equivocally a "statute prohibiting discrimination" within the meaning  of  $ 1003.

9  The  text  of  $ 3  does  not  prohibit  "dis-

crimination"; rather, it prohibits "substantia[l] burden[s]" on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous 

in light  of $ 2 of RLUIPA,  in which Congress  expressly pro-
hibited  "land use  regulation[s] that  discriminat[e] . . .  on the basis  of  religion."  $ 2000cc(b)(2).  A  waiver  of  sovereign 

immunity  must  be  "strictly  construed,  in  terms  of  its  scope, in favor of the sovereign." 

Lane, 518 U. S., at 192.  We can-
not say that the residual clause clearly extends to $ 3; a State might reasonably conclude that the clause covers only provi-

sions using the term "discrimination." The  statutory  provisions  specifically  listed  in  $ 1003  con-
firm that $ 3 does not unequivocally come within the scope of 
the residual clause.  "[G]eneral words," such as the residual 
clause  here,  "are  construed  to  embrace  only  objects  similar 

in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding spe-
cific words."  Washington State Dept. of Social and Health 
Servs. v.  Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 
(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Jarecki v. 

G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961) (noting that this 
maxim  "is  often  wisely  applied  where  a  word  is  capable  of 
many  meanings  in  order  to  avoid  the  giving  of  unintended 
breadth  to  the  Acts  of  Congress").  Unlike  $ 3,  each  of  the 
statutes  specifically  enumerated  in  $ 1003  explicitly  prohib-
its  "discrimination."  See  29  U. S. C.  $ 794(a);  20  U. S. C. 

$ 1681(a); 42 U. S. C. $$ 6101, 6102, 2000d.10 

9 Every  Court  of  Appeals  to  consider  the  question  has  so  held.  See 
Holley, 599 F. 3d, at 1113-1114; Van Wyhe, 581 F. 3d, at 654-655; Madison, 
474 F. 3d, at 132-133. 

10 Sossamon  argues  that  $ 3  resembles  $ 504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act, 

one of the statutes listed in $ 1003, because both require special accommo-
dations  for  particular  people  or  activities.  By  Sossamon's  reasoning,

elsewhere.  Section  1500,  identical  in  most  respects  to  the original statute, provides: 

"The United States Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which 
the  plaintiff  or  his  assignee  has  pending  in  any  other court  any  suit  or  process  against  the  United  States  or 
any  person  who,  at  the  time  when  the  cause  of  action alleged  in  such  suit  or  process  arose,  was,  in  respect 
thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States." 

The  rule  is  more  straightforward  than  its  complex  wording suggests.  The  CFC  has  no  jurisdiction  over  a  claim  if  the 
plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim pend-ing against the United States or its agents. 

The question to be resolved is what it means for two suits to  be  "for  or  in  respect  to"  the  same  claim.

Syllabus 
agreement is in an adhesion contract, disputes between the parties are 
likely to involve small amounts of damages, and the party with inferior 
bargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to defraud.  Pp. 340-341. 

(c)  The  Concepcions  claim  that  the  Discover  Bank  rule  is  a  ground 
that  "exist[s]  at  law  or  in  equity  for  the  revocation  of  any  contract" 
under FAA $ 2.  When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a 
particular  type  of  claim,  the  FAA  displaces  the  conflicting  rule.  But 
the  inquiry  is  more  complex  when  a  generally  applicable  doctrine  is 
alleged  to  have  been  applied  in  a  fashion  that  disfavors  or  interferes 
with  arbitration.  Although  $ 2's  saving  clause  preserves  generally  ap-
plicable  contract  defenses,  it  does  not  suggest  an  intent  to  preserve 
state-law  rules  that  stand  as  an  obstacle  to  the  accomplishment  of  the 
FAA's  objectives.  Cf.  Geier  v.  American  Honda  Motor  Co.,  529  U. S. 
861, 872.  The FAA's overarching purpose is to ensure the enforcement 
of  arbitration  agreements  according  to  their  terms  so  as  to  facilitate 
informal,  streamlined  proceedings.  Parties  may  agree  to  limit  the  is-
sues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.  Soler ChryslerPlymouth,  Inc.,  473  U. S.  614,  628,  to  arbitrate  according  to  specific 
rules,  Volt,  supra,  at  479,  and  to  limit  with  whom  they  will  arbitrate, 
Stolt-Nielsen  S.  A.  v.  Animal  Feeds  Int'l  Corp.,  559  U. S.  662,  683. 
Pp. 341-346. 

(d)  Class  arbitration,  to  the  extent  it  is  manufactured  by  Discover 
Bank  rather  than  consensual,  interferes  with  fundamental  attributes 
of arbitration.  The switch from bilateral  to class  arbitration sacrifices 
arbitration's informality and makes the process slower, more costly, and 
more  likely  to  generate  procedural  morass  than  final  judgment.  And 
class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.  The absence of 
multilayered  review  makes  it  more  likely  that  errors  will  go  uncor-
rected.  That  risk  of  error  may  become  unacceptable  when  damages 
allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are aggregated and decided at 
once.  Arbitration is poorly suited to these higher stakes.  In litigation, 
a defendant may appeal a certification decision and a final judgment, but 
9  U. S. C.  $ 10  limits  the  grounds  on  which  courts  can  vacate  arbitral 
awards.  Pp. 346-352.

then offer to settle the claim; if  it does  not, or if the dispute is not  resolved  within  30 days, the  customer may  invoke  ar-

bitration  by  filing  a  separate  Demand  for  Arbitration,  also available on AT&T's Web site.  In the event the parties pro-
ceed to arbitration, the agreement specifies that AT&T must pay  all  costs  for  nonfrivolous  claims;  that  arbitration  must 
take place in the county in which the customer is billed; that, for  claims  of  $10,000  or  less,  the  customer  may  choose 
whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based  only  on  submissions;  that  either  party  may  bring  a 
claim  in  small  claims  court  in  lieu  of  arbitration;  and  that the  arbitrator  may  award  any  form  of  individual  relief,  in-
cluding injunctions and presumably punitive damages.  The agreement, moreover, denies AT&T any ability to seek reim-
bursement of its attorney's fees, and, in the event that a cus-tomer  receives  an  arbitration  award  greater  than  AT&T's 
last written settlement offer, requires AT&T to pay a $7,500 minimum  recovery  and  twice  the  amount  of  the  claimant's 
attorney's fees.3 The  Concepcions  purchased  AT&T  service,  which  was  ad-
vertised as including the provision of free phones; they were not charged for the phones, but they were charged $30.22 in 
sales tax based  on the  phones' retail  value.  In March  2006, the  Concepcions  filed  a  complaint  against  AT&T  in  the 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of California.  The complaint was later consolidated with a pu-
tative  class  action  alleging,  among  other  things,  that  AT&T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales 
tax on phones it advertised as free. In  March  2008,  AT&T  moved  to  compel  arbitration  under 
the  terms  of  its  contract  with  the  Concepcions.  The  Con-cepcions opposed the motion, contending that the arbitration 
agreement  was  unconscionable  and  unlawfully  exculpatory

under  California  law  because  it  disallowed  classwide  proce-dures.  The  District  Court  denied  AT&T's  motion.  It  de-

scribed  AT&T's  arbitration  agreement  favorably,  noting,  for example,  that  the  informal  dispute-resolution  process  was 
"quick,  easy  to  use,"  and  likely  to  "promp[t]  full or  .  . .  even excess  payment  to  the  customer 

without  the  need  to  arbi-
trate  or  litigate";  that  the  $7,500  premium  functioned  as 
"a  substantial  inducement  for  the  consumer  to  pursue  the claim in arbitration" if a dispute was not resolved informally; 

and  that  consumers  who  were  members  of  a  class  would likely be worse off.

Bank  v.  Superior  Court,  36  Cal.  4th  148,  113  P.  3d  1100 
(2005), the court found that the arbitration provision was un-
conscionable because AT&T had not shown that bilateral ar-
bitration  adequately  substituted  for  the  deterrent  effects  of 
class actions.  Laster, 2008 WL 5216255, *14. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed,  also  finding  the  provision  un-
conscionable  under  California  law  as  announced  in  Discover 
Bank.  Laster  v.  AT&T  Mobility  LLC,  584  F.  3d  849,  855 
(2009).  It  also  held  that  the  Discover  Bank  rule  was  not 
pre-empted  by  the  FAA  because  that  rule  was  simply  "a 
refinement  of  the  unconscionability  analysis  applicable  to 
contracts  generally  in  California."  584  F.  3d,  at  857  (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted).  In response to AT&T's argu-
ment  that  the  Concepcions'  interpretation  of  California  law 
discriminated against arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected 
the  contention  that  " `class  proceedings  will  reduce  the  effi-
ciency  and  expeditiousness  of  arbitration' "  and  noted  that 
" `Discover  Bank  placed  arbitration  agreements  with  class 
action  waivers  on  the  exact  same  footing  as  contracts  that 
bar class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.' "

Opinion of the Court 

II 
The  FAA  was  enacted  in  1925  in  response  to  widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.  See 

Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v.  Mattel,  Inc., 552  U. S. 576, 581  (2008). 

Section  2,  the  "primary  substantive  provision  of  the  Act," Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v.  Mercury Constr. Corp., 
460  U. S.  1,  24  (1983),  provides,  in  relevant  part,  as  follows: 

"A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to 

settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevo-
cable,  and  enforceable,  save  upon  such  grounds  as  exist at  law  or  in  equity  for  the  revocation  of  any  contract." 
9  U. S. C.  $ 2.  
We have described this provision as reflecting both a "liberal federal  policy  favoring  arbitration," 

Moses  H.  Cone,  supra, at  24,  and  the  "fundamental  principle  that  arbitration  is  a 

matter  of  contract,"  Rent-A-Center,  West,  Inc.  v.  Jackson, 561  U. S.  63,  67  (2010).  In  line  with  these  principles, 
courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with  other  contracts,  Buckeye  Check  Cashing,  Inc.  v.  Car-
degna, 546  U. S. 440, 443  (2006),  and enforce  them according to  their  terms,  Volt  Information  Sciences,  Inc.  v.  Board  of 
Trustees  of  Leland  Stanford  Junior  Univ.,  489  U. S.  468, 478 (1989). 

The final phrase of $ 2, however, permits arbitration agree-ments  to  be  declared  unenforceable  "upon  such  grounds  as 
exist  at law or in equity for  the revocation of any contract." This saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be in-
validated by "generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability," but not by defenses that 
apply  only  to  arbitration  or  that  derive  their  meaning  from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.  Doctor's

340  AT&T  MOBILITY  LLC  v.  CONCEPCION 

Opinion of the Court 
The  question  in  this  case  is  whether  $ 2  pre-empts  Califor-nia's  rule  classifying  most  collective-arbitration  waivers  in 

consumer contracts as unconscionable.  We refer to this rule as the 

Discover Bank rule. 
Under  California  law,  courts  may  refuse  to  enforce  any contract  found  "to  have  been  unconscionable  at  the  time  it 

was made," or may "limit the application of any unconscion-
able  clause."  Cal.  Civ.  Code  Ann.  $ 1670.5(a)  (West  1985). A  finding  of  unconscionability  requires  "a `procedural'  and  a 

`substantive' element, the former focusing on `oppression' or `surprise'  due  to  unequal  bargaining  power,  the  latter  on 
`overly harsh' or `one-sided' results."  Armendariz v.  Foun-
dation  Health  Psychcare  Servs.,  Inc.,  24  Cal.  4th  83,  114,  6 
P.  3d  669,  690  (2000);  accord,  Discover  Bank,  36  Cal.  4th,  at 159-161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108. 

In  Discover  Bank,  the  California  Supreme  Court  applied 
this  framework  to  class-action  waivers  in  arbitration  agree-ments and held as follows: 

"[W]hen  the  waiver  is  found  in  a  consumer  contract  of 
adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the con-
tracting  parties  predictably  involve  small  amounts  of damages, and when it is alleged that the party with the 

superior  bargaining  power  has  carried  out  a  scheme  to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of in-
dividually  small  sums  of  money,  then  .  .  .  the  waiver becomes  in  practice  the  exemption  of  the  party  `from 
responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person  or  property  of  another.'  Under  these  circum-
stances, such waivers are unconscionable under Califor-
nia  law  and  should  not  be  enforced."  Id.,  at  162-163, 
113  P.  3d,  at  1110  (quoting  Cal.  Civ.  Code  Ann.  $ 1668). 

California  courts  have  frequently  applied  this  rule  to  find 
arbitration  agreements  unconscionable.  See,  e. g.,  Cohen  v. 
DIRECTV,  Inc.,  142  Cal.  App.  4th  1442,  1451-1453,  48  Cal.

A  

The Concepcions argue that the Discover Bank rule, given its origins in California's unconscionability doctrine and Cali-

fornia's  policy  against  exculpation,  is  a  ground  that  "exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract" under 
FAA  $ 2.  Moreover,  they  argue  that  even  if  we  construe the 

Discover  Bank  rule  as  a  prohibition  on  collective-action waivers rather  than simply an application of unconscionabil-

ity, the rule would still be applicable to all dispute-resolution contracts,  since  California  prohibits  waivers  of  class  litiga-
tion  as  well.  See  America  Online,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court, 90  Cal.  App.  4th  1,  17-18,  108  Cal.  Rptr.  2d  699,  711-713 
(2001). When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a par-
ticular  type  of  claim,  the  analysis  is  straightforward:  The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. 

Preston v.  Ferrer, 552  U. S.  346,  353  (2008).  But  the  inquiry  becomes  more 

complex  when  a  doctrine  normally  thought  to  be  generally applicable,  such  as  duress  or,  as  relevant  here,  unconsciona-
bility, is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfa-vors  arbitration.  In  Perry  v.  Thomas,  482  U. S.  483  (1987), 
for  example,  we  noted  that  the  FAA's  pre-emptive  effect might  extend  even  to  grounds  traditionally  thought  to  exist 
" `at  law  or  in  equity  for  the  revocation  of  any  contract.' " 
Id.,  at  492,  n.  9  (emphasis  deleted).  We  said  that  a  court may not "rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate 

as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect what 
. . . the state legislature cannot."  Id., at 493, n. 9. An  obvious  illustration  of  this  point  would  be  a  case  find-
ing  unconscionable  or  unenforceable  as  against  public  policy 

342  AT&T  MOBILITY  LLC  v.  CONCEPCION 

Opinion of the Court 
consumer arbitration agreements that fail to provide for judi-cially  monitored  discovery.  The  rationalizations  for  such  a 

holding  are  neither  difficult to  imagine nor  different  in  kind from  those  articulated  in 

Discover  Bank.  A  court  might 
reason that no consumer would knowingly waive his right to full  discovery,  as  this  would  enable  companies  to  hide  their 

wrongdoing.  Or the court might simply say that such agree-
ments  are  exculpatory--restricting  discovery  would  be  of greater benefit to the company than the consumer, since the 

former  is  more likely to  be sued  than  to  sue.  See Discover 
Bank,  supra,  at  161,  113  P.  3d,  at  1108-1109  (arguing  that 
class  waivers  are  similarly  one  sided).  And,  the  reasoning 
would continue, because such a rule applies the general prin-
ciple  of  unconscionability  or  public-policy  disapproval  of  ex-
culpatory  agreements,  it  is  applicable  to  "any"  contract  and 
thus  preserved  by  $ 2  of  the  FAA.  In  practice,  of  course, 
the rule would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration 
agreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts pur-
porting to restrict discovery in litigation as well. 

Other examples are easy to imagine.  The same argument 
might  apply  to  a  rule  classifying  as  unconscionable  arbitra-
tion  agreements  that  fail  to  abide  by  the  Federal  Rules  of 
Evidence,  or  that  disallow  an  ultimate  disposition  by  a  jury 
(perhaps  termed  "a  panel  of  twelve  lay  arbitrators"  to  help 
avoid  pre-emption).  Such  examples  are  not  fanciful,  since 
the  judicial  hostility  towards  arbitration  that  prompted  the 
FAA  had  manifested  itself  in  "a  great  variety"  of  "devices 
and  formulas"  declaring  arbitration  against  public  policy. 
Robert  Lawrence  Co.  v.  Devonshire  Fabrics,  Inc.,  271  F.  2d 
402,  406  (CA2  1959).  And  although  these  statistics  are  not 
definitive,  it  is  worth  noting  that  California's  courts  have 
been  more  likely  to  hold  contracts  to  arbitrate  unconscion-
able  than  other  contracts.  Broome,  An  Unconscionable

Attitudes Toward Arbitration and the Resurgence of Uncon-scionability, 52 Buffalo L. Rev. 185, 186-187 (2004). 

The  Concepcions  suggest  that  all  this  is  just  a  parade  of horribles,  and  no  genuine  worry.  "Rules  aimed  at  destroy-
ing arbitration" or "demanding procedures incompatible with arbitration," they concede, "would be preempted by the FAA 
because  they  cannot  sensibly  be  reconciled  with  Section  2." 
Brief  for  Respondents  32.  The  "grounds"  available  under $ 2's  saving  clause,  they  admit,  "should  not  be  construed  to 

include a State's mere preference for procedures that are in-compatible with arbitration and `would wholly eviscerate ar-
bitration  agreements.' "  Id.,  at  33  (quoting  Carter  v.  SSC 
Odin  Operating  Co.,  LLC,  237  Ill.  2d  30,  50,  927  N.  E.  2d 
1207, 1220 (2010)).4 We largely agree.  Although $ 2's saving clause preserves 

generally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it suggests an  intent  to  preserve  state-law  rules  that  stand  as  an  ob-
stacle  to  the  accomplishment  of  the  FAA's  objectives.  Cf. 
Geier  v.  American  Honda  Motor  Co.,  529  U. S.  861,  872 
(2000); Crosby v.  National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 
363,  372-373  (2000).  As  we  have  said,  a  federal  statute's 
saving  clause  " `cannot  in  reason  be  construed  as  [allowing] 
a common law right, the continued existence of which would 
be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the act.  In 
other  words,  the  act  cannot  be  held  to  destroy  itself.' "

sion.  It  says  that  to  its  knowledge  "we  have  not  .  .  .  applied  the  Act  to

and administrative proceedings," post, at 366 (opinion of Breyer,

344  AT&T  MOBILITY  LLC  v.  CONCEPCION 

Opinion of the Court 
We  differ  with  the  Concepcions  only  in  the  application  of this analysis to the matter before us.  We do not agree that 

rules  requiring  judicially  monitored  discovery  or  adherence to  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  are  "a  far  cry  from  this 
case."  Brief for Respondents 32.  The overarching purpose of the FAA, evident in the text of $$ 2, 3, and 4, is to ensure 
the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms  so  as  to  facilitate  streamlined  proceedings.  Requir-
ing  the  availability  of  classwide  arbitration  interferes  with fundamental  attributes  of  arbitration  and  thus  creates  a 
scheme inconsistent with the FAA. 

B 
The  "principal  purpose"  of  the  FAA  is  to  "ensur[e]  that private  arbitration  agreements  are  enforced  according  to 

their  terms."  Volt,  489  U. S.,  at  478;  see  also  Stolt-Nielsen 
S.  A.  v.  AnimalFeeds  Int'l  Corp.,  559  U. S.  662,  681-682 (2010).  This  purpose  is  readily  apparent  from  the  FAA's 

text.  Section 2 makes arbitration agreements "valid, irrev-ocable, and enforceable" as written (subject, of course, to the 
saving  clause);  $ 3  requires  courts  to  stay  litigation  of  arbi-tral claims pending arbitration of those claims "in accordance 
with  the  terms  of  the  agreement";  and  $ 4  requires  courts to  compel  arbitration  "in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the 
agreement"  upon  the  motion  of  either  party  to  the  agree-ment  (assuming  that  the  "making  of  the  arbitration  agree-
ment or the failure . . . to perform the same" is not at issue). In  light  of  these  provisions,  we  have  held  that  parties  may 
agree  to  limit  the  issues  subject  to  arbitration,  Mitsubishi 
Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-Plymouth,  Inc.,  473  U. S. 614,  628  (1985),  to  arbitrate according  to specific  rules,  Volt, 

supra, at 479,  and to limit with whom a party  will arbitrate its disputes, 

Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at 683. The  point  of  affording  parties  discretion  in  designing 

arbitration  processes  is  to  allow  for  efficient,  streamlined procedures  tailored  to  the  type  of  dispute.  It  can  be  speci-

fied,  for  example,  that  the  decisionmaker  be  a  specialist  in the relevant field, or that proceedings be kept confidential to 

protect  trade  secrets.  And  the  informality  of  arbitral  pro-ceedings  is  itself  desirable,  reducing  the  cost  and  increasing 
the  speed  of  dispute  resolution.  14  Penn  Plaza  LLC  v. 
Pyett,  556  U. S.  247,  269  (2009);  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.,

The  dissent  quotes  Dean  Witter  Reynolds  Inc.  v.  Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219 (1985), as " `reject[ing] the suggestion that 

the  overriding  goal  of  the  Arbitration  Act  was  to  promote the expeditious resolution of claims.' "

They have repeatedly described the  Act as "embod[ying] [a] 
national  policy  favoring  arbitration,"  Buckeye  Check  Cash-
ing,  546  U. S.,  at  443,  and  "a  liberal  federal  policy  favoring 
arbitration  agreements,  notwithstanding  any  state  substan-
tive  or  procedural  policies  to  the  contrary,"  Moses  H.  Cone, 
460 U. S., at 24; see also Hall Street Assocs., 552 U. S., at 581. 
Thus,  in  Preston  v.  Ferrer,  holding  pre-empted  a  state-law 
rule  requiring  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies  before 
arbitration,  we  said:  "A  prime  objective  of  an  agreement  to 
arbitrate  is  to  achieve  `streamlined  proceedings  and  expedi-
tious results,' " which objective would be "frustrated" by re-
quiring  a  dispute  to be  heard by  an agency  first.  552  U. S., 
at 357-358.  That  rule, we  said,  would,  "at the  least, hinder 
speedy resolution of the controversy."  Id., at 358.5 

California's  Discover  Bank  rule  similarly  interferes  with 
arbitration.  Although  the  rule  does  not  require  classwide 
arbitration,  it  allows  any  party  to  a  consumer  contract  to 
demand it ex post.  The rule is limited to adhesion contracts, 
Discover  Bank,  36  Cal.  4th,  at  162-163,  113  P.  3d,  at  1110,

5 Relying  upon  nothing  more  indicative  of  congressional  understanding 
than statements of witnesses in committee hearings and a press release of 
Secretary  of  Commerce  Herbert  Hoover,  the  dissent  suggests  that  Con-
gress "thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants 
sought to  resolve disputes of  fact .  .  . [and] possessed  roughly  equivalent 
bargaining power."  Post,  at 362.  Such a  limitation appears  nowhere in 
the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our cases.  "Rela-
tionships  between  securities  dealers  and  investors,  for  example,  may  in-
volve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] nevertheless held . . . that 
agreements  to  arbitrate  in  that  context  are  enforceable."  Gilmer  v.  In-
terstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 33 (1991); see also id., at 32-33 
(allowing  arbitration  of  claims  arising  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment Act of 1967 despite allegations of unequal bargaining power 
between  employers  and  employees).  Of  course  the  dissent's  disquisition 
on  legislative  history  fails  to  note  that  it  contains  nothing--not  even  the 
testimony  of  a  stray  witness  in  committee  hearings--that  contemplates 
the existence of class arbitration.

v.  Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1147, 1149 (CA7 1997).  The rule  also  requires  that  damages  be  predictably  small,  and 
that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers.  Dis-
cover  Bank,  supra, at  162-163,  113  P.  3d,  at  1110.  The  for-mer  requirement,  however,  is  toothless  and  malleable  (the 

Ninth Circuit has held that damages of $4,000 are sufficiently small,  see  Oestreicher  v.  Alienware  Corp.,  322  Fed.  Appx. 
489, 492  (2009)  (unpublished)), and  the  latter  has  no limiting effect,  as  all  that  is  required  is  an  allegation.  Consumers 
remain free to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis  under 

Discover  Bank,  and  some  may  well  do  so;  but there  is  little  incentive  for  lawyers  to  arbitrate  on  behalf  of 

individuals  when  they  may  do  so  for  a  class  and  reap  far higher  fees  in  the  process.  And  faced  with  inevitable  class 
arbitration, companies would have less incentive to continue resolving  potentially  duplicative  claims  on  an  individual 
basis. Although we have had little occasion to examine classwide 
arbitration,  our  decision  in  Stolt-Nielsen  is  instructive.  In that  case  we  held  that  an  arbitration  panel  exceeded  its 
power  under  $ 10(a)(4)  of  the  FAA  by  imposing  class  proce-dures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration 
agreement  itself  or  some  background  principle  of  contract law  that  would  affect  its  interpretation.  559  U. S.,  at  684- 
687.  We  then  held  that  the  agreement  at  issue,  which  was silent on the question of class procedures, could not be inter-
preted to allow them because the "changes brought about by the  shift  from  bilateral  arbitration  to  class-action  arbitra-
tion"  are  "fundamental."  Id.,  at  686.  This  is  obvious  as  a 

6 Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns that 
attend  contracts  of  adhesion--for  example,  requiring  class-action-waiver 
provisions in adhesive agreements to be highlighted.  Such steps cannot, 
however,  conflict  with  the  FAA  or  frustrate  its  purpose  to  ensure  that 
private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.

Opinion of the Court 
structural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent par-ties,  necessitating  additional  and  different  procedures  and 

involving higher stakes.  Confidentiality becomes more difficult.  And  while  it  is  theoretically  possible  to  select 

an  arbitrator  with  some  expertise  relevant  to  the  class-certification  question,  arbitrators  are  not  generally  knowl-
edgeable  in  the  often-dominant  procedural  aspects  of  cer-
tification,  such  as  the  protection  of  absent  parties.  The conclusion  follows  that  class  arbitration,  to  the  extent  it  is 

manufactured  by  Discover  Bank  rather  than  consensual,  is inconsistent with the FAA. 

First,  the  switch  from  bilateral  to  class  arbitration  sacri-
fices  the  principal  advantage  of  arbitration--its  informality--and  makes  the  process  slower,  more  costly,  and  more 
likely  to  generate  procedural  morass  than  final  judgment. 
"In  bilateral  arbitration,  parties  forgo  the  procedural  rigor 
and  appellate  review  of  the  courts  in  order  to  realize  the 
benefits  of  private  dispute  resolution:  lower  costs,  greater 
efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudi-
cators  to  resolve  specialized  disputes."  559  U. S.,  at  685. 
But  before  an  arbitrator  may  decide  the  merits  of  a  claim 
in  classwide  procedures,  he  must  first  decide,  for  example, 
whether the class itself may be certified, whether the named 
parties  are  sufficiently  representative  and  typical,  and  how 
discovery for the class should be conducted.  A cursory com-
parison  of  bilateral  and  class  arbitration  illustrates  the  dif-
ference.  According to the American Arbitration Association 
(AAA),  the  average  consumer  arbitration  between  January 
and  August  2007  resulted  in  a  disposition  on  the  merits  in 
six months,  four months  if the arbitration was conducted  by 
documents  only.  AAA,  Analysis  of  the  AAA's  Consumer

5027  (all  Internet  materials  as  visited  Apr.  25,  2011,  and 
available  in  Clerk  of  Court's  case  file).  As  of  September 
2009, the AAA had opened 283 class arbitrations.  Of those, 
121  remained  active,  and  162  had  been  settled,  withdrawn,

Opinion of the Court 
or  dismissed.  Not  a  single  one,  however,  had  resulted  in  a final  award  on  the  merits.  Brief  for  AAA  as  Amicus  Cu-

riae  in  Stolt-Nielsen,  O.  T.  2009,  No.  08-1198,  pp.  22-24. For those cases that  were no longer  active, the  median time 
from filing to settlement, withdrawal, or dismissal--not judg-ment  on  the  merits--was  583  days,  and  the  mean  was  630 
days.  Id., at 24.7 Second,  class  arbitration 

requires  procedural  formality. The AAA's rules governing class arbitrations mimic the Fed-

eral  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  for  class  litigation.  Compare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (effective 
Oct.  8,  2003),  online  at  http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=21936, with  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  23.  And  while  parties  can  alter 
those  procedures  by  contract,  an  alternative  is  not  obvious. If  procedures  are  too  informal,  absent class  members  would 
not  be  bound  by  the  arbitration.  For  a  class-action  money judgment  to  bind  absentees  in  litigation,  class  representa-
tives  must  at  all  times  adequately  represent  absent  class members,  and  absent  members  must  be  afforded  notice,  an 
opportunity  to  be  heard,  and  a  right  to  opt  out  of  the  class. 
Phillips  Petroleum  Co.  v.  Shutts,  472  U. S.  797,  811-812 (1985).  At  least  this  amount  of  process  would  presumably 

be  required  for  absent  parties  to  be  bound  by  the  results of arbitration. 

We  find  it  unlikely  that  in  passing  the  FAA  Congress meant  to  leave  the  disposition  of  these  procedural  require-
ments  to  an  arbitrator.  Indeed,  class  arbitration  was  not even  envisioned  by  Congress  when  it  passed  the  FAA  in 
1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in Discover 
Bank, class  arbitration is a "relatively  recent development." 36 Cal. 4th, at 163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110.  And it is at the very 

7 The  dissent  claims  that  class  arbitration  should  be  compared  to  class 
litigation, not bilateral arbitration.  Post, at 363.  Whether arbitrating a 
class  is  more  desirable  than  litigating  one,  however,  is  not  relevant.  A 
State  cannot  defend  a  rule  requiring  arbitration-by-jury  by  saying  that 
parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury.

least odd to think that an arbitrator would be entrusted with ensuring  that  third  parties'  due  process  rights  are  satisfied. 

Third,  class  arbitration  greatly  increases  risks  to  defend-ants.  Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The ab-
sence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will  go  uncorrected.  Defendants  are  willing  to  accept  the 
costs of these errors in arbitration, since their impact is lim-
ited  to  the  size  of  individual  disputes,  and  presumably  out-weighed  by  savings  from  avoiding  the  courts.  But  when 

damages  allegedly  owed  to  tens  of  thousands  of  potential claimants are aggregated and decided at once, the risk of an 
error  will  often  become  unacceptable.  Faced  with  even  a 
small  chance  of  a  devastating  loss,  defendants  will  be  pres-
sured  into  settling  questionable  claims.  Other  courts  have 
noted the risk of "in terrorem" settlements that class actions 
entail, see, e. g., Kohen v.  Pacific Inv. Management Co. LLC, 
571  F.  3d  672,  677-678  (CA7  2009),  and  class  arbitration 
would be no different. 

Arbitration  is  poorly  suited  to  the  higher  stakes  of  class 
litigation.  In  litigation,  a  defendant  may  appeal  a  certifica-
tion  decision  on  an  interlocutory  basis  and,  if  unsuccessful, 
may appeal from a final judgment as well.  Questions of law 
are  reviewed  de  novo  and  questions  of  fact  for  clear  error. 
In contrast, 9 U. S. C. $ 10 allows a court to vacate an arbitral 
award  only  where  the  award  "was  procured  by  corruption, 
fraud, or undue means"; "there was evident partiality or cor-
ruption  in  the  arbitrators";  "the  arbitrators  were  guilty  of 
misconduct  in  refusing  to  postpone  the  hearing . . . or in  
refusing to hear  evidence pertinent and material to the con-
troversy[,]  or  of  any  other  misbehavior  by  which  the  rights 
of  any  party  have  been  prejudiced";  or  if  the  "arbitrators 
exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that 
a mutual, final, and definite award . . . was not made."  The 
AAA  rules do authorize judicial review of certification deci-
sions,  but  this  review  is  unlikely  to  have  much  effect  given 
these  limitations;  review  under  $ 10  focuses  on  misconduct

rather than mistake.  And parties may not contractually ex-pand  the  grounds  or  nature  of  judicial  review.  Hall  Street 

Assocs.,  552  U. S.,  at  578.  We  find  it  hard  to  believe  that defendants  would  bet  the  company  with  no  effective  means 
of  review,  and  even  harder  to  believe  that  Congress  would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision.

The  Concepcions  contend  that  because  parties  may  and sometimes do agree to aggregation, class procedures are not 

necessarily  incompatible  with  arbitration.  But  the  same could  be  said  about  procedures  that  the  Concepcions  admit 
States  may  not  superimpose  on  arbitration:  Parties  could agree to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure,  or  pursuant  to  a  discovery  process  rivaling  that  in litigation.  Arbitration is a matter of contract, and the FAA 
requires  courts  to  honor  parties'  expectations.  Rent-A-Center,  West,  561  U. S.,  at  67-69.  But  what  the  parties  in 
the  aforementioned  examples  would  have  agreed  to  is  not arbitration as envisioned by the FAA, lacks its benefits, and 
therefore may not be required by state law. The  dissent  claims  that  class  proceedings  are  necessary 
to  prosecute  small-dollar  claims  that  might  otherwise  slip through the legal system.  See post, at 365.  But States can-
not  require  a  procedure  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  FAA, even  if  it  is  desirable  for  unrelated  reasons.  Moreover,  the 
claim  here  was  most  unlikely  to  go  unresolved.  As  noted earlier,  the  arbitration  agreement  provides  that  AT&T  will 

8 The dissent cites  three  large  arbitration awards  (none  of  which stems 
from classwide arbitration) as evidence that parties are willing to submit 
large  claims  before  an  arbitrator.  Post,  at  364.  Those  examples  might 
be  in  point  if  it  could  be  established  that  the  size  of  the  arbitral  dispute 
was predictable when the arbitration agreement was entered.  Otherwise, 
all  the  cases  prove  is  that  arbitrators  can  give  huge  awards--which  we 
have  never  doubted.  The  point  is  that  in  class-action  arbitration  huge 
awards (with limited judicial review) will be entirely predictable, thus ren-
dering arbitration unattractive.  It is not reasonably deniable that requir-
ing  consumer  disputes  to  be  arbitrated  on  a  classwide  basis  will  have  a 
substantial deterrent effect on incentives to arbitrate.

improper enlargement of that right.  Although the law of  return flows 
is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the Special Master correctly 
concluded  that Wyoming's  pre-1950 users  may switch  to  sprinkler irri-
gation.  Pp. 374-385. 

(1)  A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of 
the no-injury rule in  Montana and Wyoming, which generally concerns 
changes in the location of the diversion and the place or purpose of use. 
Thus,  an  appropriator  may  increase  his  consumption  by  changing  to  a 
more  water-intensive  crop  so  long  as  he  makes  no  change  in  acreage 
irrigated  or  amount  of  water  diverted.  Ordinary,  day-to-day  opera-
tional changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.  Consumption can 
even be increased  by  adding farm acreage,  if  that was part  of the  plan 
from  the  start,  and  diligently  pursued  through  the  years.  Irrigation 
system improvements seem to be the same sort of changes.  This view 
is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulat-
ing  certain  changes  to  water  rights,  but  neither  required  farmers  to 
take official  action before  adjusting  irrigation  methods.  Cases in  both 
States frequently describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in 
point of diversion,  purpose of use, and place of use.  The abundance of 
litigation over such changes--and the absence of any litigation over the 
sort of  change at issue here--strongly  implies that irrigation efficiency 
improvements  were  considered  within  the  scope  of  the  original  appro-
priative right.  Pp. 378-380. 

(2)  The doctrine of recapture--which permits an appropriator who 
has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own runoff 
and seepage before it escapes his control or his property--also supports 
treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the original appro-
priative right.  Montana and Wyoming cases appear to apply this basic 
doctrine  without  any  qualification  based  on  whether  the  return  flow 
would reenter the original stream or not.  By using sprinklers instead 
of flood irrigation, Wyoming's pre-1950 water users effectively recapture 
water.  The  sprinklers  reduce  loss  from  seepage  and  runoff  and  are 
simply  different  mechanisms  for  increasing  the  volume  of  water  avail-
able  to  crops  without  changing  the  amount  of  diversion.  Pp.  380-384. 

(3)  This conclusion is consistent with the view of water law scholars 
who have considered the question presented in this case.  Pp. 384-385. 

(b)  Also unpersuasive is Montana's argument that, if background ap-
propriation  law  principles  do  not  support  its  position,  Article  V(A)'s 
"beneficial  use"  definition  nonetheless  restricts  the  scope  of  pre-1950 
appropriative rights to the net volume of water that was actually being 
consumed in 1950.  Pp. 385-388. 

(1)  "Beneficial  use"  is  "that  use  by  which  the  water  supply  of  a 
drainage  basin  is  depleted  when  usefully  employed  by  the  activities  of

pact.  552  U. S.  1175.  Montana  alleged  that  Wyoming  had 
breached  the  Compact  by  consuming  more  than  its  share  of 
the  Tongue  and  Powder  Rivers.  Bill  of  Complaint  3,  || 8. 
Specifically,  Montana  claimed  that  Wyoming  was  ap-
propriating  water  for  a  number  of  new,  post-1950  uses:  irri-
gating new acreage; building new storage facilities; conduct-
ing  new  groundwater  pumping;  and  increasing  consumption 
on existing agricultural acreage.1  Id.,

improving their irrigation systems even if it reduces the flow of  water  to  Montana's  pre-1950  users.  Montana  makes  two 

basic arguments: that background principles of appropriation law,  to  the  extent  they  are  incorporated  into  the  Compact, 
do not allow such an increase in  consumption; and that even if  they  do,  the  terms  of  the  Compact  amended  those  princi-
ples in  Montana's favor.  The Special Master rejected these arguments, and so do we. 

A 
Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects "[a]ppropri-ative  rights  to  the  beneficial  uses  of  [water]"  as  of  1950  "in 

accordance  with  the  laws  governing  the  acquisition  and  use of water under the doctrine of appropriation," we begin with 
an overview of appropriation doctrine.4  As the Special Mas-ter  explained,  if  "[a]ppropriation  law  clearly  proscribe[s]  in-
creases in consumption on existing acreage to the detriment of  downstream  appropriators,  the  Compact  arguably  would 
prohibit  Wyoming  from  allowing  its  appropriators  to  make such increases to the detriment of Montana's pre-1950 
uses."  Report 65. As  is  typical  west  of  the  100th  meridian,  the  doctrine  of 
appropriation  has  governed  water  rights  in  Montana  and Wyoming since the 1800's.  See,

injury  rule  junior  users  can  prevent  senior  users  from  en-larging  their  rights  to  the  junior  users'  detriment.  1  W. 

Hutchins,  Water  Rights  Laws  in  the  Nineteen  Western States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins). 

Montana's pre-1950  users can  therefore  "insist  that [Wyo-ming's pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly within the 
rights  which  the  law  gives  them,  that  is,  to  the  amount  of water  within  the  extent  of  their  appropriation  which  they 
actually  apply  to  some  beneficial  use."  2  Kinney  $ 784,  at 1366.  That  general  proposition  is  undisputed;  the  dispute 
here is in its application.  Is a switch to more efficient irriga-tion  with  less  return  flow  within  the  extent  of  Wyoming's 
pre-1950  users'  existing  appropriative  rights,  or  is  it  an  im-proper  enlargement  of  that  right  to  the  detriment  of  Mon-
tana's pre-1950 water users? As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows is 
an unclear area of appropriation doctrine.  Report 65 (citing Trelease,  Reclamation  Water  Rights,  32  Rocky  Mt.  L.  Rev. 
464,  469  (1960)).  The  States  have  not  directed  us  to  any case on  all  fours  with this  one.  Indeed, "[n]o  western  state 
court  appears  to  have  conclusively  answered  the  question." 
Report 65. Despite  the  lack  of  clarity,  the  Special  Master  found  sev-

eral reasons to conclude that Wyoming's pre-1950 users may switch  to  sprinkler  irrigation.  He  found  that  the  scope  of 
the  original  appropriative  right  includes  such  a  change  so long  as no  additional  water is  diverted  from  the  stream  and 
the  conserved  water  is  used  on  the  same  acreage  for  the same  agricultural  purpose  as  before.  We  agree  with  the 
Special Master.5 

5 The  lack  of  clarity  in  this  area  of  water  law  highlights  the  sensi-
tive nature of our inquiry and counsels caution.  Our original jurisdiction 
over  cases  between  States  brings  us  this  dispute  between  Montana  and 
Wyoming  about  the  meaning  of  their  congressionally  approved  Yellow-
stone  River  Compact.  See  U.  S.  Const.,  Art.  III,  $ 2,  cl.  2;  28  U. S. C.

water  diverted.  See  id.,

773  P.  2d  988,  996-997  (1989)  ("No  appropriator  can  compel any other appropriator to continue the waste of water which 

benefits the former.  If the senior appropriator, through sci-entific  and  technical  advances,  can  utilize  his  water  so  that

runoff  or  seepage  water  would,  if  not  recaptured,  return  to 
the same stream from which it was originally drawn.  There is  some  support  for  Montana's  position--that  a  beneficial 

user  may  not  reuse  water  at  all,  even  while  it  is  still  on his  property,  if  it  otherwise  would  flow  back  to  the  same 
stream--especially  in  Utah  and  Colorado  cases.  See  Des-

because the water had already escaped from Fuss' property. 
The  court  said  that  the  "owner  of  land  upon  which  seepage 
or waste water rises has the right to use and reuse--capture 
and  recapture--such  waste  waters,"  but  only  before  the 
water  escapes  his  land,  and  "for  use  only  upon  the  land  for 
which  the  water  forming  the  seepage  was  originally  appro-
priated."  Id.,

prior  appropriator  can  at  anytime  .  .  .  instal[l]  a  sprinkler system, thereby eliminating all waste of water").  And a na-

tional hornbook on water law has observed: 

"The  rule  allowing  recapture  and  reuse  of  salvaged water  on  the  original  land  can  result  in  more  water 

being  consumed.  For  instance,  if  a  water  user  is  con-suming  less  than  the  permitted  amount  of  water  and 
plants  a  more  water-intensive  crop  or  puts  in  a  more efficient  irrigation system, most  or all of the water  that 
had  previously  been  returned  to  the  stream  might  be consumed.  This  can  deprive  other  appropriators  of 
water  on which they  depend but it  is  allowed since  it is technically  within  the  terms  of  the  original  appropria-
tion."  Getches 143-144. 
Montana  has  not  identified  any  scholars  who  have  reached the opposite conclusion. 

For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of appro-priation  in  Wyoming  and  Montana  allows  appropriators  to 
improve  their  irrigation  systems,  even  to  the  detriment  of downstream  appropriators.  We  readily  acknowledge  that 
this  area  of  law  is  far  from  clear.  See  supra,

(1945).  It  makes  sense  that  the  Compact  would  have  been written to protect the irrigation uses that were legislatively 
favored and represented the predominant use of the Yellow-stone  River  system.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  45-47;  65  Stat. 
663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the Compact recognizes 
"the  great  importance  of  water  for  irrigation  in  the  signa-tory States"). 

Montana's  reading  of  the  Compact,  by  contrast,  does  not follow from the text and would drastically redefine the term 
"beneficial use" from its longstanding meaning.  The amount 
of  water  put  to  "beneficial  use"  has  never  been  defined  by 
net water consumption.  The quantity of water "beneficially 
used"  in  irrigation,  for  example,  has  always  included  some 
measure  of  necessary  loss  such  as  runoff,  evaporation,  deep 
percolation, leakage, and seepage (regardless of whether any 
of  it  returns  to  the  stream).  So,  water  put  to  "[b]eneficial 
use  is  not  what  is  actually  consumed  but  what  is  actually 
necessary in good faith."  1 Wiel $ 481, at 509; see also Trel-
ease,  The  Concept  of  Reasonable  Beneficial  Use  in  the  Law 
of Surface Streams, 12 Wyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing  irriga-
tion as a beneficial use and noting that "the method of appli-
cation, by flooding, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial");

of Water Resources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irri-
gation practices and observing that the amount of water put 
to  beneficial  use  "is  often  considerably  more  than  the  quan-
tum actually consumed"). 

If  the  Compact's  definition  of  "beneficial use"  were meant 
to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for net water 
consumption,  we  would  expect  far  more  clarity.  For  exam-
ple,  the  Compact  could  have  stated  that  it  would  protect 
"only  `the  amount  of  water  consumed

that fiduciary.  Pp. 438-442. 

2.  Because $ 502(a)(3) authorizes "appropriate equitable relief" for vi-
olations  of  ERISA,  the  relevant  standard  of  harm  will  depend  on  the 
equitable  theory  by  which  the  District  Court  provides  relief.  That 
court is to  conduct the analysis in the first  instance, but there are sev-
eral  equitable  principles  that  it  might  apply  on  remand.  Neither 
ERISA's relevant substantive provisions nor $ 502(a)(3) sets a particular 
standard  for  determining  harm.  And  equity  law  provides  no  general 
principle that "detrimental reliance" must be proved before a remedy is 
decreed.  To  the extent  any  such  requirement  arises,  it  is  because  the 
specific  remedy  being  contemplated  imposes  that  requirement.  Thus, 
when  a  court  exercises  authority  under  $ 502(a)(3)  to  impose  a  remedy 
equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made. 
However, equity courts did not insist on a detrimental reliance showing 
where they ordered reformation where a fraudulent suppression, omis-
sion,  or insertion materially affected the substance  of a  contract.  Nor 
did they require a detrimental reliance showing when they ordered sur-
charge.  They simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole follow-
ing  a  trustee's  breach  of  trust.  This  flexible  approach  belies  a  strict 
detrimental  reliance  requirement.  To  be  sure,  a  fiduciary  can  be  sur-
charged under $ 502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm, and such 
harm may consist of detrimental reliance.  But it might also come from 
the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents.  It 
is  not  difficult  to  imagine  how  the  failure  to  provide  proper  summary 
information here, in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they 
did  not  themselves  act  in  reliance  on  the  summaries.  Thus,  to  obtain 
relief  by  surcharge  for  violations  of  $$ 102(a)  and  104(b),  a  plan  par-
ticipant  or  beneficiary  must  show  that  the  violation  caused  injury,  but 
need  show  only  actual  harm  and  causation,  not  detrimental  reliance.

The  District  Court  agreed  that  the  disclosures  made  by CIGNA  violated  its  obligations  under  ERISA.  In  deter-
mining  relief,  the  court  found  that  CIGNA's  notice  failures had  caused  the  employees  "likely  harm."  The  court  then 
reformed  the  new  plan  and  ordered  CIGNA  to  pay  benefits accordingly.  It found legal authority for doing so in ERISA 

$ 502(a)(1)(B),  29  U. S. C.  $ 1132(a)(1)(B)  (authorizing  a  plan "participant  or  beneficiary"  to  bring  a  "civil  action"  to  "re-
cover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan"). We  agreed  to  decide  whether  the  District  Court  applied 
the correct legal standard, namely, a "likely harm" standard, in determining that CIGNA's notice violations caused its em-
ployees  sufficient  injury  to  warrant  legal  relief.  To  reach that  question,  we  must  first  consider  a  more  general  matter--whether  the  ERISA  section  just  mentioned  (ERISA's recovery-of-benefits-due  provision,  $ 502(a)(1)(B))  authorizes 
entry of the relief the District Court provided.  We conclude that  it  does  not  authorize  this  relief.  Nonetheless,  we  find 
that  a  different  equity-related  ERISA  provision,  to  which the  District  Court  also  referred,  authorizes  forms  of  re-
lief  similar  to  those  that  the  court  entered.  $ 502(a)(3),  29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3). 

Section  502(a)(3)  authorizes  "appropriate  equitable  relief " for violations of ERISA.  Accordingly, the relevant standard 
of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by which the 
District  Court  provides  relief.  We  leave  it  to  the  District 
Court  to  conduct  that  analysis  in  the  first  instance,  but  we identify  equitable  principles  that  the  court  might  apply  on 

remand.  I 

Because our decision rests in important part upon the cir-
cumstances  present  here,  we  shall  describe  those  circum-
stances  in  some  detail.  We  still  simplify  in  doing  so.  But

would  contribute  to  the  employee's  individual  account  an amount  equal  to  between  3  percent  and  8.5  percent  of  the 

employee's  salary,  depending  upon  age,  length  of  service, and  certain  other  factors.  The  account  balance  would  earn 
compound  interest  at  a  rate  equal  to  the  return  on  5-year treasury  bills  plus  one-quarter  percent  (but  no  less  than  4.5 
percent  and  no  greater  than  9  percent).  Upon  retirement 
the  employee  would  receive  the  amount  then  in  his  or  her individual  account--in  the  form  of  either  a  lump  sum  or 

whatever  annuity  the  lump sum  then  would buy.  As prom-ised,  CIGNA  would  open  the  accounts  and  begin  to  make 
contributions as of January 1, 1998. 

But  what  about  the  retirement  benefits  that  employees 
had already earned prior to January 1, 1998?  CIGNA prom-
ised  to  make  an  initial  contribution  to  the  individual's  ac-
count  equal  to  the  value  of  that  employee's  already-earned 
benefits.  And the new plan set forth a method for calculat-
ing that initial contribution.  The method consisted of calcu-
lating  the  amount  as  of  the  employee's  (future)  retirement 
date of the annuity to which the employee's salary and length

have  contributed  (leaving  aside  the  life-insurance  problem) would have provided enough money to buy (in 2031) an annu-
ity  that  assured  the  employee  an  annual  payment  of  only about $8,000 (rather than $11,667). 

We  recognize  that  the  employee  in  our  example  (like  oth-
ers) might have continued to work for CIGNA after January 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have earned a pen-

sion that, by the time of his retirement, was worth far more than $11,667.  But that is so because CIGNA made an

433  F.  3d  254,  263  (2006));  see  29  U. S. C.  $ 1054(h)(6)  (2006 ed.)  (entitling  participants  to  benefits  "without  regard  to 

[the]  amendment"  in  case  of  an  "egregious  failure").  But the  court  also  thought  that  granting  this  relief  here  would 
harm,  not  help,  the  injured  employees.  That  is  because the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took effect 
in  December  1998.  The  court  thought  that  the  notices  in 
respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits, effective Decem-ber 31, 1997, were valid.  To strike the new plan while leav-

ing  in  effect  the  frozen  old  plan  would  not  help  CIGNA's employees. 

The  court  considered  treating  the  November  1997  notice 
as  a  sham  or  treating  that  notice  and  the  later  1998  notices 
as  part  and  parcel  of  a  single  set  of  related  events.  But  it 
pointed  out  that  respondents  "ha[d]  argued  none  of  these 
things."  559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208.  And it said that the court 
would "not make these arguments now on [respondents'] be-
half."  Ibid.

cross-petitions  for  writs  of  certiorari  in  this  Court.  We granted the request in CIGNA's petition to consider whether 
a showing of "likely harm" is sufficient to entitle plan partici-pants to recover benefits based on faulty disclosures.

CIGNA  in  the  merits  briefing  raises  a  preliminary  ques-tion.  Brief  for  Petitioners  13-20.  It  argues  first  and  fore-

most  that  the  statutory  provision  upon  which  the  District Court  rested  its  orders,  namely,  the  provision  for  recovery 
of plan benefits, $ 502(a)(1)(B), does  not  in  fact authorize the District  Court  to  enter  the  kind  of  relief  it  entered  here. 
And  for  that  reason,  CIGNA  argues,  whether  the  District Court  did  or  did  not  use  a  proper  standard  for  determining 
harm  is  beside  the  point.  We  believe  that  this  preliminary question is  closely enough related  to the  question presented 
that we shall consider it at the outset. 

A 
The District Court ordered relief in two steps.  Step 1: It ordered  the  terms  of  the  plan  reformed  (so  that  they  pro-

vided an "A plus B," rather than a "greater of A or B" guar-antee).  Step  2:  It  ordered  the  plan  administrator  (which  it 
found  to  be  CIGNA)  to  enforce  the  plan  as  reformed.  One can  fairly  describe  step  2  as  consistent  with  $ 502(a)(1)(B), 
for  that  provision  grants  a  participant  the  right  to  bring  a civil  action  to  "recover  benefits  due  .  .  .  under  the  terms 
of  his  plan."  29  U. S. C.  $ 1132(a)(1)(B).  And  step  2  orders recovery of the benefits provided by the "terms of [the] plan"

ing  whether  members  of  the  relevant  employee  class  were injured. 

The  relevant  substantive  provisions  of  ERISA  do  not  set forth  any  particular  standard  for  determining  harm.  They 
simply require the plan administrator to write and to distrib-ute  written  notices  that  are  "sufficiently  accurate  and  com-
prehensive to reasonably apprise" plan participants and ben-
eficiaries  of  "their  rights  and  obligations  under  the  plan." $ 102(a); see also $$ 104(b), 204(h).  Nor can we find a definite 

standard  in  the  ERISA  provision,  $ 502(a)(3)  (which  author-izes  the  court  to  enter  "appropriate  equitable  relief "  to  re-
dress ERISA "violations").  Hence any requirement of harm 
must come from the law of equity. 

Looking to the law of equity, there is no general principle 
that "detrimental reliance" must be proved before a remedy 
is decreed.  To the extent any such requirement arises, it is 
because  the  specific  remedy  being  contemplated  imposes 
such  a  requirement.  Thus,  as  CIGNA  points  out,  when  eq-
uity  courts  used  the  remedy  of  estoppel,

exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when the exi-
gency  was  "created"  or  "manufactured"  by  the  conduct  of  the  police. 
The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for determining 
when police impermissibly create an exigency.  Pp. 461-462. 

(c)  The proper test follows from the principle that permits warrantless searches: Warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances 
make  it  reasonable,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  to 
dispense  with  the  warrant  requirement.  Thus,  a  warrantless  entry 
based  on  exigent  circumstances  is  reasonable  when  the  police  did  not 
create  the  exigency  by  engaging  or  threatening  to  engage  in  conduct 
violating  the  Fourth Amendment.  A  similar  approach  has been  taken 
in  other  cases  involving  warrantless  searches.  For  example,  officers 
may  seize  evidence  in  plain  view  if  they  have  not  violated  the  Fourth 
Amendment  in  arriving  at  the  spot  from  which  the  observation  of  the 
evidence is made, see Horton

cocaine in plain view.  In a subsequent search, they also dis-covered crack cocaine, cash, and drug paraphernalia. 

Police eventually entered the apartment on the right.  In-side, they  found  the suspected  drug dealer who  was  the  ini-
tial target of their investigation. 

B 
In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury charged respondent  with  trafficking  in  marijuana,  first-degree  traf-

ficking  in  a controlled  substance, and second-degree  persist-ent  felony  offender  status.  Respondent  filed  a  motion  to 
suppress  the  evidence  from  the  warrantless  search,  but  the Circuit  Court  denied  the  motion.  The  Circuit  Court  con-
cluded that the officers had probable cause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the officers "properly conducted [the 
investigation] by  initially knocking on the  door of the  apart-ment  unit  and  awaiting  the  response  or  consensual  entry." 
App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  9a.  Exigent  circumstances  justified the warrantless entry, the court held, because "there was no 
response  at  all  to  the  knocking,"  and  because  "Officer  Cobb heard movement in the apartment which he reasonably con-
cluded were persons in the act of destroying evidence, partic-ularly  narcotics  because  of  the  smell."  Ibid.

The Fourth Amendment provides: 

"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers,  and  effects,  against  unreasonable 

searches  and  seizures,  shall  not  be  violated,  and  no Warrants  shall  issue,  but  upon  probable  cause,  sup-
ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describ-ing  the  place  to  be  searched,  and  the  persons  or  things 
to be seized." 
The  text  of  the  Amendment  thus  expressly  imposes  two requirements.  First, all searches and seizures must be rea-

sonable.  Second, a warrant may not be issued unless proba-ble cause is properly established and the scope of the author-
ized search is set out with particularity.  See Payton

For  these  reasons,  we  conclude  that  the  exigent  circum-stances  rule  applies  when  the  police  do  not  gain  entry  to 

premises  by  means  of  an  actual  or  threatened  violation of  the  Fourth  Amendment.  This  holding  provides  ample 
protection for the privacy rights that the Amendment protects. 

When  law  enforcement  officers  who  are  not  armed  with  a warrant  knock  on  a  door,  they  do  no  more  than  any  private 
citizen  might  do.  And  whether  the  person  who  knocks  on the  door  and  requests  the  opportunity  to  speak  is  a  police

the constitutional violation and must have given the defendant a reason-
able  time  to  comply  with  its  prior  orders.  $ 3626(a)(3)(A).  Once  con-
vened, the three-judge court must find by clear and convincing evidence 
that "crowding is the primary cause of the violation" and "no other relief

(b)  The Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably in convening a 
three-judge court.  Pp. 513-516. 

(1)  The merits of the decision to convene are properly before this 
Court,  which  has  exercised  its  28  U. S. C.  $ 1253  jurisdiction  to  deter-
mine  the  authority  of  a  court  below,  including  whether  a  three-judge 
court  was  properly  constituted.  Gonzalez  v.  Automatic  Employees 
Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12.  Pp. 513-514. 

(2)  Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)'s previous order requirement was sat-
isfied in Coleman by the Special Master's 1995 appointment and in Plata 
by  the  2002  approval  of  a  consent  decree  and  stipulated  injunction. 
Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional violations and were 
given  ample  time  to  succeed--12  years  in  Coleman,  and  5  years  in 
Plata.  Contrary  to  the  State's  claim,  $ 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)'s  reasonable 
time requirement did not require the District Courts to give more time 
for  subsequent  remedial  efforts  to  succeed.  Such  a  reading  would  in 
effect  require  courts  to  impose  a  moratorium  on  new  remedial  orders 
before issuing a population limit, which would delay an eventual remedy, 
prolong  the  courts'  involvement,  and  serve  neither  the  State  nor  the 
prisoners.  The  Coleman  and  Plata  courts  had  a  solid  basis  to  doubt 
that  additional  efforts  to  build  new  facilities  and  hire  new  staff  would 
achieve  a  remedy,  given  the  ongoing  deficiencies  recently  reported  by 
both the Special Master and the Receiver.  Pp. 514-516. 

(c)  The three-judge court did not err in finding that "crowding [was] 
the primary cause of the violation," $ 3626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Pp. 517-526. 

(1)  The  trial  record  documents  the  severe  impact  of  burgeoning 
demand on the provision of care.  The evidence showed that there were 
high  vacancy  rates  for  medical  and  mental  health  staff,  e. g.,  20%  for 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 493 (2011)  495 

Syllabus 
surgeons  and  54.1%  for  psychiatrists;  that  these  numbers  understated 
the severity  of the crisis because  the State has  not budgeted sufficient 
staff  to meet  demand;  and that  even  if vacant  positions  could  be  filled, 
there would be insufficient space for the additional staff.  Such a short-
fall  contributes  to  significant  delays  in  treating  mentally  ill  prisoners, 
who  are  housed  in  administrative  segregation  for  extended  periods 
while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds.  There 
are  also  backlogs  of  up  to  700  prisoners  waiting  to  see  a  doctor  for 
physical care.  Crowding creates unsafe and unsanitary conditions that 
hamper  effective  delivery  of  medical  and  mental  health  care.  It  also 
promotes unrest and violence and can cause prisoners with latent men-
tal  illnesses  to  worsen  and  develop  overt  symptoms.  Increased  vio-
lence requires increased reliance on lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns  further  impede  the  effective  delivery  of  care.  Overcrowding's 
effects are particularly acute in prison reception centers, which process 
140,000 new or returning prisoners annually, and which house some pris-
oners for their entire incarceration period.  Numerous experts testified 
that  crowding  is  the  primary  cause  of  the  constitutional  violations. 
Pp. 517-522. 

(2)  Contrary to the State's claim, the three-judge court properly 
admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison conditions as 
relevant  to  the  issues  before  it.  Expert  witnesses  based  their  conclu-
sions  on  recent  observations  of  prison  conditions;  the  court  admitted 
recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Special Master; 
and  both  parties  presented  testimony  related  to  current  conditions. 
The  court's  orders  cutting  off  discovery  a  few  months  before  trial  and 
excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a population limit 
is appropriate under the PLRA were within the court's sound discretion. 
Orderly trial management may require discovery deadlines and a clean 
distinction between litigation of the merits and the remedy.  The State 
points to no significant evidence that it was unable to present and that 
would have changed the outcome here.  Pp. 522-524. 

(3)  It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that 
overcrowding  was  the  "primary,"  but  not  the  only,  cause  of  the  viola-
tions, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the violations. 
This understanding of the primary cause requirement is consistent with 
the  PLRA.  Had  Congress  intended  to  require  that  crowding  be  the 
only cause, the PLRA would have said so.  Pp. 524-526. 

(d)  The  evidence  supports  the  three-judge  court's  finding  that  "no 
other  relief  [would]  remedy  the  violation,"  $ 3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).  The 
State's claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alter-
native  to  a  population  limit  must  fail  because  requiring  transfers  is  a 
population limit under the PLRA.  Even if they could be regarded as a 

496  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Syllabus 
less  restrictive  alternative,  the  three-judge  court  found  no  evidence  of 
plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve overcrowding.  The 
court also found no realistic possibility that California could build itself 
out of this crisis, particularly given the State's ongoing fiscal problems. 
Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realistic alternative, since the 
prison system was chronically understaffed and would have insufficient 
space  were  adequate  personnel  retained.  The  court  also  did  not  err 
when  it  concluded  that,  absent  a  population  reduction,  the  Receiver's 
and  Special  Master's  continued  efforts  would  not  achieve  a  remedy. 
Their reports are persuasive evidence that, with no reduction, any rem-
edy might prove  unattainable and would at the very  least require vast 
expenditures  by  the  State.  The  State  asserts  that  these  measures 
would succeed if combined, but a long history of failed remedial orders, 
together  with  substantial  evidence  of  overcrowding's  deleterious  ef-
fects  on  the  provision  of  care,  compels  a  different  conclusion  here. 
Pp. 526-530. 

(e)  The  prospective  relief  ordered  here  was  narrowly  drawn,  ex-
tended  no  further than  necessary  to  correct  the violation,  and  was  the 
least  intrusive  means necessary  to  correct  the violation.  Pp.  530-538. 

(1)  The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply be-
cause  prisoners  beyond  the  plaintiff  class  will  have  to  be  released 
through  parole  or  sentencing  reform  in  order  to  meet  the  required  re-
duction.  While narrow tailoring requires a " ` "fit" between the [reme-
dy's]  ends  and  the  means  chosen  to  accomplish  those  ends,' "  Board  of 
Trustees  of  State  Univ.  of  N.  Y.  v.  Fox,  492  U. S.  469,  480,  a  narrow 
and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not invalid 
simply  because it will have collateral effects.  Nor  does the PLRA re-
quire  that  result.  The  order  gives  the  State  flexibility  to  determine 
who should be released, and the State could move the three-judge court 
to modify its terms.  The order also is not overbroad because it encom-
passes  the  entire  prison  system,  rather  than  separately  assessing  each 
institution's  need  for  a  population  limit.  The  Coleman  court  found  a 
systemwide  violation,  and  the  State  stipulated  to  systemwide  relief  in 
Plata.  Assuming  no  constitutional  violation  results,  some  facilities 
may retain populations in excess of the 137.5% limit provided others fall 
sufficiently  below  it  so  the  system  as  a  whole  remains  in  compliance 
with  the  order.  This  will  afford  the  State  flexibility  to  accommodate 
differences  between  institutions.  The  order  may  shape  or  control  the 
State's  authority  in  the  realm  of  prison  administration,  but  it  leaves 
much  to  the  State's  discretion.  The order's  limited  scope  is  necessary 
to  remedy  a  constitutional  violation.  The  State  may  move  the  threejudge court to modify its order, but it has proposed no realistic alterna-
tive remedy at this time.  Pp. 530-534.

(2)  The three-judge court gave "substantial weight" to any poten-
tial  adverse  impact  on  public  safety  from  its  order.  The  PLRA's 
"substantial  weight"  requirement  does  not  require  the  court  to  certify 
that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public.  Here, sta-
tistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered with-
out adversely affecting public safety in some California counties, several 
States, and Canada.  The court found that various available methods of 
reducing  overcrowding--good-time  credits  and  diverting  low-risk  of-
fenders to community programs--would have little or no impact on pub-
lic  safety,  and  its  order  took  account  of  such  concerns  by  giving  the 
State substantial flexibility to select among the means of reducing over-
crowding.  The  State  complains  that  the  court  approved  the  State's 
population-reduction plan without considering whether its specific meas-
ures  would  substantially  threaten  public  safety.  But  the  court  left 
state  officials  the  choice  of  how  best  to  comply  and  was  not  required 
to second-guess their exercise of discretion.  Developments during the 
pendency of this appeal, when the State has begun to reduce the prison 
population, support the conclusion that a reduction can be accomplished 
without an undue negative effect on public safety.  Pp. 534-538. 

2.  The  three-judge  court's  order,  subject  to  the  State's  right  to 
seek  its  modification  in  appropriate  circumstances,  must  be  affirmed. 
Pp. 538-545. 

(a)  To  comply with the PLRA,  a  court must  set a  population  limit 
at  the  highest  level  consistent  with  an  efficacious  remedy,  and  it  must 
order the population reduction to be achieved  in the shortest period of 
time reasonably consistent with public safety.  Pp. 538-539. 

(b)  The  three-judge  court's  conclusion  that  the  prison  population 
should be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly erroneous. 
The  court  concluded  that  the  evidence  supported  a  limit  between  the 
130%  limit  supported  by  expert  testimony  and  the  Federal  Bureau  of 
Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State Corrections Inde-
pendent  Review  Panel.  The  PLRA's  narrow  tailoring  requirement  is 
satisfied  so  long  as  such  equitable,  remedial  judgments  are  made  with 
the objective of releasing  the fewest possible prisoners consistent  with 
an efficacious remedy.  Pp. 539-541. 

(c)  The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year deadline 
for relief, especially in light of the State's failure to contest the issue at 
trial.  The  State  has  not  asked  this  Court  to  extend  the  deadline,  but 
the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility, to amend its 
order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.  Proper respect 
for  the  State  and  for  its  governmental  processes  require  that  court  to 
exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find 
mechanisms  and  make  plans  that  will  promptly  and  effectively  correct

the violations consistent with public safety.  The court may, e. g., grant 
a motion to extend the deadline if the State meets appropriate precondi-
tions  designed  to  ensure  that  the  plan  will  be  implemented  without 
undue delay.  Such observations reflect the fact that the existing order, 
like all ongoing equitable relief, must remain open to appropriate modi-
fication, and are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the order's 
basic premise.  Pp. 541-545.

ment.  The violations are the subject of two class actions in two Federal District Courts.  The first involves the class of 

prisoners with serious mental disorders.  That case is Cole-
man v.  Brown.  The second involves prisoners with serious 
medical  conditions.  That  case  is  Plata  v.  Brown.  The order of the  three-judge District  Court is  applicable to both 

cases. 

After years of litigation, it became apparent that a remedy for the constitutional violations would not be effective absent 

a reduction in the prison system population.  The authority to order release of prisoners as a remedy to cure a systemic 
violation of the Eighth Amendment is a power reserved to a 
three-judge  district  court,  not  a  single-judge  district  court. 
18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a).  In accordance with that rule, the Cole-
man and Plata District Judges independently requested that 
a  three-judge  court  be  convened.  The  Chief  Judge  of  the 
Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  convened  a  threejudge  court  composed  of  the  Coleman  and  Plata  District 
Judges  and  a  third,  Ninth  Circuit  Judge.  Because  the  two 
cases  are  interrelated,  their  limited  consolidation  for  this 
purpose  has  a  certain  utility  in  avoiding  conflicting  decrees 
and  aiding  judicial  consideration  and  enforcement.  The 
State  in  this  Court  has  not  objected  to  consolidation,  al-
though the  State  does  argue  that  the  three-judge  court was 
prematurely  convened.  The  State  also  objects  to  the  sub-
stance  of  the  three-judge  court  order,  which  requires  the 
State to reduce overcrowding in its prisons. 

The  appeal  presents  the  question  whether  the  remedial 
order  issued  by  the  three-judge  court  is  consistent  with 
requirements  and  procedures  set  forth  in  a  congressional 
statute,  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  (PLRA). 
18 U. S. C. $ 3626; see Appendix A, infra.  The order leaves 
the  choice  of  means  to  reduce  overcrowding  to  the  discre-
tion  of  state  officials.  But  absent  compliance  through  new 
construction, out-of-state transfers, or other means--or mod-
ification of the order upon a further showing by the State--

Opinion of the Court 
the State will be required to release some number of prison-ers  before  their  full  sentences  have  been  served.  High 

recidivism  rates  must  serve  as  a  warning  that  mistaken  or premature release of even one prisoner can cause injury and 
harm.  The release of prisoners in large numbers--assuming the  State  finds  no other way  to comply  with  the  order--is a 
matter of undoubted, grave concern. 

At the time of trial, California's correctional facilities held some  156,000  persons.  This  is  nearly  double  the  number 

that California's  prisons were designed  to  hold, and  Califor-nia  has  been  ordered  to  reduce  its  prison  population  to 
137.5%  of  design  capacity.  By  the  three-judge  court's  own 
estimate, the required population reduction could be as high 
as 46,000 persons.  Although the State has reduced the pop-
ulation by at least 9,000 persons during the pendency of this 
appeal,  this  means  a  further  reduction  of  37,000  persons 
could be required.  As will be noted, the reduction need not 
be  accomplished  in  an  indiscriminate  manner  or  in  these 
substantial  numbers  if  satisfactory,  alternative  remedies  or 
means  for  compliance  are  devised.  The  State  may  employ 
measures,  including  good-time  credits  and  diversion  of  lowrisk  offenders  and  technical  parole  violators  to  communitybased programs, that  will mitigate the order's  impact.  The 
population  reduction  potentially  required  is  nevertheless  of 
unprecedented sweep and extent. 

Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting from 
these serious constitutional violations.  For years the medi-
cal  and  mental  health  care  provided  by  California's  prisons 
has fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and 
has  failed  to  meet  prisoners'  basic  health  needs.  Needless 
suffering  and  death  have  been  the  well-documented  result. 
Over  the  whole  course  of  years  during  which  this  litigation 
has  been  pending,  no  other  remedies  have  been  found  to 
be  sufficient.  Efforts  to  remedy  the  violation  have  been 
frustrated  by  severe  overcrowding  in  California's  prison 
system.  Short-term gains in the provision of care have been 

502  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
eroded  by  the  long-term  effects  of  severe  and  pervasive overcrowding. 

Overcrowding  has  overtaken  the  limited  resources  of prison  staff;  imposed  demands  well  beyond  the  capacity  of 
medical  and  mental  health  facilities;  and  created  unsanitary and unsafe conditions that make progress in the provision of 
care difficult or impossible to achieve.  The overcrowding is the  "primary  cause  of  the  violation  of  a  Federal  right,"  18 
U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically the severe and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners through grossly inadequate provi-
sion of medical and mental health care. This  Court  now  holds  that  the  PLRA  does  authorize  the 
relief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated popu-lation limit is necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' 
constitutional  rights.  The  order  of  the  three-judge  court, subject  to  the  right  of  the  State  to  seek  its  modification  in 
appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed. 

I 
A 

The  degree  of  overcrowding  in  California's  prisons  is  ex-ceptional.  California's prisons are designed to house a pop-

ulation  just under  80,000, but at the  time  of the  three-judge court's decision the population was almost double that.  The 
State's prisons had operated at around 200% of design capac-ity for at least 11 years.  Prisoners are crammed into spaces 
neither  designed  nor  intended  to  house  inmates.  As  many as  200  prisoners  may  live  in  a  gymnasium,  monitored  by  as 
few  as  two  or  three  correctional  officers.  App.  1337-1338, 1350; see Appendix B, 

infra.  As many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.  App. 1337. 

The  Corrections  Independent  Review  Panel,  a  body  ap-pointed  by  the  Governor  and  composed  of  correctional  con-
sultants  and  representatives  from  state  agencies,  concluded that California's prisons are " `severely  overcrowded, imper-
iling  the  safety  of  both  correctional  employees  and  in-

mates.' " 1  App. to Juris. Statement, O. T. 2009, No. 09-416, 
p.  56a  (hereinafter  Juris.  App.).  In  2006,  then-Governor 
Schwarzenegger  declared  a  state  of  emergency  in  the  pris-
ons, as " `immediate action is necessary to prevent death and 
harm  caused  by  California's  severe  prison  overcrowding.' " 
Id., at 61a.  The consequences of overcrowding identified by 
the  Governor include " `increased, substantial risk for  trans-
mission  of  infectious  illness' "  and a  suicide  rate  " `approach-
ing an average of one per week.' "  Ibid. 

Prisoners  in  California  with  serious  mental  illness  do  not 
receive  minimal,  adequate  care.  Because  of  a  shortage  of 
treatment  beds,  suicidal  inmates  may  be  held  for  prolonged 
periods  in  telephone-booth-sized  cages  without  toilets.  See 

1 A similar conclusion was reached by the Little  Hoover Commission,  a 
bipartisan  and  independent  state  body,  which  stated  that  "[o]vercrowded 
conditions inside the prison walls are unsafe for inmates and staff," Solv-
ing  California's  Corrections  Crisis:  Time  Is  Running  Out  17  (Jan.  2007), 
and that "California's correctional system Is in a tailspin," id., at i. 

At  trial,  current  and  former  California  prison  officials  also  testified  to 
the  degree  of  overcrowding.  Jeanne  Woodford,  who  recently  adminis-
tered California's prison system, stated that " `[o]vercrowding in the [Cali-
fornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)] is extreme, 
its effects are pervasive and it is preventing the Department from provid-
ing adequate mental and  medical health care to prisoners.' "  Juris.  App. 
84a.  Matthew Cate, the head of the California prison system, stated that 
" `overpopulation  makes  everything  we  do  more  difficult.' "  Ibid.  And 
Robin Dezember, chief deputy secretary of Correctional Healthcare Serv-
ices, stated that "we are terribly overcrowded in  our prison system" and 
"overcrowding  has  negative  effects  on  everybody  in  the  prison  system." 
Tr. 853, 856. 

Experts  from  outside  California  offered  similar  assessments.  Doyle 
Wayne  Scott,  the  former  head  of  corrections  in  Texas,  described  con-
ditions in  California's prisons  as "appalling,"  "inhumane,"  and "unaccept-
able" and stated that "[i]n more than 35 years of prison work experience, 
I  have  never  seen  anything  like  it."  App.  1337.  Joseph  Lehman,  the 
former head of correctional systems in Washington, Maine, and Pennsylva-
nia,  concluded  that  "[t]here  is  no  question  that  California's  prisons  are 
overcrowded" and that "this is an emergency situation; it calls for drastic 
and immediate action."  Id., at 1312.

Appendix  C,  infra.  A  psychiatric  expert  reported  observ-
ing  an  inmate  who  had  been  held  in  such  a  cage  for  nearly 
24  hours,  standing  in  a  pool  of  his  own  urine,  unresponsive 
and  nearly  catatonic.  Prison  officials  explained  they  had 
" `no place to put him.' "  App. 593.  Other inmates awaiting 
care  may  be  held  for  months  in  administrative  segregation, 
where they endure harsh and isolated conditions and receive 
only  limited  mental  health  services.  Wait  times  for  mental 
health  care  range  as  high  as  12  months.  Id.,  at  704.  In 
2006, the suicide rate in California's prisons was nearly 80% 
higher than the national average for prison populations; and 
a court-appointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides 
involved  "some  measure  of  inadequate  assessment,  treat-
ment,  or  intervention,  and  were  therefore  most  probably 
foreseeable and/or preventable." 2  Id., at 1781. 

Prisoners  suffering  from  physical  illness  also  receive  se-
verely  deficient care.  California's  prisons  were designed  to 
meet  the  medical  needs  of  a  population  at  100%  of  design 
capacity  and  so  have  only  half  the  clinical  space  needed  to 
treat  the  current  population.  Id.,  at  1024.  A  correctional 
officer testified that, in one prison, up to 50 sick inmates may 
be held together in a 12- by 20-foot cage for up to five hours 
awaiting  treatment.  Tr.  597-599.  The  number  of  staff  is 

2 At the time of  the three-judge court's decision, 2006  was the most  re-
cent year for which the Special Master had conducted a detailed study of 
suicides  in  the  California  prisons.  The  Special  Master  later  issued  an 
analysis  for  the  year  2007.  This  report  concluded  that  the  2007  suicide 
rate was "a continuation of the CDCR's pattern of exceeding the national 
prison suicide rate."  Record in No. 2:90-cv-00520-LKK-JFM (ED Cal.), 
Doc. 3677, p. 1.  The report found that the rate of suicides involving inade-
quate  assessment,  treatment,  or  intervention  had  risen  to  82%  and  con-
cluded that "[t]hese numbers clearly indicate no improvement in this area 
during  the  past  several  years,  and  possibly  signal  a  trend  of  ongoing  de-
terioration."  Id.,  at  12.  No  detailed  study  has  been  filed  since  then, 
but in September 2010 the Special Master filed a report stating that "the 
data  for  2010  so  far  is  not  showing  improvement  in  suicide  prevention."

care  were  "widespread,"  Tr.  430,  and  that  the  proportion of  "possibly  preventable  or  preventable"  deaths  was  "ex-
tremely high," id.,  at 429.4  Many  more prisoners,  suffering 

3 Because  plaintiffs  do  not  base  their  case  on  deficiencies  in  care  pro-
vided on any one occasion, this Court has no occasion to consider whether 
these instances of delay--or any other particular deficiency in medical care 
complained of by the plaintiffs--would violate the Constitution under Es-
telle  v.  Gamble,  429  U. S.  97,  104-105  (1976),  if  considered  in  isolation. 
Plaintiffs  rely on  systemwide deficiencies  in  the provision  of  medical  and 
mental  health  care  that,  taken  as  a  whole,  subject  sick  and  mentally  ill 
prisoners in California to "substantial risk of serious harm" and cause the 
delivery  of  care  in  the  prisons  to  fall  below  the  evolving  standards  of 
decency  that  mark  the  progress  of  a  maturing  society.  Farmer  v.  Bren-
nan, 511 U. S. 825, 834 (1994). 

4 In  2007,  the  last  year  for  which  the  three-judge  court  had  available 

statistics, an analysis of deaths in California's prisons found 68 preventable 
or possibly preventable deaths.  California Prison Health Care Receiver-
ship Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2007 Death Reviews 18 (Nov. 2008). 
This was essentially unchanged from 2006, when an analysis found 66 pre-
ventable  or  possibly  preventable  deaths.  Ibid.  These  statistics  mean 
that,  during  2006  and  2007,  a  preventable  or  possibly  preventable  death 
occurred once every five to six days. 

Both preventable and possibly preventable deaths involve major lapses 
in  medical care  and  are  a  serious  cause  for  concern.  In  one typical  case 
classified as a possibly preventable death, an analysis revealed the follow-
ing  lapses:  "16  month  delay  in  evaluating  abnormal  liver  mass;  8  month 
delay  in  receiving  regular  chemotherapy  .  .  .  ;  multiple  providers  fail  to

B 
These  conditions  are  the  subject  of  two  federal  cases. The first to commence, 

Coleman v.  Brown, was filed in 1990. Coleman involves  the  class  of seriously  mentally  ill  persons 

in  California  prisons.  Over  15  years  ago,  in  1995,  after  a 39-day trial, the Coleman  District Court found "overwhelm-
ing evidence of the systemic failure to deliver necessary care to  mentally  ill  inmates"  in  California  prisons.  Coleman  v. 
Wilson,  912  F.  Supp.  1282,  1316  (ED  Cal.).  The  prisons were  "seriously  and  chronically  understaffed," 

id.,  at  1306, and  had  "no  effective  method  for  ensuring  .  .  .  the  compe-

tence  of  their  staff,"  id.,  at  1308.  The  prisons  had  failed  to implement  necessary  suicide-prevention  procedures,  "due  in 
large  measure  to  the  severe  understaffing."  Id.,  at  1315. Mentally  ill  inmates  "languished  for  months,  or  even  years, 
without access to necessary care."  Id., at 1316.  "They suf-fer from severe hallucinations, [and] they decompensate into 
catatonic  states."  Ibid.  The  court  appointed  a  Special Master  to  oversee  development  and  implementation  of  a  re-

The  three-judge  court  did  not  have  access  to  statistics  for  2008,  but  in 
that year  the number  of preventable or  possibly preventable  deaths held 
steady at 66.  California Prison Health Care Receivership Corp., K. Imai,

of preventable or possibly preventable deaths dropped to 46.  2009 Death 
Reviews  11,  13.  The  three-judge  court  could  not  have  anticipated  this 
development, and it would be inappropriate for this Court to evaluate its 
significance for the first time on appeal.  The three-judge court should, of 
course, consider this and any other evidence of improved conditions when 
considering future requests by the State for modification of its order.  See

Opinion of the Court 
In 2007, 12 years after his appointment, the Special Master in  Coleman  filed  a  report  stating  that,  after  years  of  slow 

improvement,  the  state  of mental  health  care  in  California's prisons  was  deteriorating.  App.  489.  The  Special  Master 
ascribed this change to increased overcrowding.  The rise in population  had  led  to  greater  demand  for  care,  and  existing 
programming  space  and  staffing  levels  were  inadequate  to keep  pace.  Prisons  had  retained  more  mental  health  staff, 
but  the  "growth  of  the  resource  [had]  not  matched  the  rise in  demand." 

Id.,  at  482.  At  the  very  time  the  need  for space was rising, the need to house the expanding population 

had  also  caused  a  "reduction  of  programming  space  now  oc-cupied by inmate  bunks." 

Id., at  479.  The State  was "fac-ing  a  four  to  five-year  gap  in  the  availability  of  sufficient 

beds to meet the treatment needs of many inmates/patients." Id.,  at  481.  "[I]ncreasing  numbers  of  truly  psychotic  in-
mate/patients are trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot  meet  their  needs."  Ibid.  The  Special  Master  con-
cluded  that  many  early  "achievements  have  succumbed  to the  inexorably  rising  tide  of  population,  leaving  behind 
growing frustration and despair."  Id., at 489. 

C 
The  second  action,  Plata  v.  Brown,  involves  the  class  of state  prisoners  with  serious  medical  conditions.  After  this 

action  commenced  in  2001,  the  State  conceded  that  defi-ciencies  in  prison  medical  care  violated  prisoners'  Eighth 
Amendment  rights.  The  State  stipulated  to  a  remedial  in-junction.  The  State  failed  to  comply  with  that  injunction, 
and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee reme-dial  efforts.  The  court  found  that  "the  California  prison 
medical care system is broken beyond repair," resulting in an "unconscionable  degree  of  suffering  and  death."  App.  917. 
The court found: "[I]t is an uncontested fact that, on average, an inmate in one of California's prisons needlessly dies every 
six  to  seven  days  due  to  constitutional  deficiencies  in  the 

508  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
[California  prisons']  medical  delivery  system."  Ibid.  And the  court  made  findings  regarding  specific  instances  of  ne-

glect, including the following: 

"[A]  San  Quentin  prisoner  with  hypertension,  diabetes and  renal  failure  was  prescribed  two  different  medica-

tions that actually served to exacerbate his renal failure. An  optometrist  noted  the  patient's  retinal  bleeding  due 
to very high blood pressure and referred him for imme-diate  evaluation,  but  this  evaluation  never  took  place. 
It was not until a year later that the patient's renal fail-ure was recognized, at which point he was referred to a 
nephrologist  on  an  urgent  basis;  he  should  have  been seen  by  the  specialist  within  14  days  but  the  consulta-
tion  never  happened  and  the  patient  died  three  months later."  Id., at 928 (citations omitted). 

Prisons  were  unable  to  retain  sufficient  numbers  of  compe-tent  medical  staff,  id.,  at  937,  and  would  "hire  any  doctor 
who  had  `a  license,  a  pulse  and  a  pair  of  shoes,' "  id.,  at  926. Medical  facilities  lacked  "necessary  medical  equipment"  and 
did  "not  meet  basic  sanitation  standards."  Id.,  at  944. "Exam  tables  and  counter  tops,  where  prisoners  with . . .  
communicable diseases are  treated,  [were] not  routinely  dis-infected." 

Ibid. In 2008, three years after the District Court's decision, the 

Receiver described continuing deficiencies in the health care provided by California prisons: 

"Timely  access  is  not  assured.  The  number  of  medical personnel  has been  inadequate, and competence has  not 
been assured. . . . Adequate housing for the disabled and aged  does  not  exist.  The  medical  facilities,  when  they 
exist  at all,  are  in  an  abysmal  state of  disrepair.  Basic medical equipment is often not available or used.  Medi-
cations  and  other  treatment  options  are  too  often  not available  when  needed.  .  .  .  Indeed,  it  is  a  misnomer  to 
call the existing chaos a `medical delivery system'--it is

Opinion of the Court 
more  an  act  of  desperation  than  a  system."  Record  in No. 3:01-cv-01351-TEH (ND Cal.), Doc. 1136, p. 9. 

A  report by  the  Receiver detailed  the  impact of overcrowd-ing  on  efforts  to  remedy  the  violation.  The  Receiver  ex-
plained  that  "overcrowding,  combined  with  staffing  short-ages,  has  created  a  culture  of  cynicism,  fear,  and  despair 
which  makes  hiring  and  retaining  competent  clinicians  ex-tremely  difficult."  App.  1031.  "[O]vercrowding,  and  the 
resulting day to day operational chaos of the [prison system], creates  regular  `crisis'  situations  which  .  .  .  take  time  [and] 
energy . . .  away  from  important  remedial  programs."  Id., at 1035.  Overcrowding had increased the incidence of infec-
tious  disease,  id.,  at  1037-1038,  and  had  led  to  rising  prison 
violence and greater reliance by custodial staff on lockdowns, which  "inhibit  the  delivery  of  medical  care  and  increase  the 

staffing necessary for such care," id., at 1037.  "Every day," the  Receiver  reported,  "California  prison  wardens  and 
health care managers make the difficult decision as to which of  the  class  actions, 

Coleman  . .  . or  Plata  they  will  fail  to 
comply  with  because  of  staff  shortages  and  patient  loads." 
Id., at 1038. 

D 

The Coleman and Plata plaintiffs, believing that a remedy 
for unconstitutional medical and mental health care could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding, moved their re-

spective District Courts to convene  a  three-judge court em-powered  under  the  PLRA  to  order  reductions  in  the  prison 
population.  The judges in both actions granted the request, 
and  the  cases  were  consolidated  before  a  single  three-judge 
court.  The State has not challenged the validity of the con-
solidation  in  proceedings  before  this  Court,  so  its  propriety 
is not presented by this appeal. 

The  three-judge  court  heard  14  days  of  testimony  and  is-
sued  a  184-page  opinion,  making  extensive  findings  of  fact. 
The court ordered California to reduce its prison population 

510  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
to  137.5%  of  the  prisons'  design  capacity  within  two  years. Assuming  the  State  does  not  increase capacity  through new 

construction,  the  order  requires  a  population  reduction  of 38,000 to 46,000 persons.  Because it appears all but certain 
that  the  State  cannot  complete  sufficient  construction  to comply  fully with  the  order,  the  prison  population will  have 
to  be  reduced  to  at  least  some  extent.  The  court  did  not order  the  State  to  achieve  this  reduction  in  any  particular 
manner.  Instead,  the  court  ordered  the  State  to  formulate a  plan  for  compliance  and  submit  its  plan  for  approval  by 
the court. The  State  appealed  to  this  Court  pursuant  to  28  U. S. C. 

$ 1253, and the Court postponed consideration of the question of  jurisdiction  to  the  hearing  on  the  merits.  Schwarzeneg-
ger v.  Plata, 560 U. S. 964 (2010). 

II 
As  a  consequence  of  their  own  actions,  prisoners  may  be deprived  of rights  that  are  fundamental  to liberty.  Yet  the 

law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other rights.  Prisoners  retain  the  essence  of  human  dignity  in-
herent in all persons.  Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth  Amendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual 
punishment.  " `The  basic  concept  underlying  the  Eighth Amendment  is  nothing  less  than  the  dignity  of  man.' " 

At-
kins  v.  Virginia,  536  U. S.  304,  311  (2002)  (quoting  Trop  v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality opinion)). 

To  incarcerate,  society  takes  from  prisoners  the  means  to provide  for  their  own  needs.  Prisoners  are  dependent  on 
the  State  for  food,  clothing,  and  necessary  medical  care.  A prison's failure to provide sustenance for inmates "may actu-
ally  produce  physical  `torture  or  a  lingering  death.' "  Es-
telle v.  Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re Kemm-ler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A. Elsner, Gates 

of Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (2004).  Just as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she may suffer or die if

Opinion of the Court 
not provided adequate medical care.  A prison that deprives prisoners  of  basic  sustenance,  including  adequate  medical 

care,  is  incompatible  with  the  concept  of  human  dignity  and has no place in civilized society. 

If  government  fails  to  fulfill  this  obligation,  the  courts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amend-
ment violation.  See Hutto v.  Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 687, n. 9 
(1978).  Courts  must  be  sensitive  to  the  State's  interest  in punishment,  deterrence,  and  rehabilitation,  as  well  as  the 

need for deference to experienced and expert prison adminis-trators faced with the difficult and dangerous task of housing 
large  numbers  of  convicted  criminals.  See  Bell  v.  Wolfish, 
441 U. S. 520, 547-548 (1979).  Courts nevertheless must not 
shrink  from  their  obligation  to  "enforce  the  constitutional 
rights  of  all  `persons,'  including  prisoners."  Cruz  v.  Beto, 
405  U. S.  319,  321  (1972)  (per  curiam).  Courts  may  not 
allow  constitutional  violations  to  continue  simply  because  a 
remedy  would  involve  intrusion  into  the  realm  of  prison 
administration. 

Courts  faced  with  the  sensitive  task  of  remedying  uncon-
stitutional  prison  conditions  must  consider  a  range  of  avail-
able  options,  including  appointment  of  special  masters  or 
receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.  When nec-
essary  to  ensure  compliance  with  a  constitutional  mandate, 
courts  may  enter  orders  placing  limits  on  a  prison's  popula-
tion.  By  its  terms,  the  PLRA  restricts  the  circumstances 
in  which  a  court  may  enter  an  order  "that  has  the  pur-
pose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population." 
18 U. S. C. $ 3626(g)(4).  The order in this case does not nec-
essarily  require  the  State  to  release  any  prisoners.  The 
State  may  comply  by  raising  the  design  capacity  of  its  pris-
ons or by transferring prisoners to county facilities or facili-
ties  in  other  States.  Because  the  order  limits  the  prison 
population as a percentage of design capacity, it nonetheless 
has  the  "effect  of  reducing  or  limiting  the  prison  popula-
tion."  Ibid. 

512  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
Under  the  PLRA,  only  a  three-judge  court  may  enter  an order  limiting  a  prison  population.  $ 3626(a)(3)(B).  Before 

a  three-judge  court  may  be  convened,  a  district  court  first must  have  entered  an  order  for  less  intrusive  relief  that 
failed  to  remedy  the  constitutional  violation  and  must  have given  the  defendant  a  reasonable  time  to  comply  with  its 
prior orders.  $ 3626(a)(3)(A).  The party requesting a 
three-judge  court  must  then  submit  "materials  sufficient  to demonstrate  that  [these  requirements]  have  been  met." 

$ 3626(a)(3)(C).  If  the  district  court  concludes  that  the  ma-terials are, in fact, sufficient, a three-judge court may be con-
vened.  Ibid.; see also 28 U. S. C. $ 2284(b)(1) (stating that a 
three-judge  court  may  not  be  convened  if  the  district  court 
"determines  that  three  judges  are  not  required");  17A  C. 
Wright,  A.  Miller,  E.  Cooper,  &  V.  Amar,  Federal  Practice 
and Procedure $ 4235 (3d ed. 2007). 

The three-judge court must then find by clear and convinc-
ing  evidence  that  "crowding  is  the  primary  cause  of  the 
violation  of  a  Federal  right"  and  that  "no  other  relief  will 

remedy  the  violation  of  the  Federal  right."  18  U. S. C. 

$ 3626(a)(3)(E).  As  with  any  award  of  prospective  relief 
under  the  PLRA,  the  relief  "shall  extend  no  further  than 
necessary  to  correct  the  violation  of  the  Federal  right  of 
a  particular  plaintiff  or  plaintiffs."  $ 3626(a)(1)(A).  The 
three-judge court must therefore find that the relief is "nar-
rowly drawn, extends  no further than necessary . . . , and  is 
the  least  intrusive  means  necessary  to  correct  the  violation 
of the Federal right."  Ibid.  In making this determination, 
the  three-judge  court  must  give  "substantial  weight  to  any 
adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal 
justice system caused by the relief."  Ibid.  Applying these 
standards, the three-judge court found a population limit ap-
propriate, necessary, and authorized in this case. 

This Court's review of the three-judge court's legal deter-
minations  is  de  novo,  but  factual  findings  are  reviewed  for 
clear  error.  See  Anderson  v.  Bessemer  City,  470  U. S.  564, 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 493 (2011)  513 

Opinion of the Court 
573-574 (1985).  Deference to trial court factfinding reflects an  understanding  that  "[t]he  trial  judge's  major  role  is  the 

determination  of  fact,  and  with  experience  in  fulfilling  that role  comes  expertise."  Id.,  at  574.  The  three-judge  court 
oversaw two weeks of trial and heard at considerable length from California prison officials, as well as experts in the field 
of correctional administration.  The judges had the opportu-nity  to  ask  relevant  questions  of  those  witnesses.  Two  of 
the judges  had  overseen the  ongoing remedial efforts  of the Receiver  and  Special  Master.  The  three-judge  court  was 
well  situated  to  make  the  difficult  factual  judgments  neces-sary  to  fashion  a  remedy  for  this  complex  and  intractable 
constitutional violation.  The three-judge court's findings of fact  may  be  reversed  only  if  this  Court  is  left  with  a  " `defi-
nite  and  firm  conviction  that  a  mistake  has  been  com-mitted.' "  Id., at 573 (quoting United States v.  United States 
Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)). 

A 
The State contends that it was error to convene the three-judge  court  without  affording  it  more  time  to  comply  with 

the prior orders in Coleman and Plata. 

1 
The parties dispute this Court's jurisdiction to review the determinations  of  the  Coleman  and  Plata  District  Courts 

that  a  three-judge  court  should  be  convened.  Plaintiffs claim  the  State  was  required  to  raise  this  issue  first  in  the 
Court  of  Appeals  by  appealing  the  orders  of  the  District Courts.  When  exercising  jurisdiction  under  28  U. S. C. 

$ 1253,  however,  this  Court  "has  not  hesitated  to  exercise jurisdiction `to determine the authority of the court below,' " 
including whether the three-judge court was properly consti-tuted.

Opinion of the Court 
Natural  Gas  Co.,  292  U. S.  16,  18  (1934)  (per  curiam)  ("The case  is  analogous  to  those  in  which  this  Court,  finding  that 

the  court  below  has  acted  without  jurisdiction,  exercises  its appellate jurisdiction to correct the improper action").  The 
merits  of  the  decision  to  convene  the  three-judge  court, therefore, are properly before this Court. 

2 
Before  a  three-judge  court  may  be  convened  to  consider whether  to  enter  a  population  limit,  the  PLRA  requires 

that  the  court  have  "previously  entered  an  order  for  less intrusive  relief  that  has  failed  to  remedy  the  deprivation 
of  the  Federal  right  sought  to  be  remedied."  18  U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(3)(A)(i).  This provision refers to "an order."  It is 
satisfied  if  the  court  has  entered  one  order,  and  this  sin-gle  order  has  "failed  to  remedy"  the  constitutional  viola-
tion.  The  defendant  must  also  have  had  "a  reasonable amount  of  time  to  comply  with  the  previous  court  orders." 

$ 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii).  This  provision  refers  to  the  court's  "or-ders."  It  requires  that  the  defendant  have  been  given  a 
reasonable time to comply with all of the court's orders.  To-gether, these requirements ensure that the " `last resort rem-
edy' " of a population limit is not imposed " `as a first step.' " Inmates  of  Occoquan  v.  Barry,  844  F.  2d  828,  843  (CADC 
1988). The  first  of  these  conditions,  the  previous  order  require-
ment  of  $ 3626(a)(3)(A)(i),  was  satisfied  in  Coleman  by  ap-pointment of a Special Master in 1995, and it was satisfied in 
Plata by approval of a consent decree and stipulated injunc-tion in 2002.  Both orders were intended to remedy the con-
stitutional  violations.  Both  were  given  ample  time  to  suc-
ceed.  When  the  three-judge  court  was  convened,  12  years had  passed  since  the  appointment  of  the 

Coleman  Special 
Master,  and  5  years  had  passed  since  the  approval  of  the 
Plata consent decree.  The State does  not claim that either

Opinion of the Court 
order  achieved  a  remedy.  Although  the  PLRA  entitles  a 
State  to  terminate  remedial  orders  such  as  these  after  two 
years  unless  the  district  court  finds  that  the  relief  "remains 
necessary  to  correct  a  current  and  ongoing  violation  of  the 
Federal  right,"  $ 3626(b)(3),  California  has  not  attempted  to 
obtain relief on this basis. 

The  State  claims  instead  that  the  second  condition,  the 
reasonable  time  requirement  of  $ 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii),  was  not 
met  because  other,  later  remedial  efforts  should  have  been 
given more time to succeed.  In 2006, the Coleman  District 
Judge approved a revised plan of action calling for construc-
tion of new facilities, hiring of new staff, and implementation 
of  new  procedures.  That  same  year,  the  Plata  District 
Judge  selected  and  appointed  a  Receiver  to  oversee  the 
State's  ongoing  remedial  efforts.  When  the  three-judge 
court  was  convened,  the  Receiver  had  filed  a  preliminary 
plan  of  action  calling  for  new  construction,  hiring  of  addi-
tional staff, and other procedural reforms. 

Although  both  the  revised  plan  of  action  in  Coleman  and 
the appointment of the Receiver in Plata were new develop-
ments in the courts' remedial efforts, the basic plan to solve 
the  crisis  through  construction,  hiring,  and  procedural  re-
forms remained unchanged.  These efforts had been ongoing 
for  years;  the  failed  consent  decree  in  Plata  had  called  for 
implementation  of  new  procedures  and  hiring  of  additional 
staff;  and  the  Coleman  Special  Master  had  issued  over  70 
orders directed at achieving a remedy through construction, 
hiring, and procedural reforms.  The Coleman Special Mas-
ter  and  Plata  Receiver  were  unable  to  provide  assurance 
that further, substantially similar efforts would yield success 
absent  a  population  reduction.  Instead,  the  Coleman  Spe-
cial Master explained that "many of the clinical advances . . .

Opinion of the Court 
crowding,  a  successful  remedial  effort  could  "all  but  bank-rupt" the State of California.  App. 1053. 

Having  engaged  in  remedial  efforts  for  5  years  in  Plata and 12 in 

Coleman, the District Courts were not required to 
wait  to  see  whether  their  more  recent  efforts  would  yield equal  disappointment.  When  a  court  attempts  to  remedy 

an  entrenched  constitutional  violation  through  reform  of  a 
complex institution,  such as this  statewide  prison  system,  it may  be  necessary  in  the  ordinary  course  to  issue  multiple 

orders  directing  and  adjusting  ongoing  remedial  efforts. Each new order must be given a reasonable time to succeed, 
but  reasonableness  must  be  assessed  in  light  of  the  entire 
history  of  the  court's  remedial  efforts.  A  contrary  reading 
of  the  reasonable  time  requirement  would  in  effect  require 
district  courts  to  impose  a  moratorium  on  new  remedial  or-
ders before issuing a population limit.  This unnecessary pe-
riod  of  inaction  would  delay  an  eventual  remedy  and  would 
prolong  the  courts'  involvement,  serving  neither  the  State 
nor  the  prisoners.  Congress  did  not  require  this  unreason-
able result when it used the term "reasonable." 

The  Coleman  and  Plata  courts  had  a  solid  basis  to  doubt 
that  additional  efforts  to  build  new  facilities  and  hire  new 
staff  would  achieve  a  remedy.  Indeed,  although  five  years 
have  now  passed  since  the  appointment  of  the  Plata  Re-
ceiver and approval of the revised plan of action in Coleman, 
there  is  no  indication  that  the  constitutional  violations  have 
been  cured.  A  report  filed  by  the  Coleman Special  Master 
in  July  2009  describes  ongoing  violations,  including  an  "ab-
sence  of  timely  access  to  appropriate  levels  of  care  at  every 
point  in  the  system."  App.  807.  A  report  filed  by  the 
Plata  Receiver  in  October  2010  likewise  describes  ongoing 
deficiencies  in  the  provision  of  medical  care  and  concludes 
that  there  are  simply  "too  many  prisoners  for  the  health-
care  infrastructure."  App.  1655.  The  Coleman  and  Plata 
courts  acted  reasonably  when  they  convened  a  three-judge 
court without further delay.

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Once  a  three-judge  court  has  been  convened,  the  court 
must find additional requirements satisfied before it may im-
pose  a  population  limit.  The  first  of  these  requirements  is 
that "crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Fed-
eral right."  18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(3)(E)(i). 

1 
The  three-judge  court  found  the  primary  cause  require-
ment satisfied by the evidence at trial.  The court found that 
overcrowding  strains  inadequate  medical  and  mental  health 
facilities; overburdens limited clinical and custodial staff; and 
creates  violent,  unsanitary,  and  chaotic  conditions  that  con-
tribute  to  the  constitutional  violations  and  frustrate  efforts 
to fashion a  remedy.  The three-judge court also found  that 
"until  the  problem  of  overcrowding  is  overcome  it  will  be 
impossible to provide constitutionally compliant care to Cali-
fornia's prison population."  Juris. App. 141a. 

The  parties  dispute  the  standard  of  review  applicable  to 
this determination.  With respect to the three-judge court's 
factual  findings,  this  Court's  review  is  necessarily  deferen-
tial.  It  is  not  this  Court's  place  to  "duplicate  the  role"  of 
the  trial  court.  Anderson,  470  U. S.,  at  573.  The  ultimate 
issue  of  primary  cause  presents  a  mixed  question  of  law 
and fact; but there, too, "the mix weighs heavily on the `fact' 
side."  Lilly  v.  Virginia,  527  U. S.  116,  148  (1999)  (Rehn-
quist,  C.  J.,  concurring  in  judgment).  Because  the  "district 
court  is  `better  positioned' . . .  to  decide  the  issue,"  our  re-
view of the three-judge court's primary cause determination 
is  deferential.  Salve  Regina  College  v.  Russell,  499  U. S. 
225, 233 (1991). 

The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning de-
mand on the provision of care.  At the time of trial, vacancy 
rates  for  medical  and  mental  health  staff  ranged  as  high  as 
20%  for  surgeons,  25%  for  physicians,  39%  for  nurse  prac-

Opinion of the Court 
titioners,  and  54.1%  for  psychiatrists.  Juris.  App.  105a, 108a.  These  percentages  are  based  on  the  number  of  posi-

tions  budgeted  by  the  State.  Dr.  Ronald  Shansky,  former medical director of the Illinois prison system, concluded that 
these  numbers  understate  the  severity  of  the  crisis  because the State has  not budgeted sufficient staff  to meet demand.

5 

According  to  Dr.  Shansky,  "even  if  the  prisons  were  able  to fill all of their vacant health care  positions, which  they have 

not  been  able  to  do  to  date,  .  .  .  the  prisons  would  still be  unable  to  handle  the  level  of  need  given  the  current 
overcrowding."  Record  in  No.  2:90-cv-00520-LKK-JFM 
(ED  Cal.),  Doc.  3231-13,  p.  19  (hereinafter  Doc.  3231-13). Dr.  Craig  Haney,  a  professor  of  psychology,  reported  that 

mental  health  staff  are  "managing  far  larger  caseloads  than is  appropriate  or  effective."  App.  596.  A  prison  psychia-
trist  told  Dr.  Haney  that  " `we  are  doing  about  50%  of  what 
we should be doing.' "  Ibid.  In the context of physical care Dr.  Shansky  agreed  that  "demand  for  care,  particularly  for 

the  high  priority  cases,  continues  to  overwhelm  the  re-sources available." 

Id., at 1408. 
Even  on  the  assumption  that  vacant  positions  could  be filled,  the  evidence  suggested  there  would  be  insufficient 

space for the necessary additional staff to perform their jobs. The 

Plata  Receiver,  in  his  report  on  overcrowding,  con-
cluded that even the "newest and most modern prisons" had 
been  "designed  with  clinic  space  which  is  only  one-half  that necessary  for  the  real-life  capacity  of  the  prisons."  App. 

1023  (emphasis  deleted).  Dr.  Haney  reported  that  "[e]ach one of the facilities I toured was short of significant amounts 
of  space  needed  to  perform  otherwise  critical  tasks  and  re-

5 Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had "significantly un-
derestimated  the  staffing  needed  to  implement  critical  portions  of  the 
Coleman  Program  Guide  requirements,"  that  "key  tasks  were  omitted 
when determining staffing workloads," and that estimates were based on 
"key  assumptions"  that  caused  the  State  to  underestimate  demand  for 
mental health care.  App. 596-597.

Opinion of the Court 
sponsibilities."  Id.,  at  597-598.  In  one  facility,  staff  cared for  7,525  prisoners  in  space  designed  for  one-third  as  many. 

Juris.  App.  93a.  Staff  operate  out  of  converted  storage rooms,  closets,  bathrooms,  shower  rooms,  and  visiting  cen-
ters.  These  makeshift  facilities  impede  the  effective  de-livery  of  care  and  place  the  safety  of  medical  professionals 
in  jeopardy,  compounding  the  difficulty  of  hiring  additional staff. 

This  shortfall  of  resources  relative  to  demand  contributes to significant delays in treatment.  Mentally ill prisoners are 
housed in administrative segregation while awaiting transfer 
to scarce mental health treatment beds for appropriate care. One  correctional  officer  indicated  that  he  had  kept  mentally 

ill prisoners in segregation for " `6 months or more.' "  App. 
594.  Other  prisoners  awaiting  care  are  held  in  tiny,  phone-booth-sized  cages.  The record  documents instances of pris-

oners committing suicide while awaiting treatment.6 Delays  are  no  less  severe  in  the  context  of  physical  care. 
Prisons  have  backlogs  of  up  to  700  prisoners  waiting  to  see a doctor.  Doc. 3231-13, at 21.  A review of referrals for ur-
gent  specialty  care  at  one  prison  revealed  that  only  105  of 316 pending referrals had a scheduled appointment, and only 
2  had  an  appointment  scheduled  to  occur  within  14  days. 
Id.,  at  25-26.  Urgent  specialty  referrals  at  one  prison  had 
been pending for six months to a year.  Id., at 30. Crowding also creates unsafe  and unsanitary living condi-

tions  that  hamper  effective  delivery  of  medical  and  mental health  care.  A  medical  expert  described  living  quarters  in 
converted gymnasiums or dayrooms, where large numbers of 
prisoners  may  share  just  a  few  toilets  and  showers,  as 

6 For  instance,  Dr.  Pablo  Stewart  reported  that  one  prisoner  was  re-
ferred to a crisis bed but, "[a]fter learning that the restraint room was not 
available  and  that  there  were  no  crisis  beds  open,  staff  moved  [the  pris-
oner]  back  to  his  administrative  segregation  cell  without  any  prescribed 
observation."  App. 736.  The prisoner "hanged himself that night in his 
cell."  Ibid.; see also Juris. App. 99a.

" `breeding  grounds  for  disease. ' " 7  Juris.  App.  102a. 
Cramped  conditions  promote  unrest  and  violence,  making  it 
difficult for prison officials to monitor and control the prison 
population.  On  any  given  day,  prisoners  in  the  general 
prison population may become ill, thus entering the plaintiff 
class;  and  overcrowding  may  prevent  immediate  medical  at-
tention necessary to avoid suffering, death, or spread of dis-
ease.  After  one  prisoner  was  assaulted  in  a  crowded  gym-
nasium, prison staff did not even learn of the injury until the 
prisoner  had been  dead  for several hours.  Tr. 382.  Living 
in crowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions can cause pris-
oners  with  latent  mental  illnesses  to  worsen  and  develop 
overt  symptoms.  Crowding may  also  impede efforts to im-
prove delivery of care.  Two prisoners committed suicide by 
hanging  after  being  placed  in  cells  that  had  been  identified 
as  requiring  a  simple  fix  to  remove  attachment  points  that 
could  support  a  noose.  The  repair  was  not  made  because 
doing  so  would  involve  removing  prisoners  from  the  cells, 
and there was no place to put them.  Id., at 769-777.  More 
generally,  Jeanne  Woodford,  the  former  acting  secretary  of 
California's  prisons,  testified  that  there  " `are  simply  too 
many  issues  that  arise  from  such  a  large  number  of  prison-
ers,' "  and  that,  as  a  result,  " `management  spends  virtually 
all of its time fighting fires instead of engaging in thoughtful 
decision-making  and  planning' "  of  the  sort  needed  to  fash-
ion  an  effective  remedy  for  these  constitutional  violations. 
Juris. App. 82a. 

7 Correctional  officials  at  trial  described  several  outbreaks  of  disease. 
One officer testified that antibiotic-resistant staph infections spread widely 
among  the  prison  population  and  described  prisoners  "bleeding,  oozing 
with  pus  that  is  soaking  through  their  clothes  when  they  come  in  to  get 
the wound covered and treated."  Tr. 601, 604-605.  Another witness tes-
tified  that  inmates  with  influenza  were  sent back  from  the  infirmary  due 
to a lack of beds  and that the disease  quickly spread  to "more than half" 
the  340  prisoners  in  the  housing  unit,  with  the  result  that  the  unit  was 
placed on lockdown for a week.  Id., at 720-721. 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 493 (2011)  521 

Opinion of the Court 
Increased violence also requires increased reliance on lock-downs  to  keep  order,  and  lockdowns  further  impede  the  ef-

fective  delivery  of  care.  In  2006,  prison  officials  instituted 449  lockdowns. 

Id.,  at  116a.  The  average  lockdown  lasted 
12  days,  and  20  lockdowns  lasted  60  days  or  longer.  Ibid. During lockdowns, staff must either escort prisoners to med-

ical facilities or bring medical staff to the prisoners.  Either 
procedure  puts  additional  strain  on  already  overburdened medical  and  custodial  staff.  Some  programming  for  the 

mentally  ill  even  may  be  canceled  altogether  during  lock-downs,  and staff  may  be unable  to  supervise  the  delivery  of 
psychotropic medications. 

The  effects  of  overcrowding  are  particularly  acute  in  the 
prisons'  reception  centers,  intake areas  that  process  140,000 
new or returning prisoners every year.  Id., at 85a.  Crowd-
ing  in  these  areas  runs  as  high  as  300%  of  design  capacity. 
Id.,  at  86a.  Living  conditions  are  " `toxic,' "  and  a  lack  of 
treatment  space  impedes  efforts  to  identify  inmate  medical 
or  mental  health  needs  and  provide  even  rudimentary  care. 
Id.,  at  92a.  The  former  warden  of  San  Quentin  reported 
that  doctors  in  that  prison's  reception  center  " `were  unable 
to  keep  up  with  physicals  or  provid[e]  any  kind  of  chronic 
care  follow-up.' "  Id.,  at  90a.  Inmates  spend  long  periods 
of time in these areas awaiting transfer to the general popu-
lation.  Some prisoners are held in the reception centers for 
their entire period of incarceration. 

Numerous  experts  testified  that  crowding  is  the  primary 
cause  of  the  constitutional  violations.  The  former  warden 
of San Quentin and former acting secretary of the California 
prisons concluded that crowding "makes it `virtually impossi-
ble  for  the  organization  to  develop,  much  less  implement,  a 
plan to provide prisoners with adequate care.' "  Id., at 83a. 
The  former  executive  director  of  the  Texas  Department 
of  Criminal  Justice  testified  that  " `[e]verything  revolves 
around  overcrowding' "  and  that  " `overcrowding  is  the  pri-
mary  cause  of  the  medical  and  mental  health  care  viola-

522  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
tions.' "  Id.,  at  127a.  The  former  head  of  corrections  in Pennsylvania,  Washington,  and  Maine  testified  that  over-

crowding  is  " `overwhelming  the  system  both  in  terms  of sheer  numbers,  in  terms  of  the  space  available,  in  terms  of 
providing  healthcare.' "  Ibid.  And  the  current  secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections testified that 
" ``the biggest inhibiting factor right now in California being able  to  deliver  appropriate  mental  health  and  medical  care 
is the severe overcrowding.' "  Id., at 82a.

The State attempts to undermine the substantial evidence presented  at  trial,  and  the  three-judge  court's  findings  of 

fact, by complaining that the three-judge court did not allow it  to  present  evidence  of  current  prison  conditions.  This 
suggestion lacks a factual basis. The  three-judge  court  properly  admitted  evidence  of  cur-
rent  conditions  as  relevant  to  the  issues  before  it.  The three-judge  court  allowed  discovery  until  a  few  months  be-
fore trial; expert witnesses based their conclusions on recent observations  of prison  conditions;  the  court  admitted  recent 
reports on prison conditions by the Plata Receiver and Cole-
man  Special  Master;  and  both  parties  presented  testimony related to current conditions, including understaffing, inade-

quate  facilities,  and  unsanitary  and  unsafe  living  conditions. See 

supra,  at  504-507,  517-521  and  this  page.  Dr.  Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on tours of eight 

California prisons.  App. 539.  These tours occurred as late as  August  2008,  two  weeks  before  Dr.  Haney  submitted  his 
report and less than four months before the first day of trial. Id.,  at 585;  see  also  id.,  at  563,  565,  580  (July  tours).  Other 
experts  submitted  reports  based  on  similar  observations. See, 

e. g.,  Doc.  3231-13,  at  9  (Dr.  Shansky);  App.  646  (Dr. Stewart); id., at 1245 (Austin); id., at 1312 (Lehman). 

The  three-judge  court's  opinion  cited  and  relied  on  this evidence of current conditions.  The court relied extensively 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 493 (2011)  523 

Opinion of the Court 
on  the  expert  witness  reports.  See  generally  Juris.  App. 85a-143a.  The  court  cited  the  most  current  data  available 

on suicides and preventable deaths in the California prisons. 
Id., at 123a, 125a.  The court relied on statistics on staff va-
cancies  that  dated  to  three  months  before  trial,  id.,  at  105a, 108a,  and  statistics  on  shortages  of  treatment  beds  for  the 

same  period,  id.,  at  97a.  These  are  just  examples  of  the 
extensive evidence of current conditions that informed every aspect  of  the  judgment  of  the  three-judge  court.  The 

three-judge  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  when  it  also cited  findings  made  in  earlier  decisions  of  the 

Plata  and 
Coleman District Courts.  Those findings remained relevant 
to establish the nature of these longstanding, continuing con-
stitutional violations. 

It  is  true  that  the  three-judge  court  established  a  cutoff 
date  for  discovery  a  few  months  before  trial.  The  order 
stated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed until 
that  date,  and  that  evidence  of  "changed  prison  conditions" 
after  that  date  would  not  be  admitted.  App.  1190.  The 
court  also  excluded  evidence  not  pertinent  to  the  issue 
whether  a  population  limit  is  appropriate  under  the  PLRA, 
including  evidence  relevant  solely  to  the  existence  of  an  on-
going  constitutional  violation.  The  court  reasoned  that  its 
decision was limited to the issue of remedy and that the mer-
its  of  the  constitutional  violation  had  already  been  deter-
mined.  The  three-judge court  made  clear  that  all  such  evi-
dence would be considered "[t]o the extent that it illuminates 
questions  that  are  properly  before  the  court."  Id.,  at  2339. 

Both  rulings  were  within  the  sound  discretion  of  the 
three-judge  court.  Orderly  trial  management  may  require 
discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation 
of the merits and the remedy.  The State in fact represented 
to  the  three-judge  court  that  it  would  be  "appropriate"  to 
cut off discovery before trial because "like plaintiffs, we, too, 
are  really  gearing  up  and  going  into  a  pretrial  mode."  Id., 
at 1683.  And if the State truly believed there was no longer

a  violation,  it  could  have  argued  to  the  Coleman  and  Plata District  Courts  that  a  three-judge  court  should  not  be  con-

vened  because  the  District  Courts'  prior  orders  had  not "failed  to  remedy  the  deprivation"  of  prisoners'  constitu-
tional  rights.  18  U. S. C.  $ 3626(a)(3)(A)(i);  see  also  supra, at 514-515.  Once the three-judge court was convened, that 
court  was  not  required  to  reconsider  the  merits.  Its  role was solely to consider the propriety and necessity of a popu-
lation limit. The  State  does  not  point  to  any  significant  evidence  that 
it  was  unable  to  present  and  that  would  have  changed  the outcome of the proceedings.  To the contrary, the record and 
opinion make clear that the decision of the three-judge court was based on current evidence pertaining to ongoing consti-
tutional violations.  3 

The  three-judge  court  acknowledged  that  the  violations were caused by factors in addition to overcrowding and that 
reducing  crowding  in  the  prisons  would  not  entirely  cure the  violations.  This  is  consistent  with  the  reports  of  the 
Coleman  Special  Master  and  Plata  Receiver,  both  of  whom concluded that even a significant reduction in the prison pop-
ulation would not remedy the violations absent continued ef-forts to train staff, improve facilities, and reform procedures. 
App.  487,  1054.8  The  three-judge  court  nevertheless  found 

8 The  Plata  Receiver  concluded  that  those  who  believed  a  population 
reduction  would  be  a  panacea  were  "simply  wrong."  App.  1054-1055. 
The  Receiver  nevertheless  made  clear  that  "the  time  this  process  will 
take, and the cost and the scope of intrusion by the Federal Court cannot 
help  but  increase,  and  increase  in  a  very  significant  manner,  if  the  scope 
and characteristics of [California prison] overcrowding continue."  Id., at 
1053.  The Coleman Special Master likewise found that a large release of 
prisoners,  without other  relief, would  leave the  violation "largely unmiti-
gated"  even  though  deficiencies  in  care  "are  unquestionably  exacerbated 
by  overcrowding"  and  "defendants'  ability  to  provide  required  mental 
health services would be enhanced considerably by a reduction in the over-
all census" of the prisons.  App. 486-487.

Opinion of the Court 
that  overcrowding  was  the  primary  cause  in  the  sense  of 
being the foremost cause of the violation. 

This  understanding  of  the  primary  cause  requirement  is 
consistent  with  the  text  of  the  PLRA.  The  State  in  fact 
concedes  that  it  proposed  this  very  definition  of  primary 
cause  to  the  three-judge  court.  "Primary"  is  defined  as 
"[f]irst or highest in rank, quality, or importance; principal." 
American  Heritage  Dictionary  1393  (4th  ed.  2000);  see  also 
Webster's  Third  New  International  Dictionary  1800  (2002) 
(defining "primary" as "first in rank  or importance"); 12 Ox-
ford English Dictionary 472 (2d ed. 1989) (defining "primary" 
as  "[o]f  the  first  or  highest  rank  or  importance;  that  claims 
the  first  consideration;  principal,  chief ").  Overcrowding 
need  only  be  the  foremost,  chief,  or  principal  cause  of  the 
violation.  If  Congress  had  intended  to  require  that  crowd-
ing  be the  only  cause, it  would  have  said  so,  assuming in  its 
judgment  that  definition  would  be  consistent  with  constitu-
tional limitations. 

As  this  case  illustrates,  constitutional  violations  in  condi-
tions  of  confinement  are  rarely  susceptible  of  simple  or 
straightforward  solutions.  In  addition  to  overcrowding  the 
failure  of  California's  prisons  to  provide  adequate  medical 
and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic and wors-
ening  budget  shortfalls,  a  lack  of  political  will  in  favor  of 
reform,  inadequate  facilities,  and  systemic  administrative 
failures.  The  Plata  District  Judge,  in  his  order  appointing 
the  Receiver,  compared  the  problem  to  " `a  spider  web,  in 
which  the  tension  of  the  various  strands  is  determined  by 
the  relationship  among  all  the  parts  of  the  web,  so  that  if 
one pulls on a single strand, the tension of the entire web is 
redistributed  in  a  new  and  complex  pattern.' "  App.  966- 
967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discretionary Constitution: Insti-
tutional Remedies and Judicial Legitimacy, 91 Yale L. J. 635, 
645  (1982));  see  also  Hutto, 437  U. S., at  688  (noting  "the  in-
terdependence of the conditions producing the violation," in-

Opinion of the Court 
cluding overcrowding).  Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes, including overcrowding, will yield a solution. 

The  PLRA  should  not  be  interpreted  to  place  undue  re-strictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion practi-
cal  remedies  when  confronted  with  complex  and  intractable constitutional  violations.  Congress  limited  the  availability 
of  limits  on  prison  populations,  but  it  did  not  forbid  these measures  altogether.  See  18  U. S. C.  $ 3626.  The  House 
Report accompanying the PLRA explained: 

"While prison caps must be the remedy of last resort, a  court  still  retains  the  power  to  order  this  remedy  de-

spite  its  intrusive  nature  and  harmful  consequences  to the public if, but only if, it is truly necessary to prevent 
an actual violation of a prisoner's federal rights."  H. R. Rep. No. 104-21, p. 25 (1995). 

Courts  should  presume  that  Congress  was  sensitive  to  the real-world  problems  faced  by  those  who  would  remedy  con-
stitutional  violations  in  the  prisons  and  that  Congress  did not  leave  prisoners  without  a  remedy  for  violations  of  their 
constitutional  rights.  A  reading  of  the  PLRA  that  would render  population  limits  unavailable  in  practice  would  raise 
serious  constitutional  concerns.  See,  e. g.,  Bowen  v.  Michi-
gan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986).  A finding that overcrowding  is the "primary cause" 

of  a  violation  is  therefore  permissible,  despite  the  fact  that additional steps will be required to remedy the violation. 

C 
The  three-judge  court  was  also  required  to  find  by  clear and convincing evidence that "no other relief will remedy the 

violation of the Federal right."  $ 3626(a)(3)(E)(ii). The State argues that the violation could have been reme-
died  through  a  combination  of  new  construction,  transfers of  prisoners  out  of  State,  hiring  of  medical  personnel,  and 
continued  efforts  by  the  Plata  Receiver  and  Coleman  Spe-

Opinion of the Court 
cial  Master.  The  order  in  fact  permits  the  State  to  comply with the population limit by transferring prisoners to county 

facilities or facilities in other States, or by constructing new facilities  to  raise  the  prisons'  design  capacity.  And  the 
three-judge court's order does not bar the State from under-taking any other remedial efforts.  If the State does find an 
adequate  remedy  other  than  a  population  limit,  it  may  seek modification  or  termination  of  the  three-judge  court's  order 
on  that  basis.  The  evidence  at trial,  however,  supports  the three-judge court's conclusion  that an  order limited to other 
remedies would not provide effective relief. 

The State's argument that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail be-

cause requiring out-of-state transfers itself qualifies as a pop-
ulation limit under the PLRA.9  Such an order "has the pur-pose  or  effect  of  reducing  or  limiting  the  prison  population, 

or . . .  directs the release  from or nonadmission  of prisoners 
to a prison."  $ 3626(g)(4).  The same is true of transfers to 
county  facilities.  Transfers  provide  a  means  to  reduce  the prison population in compliance with the three-judge court's 

order.  They  are  not  a  less  restrictive  alternative  to  that order. 

Even  if  out-of-state  transfers  could  be  regarded  as  a  less restrictive  alternative,  the  three-judge  court  found  no  evi-
dence  of  plans  for  transfers  in  numbers  sufficient  to  relieve overcrowding.  The  State  complains  that  the 

Coleman  Dis-
trict  Court  slowed  the  rate  of  transfer  by  requiring  inspec-
tions to ensure that the receiving institutions were in compli-ance  with  the  Eighth  Amendment,  but  the  State  has  made 

no  effort  to  show  that  it  has  the  resources  and  the  capacity 

9 A program of voluntary transfers by the State would, of course, be less 
restrictive than an order mandating a reduction in the prison population. 
In light of the State's longstanding failure to remedy these serious consti-
tutional  violations, the  three-judge  court  was under no  obligation  to con-
sider voluntary population-reduction measures by the State as a workable 
alternative to injunctive relief. 

528  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
to  transfer  significantly  larger  numbers  of  prisoners  absent that condition. 

Construction  of  new  facilities,  in  theory,  could  alleviate overcrowding,  but  the  three-judge  court  found  no  realistic 
possibility that California would be able to build itself out of this crisis.  At the time of the court's decision the State had 
plans to build new medical and housing facilities, but funding 
for  some  plans  had  not  been  secured  and  funding  for  other plans had been delayed by the legislature for years.  Partic-

ularly  in  light  of  California's  ongoing  fiscal  crisis,  the  three-judge court deemed  "chimerical" any  "remedy that requires 
significant  additional  spending  by  the  state."  Juris.  App. 
151a.  Events subsequent to the three-judge court's decision 
have  confirmed  this  conclusion.  In  October  2010,  the  State 
notified  the  Coleman  District  Court  that  a  substantial  com-
ponent of its construction plans had been delayed indefinitely 
by  the  legislature.  And  even  if  planned  construction  were 
to  be  completed,  the  Plata  Receiver  found  that  many  socalled "expansion" plans called for cramming more prisoners 
into  existing  prisons  without  expanding  administrative  and 
support  facilities.  Juris.  App.  151a-152a.  The  former  act-
ing  secretary  of  the  California  prisons  explained  that  these 
plans  would  " `compound  the  burdens  imposed  on  prison 
administrators  and  line  staff ' "  by  adding  to  the  already 
overwhelming  prison  population,  creating  new  barriers  to 
achievement of a remedy.  Id., at 152a. 

The  three-judge  court  also  rejected  additional  hiring  as  a 
realistic  means  to  achieve  a  remedy.  The  State  for  years 
had  been  unable  to  fill  positions  necessary  for  the  adequate 
provision  of  medical  and  mental  health  care,  and  the  threejudge  court  found  no  reason  to  expect  a  change.  Although 
the  State  points  to  limited  gains  in  staffing  between  2007 
and 2008, the record shows that the prison system remained 
chronically  understaffed  through  trial  in  2008.  See  supra, 
at  517-518.  The  three-judge  court  found  that  violence  and 
other  negative  conditions  caused  by  crowding  made  it  diffi-

Opinion of the Court 
cult  to  hire  and  retain  needed  staff.  The  court  also  con-
cluded  that  there  would  be  insufficient  space  for  additional 
staff  to  work  even  if  adequate  personnel  could  somehow  be 
retained.  Additional  staff  cannot  help  to  remedy  the  viola-
tion if they have no space in which to see and treat patients. 

The  three-judge  court  also  did  not  err,  much  less  commit 
clear  error,  when  it  concluded  that,  absent  a  population  re-
duction,  continued  efforts  by  the  Receiver  and  Special  Mas-
ter would not achieve a remedy.  Both the Receiver and the 
Special Master filed reports stating that overcrowding posed 
a  significant  barrier  to  their  efforts.  The  Plata  Receiver 
stated  that  he  was  determined  to  achieve  a  remedy  even 
without  a  population  reduction,  but  he  warned  that  such  an 
effort would "all but bankrupt" the State.  App. 1053.  The 
Coleman  Special  Master  noted  even  more  serious  concerns, 
stating  that  previous  remedial  efforts  had  "succumbed  to 
the  inexorably  rising  tide  of  population."  App.  489.  Both 
reports  are  persuasive  evidence  that,  absent  a  reduction 
in  overcrowding,  any  remedy  might  prove  unattainable  and 
would  at  the  very  least  require  vast  expenditures  of  re-
sources  by  the  State.  Nothing  in  the  long  history  of  the 
Coleman and Plata actions demonstrates any real possibility 
that the necessary resources would be made available. 

The State claims that, even if each of these measures were 
unlikely to remedy the violation, they would succeed in doing 
so if combined together.  Aside from asserting this proposi-
tion, the State offers no reason to believe it is so.  Attempts 
to remedy the violations in Plata have been ongoing for nine 
years.  In  Coleman,  remedial  efforts  have  been  ongoing 

for 16.  At one time, it may have been possible to hope that 
these violations would be cured without a reduction in over-
crowding.  A long history of failed remedial orders, together 
with  substantial  evidence  of  overcrowding's  deleterious 
effects  on  the  provision  of  care,  compels  a  different  conclu-
sion today. 

530  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
The common thread connecting the State's proposed reme-dial  efforts  is  that  they  would  require  the  State  to  expend 

large amounts of money absent a reduction in overcrowding. The  Court  cannot  ignore  the  political  and  fiscal  reality  be-
hind this case.  California's Legislature has not been willing or able to allocate the resources necessary to meet this crisis 
absent  a  reduction  in  overcrowding.  There  is  no  reason  to believe it will begin to do so now, when the State of Califor-
nia  is  facing  an  unprecedented  budgetary  shortfall.  As noted  above, the  legislature  recently  failed  to  allocate  funds 
for  planned  new  construction.  Supra,  at  528.  Without  a reduction  in  overcrowding,  there  will  be  no  efficacious  rem-
edy for the unconstitutional care of the sick and mentally ill in California's prisons. 

D 
The  PLRA  states  that  no  prospective  relief  shall  issue with respect to prison conditions unless it is narrowly drawn, 

extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of a federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to 
correct  the  violation.  18  U. S. C.  $ 3626(a).  When  deter-mining  whether  these  requirements  are  met,  courts  must 
"give  substantial  weight  to  any  adverse  impact  on  public safety  or  the  operation  of  a  criminal  justice  system."

The  three-judge  court  acknowledged  that  its  order  "is likely to affect inmates without medical conditions or serious 

mental illness."  Juris. App. 172a.  This is because reducing California's prison population will require reducing the num-
ber  of  prisoners  outside  the  class  through  steps  such  as  pa-role  reform,  sentencing  reform,  use  of  good-time  credits,  or 
other means to be determined by the State.  Reducing over-crowding  will  also  have  positive  effects  beyond  facilitating 
timely and adequate access to medical care, including reduc-ing  the incidence  of  prison  violence  and  ameliorating  unsafe 
living  conditions.  According  to  the  State,  these  collateral

Opinion of the Court 
consequences  are  evidence  that  the  order  sweeps  more broadly than necessary. 

The  population  limit  imposed  by  the  three-judge  court does  not  fail  narrow  tailoring  simply  because  it  will  have 
positive effects beyond the plaintiff class.  Narrow tailoring requires a " ` "fit" between the [remedy's] ends and the means 
chosen  to  accomplish  those  ends.' "  Board  of  Trustees  of 
State  Univ.  of  N.  Y.  v.  Fox,  492  U. S.  469,  480  (1989).  The scope of the remedy must be proportional to the scope of the 

violation,  and  the  order  must  extend  no  further  than  neces-sary  to  remedy  the  violation.  This  Court  has  rejected  re-
medial orders that unnecessarily reach out to improve prison 
conditions  other  than  those  that  violate  the  Constitution. 
Lewis  v.  Casey,  518  U. S.  343,  357  (1996).  But  the  prece-
dents  do  not  suggest  that  a  narrow  and  otherwise  proper 
remedy  for  a  constitutional  violation  is  invalid  simply  be-
cause it will have collateral effects. 

Nor  does  anything  in  the  text  of  the  PLRA  require  that 
result.  The  PLRA  states  that  a  remedy  shall  extend  no 
further  than  necessary  to  remedy  the  violation  of  the 
rights  of  a  "particular  plaintiff  or  plaintiffs."  18  U. S. C. 

$ 3626(a)(1)(A).  This means only that the scope of the order 
must  be  determined  with  reference  to  the  constitutional 
violations  established  by  the  specific  plaintiffs  before  the 
court. 

This case is unlike cases where courts have impermissibly 
reached  out  to  control  the  treatment  of  persons  or  institu-
tions  beyond the  scope of the violation.  See Dayton Bd. of 
Ed.  v.  Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 420 (1977).  Even prisoners 
with  no  present  physical  or  mental  illness  may  become  af-
flicted,  and  all  prisoners  in  California  are  at  risk  so  long  as 
the  State  continues  to  provide  inadequate  care.  Prisoners 
in  the  general  population  will  become  sick,  and  will  become 
members of the plaintiff classes, with routine frequency; and 
overcrowding  may  prevent  the  timely  diagnosis  and  care 
necessary to provide effective treatment and to prevent fur-

Opinion of the Court 
ther  spread  of  disease.  Relief  targeted  only  at  present members  of  the  plaintiff  classes  may  therefore  fail  to  ade-

quately protect future  class members  who will develop seri-ous  physical  or  mental  illness.  Prisoners  who  are  not  sick 
or  mentally  ill  do  not  yet  have  a  claim  that  they  have  been subjected  to  care  that  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment,  but 
in  no  sense are  they  remote  bystanders in  California's  med-
ical  care  system.  They  are  that  system's  next  potential victims. 

A  release  order  limited  to  prisoners  within  the  plaintiff classes  would,  if  anything,  unduly  limit  the  ability  of  state 
officials  to  determine  which  prisoners  should  be  released. 
As  the  State  acknowledges  in  its  brief,  "release  of  seriously 
mentally  ill  inmates  [would  be]  likely  to  create  special  dan-
gers because of their recidivism rates."  Consolidated Reply 
Brief for Appellants 34.  The order of the three-judge court 
gives  the  State  substantial  flexibility  to  determine  who 
should be released.  If the State truly believes that a release 
order limited to sick and mentally ill inmates would be pref-
erable  to  the  order  entered  by  the  three-judge  court,  the 
State can move the three-judge court for modification of the 
order on that basis.  The State has not requested this relief 
from this Court. 

The  order  also  is  not  overbroad  because  it  encompasses 
the  entire  prison  system,  rather  than  separately  assessing 
the  need  for  a  population  limit  at  every  institution.  The 
Coleman  court  found  a  systemwide  violation  when  it  first 
afforded  relief,  and  in  Plata  the  State  stipulated  to  systemwide  relief  when  it  conceded  the  existence  of  a  violation. 
Both  the  Coleman  Special  Master  and  the  Plata  Receiver 
have  filed  numerous  reports  detailing  systemwide  deficien-
cies in medical and mental health care.  California's medical 
care program is run at a systemwide level, and resources are 
shared among the correctional facilities. 

Although  the  three-judge  court's  order  addresses  the  en-
tire  California  prison  system,  it  affords  the  State  flexibility 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 493 (2011)  533 

Opinion of the Court 
to  accommodate  differences  between  institutions.  There  is no  requirement  that  every  facility  comply  with  the  137.5% 

limit.  Assuming  no  constitutional  violation  results,  some facilities  may  retain  populations  in  excess  of  the  limit  pro-
vided  other  facilities  fall  sufficiently  below  it  so  the  system as a whole  remains  in  compliance with  the  order.  This  will 
allow  prison  officials  to  shift  prisoners  to  facilities  that  are 
better able to accommodate overcrowding, or out of facilities where  retaining  sufficient  medical  staff  has  been  difficult. 

The  alternative--a  series  of  institution-specific  population limits--would  require  federal  judges  to  make  these  choices. 
Leaving  this  discretion  to  state  officials  does  not  make  the 
order overbroad. 

Nor  is  the  order  overbroad  because  it  limits  the  State's 
authority  to  run  its  prisons,  as  the  State  urges  in  its  brief. 
While  the  order  does  in  some  respects  shape  or  control  the 
State's  authority  in  the  realm  of  prison  administration,  it 
does  so  in  a  manner  that  leaves  much  to  the  State's  discre-
tion.  The  State  may  choose  how  to  allocate  prisoners  be-
tween  institutions;  it  may  choose  whether  to  increase  the 
prisons' capacity through construction or reduce the popula-
tion; and, if it does reduce the population, it may decide what 
steps  to  take  to  achieve  the  necessary  reduction.  The  or-
der's  limited  scope  is  necessary  to  remedy  a  constitutional 
violation. 

As  the  State  implements  the  order  of  the  three-judge 
court, time and experience may reveal targeted and effective 
remedies  that  will  end  the  constitutional  violations  even 
without  a  significant  decrease  in  the  general  prison  popula-
tion.  The  State  will  be  free  to  move  the  three-judge  court 
for modification of its order on that basis, and these motions 
would  be  entitled  to  serious  consideration.  See  infra,  at 
543-545.  At this time, the State has not proposed any real-
istic  alternative  to  the  order.  The  State's  desire  to  avoid  a 
population  limit,  justified  as  according  respect  to  state  au-
thority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of continuing

Opinion of the Court 
violations  of  the  rights  of  sick  and  mentally  ill  prisoners, with the result that many more will die or needlessly suffer. 

The Constitution does not permit this wrong.

In  reaching  its  decision,  the  three-judge  court  gave  "sub-stantial  weight"  to  any  potential  adverse  impact  on  public 

safety  from  its  order.  The  court  devoted  nearly  10  days  of trial  to  the  issue  of  public  safety,  and  it  gave  the  question 
extensive  attention  in  its  opinion.  Ultimately,  the  court concluded  that  it  would  be  possible  to  reduce  the  prison 
population  "in  a  manner  that  preserves  public  safety  and the  operation  of  the  criminal  justice  system."  Juris.  App. 
247a-248a. The  PLRA's  requirement  that  a  court  give  "substantial 
weight" to public safety does not require the court to certify that  its  order  has  no  possible  adverse  impact  on  the  public. 
A  contrary  reading  would  depart  from  the  statute's  text  by replacing  the  word  "substantial"  with  "conclusive."  When-
ever a court issues an order requiring the State to adjust its incarceration  and criminal  justice policy,  there is  a risk  that 
the  order  will  have  some  adverse  impact  on  public  safety in  some  sectors.  This  is  particularly  true  when  the  order 
requires  release  of  prisoners  before  their  sentence  has  been served.  Persons incarcerated for even one offense may have 
committed many other crimes prior to arrest and conviction, and some number can be expected to commit further crimes 
upon  release.  Yet  the  PLRA  contemplates  that  courts  will retain authority to issue orders  necessary to remedy  consti-
tutional  violations,  including  authority  to  issue  population limits  when  necessary.  See 

supra,  at  527.  A  court  is  re-
quired to consider the public safety consequences of its order and  to  structure,  and  monitor,  its  ruling  in  a  way  that  miti-

gates  those  consequences  while  still  achieving  an  effective 
remedy of the constitutional violation.

Opinion of the Court 
This  inquiry  necessarily  involves  difficult  predictive  judg-ments  regarding  the  likely  effects  of  court  orders.  Al-

though these judgments are normally made by state officials, they necessarily must be made  by courts when those courts 
fashion injunctive relief to remedy serious constitutional vio-lations in the prisons.  These questions are difficult and sen-
sitive,  but  they  are  factual  questions  and  should  be  treated as  such.  Courts  can,  and  should,  rely  on  relevant  and  in-
formed  expert  testimony  when  making  factual  findings.  It was proper for the three-judge court to rely on the testimony 
of  prison  officials  from  California  and  other  States.  Those experts  testified  on  the  basis  of  empirical  evidence  and  ex-
tensive experience in the field of prison administration. The  three-judge  court  credited  substantial  evidence  that 
prison populations can be reduced in a manner that does not increase  crime  to a significant  degree.  Some evidence  indi-
cated  that  reducing  overcrowding  in  California's  prisons could  even  improve  public  safety.  Then-Governor  Schwar-
zenegger,  in  his  emergency  proclamation  on  overcrowding, acknowledged  that  " `overcrowding  causes  harm  to  people 
and  property,  leads  to  inmate  unrest  and  misconduct,  .  .  . and  increases  recidivism  as  shown  within  this  state  and  in 
others.' "  Juris.  App.  191a-192a.  The  former  warden  of San  Quentin  and  acting  secretary  of  the  California  prison 
system testified that she " `absolutely believe[s] that we make people  worse,  and  that  we  are  not  meeting  public  safety  by 
the way we treat people.' " 10  Id., at 129a.  And the head of

sity reported that California's present recidivism rate is among the highest 
in  the  Nation.  App.  1246.  And  the  three-judge  court  noted  the  report

safety because  they  address  the problems  that  brought peo-ple to jail."  Tr. 1552-1553. 

Expert witnesses produced statistical evidence that prison populations  had  been  lowered  without  adversely  affecting 
public  safety  in  a  number  of  jurisdictions,  including  certain counties  in  California,  as  well  as  Wisconsin,  Illinois,  Texas, 
Colorado,  Montana,  Michigan,  Florida,  and  Canada.  Juris. App.  245a.

11 Philadelphia's experience in the early 1990's with a federal-court order 

mandating reductions in the prison population was less positive, and that 
history illustrates the undoubted need for caution in this area.  One con-
gressional witness testified that released prisoners committed 79 murders 
and multiple other offenses.  See Hearing on S. 3 et al. before the Senate 
Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  104th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  45  (1995)  (statement 
of Lynne Abraham, District Attorney of Philadelphia).  Lead counsel for 
the  plaintiff  class  in  that  case  responded  that  "[t]his  inflammatory  asser-
tion  has never  been documented."  Id.,  at 212 (statement of David  Richman).  The Philadelphia decree was also different from the order entered 
in this case.  Among other things, it "prohibited the City from admitting 
to its prisons any additional inmates, except for persons charged with, or 
convicted  of, murder, forcible rape, or  a  crime involving the use of  a gun 
or knife in the commission of an aggravated assault or robbery."  Harris 
v.  Reeves,  761  F.  Supp.  382,  384-385  (ED  Pa.  1991);  see  also  Crime  and 
Justice  Research  Institute,  J.  Goldkamp  &  M.  White,  Restoring  Account-
ability in Pretrial Release: The Philadelphia Pretrial Release Supervision 
Experiments  6-8  (1998).  The  difficulty  of  determining  the  precise  rele-
vance  of  Philadelphia's  experience  illustrates  why  appellate  courts  defer 
to  the  trier  of  fact.  The  three-judge  court  had  the  opportunity  to  hear 
testimony on  population-reduction measures  in  other jurisdictions  and to 
ask relevant questions of informed expert witnesses.

would  be  "substantially  offset,  and  perhaps  entirely  elimi-
nated,  by  the  public  safety  benefits"  of  a  reduction  in  over-
crowding.  Juris. App. 248a. 

The court found that various available methods of reducing 
overcrowding would have little or no impact on public safety. 
Expansion of good-time credits would allow the State to give 
early release to only those prisoners who pose the least risk 
of  reoffending.  Diverting  low-risk  offenders  to  community 
programs such as drug treatment, day reporting centers, and 
electronic monitoring would likewise lower the prison popu-
lation  without  releasing  violent  convicts.12  The  State  now 
sends large numbers of persons to prison for violating a tech-
nical  term  or  condition  of  their  parole,  and  it  could  reduce 
the  prison  population  by  punishing  technical  parole  viola-
tions  through  community-based  programs.  This  last  meas-
ure would be particularly beneficial as it would reduce crowd-
ing in the reception centers, which are especially hard hit by 
overcrowding.  See  supra,  at  521.  The  court's  order  took 
account  of  public  safety  concerns  by  giving  the  State  sub-
stantial  flexibility to  select  among these  and  other means  of 
reducing overcrowding. 

The State submitted a plan to reduce its prison population 
in accordance with the three-judge court's order, and it com-
plains that the three-judge court approved that plan without 
considering  whether  the  specific  measures  contained  within 
it  would  substantially  threaten  public  safety.  The  threejudge  court,  however,  left  the  choice  of  how  best  to  comply 
with its population limit to state prison officials.  The court 

12 Expanding such community-based measures may require  an expendi-
ture  of  resources  by  the  State  to  fund  new  programs  or  expand  existing 
ones.  The State complains that the order therefore requires it to "divert" 
savings that  will be achieved by reducing the prison  population  and that 
setting budgetary priorities in this manner is a "severe, unlawful intrusion 
on  the  State  authority."  Brief  for  Appellants  55.  This  argument  is  not 
convincing.  The  order  does  not  require  the  State  to  use  any  particular 
approach to reduce its prison population or allocate its resources.

was not required to second-guess the exercise of that discre-tion.  Courts  should  presume  that  state  officials  are  in  a 

better  position  to  gauge  how  best  to  preserve  public  safety and  balance  competing  correctional  and  law  enforcement 
concerns.  The  decision  to  leave  details  of  implementation to  the  State's  discretion  protected  public  safety  by  leav-
ing  sensitive  policy  decisions  to  responsible  and  competent state officials. 

During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact began to  implement  measures  to  reduce  the  prison  population. 
See  Supp.  Brief  for  Appellants  1.  These  measures  will shift  "thousands"  of  prisoners  from  the  state  prisons  to  the 
county  jails  by  "mak[ing]  certain  felonies  punishable  by  im-prisonment  in  county  jail"  and  "requir[ing]  that  individuals 
returned  to  custody  for  violating  their  conditions  of  parole `serve  any  custody  term  in  county  jail.' "  Ibid.  These  de-
velopments  support  the  three-judge  court's  conclusion  that the prison population can be reduced in a manner calculated 
to avoid an undue negative effect on public safety. 

III 
Establishing the population at which the State could begin to  provide  constitutionally  adequate  medical  and  mental 

health  care,  and  the  appropriate  timeframe  within  which to  achieve  the  necessary  reduction,  requires  a  degree  of 
judgment.  The  inquiry  involves  uncertain  predictions  re-garding  the  effects  of  population  reductions,  as  well  as  dif-
ficult  determinations  regarding  the  capacity  of  prison  offi-cials  to  provide  adequate  care  at  various  population  levels. 
Courts have  substantial  flexibility  when  making  these judg-ments.  " `Once invoked, "the scope of a district court's equi-
table  powers  .  .  .  is  broad,  for  breadth  and  flexibility  are inherent in equitable remedies." ' "

Opinion of the Court 
Nevertheless,  the  PLRA requires a  court to adopt  a rem-edy that is "narrowly tailored" to the constitutional violation 

and  that  gives  "substantial  weight"  to  public  safety.  18 U. S. C.  $ 3626(a).  When  a  court  is  imposing  a  population 
limit,  this  means  the  court  must  set the  limit  at the  highest population consistent with an efficacious remedy.  The court 
must  also  order  the  population  reduction  achieved  in  the shortest  period  of  time  reasonably  consistent  with  public 
safety.  A 

The  three-judge  court  concluded  that  the  population  of California's prisons should be capped at 137.5% of design ca-
pacity.  This conclusion is supported by the record.  Indeed, some  evidence  supported  a  limit  as  low  as  100%  of  design 
capacity.  The chief deputy secretary of Correctional Health-care Services for the California prisons testified that Califor-
nia's  prisons " `were not  designed and made no provision for any expansion of medical care space beyond the initial 100% 
of  capacity.' "  Juris.  App.  176a.  Other  evidence  supported a  limit  as  low  as  130%.  The  head  of  the  State's  Facilities 
Strike  Team  recommended  reducing  the  population  to  130% of  design  capacity  as  a  long-term  goal.  Id.,  at  179a-180a. 
A former head of correctional systems in Washington State, Maine,  and  Pennsylvania  testified  that  a  130%  limit  would 
" `give prison officials and staff the ability to provide the nec-essary  programs  and  services  for  California's  prisoners.' " 
Id., at 180a.  A former executive director of the Texas pris-ons  testified  that  a  limit  of  130%  was  " `realistic  and  appro-
priate' "  and  would  " `ensure  that  [California's]  prisons  are safe  and  provide  legally  required  services.' " 

Ibid.  And  a former acting secretary of the California prisons agreed with 

a  130%  limit  with  the  caveat  that  a  130%  limit  might  prove inadequate in some older facilities. 

Ibid. According  to  the  State,  this  testimony  expressed  the  wit-

nesses' policy preferences, rather than their views as to what would  cure  the  constitutional  violation.  Of  course,  courts 

540  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
must  not  confuse  professional  standards  with  constitutional requirements. 

Rhodes v.  Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 348, n. 13 
(1981).  But expert opinion may be relevant when determin-ing  what  is  obtainable  and  what  is  acceptable  in  corrections 

philosophy.  See  supra,  at  536-537.  Nothing  in  the  record indicates  that  the  experts  in  this  case  imposed  their  own 
policy  views  or  lost  sight  of  the  underlying  violations.  To 
the  contrary,  the  witnesses  testified  that  a  130%  population limit  would  allow  the  State  to  remedy  the  constitutionally 

inadequate  provision  of  medical  and  mental  health  care. When expert  opinion is  addressed  to the  question of  how  to 
remedy the relevant constitutional violations, as it was here, 
federal judges can give it considerable weight. 

The  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)  has  set  130%  as  a 
long-term goal for population levels in the federal prison sys-
tem.  Brief  for  Appellants  43-44.  The  State  suggests  the 
expert  witnesses  impermissibly  adopted  this  professional 
standard in their testimony.  But courts are not required to 
disregard  expert  opinion  solely  because  it  adopts or  accords 
with  professional  standards.  Professional  standards  may 
be  "helpful  and  relevant  with  respect  to  some  questions." 
Chapman, supra, at 348, n. 13.  The witnesses testified that 
a  limit  of  130%  was  necessary  to  remedy  the  constitutional 
violations, not that it should be adopted because it is a BOP 
standard.  If  anything,  the  fact  that  the  BOP  views  130% 
as a manageable population density bolsters the three-judge 
court's conclusion that a population limit of 130% would alle-
viate  the  pressures  associated  with  overcrowding  and  allow 
the State to begin to provide constitutionally adequate care. 

Although  the  three-judge  court  concluded  that  the  "evi-
dence  in  support  of  a  130%  limit  is  strong,"  it  found  that 
some upward adjustment was warranted in light of "the cau-
tion  and  restraint  required  by  the  PLRA."  Juris.  App. 
183a,  184a.  The  three-judge  court  noted  evidence  support-
ing a higher limit.  In particular, the State's Corrections In-
dependent Review Panel had found that 145% was the maxi-

Opinion of the Court 
mum  "operable  capacity"  of  California's  prisons,  id.,  at 181a-182a, although the relevance of that determination was 

undermined  by  the  fact  that  the  panel  had  not  considered the  need  to  provide  constitutionally  adequate  medical  and 
mental  health  care,  as  the  State  itself  concedes.  Brief  for Coleman  Appellees  45.  After  considering,  but  discounting, 
this  evidence,  the  three-judge  court  concluded  that  the  evi-dence  supported  a  limit  lower  than  145%,  but  higher  than 
130%.  It therefore imposed a limit of 137.5%. This  weighing  of  the  evidence  was  not  clearly  erroneous. 
The  adversary  system  afforded  the  court  an  opportunity  to weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.  The 
plaintiffs' evidentiary showing was intended to justify a limit of  130%,  and  the  State  made  no  attempt  to  show  that  any 
other number  would allow  for  a  remedy.  There  are  also  no scientific  tools  available  to  determine  the  precise  population 
reduction  necessary  to  remedy  a  constitutional  violation  of this sort.  The three-judge court made the most precise de-
termination  it  could  in  light  of  the  record  before  it.  The PLRA's  narrow  tailoring  requirement  is  satisfied  so  long  as 
these  equitable,  remedial  judgments  are  made  with  the  ob-jective  of  releasing  the  fewest  possible  prisoners  consistent 
with an efficacious remedy.  In light of substantial evidence supporting  an  even  more  drastic  remedy,  the  three-judge 
court  complied  with  the  requirement  of  the  PLRA  in  this case. 

B 
The  three-judge  court  ordered  the  State  to  achieve  this reduction  within  two  years.  At  trial  and  closing  argument 

before  the  three-judge  court,  the  State  did  not  argue  that reductions  should  occur  over  a  longer  period  of  time.  The 
State  later  submitted  a  plan  for  court  approval  that  would achieve  the  required  reduction  within  five  years,  and  that 
would reduce the prison population to 151% of design capac-ity  in  two  years.  The  State  represented  that  this  plan 
would "safely reach  a population  level  of 137.5% over  time." 

542  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
Juris.  App.  317a.  The  three-judge  court  rejected  this  plan because it did not comply with the deadline set by its order. 

The State first had notice  that it  would be required to re-duce its prison population in February 2009, when the threejudge  court  gave  notice  of  its  tentative  ruling  after  trial. The 2-year deadline, however, will not begin to run until this 
Court  issues  its  judgment.  When  that  happens,  the  State 
will  have  already  had  over  two  years  to  begin  complying with the order of the three-judge court.  The State has used 

the  time  productively.  At  oral  argument,  the  State  indi-cated  it  had  reduced  its prison  population  by  approximately 
9,000  persons  since  the  decision  of  the  three-judge  court. 
After oral argument, the State filed a supplemental brief in-
dicating  that  it  had  begun  to  implement  measures  to  shift 
" thousands" of additional  prisoners to county facilities. 
Supp. Brief for Appellants 1. 

Particularly  in  light  of  the  State's  failure  to  contest  the 
issue at trial, the three-judge court did not err when it estab-
lished  a  2-year  deadline  for  relief.  Plaintiffs  proposed  a  2-
year deadline, and the evidence at trial was intended to dem-
onstrate  the  feasibility  of  a  2-year  deadline.  See  Tr.  2979. 
Notably,  the  State  has  not  asked  this  Court  to  extend  the 
2-year deadline at this time. 

The three-judge court, however, retains the authority, and 
the responsibility, to make further amendments to the exist-
ing  order  or  any  modified  decree  it  may  enter  as  warranted 
by  the  exercise  of  its  sound  discretion.  "The  power  of  a 
court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive relief is longestablished, broad, and flexible."  New York State Assn. for 
Retarded  Children,  Inc.  v.  Carey,  706  F.  2d  956,  967  (CA2 
1983)  (Friendly,  J.).  A  court  that  invokes  equity's  power  to 
remedy a constitutional violation by an injunction mandating 
systemic  changes  to  an  institution  has  the  continuing  duty 
and responsibility to assess the efficacy and consequences of 
its  order.  Id.,  at  969-971.  Experience  may  teach  the  ne-
cessity  for  modification  or  amendment  of  an  earlier  decree.

Opinion of the Court 
To  that  end,  the  three-judge  court  must  remain  open  to  a showing or demonstration by either party that the injunction 

should  be  altered  to  ensure  that  the  rights  and  interests  of the parties are given all due and necessary protection. 

Proper  respect  for  the  State  and  for  its  governmental processes requires that the three-judge court exercise its ju-
risdiction  to  accord  the  State  considerable  latitude  to  find 
mechanisms  and  make  plans  to  correct  the  violations  in  a prompt  and  effective  way  consistent  with  public  safety.  In 

order  to  "give  substantial  weight  to  any  adverse  impact  on public  safety,"  18  U. S. C.  $ 3626(a)(1)(A),  the  three-judge 
court  must  give  due  deference  to  informed  opinions  as  to 
what  public  safety  requires,  including  the  considered  deter-
minations of state officials regarding the time in which a re-
duction  in  the  prison  population  can  be  achieved  consistent 
with  public  safety.  An  extension  of  time  may  allow  the 
State to consider changing political, economic, and other cir-
cumstances and to take advantage of opportunities for more 
effective  remedies  that  arise  as  the  Special  Master,  the  Re-
ceiver,  the  prison  system,  and  the  three-judge  court  itself 
evaluate the progress being made to correct unconstitutional 
conditions.  At  the  same  time,  both  the  three-judge  court 
and  state  officials  must  bear  in  mind  the  need  for  a  timely 
and efficacious remedy for the ongoing violation of prisoners' 
constitutional rights. 

The State may wish to move for modification of the threejudge  court's  order  to  extend  the  deadline  for  the  required 
reduction to five years from the entry of the judgment of this 
Court,  the  deadline  proposed  in  the  State's  first  populationreduction plan.  The three-judge court may grant such a re-
quest provided that the State  satisfies necessary and appro-
priate  preconditions  designed  to  ensure  that  measures  are 
taken  to  implement  the  plan  without  undue  delay.  Appro-
priate  preconditions  may  include  a  requirement  that  the 
State  demonstrate  that  it  has  the  authority  and  the  re-
sources  necessary  to  achieve  the  required  reduction  within 

544  BROWN  v.  PLATA 

Opinion of the Court 
a  5-year  period  and  to  meet  reasonable  interim  directives for  population  reduction.  The  three-judge  court  may  also 

condition an  extension  of time on  the  State's ability to meet interim benchmarks for improvement in provision of medical 
and mental health care. The three-judge court,  in its  discretion, may  also consider 
whether it is appropriate to order the State to begin without 
delay  to  develop  a  system  to  identify  prisoners  who  are  un-likely  to  reoffend  or  who  might  otherwise  be  candidates  for 

early  release.  Even  with  an  extension  of  time  to  construct new  facilities  and  implement  other  reforms,  it  may  become 
necessary  to  release  prisoners  to  comply  with  the  court's 
order.  To  do  so  safely,  the  State  should  devise  systems  to 
select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public safety. 
An extension of time may provide the State a greater oppor-
tunity to refine and elaborate those systems. 

The  State  has  already  made  significant  progress  toward 
reducing  its  prison  population,  including  reforms  that  will 
result  in  shifting  "thousands"  of  prisoners  to  county  jails. 
See  Supp.  Brief  for  Appellants  1.  As  the  State  makes  fur-
ther progress, the three-judge court should evaluate whether 
its  order  remains  appropriate.  If  significant  progress  is 
made toward remedying the underlying constitutional viola-
tions, that progress may demonstrate that further population 
reductions  are  not  necessary  or  are  less  urgent  than  pre-
viously believed.  Were the State to make this showing, the 
three-judge  court  in  the  exercise  of  its discretion  could  con-
sider  whether  it  is  appropriate  to  extend  or  modify  this 
timeline. 

Experience  with  the  three-judge  court's  order  may  also 
lead  the  State  to  suggest  other  modifications.  The  threejudge  court  should  give  any  such  requests  serious  consider-
ation.  The  three-judge  court  should  also  formulate  its 
orders to allow the State and its officials the authority neces-
sary  to  address  contingencies  that  may  arise  during  the  re-
medial process.

Appendix A to opinion of the Court 
These  observations  reflect  the  fact  that  the  three-judge court's  order,  like  all  continuing  equitable  decrees,  must  re-

main  open  to  appropriate  modification.  They  are  not  in-tended  to  cast  doubt  on  the  validity  of  the  basic  premise  of 
the existing order.  The medical and mental health care pro-vided  by  California's  prisons  falls  below  the  standard  of  de-
cency  that  inheres  in  the  Eighth  Amendment.  This  exten-sive  and  ongoing  constitutional  violation  requires  a  remedy, 
and  a  remedy  will  not  be  achieved  without  a  reduction  in overcrowding.  The  relief  ordered  by  the  three-judge  court 
is  required  by  the  Constitution  and  was  authorized  by  Con-gress  in  the  PLRA.  The  State  shall  implement  the  order 
without further delay. The judgment of the three-judge court is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

The

584  CHAMBER  OF  COMMERCE  OF  UNITED  STATES  OF 

AMERICA  v.  WHITING 

Syllabus 

The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal law. 
At its broadest, the Chamber's argument is that Congress intended the 
federal system to be exclusive.  But Arizona's procedures simply imple-
ment  the sanctions that Congress  expressly  allowed  the States  to pur-
sue through licensing laws.  Given that Congress specifically preserved 
such authority for the States, it stands to reason that Congress did not 
intend  to  prevent  the  States  from  using  appropriate  tools  to  exercise 
that authority. 

And here Arizona's  law closely tracks IRCA's provisions in all mate-
rial respects.  For example, it adopts the federal definition of who quali-
fies  as  an  "unauthorized  alien,"  compare  8  U. S. C.  $ 1324a(h)(3)  with 
Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 23-211(11);  provides  that  state  investigators 
must  verify  the  work  authorization  of  an  allegedly  unauthorized  alien 
with the Federal Government, making no independent determination of 
the matter, $ 23-212(B); and requires a state court to "consider only the 
federal government's determination," $ 23-212(H). 

The Chamber's more general contention that the Arizona law is pre-
empted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to strike in 
IRCA also fails.  The cases on which the Chamber relies in making this 
argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest, see, e. g., Buckman Co. v.  Plaintiffs' Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341.  Regulating in-state 
businesses through licensing laws is not such an area.  And those cases 
all concern state actions that directly interfered with the operation of a 
federal program, see, e. g., id., at 351.  There is no similar interference 
here. 

The  Chamber  asserts  that  employers  will  err  on  the  side  of  dis-
crimination  rather  than  risk  the  " `business  death  penalty' "  by  "hiring 
unauthorized  workers."  That  is  not  the  choice.  License  termination 
is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized workers, but 
is  triggered  only  by  far  more  egregious  violations.  And  because  the 
Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional violations, an employer 
acting  in  good  faith  need  not  fear  the  law's  sanctions.  Moreover, 
federal  and  state  antidiscrimination  laws  protect  against  employment 
discrimination  and  provide  employers  with  a  strong  incentive  not  to 
discriminate.  Employers  also  enjoy  safe  harbors  from  liability  when 
using E-Verify as required by the Arizona law.  The most rational path 
for employers is to obey both the law barring the employment of unau-
thorized  aliens  and  the  law  prohibiting  discrimination.  There  is  no 
reason  to  suppose  that  Arizona  employers  will  choose  not  to  do  so.

Syllabus 
Arizona's  requirement  that  employers  use  E-Verify  is  not  impliedly 
preempted.  The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no lan-
guage circumscribing state action.  It does, however, constrain federal 
action: Absent a prior violation of federal law, "the Secretary of Home-
land  Security  may  not  require  any  person  or  .  .  .  entity"  outside  the 
Federal  Government  "to  participate  in"  E-Verify.  IIRIRA  $$ 402(a), 
(e).  The  fact  that  the  Federal  Government  may  require  the  use  of  EVerify in only limited circumstances says nothing about what the States 
may do.  The Government recently argued just that in another case and 
approvingly referenced Arizona's law as an example of a permissible use 
of E-Verify when doing so. 

Moreover, Arizona's use of E-Verify does not conflict with the federal 
scheme.  The  state  law requires  no  more  than  that an  employer,  after 
hiring an employee, "verify the employment eligibility of the employee" 
through  E-Verify.  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 23-214(A).  And  the  conse-
quences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state and federal 
law--an  employer  forfeits  an  otherwise  available  rebuttable  presump-
tion of compliance with the law.  Pp. 607-609.

Opinion of the Court 

living within state borders who were not lawful residents of the  United  States.  For  example,  in  1971  California  passed 

a  law providing  that  "[n]o  employer shall  knowingly  employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United 
States  if  such  employment  would  have  an  adverse  effect  on lawful  resident  workers."  1971  Cal.  Stats.  ch.  1442,  $ 1(a). 
The  California  law  imposed  fines  ranging  from  $200  to  $500 for  each  violation  of  this  prohibition.  $ 1(b).  At  least  11 
other  States  enacted  provisions  during  that  same  time  pe-riod proscribing the employment of unauthorized aliens.

1 

We  first  addressed  the  interaction  of  federal  immigration 
law and state laws dealing with the employment of unauthor-ized aliens in 

De Canas, 424 U. S. 351.  In that case, we rec-
ognized that the "[p]ower to regulate immigration is unques-tionably  .  .  .  a  federal  power." 

Id.,  at  354.  At  the  same 
time,  however,  we  noted  that  the  "States  possess  broad  au-thority  under  their  police  powers  to  regulate  the  employ-

ment  relationship  to  protect  workers  within  the  State,"  id., 
at  356,  that  "prohibit[ing]  the  knowing  employment  . . . of  persons not entitled to lawful residence in the United States, 

let alone to work here, is certainly within the mainstream of [the  State's]  police  power," 

ibid.,  and  that  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment had "at best" expressed "a peripheral concern with [the]  employment  of  illegal  entrants"  at  that  point  in  time, 

id., at 360.  As a result, we declined to hold that a state law assessing  civil  fines  for  the  employment  of  unauthorized 
aliens was preempted by federal immigration law. 

Ten years after De Canas, Congress enacted the Immigra-tion Reform and Control Act (IRCA), 100 Stat. 3359.  IRCA 

makes  it  "unlawful  for  a  person  or  other  entity  .  .  .  to  hire,

or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States  an  alien  knowing  the  alien  is  an  unauthorized  alien." 

8  U. S. C.  $ 1324a(a)(1)(A).  IRCA  defines  an  "unauthorized alien"  as  an  alien  who  is  not  "lawfully  admitted  for  perma-
nent residence" or not otherwise authorized by the Attorney General to be employed in the United States.  $ 1324a(h)(3). 

To  facilitate  compliance  with  this  prohibition,  IRCA  re-
quires that employers review documents establishing an em-ployee's  eligibility  for  employment.  $ 1324a(b).  An  em-

ployer  can  confirm  an  employee's  authorization  to  work  by reviewing  the  employee's  United  States  passport,  resident 
alien  card,  alien  registration  card,  or  other  document  ap-
proved by the Attorney General; or by reviewing a combina-
tion  of other  documents  such  as a  driver's license  and social 
security  card.  $$ 1324a(b)(1)(B)-(D).  The  employer  must 
attest under penalty of perjury on Department of Homeland 
Security  Form  I-9  that  he  "has  verified  that  the  individual 
is not an unauthorized alien" by reviewing these documents. 

$ 1324a(b)(1)(A).  The  form  I-9  itself  "and  any  information 
contained  in  or  appended  to  [it]  .  .  .  may  not  be  used  for 
purposes  other  than  for  enforcement  of "  IRCA  and  other 
specified provisions of federal law.  $ 1324a(b)(5). 

Employers  that  violate  IRCA's  strictures  may  be  sub-
jected to both civil and criminal sanctions.  Immigration and 
Customs  Enforcement,  an  entity  within  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security,  is  authorized  to bring  charges  against  a 
noncompliant employer  under $ 1324a(e).  Depending on the 
circumstances of the violation, a civil fine ranging from $250 
to  $16,000  per  unauthorized  worker  may  be  imposed.  See 

$ 1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136 (2008).  Employers that 
engage  in  a  pattern  or  practice  of  violating  IRCA's  require-
ments  can  be  criminally  prosecuted,  fined,  and  imprisoned 
for  up  to  six  months.  $ 1324a(f )(1).  The  Act  also  imposes 
fines  for  engaging  in  "unfair  immigration-related  employ-
ment  practice[s]"  such  as  discriminating  on  the  basis  of  citi-
zenship or national origin.  $1324b(a)(1); see $1324b(g)(2)(B). 

590  CHAMBER  OF  COMMERCE  OF  UNITED  STATES  OF 

AMERICA  v.  WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 

Good-faith  compliance  with  IRCA's  I-9  document  review requirements  provides  an  employer  with  an  affirmative 

defense if charged with a $ 1324a violation.  $ 1324a(a)(3). IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat employ-
ment of unauthorized workers.  The Act expressly preempts "any  State  or  local  law  imposing  civil  or  criminal  sanctions 
(other  than  through  licensing  and  similar  laws)  upon  those 
who  employ,  or  recruit  or  refer  for  a  fee  for  employment, unauthorized  aliens."  $ 1324a(h)(2).  Under  that  provision, 

state  laws  imposing  civil  fines  for  the  employment  of  unau-thorized  workers  like  the  one  we  upheld  in 

De  Canas  are 
now expressly preempted. 

In 1996, in an attempt to improve IRCA's employment ver-
ification  system,  Congress  created  three  experimental  com-
plements  to  the  I-9  process  as  part  of  the  Illegal  Immigra-
tion  Reform  and  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  (IIRIRA), 
110  Stat.  3009-655,  note  following  8  U. S. C.  $ 1324a.  Ari-
zona Contractors Assn., Inc. v.  Candelaria, 534  F. Supp.  2d 
1036,  1042  (Ariz.  2008);  see  8  U. S. C.  $ 1324a(d).  Only  one 
of  those  programs--E-Verify--remains  in  operation  today. 
Originally known as the "Basic Pilot Program," E-Verify "is 
an  internet-based  system  that  allows  an  employer  to  verify 
an  employee's  work-authorization  status."  Chicanos  Por 
La Causa, Inc. v.  Napolitano, 558 F. 3d 856, 862 (CA9 2009). 
An employer submits a request to the E-Verify system based 
on  information  that  the  employee  provides  similar  to  that 
used  in  the  I-9  process.  In  response  to  that  request,  the 
employer  receives  either  a  confirmation  or  a  tentative  nonconfirmation  of  the  employee's  authorization  to  work.  An 
employee  may  challenge  a  nonconfirmation  report.  If  the 
employee  does  not  do  so,  or  if  his  challenge  is  unsuccessful, 
his employment  must be terminated or the Federal Govern-
ment must be informed.  See ibid. 

In the absence  of a  prior violation of certain  federal laws, 
IIRIRA  prohibits  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  from 
"requir[ing]  any  person  or  .  .  .  entity"  outside  the  Federal

Government  " to participate  in" the  E-Verify  program, $$ 402(a),  (e),  110  Stat.  3009-656  to  3009-658.  To  promote 

use  of  the  program,  however,  the  statute  provides  that  any employer that utilizes E-Verify "and obtains confirmation of 
identity  and  employment  eligibility  in  compliance  with  the terms  and  conditions  of  the  program . . . has established  a 
rebuttable presumption"  that it  has  not  violated IRCA's un-authorized  alien  employment  prohibition,  $ 402(b)(1), 

id.,  at 3009-656 to 3009-657. 

B 
Acting  against  this  statutory  and  historical  background, several States have recently enacted laws attempting to im-

pose  sanctions  for  the  employment  of  unauthorized  aliens through, among other things, "licensing and similar laws," 8 
U. S. C.  $ 1324a(h)(2).2  Arizona  is  one  of  them.  The  Legal Arizona  Workers  Act  of  2007  allows  Arizona  courts  to  sus-
pend  or  revoke  the  licenses  necessary  to  do  business  in  the State  if  an  employer  knowingly  or  intentionally  employs  an 
unauthorized alien.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 23-211, 23-212, 23-212.01 (West Supp. 2010) (citing 8 U. S. C. $ 1324a). 

Under  the  Arizona  law,  if  an  individual  files  a  complaint alleging  that  an  employer  has  hired  an  unauthorized  alien, 
the attorney general or the county attorney first verifies the employee's work authorization with the Federal Government 
pursuant  to  8  U. S. C.  $ 1373(c).  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 23- 212(B).  Section  1373(c)  provides  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  "shall  respond  to  an  inquiry  by  a"  State  "seeking  to verify  or  ascertain  the  citizenship  or  immigration  status  of 
any  individual  .  .  .  by  providing  the  requested  verification or  status  information."  The  Arizona  law  expressly  prohib-

its  state,  county,  or  local  officials  from  attempting  "to  inde-pendently  make  a  final  determination  on  whether  an  alien 

is  authorized  to  work  in  the  United  States."  Ariz.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. $ 23-212(B).  If  the  $ 1373(c)  inquiry  reveals  that 
a  worker  is  an  unauthorized  alien,  the  attorney  general or  the  county  attorney  must  notify  United  States  Immi-
gration  and  Customs  Enforcement  officials,  notify  local  law 
enforcement,  and  bring  an  action  against  the  employer. $$ 23-212(C)(1)-(3), (D). 

When  a  complaint  is  brought  against  an  employer  under Arizona  law,  "the  court  shall  consider  only  the  federal  gov-
ernment's  determination  pursuant  to"  8  U. S. C.  $ 1373(c) 
in  "determining  whether  an  employee  is  an  unauthorized 
alien."  $ 23-212(H).  Good-faith  compliance  with  the  fed-
eral I-9 process provides employers prosecuted by the State 
with an affirmative defense.  $ 23-212(J). 

A  first  instance  of  "knowingly  employ[ing]  an  unauthor-
ized alien" requires that the court order the employer to ter-
minate  the  employment  of  all  unauthorized  aliens  and  file 
quarterly reports on all new hires for a probationary period 
of  three  years.  $$ 23-212(A),  (F)(1)(a)-(b).  The  court  may 
also  "order  the  appropriate  agencies  to  suspend  all  licenses 
. . . that are held by the employer for [a period] not to exceed 
ten  business  days."  $ 23-212(F)(1)(d).  A  second  knowing 
violation  requires  that  the  adjudicating  court  "permanently 
revoke  all  licenses  that  are  held  by  the  employer  specific  to 
the  business  location  where  the  unauthorized  alien  per-
formed work."  $ 23-212(F)(2). 

For  a  first  intentional  violation,  the  court  must  order  the 
employer  to  terminate  the  employment  of  all  unauthorized 
aliens and file quarterly reports on all new hires for a proba-
tionary  period  of  five  years.  $$ 23-212.01(A),  (F)(1)(a)-(b). 
The  court  must  also  suspend  all  the  employer's  licenses  for 
a  minimum  of  10  days.  $ 23-212.01(F)(1)(c).  A  second  in-
tentional  violation  requires  the  permanent  revocation  of  all 
business licenses.  $ 23-212.01(F)(2). 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 582 (2011)  593 

Opinion of the Court 
With  respect  to  both  knowing  and  intentional  violations, a  violation  qualifies  as  a  "second  violation"  only  if  it  occurs 

at the same business location as the first violation, during the time  that  the  employer  is  already  on  probation  for  a  viola-
tion  at that  location.  $$ 23-212(F)(3)(a)-(b);  $$ 23-212.01(F) (3)(a)-(b). 

The Arizona law also requires that "every employer, after hiring  an  employee,  shall  verify  the  employment  eligibility 
of the employee" by using E-Verify.  $ 23-214(A).3  "[P]roof of  verifying  the  employment  authorization  of  an  employee 
through the e-verify program creates a rebuttable presump-tion  that  an  employer  did  not  knowingly  employ  an  unau-
thorized alien."  $ 23-212(I).

594  CHAMBER  OF  COMMERCE  OF  UNITED  STATES  OF 

AMERICA  v.  WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 

The  Chamber  argued  that  the  Arizona  law's  provisions allowing  the  suspension  and  revocation  of  business  licenses 

for  employing  unauthorized  aliens  were  both  expressly  and impliedly  preempted  by  federal  immigration  law,  and  that 
the mandatory use of E-Verify was impliedly preempted. The  District  Court  held  that  Arizona's  law  was  not  pre-
empted.  534 F. Supp. 2d 1036.  It found that  the plain lan-guage of IRCA's preemption clause did not preempt the Ari-
zona  law  because  the  state  law  does  no  more  than  impose licensing conditions  on  businesses  operating within the 
State.  Id.,  at  1045-1046.  With  respect  to  E-Verify,  the court  concluded  that  although  Congress  had  made  the  pro-
gram  voluntary  at  the  national  level,  it  had  expressed  no intent to prevent States from  mandating participation.  Id., 
at  1055-1057.  The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  District Court  in  all  respects,  holding  that  Arizona's  law  was  a  " `li-
censing  and  similar  law[ ]' "  falling  within  IRCA's  saving clause and that none of the state law's challenged provisions 
was  "expressly  or  impliedly  preempted  by  federal  policy." 558 F. 3d, at 860, 861, 866. 

We granted certiorari.  561 U. S. 1024 (2010). 

II 
The  Chamber  of  Commerce  argues  that  Arizona's  law is  expressly  preempted  by  IRCA's  text  and  impliedly  pre-

empted  because  it  conflicts  with  federal  law.  We  address each of the Chamber's arguments in turn. 

A 
When a federal law contains an express preemption clause, we "focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessar-

ily  contains  the  best  evidence  of  Congress'  preemptive  in-tent."  CSX  Transp.,  Inc.  v.  Easterwood,  507  U. S.  658,  664 
(1993). IRCA  expressly  preempts  States  from  imposing  "civil 
or  criminal  sanctions"  on  those  who  employ  unauthorized

Opinion of the Court 
aliens,  "other  than  through  licensing  and  similar  laws."  8 U. S. C. $ 1324a(h)(2).  The Arizona law, on its face, purports 

to  impose  sanctions  through  licensing  laws.  The  state  law authorizes  state  courts  to  suspend  or  revoke  an  employer's 
business licenses if that employer knowingly or intentionally employs an unauthorized alien.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 23- 
212(A)  and  (F);  $$ 23-212.01(A)  and  (F).  The  Arizona  law 
defines "license" as "any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration,  charter  or  similar  form  of  authorization  that 

is  required  by  law  and  that  is  issued  by  any  agency  for the  purposes  of  operating  a  business  in"  the  State.  $ 23- 
211(9)(a).  That  definition  largely  parrots  the  definition  of 
"license" that Congress codified in the Administrative Proce-
dure  Act.  See  5  U. S. C.  $ 551(8)  (" `license'  includes  the 
whole  or  a  part  of  an  agency  permit,  certificate,  approval, 
registration,  charter,  membership,  statutory  exemption  or 
other form of permission"). 

Apart  from  that  general  definition,  the  Arizona  law  spe-
cifically includes  within its  definition  of "license"  documents 
such  as  articles  of  incorporation,  certificates  of  partnership, 
and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact busi-
ness in the State.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 23-211(9).  These 
examples have clear counterparts in the APA definition just 
quoted.  See 5  U. S. C. $ 551(8)  (defining  "license"  as includ-
ing a "registration" or "charter"). 

A  license  is  "a  right  or  permission  granted  in  accordance 
with law . . . to engage in some business or occupation, to do 
some  act,  or  to  engage  in  some  transaction  which  but  for 
such  license  would  be  unlawful."  Webster's  Third  New  In-
ternational  Dictionary  1304  (2002).  Articles  of  incorpora-
tion  and  certificates  of  partnership  allow  the  formation  of 
legal entities and permit them as such to engage in business 
and  transactions  "which  but  for  such"  authorization  "would 
be unlawful."  Ibid.; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 10-302, 10- 
302(11) (West 2004) (articles of incorporation allow a corpora-
tion "to  carry out  its business and affairs"  and to "[c]onduct

its business"); see also $ 10-202(A)(3) (West Supp. 2010).  As 
for state-issued authorizations for foreign businesses to oper-
ate  within  a  State,  we  have  repeatedly  referred  to  those  as 
"licenses."  See,  e. g.,  Helicopteros  Nacionales  de  Colombia, S. A.  v.  Hall,  466  U. S.  408,  417  (1984);  G.  D.  Searle  & 
Co.  v.  Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 413, n. 8 (1982); Rosenberg Bros. & 
Co.  v.  Curtis  Brown  Co.,  260  U. S.  516,  518  (1923).  More-
over, even if a law regulating articles of incorporation, part-
nership  certificates,  and  the  like  is  not  itself  a  "licensing 
law,"  it  is  at  the  very  least  "similar"  to  a  licensing  law,  and 
therefore  comfortably  within  the  saving  clause.  8  U. S. C. 

$ 1324a(h)(2).5 

The Chamber and the United States as amicus argue that 
the  Arizona  law  is  not  a  "licensing"  law  because  it  operates 
only  to  suspend  and  revoke  licenses  rather  than  to  grant 
them.  Again,  this  construction  of  the  term  runs  contrary 
to  the  definition  that  Congress  itself  has  codified.  See 
5  U. S. C.  $ 551(9)  (" `licensing'  includes  agency  process  re-

specting  the  grant,  renewal,  denial,  revocation,  suspension, 
annulment,  withdrawal,  limitation,  amendment,  modifica-
tion,  or  conditioning  of  a  license"  (emphasis  added)).  It is  also  contrary  to  common  sense.  There  is  no  basis  in 

law,  fact,  or  logic  for  deeming  a  law  that  grants  licenses  a licensing law, but a law that suspends or revokes those very 
licenses something else altogether. 

The Chamber also submits that the manner in which Con-gress  amended  a  related  statute  when  enacting  IRCA  sup-

ports a narrow interpretation of the saving clause.  The Mi-grant  and  Seasonal  Agricultural  Worker  Protection  Act 
(AWPA),  29  U. S. C.  $ 1801  et  seq.,  requires  employers  to  se-
cure a registration certificate from the Department of Labor 
before  engaging  in  any  "farm  labor  contracting  activity." 

$ 1811(a).  Prior to IRCA, AWPA had contained its own pro-
hibition on hiring unauthorized workers, with accompanying 
adjudication  procedures.  See  $ 1813(a);  $ 1816(a)  (1982  ed.) 
(repealed  by  IRCA,  100  Stat.  3372); $$ 1851(a)-(b)  (1982 ed.) 
(amended  by  IRCA,  100  Stat.  3372).  When  Congress 
enacted  IRCA,  it  repealed  AWPA's  separate  unauthorized 
worker  prohibition  and  eliminated  the  associated  adjudica-
tion process.  Under the current state of the law, an AWPA 
certification may be denied based on a prior IRCA violation. 

$ 1813(a)(6) (2006 ed.).  And once obtained, that certification 
can  be  revoked  because  of  the  employment  of  an  unauthor-
ized  alien  only  following  a  finding  of  an  IRCA  violation. 
Ibid. 

The  Chamber  asserts  that  IRCA's  amendment  of  AWPA 
shows that Congress meant to allow state licensing sanctions 
only  after  a  federal  IRCA  adjudication,  just  as  adverse  ac-
tion  under  AWPA  can  now  be  taken  only  through  IRCA's 
procedures.  But the text of IRCA's saving clause says noth-
ing about state licensing sanctions being contingent on prior 
federal  adjudication,  or  indeed  about  state  licensing  proc-
esses at all.  The simple fact that federal law creates proce-
dures  for  federal  investigations  and  adjudications  culminat-

Opinion of the Court 

ing  in  federal  civil  or  criminal  sanctions  does  not  indicate that  Congress  intended  to  prevent  States  from  establishing 

their  own  procedures  for  imposing  their  own  sanctions through  licensing.  Were  AWPA  not  amended  to  conform 
with IRCA, two different federal agencies would be respon-sible for  administering  two  different unauthorized alien em-
ployment  laws.  The  conforming  amendments  eliminated 
that  potential  redundancy  and  centralized  federal  adjudica-tory  authority.  That  hardly  supports  a  conclusion  that  any 

state licensing programs must also be contingent on the cen-tral federal system. 

In  much  the  same  vein,  the  Chamber  argues  that  Con-
gress's  repeal  of  "AWPA's  separate  prohibition  concerning 
unauthorized  workers  belies  any  suggestion  that  IRCA 
meant  to  authorize  each  of  the  50  States  .  .  .  to  impose  its 
own separate prohibition," and that Congress instead wanted 
uniformity  in immigration law enforcement.  Brief  for Peti-
tioners  36.  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
gues  that  the  purpose  of  IRCA's  saving  clause  was  limited to  preserving  existing  state  farm  contractor  licensing  pro-

grams.  But here again no such limit is remotely discernible in the statutory text.  Absent any  textual basis, we are not 
inclined to limit so markedly the otherwise broad phrasing of the saving clause.  See 

United States v.  Shreveport Grain & Elevator  Co.,  287  U. S.  77,  83  (1932)  ("extrinsic  aids  to  con-

struction" may be used "to solve, but not to create an ambi-guity" (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)). 

The Chamber  argues that its textual and  structural argu-ments are bolstered by IRCA's legislative history.  We have 
already  concluded  that  Arizona's  law  falls  within  the  plain text of  IRCA's saving  clause.  And, as  we  have  said  before, 
Congress's  "authoritative  statement  is  the  statutory  text, not the legislative history." 

Exxon Mobil Corp. v.  Allapat-tah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see also Hoffman 

Plastic  Compounds,  Inc.  v.  NLRB,  535  U. S.  137,  149-150, n.  4  (2002).  Whatever  the  usefulness  of  relying  on  legisla-
tive  history  materials  in  general,  the  arguments  against doing so are particularly compelling here.  Beyond verbatim 
recitation  of  the  statutory  text,  all  of  the  legislative  history documents related to IRCA save  one fail to discuss the sav-
ing  clause  at  all.  The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Report on  the  Senate  version  of  the  law  does  not  comment  on  it. 
See  S.  Rep.  No.  99-132  (1985).  Only  one  of  the  four  House Reports  on  the  law  touches  on  the  licensing  exception,  see 
H. R.  Rep.  No.  99-682,  pt.  1,  p.  58  (1986),  and  we  have previously  dismissed  that  very  report  as  "a  rather  slender 
reed"  from  "one  House  of  a  politically  divided  Congress." Hoffman,  supra,  at  149-150,  n.  4.  And  the  Conference 
Committee  Report  does  not  discuss  the  scope  of  IRCA's preemption provision in any way.  See H. Conf. Rep. No. 99- 
1000 (1986).6

Opinion of the Court 
the  States.  The  principle  that  Congress  adopted  in  doing so  was  not  that  the  Federal  Government  can  impose  large 

sanctions,  and  the  States  only  small  ones.  IRCA  instead preserved  state  authority  over  a  particular  category  of 
sanctions--those  imposed  "through  licensing  and  similar laws." 

Of  course  Arizona  hopes  that  its  law  will  result  in  more effective enforcement  of the  prohibition on  employing unau-
thorized aliens.  But in preserving to the States the author-ity to impose sanctions through licensing laws, Congress did 
not intend to preserve only those state laws that would have no  effect.  The  balancing  process  that  culminated  in  IRCA 
resulted in a ban on hiring unauthorized aliens, and the state law here simply seeks to enforce that ban. 

Implied preemption analysis does not justify a "freewheel-ing judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension 
with  federal  objectives";  such  an  endeavor  "would  undercut the  principle  that  it  is  Congress  rather  than  the  courts  that 
pre-empts state law."  Gade v.  National Solid Wastes Man-agement Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 111 (1992) (K

Opinion of the Court 

A 
We  begin  again  with  the  relevant  text.  The  provision  of IIRIRA  setting  up  the  program  that  includes  E-Verify 

contains  no  language  circumscribing  state  action.  It  does, however,  constrain  federal  action:  Absent  a  prior  violation 
of federal law, "the Secretary of Homeland Security may not require  any  person  or  other  entity  [outside  of  the  Federal 
Government]  to  participate  in  a  pilot  program"  such  as  E-Verify.  IIRIRA  $ 402(a),  110  Stat.  3009-656.  That  provi-
sion  limits  what  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  may do--nothing more. 

The  Federal  Government  recently  argued  just  that,  and approvingly  referenced  Arizona's  E-Verify  law  when  doing 
so.  In  2008,  an  Executive  Order  mandated  that  executive agencies require federal contractors to use E-Verify as a con-
dition  of  receiving  a  federal  contract.  See  Exec.  Order No. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008).  When that order and 
its  implementing  regulation  were  challenged,  the  Govern-ment  pointed  to  Arizona's  E-Verify  mandate  as  an  example 
of  a  permissible  use  of  that  system:  "[T]he  State  of  Arizona has  required  all  public  and  private  employers  in  that  State 
to use E-Verify  . . . .   This is permissible because the State of Arizona is not the Secretary of Homeland Security."  De-
fendants'  Reply  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Their  Motion for  Summary  Judgment  in  No.  8:08-cv-03444  (D  Md.),  p.  7 
(emphasis  added), appeal  dism'd,  No.  09-2006  (CA4,  Dec.  14, 2009). 

Arizona's use of E-Verify does not conflict with the federal scheme.  The  Arizona  law  requires  that  "every  employer, 
after hiring an employee, shall verify the  employment  eligi-bility  of  the  employee"  through  E-Verify.  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat. 
Ann.  $ 23-214(A)  (West  Supp.  2010).  That  requirement  is entirely  consistent  with  the  federal  law.  And  the  conse-
quences of not using E-Verify under the Arizona law are the same as the consequences of not using the system under fed-
eral  law.  In  both  instances,  the  only  result  is  that  the  em-

Syllabus 

UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 
certiorari

648  UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 

Syllabus 

$ 3161(h)(1).  This latter list is followed by a sublist, each member (but 
one)  of  which  is  introduced  by  the  phrase  "delay  resulting  from  .  .  .  ." 
Ibid.  Those  words  are  followed  by  a  more  specific  description,  such 
as  "any  pretrial  motion"  from  its  "filing"  "through  the  conclusion  of 

the  hearing  on,  or  other  prompt  disposition  of,  such  motion." 

$ 3161(h)(1)(D).  The whole paragraph can be read as requiring the au-
tomatic exclusion of the members of that specific sublist, while referring 
to  those  members  in  general  as  "periods  of  delay"  and  as  causing  that 
delay, not because Congress intended the judge to determine causation, 
but because, in a close to definitional way, the words embody Congress' 
own view of the matter.  Thus, language alone cannot resolve the basic 
question presented.  Pp. 653-655. 

(b)  Several  considerations,  taken  together,  compel  the  conclusion 
that Congress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.  First, 
subparagraph  (D)  and  neighboring  subparagraphs  (F)  and  (H)  contain 
language  that  instructs  courts  to  measure  the  time  actually  consumed 
by  the  specified  pretrial  occurrence,  but  those  subparagraphs  do  not 
mention  the  date  on  which  the  trial  begins  or  was  expected  to  begin. 
Second,  during  the  37  years  since  Congress  enacted the  statute,  every 
other  Court  of  Appeals  has  rejected  the  Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation. 
Third, the Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation  would make  the subparagraph 
(D) exclusion  significantly  more difficult  to administer,  thereby hinder-
ing  the  Act's  efforts  to  secure  fair  and  efficient  trials.  Fourth,  the 
Court's  conclusion  is  reinforced  by  the  difficulty  of  squaring  the  Sixth 
Circuit's interpretation with the "automatic application" rule expressed 
in, e. g., Henderson v.  United States, 476 U. S. 321, 327.  Fifth, the legis-
lative  history  also  supports  the  Court's  conclusion.  Sixth,  because  all 
the  subparagraphs  but  one  under  paragraph  (1)  begin  with  the  phrase 
"delay  resulting  from,"  the  Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation  would  poten-
tially extend well beyond pretrial motions and encompass such matters 
as mental and physical competency examinations, interlocutory appeals, 
consideration  of  plea  agreements,  and  the  absence  of  essential  wit-
nesses.  Pp. 656-660. 

2.  The  Sixth  Circuit  also  misinterpreted  $ 3161(h)(1)(F),  which  ex-
cludes from the 70-day calculation "delay resulting from transportation 
of any defendant . . . to and  from places of examination . . .  ,  except that 
any  time  consumed  in  excess  of  ten  days  .  .  .  shall  be  presumed  to  be 
unreasonable."  The lower courts agreed  that a total of 20 transporta-
tion days had elapsed when Tinklenberg was evaluated for competency, 
and  that  because  the  Government  provided  no  justification,  all  days  in 
excess of the 10 days specified in the statute were unreasonable.  How-
ever, the Sixth Circuit exempted 8 weekend days and holidays from the 
count on the theory that subparagraph (F) incorporated Federal Rule of 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 647 (2011)  649 

Syllabus 
Criminal Procedure 45(a), which, at the time, excluded such days when 
computing any period specified in "rules" and "court order[s]" that was 
less than 11 days.  Thus, the Circuit considered only two transportation 
days excessive, and the parties concede that the eight extra days were 
enough  to  make  the  difference  between  compliance  with,  and  violation 
of, the Act. 

This Court exercises its discretion to consider the subsidiary subpara-
graph  (F)  question  because  doing  so  is  fairer  to  Tinklenberg,  who  has 
already  served  his  sentence.  In  the  Court's  view,  subparagraph  (F) 
does  not  incorporate  Rule  45.  The  Act  does  not  say  that  it  does  so, 
the Government gives no good reason for such a reading, and the Rule 
itself,  as  it  existed  at  the  relevant  time,  stated  it  applied  to  rules  and 
court orders, but said nothing about statutes.  The fact that Rule 45 is 
revised  from  time  to  time  also  argues  against  its  direct  application  to 
subparagraph (F) because such changes, likely reflecting considerations 
other than those related to the Act, may well leave courts treating simi-
lar  defendants  differently.  The  better  reading  includes  weekend  days 
and holidays in subparagraph (F)'s 10-day period under the common-law 
rule that such days are included when counting a statutory time period 
of  10  days  unless  a  statute  specifically  excludes  them.  Many  courts 
have treated statutory time periods this way, and Congress has tended 
specifically  to  exclude  weekend  days  and  holidays  from  statutory  time 
periods  of  10  days  when  it  intended  that  result.  Indeed,  Rule  45  has 
been recently modified to require a similar result.  Pp. 660-663. 

3.  Although  the  Sixth  Circuit's  interpretations  of  subparagraphs  (D) 
and  (F)  are  both  mistaken,  the  conclusions  the  court  drew  from  its 
interpretations  in  relevant  part  cancel  each  other  out,  such  that  the 
court's ultimate conclusion that Tinklenberg's trial failed to comply with 
the Act's deadline is correct.  P. 663. 

579 F. 3d 589, affirmed.

run.  His  trial  began  on  August  14,  2006,  287  days  later. Just  before  trial,  Tinklenberg  asked  the  District  Court  to 

dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial came too late,  violating  the  Speedy  Trial  Act's  70-day  requirement. 
The  District  Court  denied  the  motion  after  finding  that  218 of  the  287  days  fell  within  various  Speedy  Trial  Act  exclu-
sions,  leaving  69  nonexcludable  days,  thereby  making  the 
trial timely. On appeal the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court 

that many of the 287 days were excludable.  But it disagreed with  the  District  Court  about  the  excludability  of  time  re-
lated  to  three  pretrial  motions.  The  Government  filed  the 
first motion, an unopposed motion to conduct a video deposi-
tion  of  a  witness,  on  August  1,  2006;  the  District  Court  dis-
posed  of  the  motion  on  August  3,  2006.  The  Government 
filed the second motion, an unopposed motion to bring seized 
firearms into the courtroom as evidence at trial, on August 8, 
2006; the District Court disposed of the motion on August 10, 
2006.  Tinklenberg  filed  the  third  motion,  a  motion  to  dis-
miss  the  indictment  under  the  Speedy  Trial  Act,  on  Au-
gust  11,  2006;  the  District  Court  denied  that  motion  on 
August  14,  2006.  In  the  Sixth  Circuit's  view,  the  nine  days 
during  which  the  three  motions  were  pending  were  not 
excludable  because  the  motions  did  not  "actually  cause  a 
delay, or the expectation of delay, of trial."  579 F. 3d, at 598. 
Because these 9 days were sufficient to bring the number of 
nonexcludable  days  above  70,  the  Court  of  Appeals  found  a 
violation  of  the  Act.  And  given  the  fact  that  Tinklenberg 
had  already  served  his  prison  sentence,  it  ordered  the  Dis-
trict Court to dismiss the indictment with prejudice.

tency  examination,  id.,  at  597,  we  affirm  the  Court  of  Ap-peals' ultimate conclusion. 

II 

A 
In  relevant  part  the  Speedy  Trial  Act  sets  forth  a  basic rule: 

"In  any  case  in  which  a  plea  of  not  guilty  is  entered, the  trial  of  a  defendant  .  .  .  shall  commence  within  sev-
enty  days  from  [the  later  of  (1)]  the  filing  date  . . . of  the  information  or  indictment,  or . . .  [(2)]  the  date  the 
defendant  has  appeared  before  a  judicial  officer  of  the court in which such charge is pending . . . ."  $ 3161(c)(1) 
(2006 ed.). 
The  Act  then  says  that  the  "following  periods of  delay  shall be excluded in computing . . . the time within which the trial 

.  .  .  must  commence."  $ 3161(h)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III).  It lists seven such "periods of delay." 

It describes the first of these seven excludable periods as 

"(1)  Any  period  of  delay  resulting  from  other  pro-ceedings  concerning  the  defendant,  including  but  not 

limited to-- "(A) 

delay  resulting  from  any  proceeding  .  .  .  to  de-termine  the  mental  competency  or  physical  capacity  of 

the defendant; "(B)  delay  resulting  from  trial  with  respect  to  other 
charges . . . ;  "(C) 

delay  resulting  from  any  interlocutory  appeal; "(D)  delay  resulting  from  any  pretrial  motion,  from 

the  filing  of  the  motion  through  the  conclusion  of  the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion; 

"(E)  delay  resulting  from  any  proceeding  relating  to the  transfer  of  a  case  [or  defendant] . . .  from  another 
district . . . ;  "(F) 

delay  resulting  from  transportation  of  any  de-fendant  from  another  district,  or  to  and  from  places  of

examination or hospitalization, except that any time con-sumed  in  excess  of  ten  days . . . shall be  presumed  to 

be unreasonable; "(G)  delay  resulting  from  consideration  by  the  court 
of a proposed plea agreement . . . ;  "(H)  delay  reasonably  attributable  to  any  period,  not 
to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding con-cerning  the  defendant  is  actually  under  advisement  by 
the  court."  Ibid.  (2006  ed.  and  Supp.  III)  (emphasis added). 

B 
The  particular  provision  before  us,  subparagraph  (D),  ex-cludes  from  the  speedy  trial  period  "delay  resulting  from 

any  pretrial  motion,  from  the  filing  of  the  motion  through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition 
of, such  motion."  $ 3161(h)(1)(D).  The question  is whether this provision stops the speedy trial clock from running auto-
matically  upon  the  filing of  a pretrial  motion  irrespective  of whether the motion has any impact on when the trial begins. 
Unlike the Sixth Circuit, we believe the answer to this ques-tion is yes. 

We  begin  with  the  Act's  language.  The  Sixth  Circuit based  its  answer  primarily  upon  that  language.  It  argued 
that  the  phrase  "delay  resulting  from,"  read  most  naturally, requires  a  court  to  apply  the  exclusion  provision  only  to 
those "motion[s]" that "actually cause a delay, or the expecta-tion  of  a  delay,  of  trial."  579  F.  3d,  at  598.  We  agree  that 
such  a  reading  is  linguistically  reasonable,  but  the  Court  of Appeals wrote that there "is no conceivable way to read this 
language  other  than  to  require  a  delay  to  result  from  any pretrial  motion  before  excludable  time  occurs."  Ibid.  See 
also  ibid.  ("[T]he  statute  is  clear").  And  here  we  disagree. When  the  Court  of  Appeals  says  that  its  reading  is  the 
only way any reasonable person could read this language, it overstates  its  claim.  For  one  thing,  even  though  the  word 
"delay" ordinarily indicates a postponement, it need not inev-

Opinion of the Court 
itably  do  so.  Compare  American  Heritage  Dictionary  480 (4th ed. 2000) ("[t]o postpone until a later time" or "[t]o cause 

to  be  later  or  slower  than  expected  or  desired")  with  ibid. ("[t]he interval of time between two events").  In any event, 
terms  must  be  read  in  their  statutory  context  in  order  to determine  how  the  provision  in  question  should  be  applied 
in an individual case. 

Statutory  language  that  describes  a  particular  circum-stance,  for  example,  might  require  a  judge  to  examine  each 

individual  case  to  see  if  that  circumstance  is  present.  But, alternatively,  it  might  ask  a  judge  instead  to  look  at  more 
general  matters,  such  as  when  a  statute  requires a  judge  to 
increase  the  sentence  of  one  convicted  of  a  "crime  of  vio-
lence" without requiring the judge to determine whether the 
particular crime at issue in a particular  case was committed 
in  a violent manner.  See Taylor v.  United  States,  495 U. S. 
575, 602 (1990) ("crime of violence" characterizes the generic 
crime,  not  the  particular  act  committed).  Similarly  a  stat-
ute  that  forbids  the  importation  of  "wild  birds"  need  not 
require  a  court  to  decide  whether  a  particular  parrot  is, 
in fact, wild or domesticated.  It may intend to place the en-
tire  species  within  that  definition  without  investigation  of 
the  characteristics  of  an  individual  specimen.  See  United 
States  v.  Fifty-Three  (53)  Eclectus  Parrots,  685  F.  2d  1131, 
1137 (CA9 1982). 

More than that, statutory language can sometimes specify 
that  a  set  of  circumstances  exhibits  a  certain  characteristic 
virtually  as  a  matter  of  definition  and  irrespective  of  how  a 
court  may  view  it  in  a  particular  case.  A  statute  that  de-
scribes  "extortion"  as  a  "crime  of  violence"  makes  that  fact 
so by definition, without asking a court to second-guess Con-
gress  about  the  matter.  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)  (2006 
ed.)  (defining  "violent  felony"  to  include  extortion  for  pur-
poses of the Armed Career Criminal Act). 

The  statute  before  us,  though  more  complex,  can  be  read 
similarly.  The  pretrial  motion  subparagraph  falls  within  a 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 647 (2011)  655 

Opinion of the Court 
general set of provisions introduced by the phrase: "The fol-lowing  periods  of  delay  shall  be  excluded."  $ 3161(h)  (2006 

ed.,  Supp.  III).  That  phrase  is  then  followed  by  a  list  that includes "[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceed-
ings concerning the defendant, including . . . ."  $ 3161(h)(1). This  latter  list  is  followed  by  a  sublist,  each  member  (but 
one)  of  which  is  introduced  by  the  phrase  "delay  resulting 
from  .  .  .  ,"  ibid.  (2006  ed.  and  Supp.  III),  which  words  are followed  by  a  more  specific  description,  such  as  "any  pre-

trial motion" from its "filing" "through the conclusion of the hearing  on,  or  other  prompt  disposition  of,  such  motion." 

$ 3161(h)(1)(D)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III).  The  whole  paragraph 
can be read as requiring the automatic exclusion of the mem-
bers  of  that  specific  sublist,  while  referring  to  those  mem-
bers  in  general  as  "periods  of  delay"  and  as  causing  that 
delay, not because Congress intended the judge to determine 
causation,  but  because,  in  a  close  to  definitional  way,  the 
words embody Congress' own view of the matter. 

It is not farfetched to describe the members of the specific 
sublist in the statute before us in this definitional sense--as 
"periods of delay" or as bringing about delay.  After all, the 
exclusion of any of the  specific periods described always de-
lays  the  expiration  of  the  70-day  speedy  trial  deadline.  Or 
Congress might  have described  the  specific periods listed  in 
paragraph  (1)  as  "periods  of  delay"  and  "delay[s]  resulting 
from" simply because periods of the type described often do 
cause  a  delay  in  the  start  of  trial.  Both  explanations  show 
that,  linguistically  speaking,  one  can  read  the  statutory  ex-
clusion  as  automatically  applying  to  the  specific  periods  de-
scribed  without  leaving  to  the  district  court  the  task  of 
determining whether the period described would or did actu-
ally cause a postponement of the trial in the particular case. 
Thus,  language  alone  cannot  resolve  the  basic  question  pre-
sented  in  this  case.  But  when  read  in  context  and  in  light 
of the statute's structure and purpose, we think it clear that 
Congress  intended  subparagraph  (D)  to  apply  automatically. 

656  UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 

Opinion of the Court 

C 
We  now  turn  to  several  considerations,  which,  taken  to-
gether,  convince  us  that  the  subparagraphs  that  specifically 
list  common  pretrial  occurrences  apply  automatically  in  the 
way we  have just described.  First, subparagraph  (D) clari-
fies that the trial court should measure the period of exclud-
able delay for a pretrial motion "from the filing of the motion 
through  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing  on,  or  other  prompt 
disposition of, such motion," but nowhere does it mention the 
date  on  which  the  trial  begins  or  was  expected  to  begin. 

$ 3161(h)(1)(D)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III).  Thus,  it  is  best  read 
to  instruct  measurement  of  the  time  actually  consumed  by 
consideration of the pretrial motion.  Two other related subparagraphs  contain  clarifying  language  that  contemplates 
measurement of the time actually consumed by the specified 
pretrial  occurrence  without  regard to  the  commencement  of 
the  trial.  See  $ 3161(h)(1)(F)  ("[A]ny  time  consumed  in  ex-
cess  of  ten  days  from  the  date  an  order  of  removal  or  an 
order  directing  such  transportation,  and  the  defendant's  ar-
rival  at  the  destination  shall  be  presumed  to  be  unreason-
able"); $ 3161(h)(1)(H) ("delay reasonably attributable to any 
period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceed-
ing  concerning  the  defendant  is  actually  under  advisement 
by  the  court").  If  "delay"  truly  referred  to  the  postpone-
ment  of  trial,  then  presumably  those  subparagraphs  would 
instruct  that  excludable  periods  should  be  measured  from 
the date that trial was otherwise scheduled to begin. 

Second,  we  are  impressed  that  during  the  37  years  since 
Congress  enacted  the  Speedy  Trial  Act,  every  Court  of  Ap-
peals  has  considered  the  question  before  us  now,  and  every 
Court  of  Appeals,  implicitly  or  explicitly,  has  rejected  the 
interpretation  that  the  Sixth  Circuit  adopted  in  this  case.

1987)  (explicit),  abrogated  on  other  grounds  by  Bloate  v. 
United  States,  559  U. S.  196  (2010);  United  States  v.  Hood,

grounds by Henderson v.  United States, 476 U. S. 321 (1986);

v.  Stafford,  697  F.  2d 1368,  1371-1372  (CA11  1983) (explicit). 
This  unanimity  among  the  lower  courts  about  the  meaning 
of  a  statute  of  great  practical  administrative  importance  in 
the  daily  working  lives  of  busy  trial  judges  is  itself  entitled 
to strong consideration, particularly when those courts have 
maintained  that  interpretation  consistently  over  a  long  pe-
riod of time.   See  General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. 
Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 593-594 (2004). 

Third,  the  Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation  would  make  the 
subparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to ad-
minister.  And  in doing  so, it  would significantly hinder  the 
Speedy Trial Act's efforts to secure fair and efficient criminal 
trial  proceedings.  See  Zedner  v.  United  States,  547  U. S. 
489,  497  (2006)  (noting  that  the  Act's  exceptions  provide 
"necessary  flexibility");  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  93-1508,  p.  15  (1974) 
(the  Act  seeks  to  achieve  "efficiency  in  the  processing  of 
cases  which  is  commensurate  with  due  process");  S.  Rep. 
No. 93-1021, p. 21 (1974).  Trial judges may, for example, set 
trial  dates  beyond  70  days  in  light  of  other  commitments. 
And  in  doing  so,  a  trial  judge  may  well  be  aware,  based  on 
his  or  her  experience,  that  pretrial  motions  will  likely  con-
sume the extra time--even though the judge may know little 
about  which  specific  motions  will  be  filed,  when,  and  how 
many.  How  is  that  judge  to  apply  the  Sixth  Circuit's  ap-

658  UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 

Opinion of the Court 
proach,  particularly  when  several,  including  unanticipated, pretrial proceedings did consume the time in question? 

Moreover, what is to happen if several excludable and sev-eral  nonexcludable  potential  causes  of  delay  (

e. g.,  pretrial 
motions  to  take  depositions,  potential  scheduling  conflicts, various  health  examinations,  etc.)  coincide,  particularly  in 

multidefendant cases?  Can the judge, motion by motion, de-
cide which motions were responsible and which were not re-sponsible for postponing what otherwise might have been an 

earlier  trial  date?  And  how  is  a  defendant  or  his  attorney to predict whether or when a judge will later find a particu-
lar  motion  to  have  caused  a  postponement  of  trial?  And  if 
the matter is difficult to predict, how is the attorney to know 
when  or  whether  he  or  she  should  seek  further  postpone-
ment of the 70-day deadline? 

With  considerable  time  and  judicial  effort,  perhaps 
through  the  use  of  various  presumptions,  courts  could  find 
methods  for  overcoming  these  and  other  administrative  dif-
ficulties.  In some instances, the judge may know at the time 
of  filing  that  a  given  motion  is  easily  resolved  or  that  its 
complexity will almost certainly postpone the trial.  Judges 
could note on the record their predictions about whether the 
motion will postpone trial at the time that the motion is filed. 
Parties  could  also  stipulate  as  to  whether  a  given  motion 
would  be  excluded  from  the  speedy  trial  clock.  But  those 
theoretical  strategies  would  not  prevent  all  or  even  most 
mistakes,  needless  dismissals  of  indictments,  and  potential 
retrials  after  appeal--all  of  which  exact  a  toll  in  terms  of 
the fairness of and confidence in the criminal justice system. 
And  any  such  future  strategies  for  administering  the  Sixth 
Circuit's rule cannot provide a present justification for turn-
ing  the  federal  judicial  system  away  from  the  far  less 
obstacle-strewn path that the system has long traveled. 

Fourth,  we  are  reinforced  in  our  conclusion  by  the  diffi-
culty of squaring the Sixth Circuit's interpretation with this 
Court's  precedent.  In  Henderson  v.  United  States,  supra, 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 647 (2011)  659 

Opinion of the Court 
the  Court  rejected  the  contention  that  the  exclusion  provi-sion  for  pretrial  motions  governs  only  reasonable  delays. 

The  Court  there  concluded  (as  the  Court  of  Appeals  had held)  that  the  exclusion  "was  intended  to  be  automatic." 
Id.,  at  327  (quoting  United  States  v.  Henderson,  746  F.  2d 619, 622 (CA9 1984); internal quotation marks omitted).  See 
also Bloate, 559 U. S. 196 (holding based in part on the view 
that  the  exclusion  applies  "automatically"  to  the  specified period  of  delay). 

Henderson  did  not  consider  whether  a 
trial court must determine whether the pretrial motion actu-ally caused postponement of the trial in each individual case. 

But the Sixth Circuit's interpretation would nonetheless sig-
nificantly  limit  the  premise  of  "automatic  application"  upon 
which the case rests. 

Fifth,  for  those  who  find  legislative  history  useful,  it  is 
worthwhile  noting  (as  this  Court  noted  in  Henderson)  that 
the Senate Report concerning the reenactment of the provi-
sion  in  1979  described  it,  along  with  the  other  provisions  in 

$ 3161(h)(1), as referring to "specific and recurring periods of 
time  often  found  in  criminal  cases,"  and  characterized  them 
as "automatically excludable delay," S. Rep. No. 96-212, p. 9 
(1979).  See H. R. Rep. No. 93-1508, at 21 ("The time limits 
would  be  tolled  by  hearings,  proceedings  and  necessary 
delay  which  normally  occur  prior  to  the  trial  of  criminal 
cases"  (emphasis  added));  S.  Rep.  No.  93-1021,  at  21  ("[The 
Act]  has  carefully  constructed  exclusions  and  exceptions 
which  permit  normal  pre-trial  preparation  in  the  ordinary 
noncomplex  cases  which  represent  the  bulk  of  business  in 
the Federal courts").  But cf. id., at 35 (paragraph (h)(1) ex-
cludes  "[d]elays  caused  by  proceedings  relating  to  the  de-
fendant" (emphasis added)). 

Sixth,  because  all  the  subparagraphs  but  one  under  para-
graph  (1)  begin  with  the  phrase  "delay  resulting  from,"  the 
Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation  would  potentially  extend  well 
beyond  pretrial  motions  and  encompass  such  matters  as 
mental and physical competency examinations, interlocutory 

660  UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 

Opinion of the Court 
appeals,  consideration  of  plea  agreements,  and  the  absence of essential witnesses.  See $ 3161(h)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III); 

$ 3161(h)(3)(A)  (2006  ed.).  Given  the  administrative  com-plexity  the  causation  requirement  would  bring  about  in  all 
these  areas,  those  Circuits  that  have  considered  a  causation requirement in respect to these other matters have rejected 
it.  See, e. g.,  United  States  v.  Pete, 525  F. 3d  844,  852  (CA9 2008)  (interlocutory  appeal); 

United  States  v.  Miles,  290  F. 3d  1341,  1350  (CA11  2002)  (unavailability  of  essential  wit-

nesses);  United  States  v.  Robinson,  887  F.  2d  651,  656-657 (CA6  1989)  (trial  on  other  charges).  That  further  complex-
ity,  along  with  these  lower  court  holdings,  reinforce  our conclusion. 

We  consequently  disagree  with  the  Sixth  Circuit  that  the Act's  exclusion  requires  a  court  to  find  that  the  event  the 
exclusion specifically describes, here the filing of the pretrial motion,  actually  caused  or  was  expected  to  cause  delay  of  a 
trial.  We  hold  that  the  Act  contains  no  such  requirement. 

III 
Tinklenberg also argues that the Sixth Circuit wrongly in-terpreted a different exclusion provision, this time the provi-

sion excluding 

"delay  resulting  from  transportation  of  any  defendant from another district, or to and from places of examina-

tion  or  hospitalization,  except  that  any  time  consumed 
in excess of ten days  from the date an order of removal or  an  order  directing  such  transportation,  and  the  de-

fendant's arrival at the destination shall be presumed to 
be  unreasonable."  $ 3161(h)(1)(F)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III) (emphasis added). 

The District Court granted Tinklenberg's request for a com-petency  evaluation,  and  he  was  transported  to  a  medical  fa-
cility for examination.  The lower courts agreed that a total 

Cite as: 563 U. S. 647 (2011)  661 

Opinion of the Court 
of 20 transportation days elapsed and that since the Govern-
ment  provided  no  justification,  all  days  in  excess  of  the  10 
days  specified  in  the  statute  were  unreasonable.  But  in 
counting  those  excess  days,  the  court  exempted  weekend 
days  and  holidays.  Since  Veterans  Day,  Thanksgiving  Day, 
and  three  weekends  all  fell  within  the  20-day  period,  only  2 
days,  not  10  days,  were  considered  excessive,  during  which 
the 70-day Speedy Trial Act clock continued to tick. 

Tinklenberg  argues  that  subparagraph  (F)  does  not  ex-
empt  weekend  days  and  holidays;  hence  the  court  should 
have  considered  10,  not  2,  days  to  be  excessive.  And  the 
parties  concede  that  those  eight  extra  ticking  days  are 
enough to make the difference between compliance with, and 
violation of, the Act. 

As  the  Solicitor  General  notes,  we  may  consider,  or  "de-
cline to entertain," alternative grounds for affirmance.  See 
United  States  v.  Nobles,  422  U. S.  225,  242,  n.  16  (1975).  In 
this  case,  we  believe  it  treats  Tinklenberg,  who  has  already 
served  his  sentence,  more  fairly  to  consider  the  alternative 
ground and thereby more fully to dispose of the case. 

The  Sixth  Circuit  exempted  weekend  days  and  holidays 
because it believed that subparagraph (F) incorporated Fed-
eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a).  At the relevant time, 
that Rule excluded weekend days and holidays when comput-
ing  any  period  of  time  specified  in  the  "rules,"  in  "any  local 
rule,"  or  in  "any  court  order"  that  was  less  than  11  days. 
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(a) (2005).  But in our view subpar-
agraph (F) does not incorporate Rule 45.  The Act does not 
say  that  it  incorporates  Rule  45.  The  Government  has 
given  us  no  good  reason  for  reading  it  as  incorporating  the 
Rule.  And the Rule itself, as it existed at the relevant time, 
said  that  it  applied  to  "rules"  and  to  "orders,"  but  it  said 
nothing  about  statutes.  Other  things  being  equal,  the  fact 
that Rule 45 is revised from time to time also argues against 
its  direct  application  to  subparagraph  (F).  That  is  because 

662  UNITED  STATES  v.  TINKLENBERG 

Opinion of the Court 
those  changes,  likely  reflecting  considerations  other  than those related to the Speedy Trial Act, may well leave courts 

treating similar defendants differently. Without  relying  upon  a  cross-reference  to  Rule  45,  we 
believe the better reading of subparagraph (F) would include weekend days and holidays in its 10-day time period.  Under 
the  common-law  rule,  weekend  days  and  holidays  are  in-
cluded  when  counting  a  statutory  time  period  of  10  days unless  the  statute  specifically  excludes  them.  See  74  Am. 

Jur.  2d,  Time  $ 22,  p.  589  (2001)  (in  calculating  time  periods expressed in statutes, "when the time stipulated must neces-
sarily  include  one  or  more  Saturdays,  Sundays,  or  holidays, 
those days will not be excluded, in the absence of an express 
proviso  for  their  exclusion").  Many  courts  have  treated 
statutory  time  periods  this  way.  See,  e. g.,  Howeisen  v. 
Chapman,  195  Ind.  381,  383-384,  145  N.  E.  487,  488  (1924); 
American Tobacco Co. v.  Strickling, 88 Md. 500, 508-511, 41 
A.  1083,  1086  (1898).  And  Congress  has  tended  specifically 
to  exclude  weekend  days  and  holidays  from  statutory  time 
periods  of  10  days  when  it  intended  that  result.  Compare 
18  U. S. C.  $ 3142(d)(2)  (permitting  the  temporary  detention 
of certain defendants "for a period of not more than ten days, 
excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and  holidays")  and  5  U. S. C. 

$ 552a(d)(2)(A)  (requiring  an  agency  to  acknowledge  receipt 
of  a  request  to  amend  agency  records  within  "10  days  (ex-
cluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)") with 
18 U. S. C. $ 2518(9) (establishing a 10-day period for disclos-
ing  applications  for  and  court  orders  authorizing  wiretaps 
without  specifically  excluding  weekends  and  holidays)  and 

$ 4244(a) (providing a 10-day period after conviction for filing 
a  motion  to  request  mental  health  treatment  without  spe-
cifically excluding weekends and holidays).  Indeed, Rule 45 
has  been  recently  modified  so  that  now  (though  not  at  the 
time  of  Tinklenberg's  proceedings)  it  requires  a  similar  re-

cer where  the defendant  did not think specifically  about any particular 
communication or its recipient.  Pp. 672-675. 

(c)  To determine what the Government must prove in such instances, 
the Court looks to the dictionary definition of the statutory word "pre-
vent,"  which  means  rendering  an  "intended,"  "possible,"  or  "likely" 
event  impractical  or  impossible  by  anticipatory  action.  No  one  sug-
gests that the word "intended" sets forth the appropriate standard here. 
The Government and the Eleventh Circuit would rest their standard on 
the word "possible."  But that standard would eliminate the independ-
ent  force  of  the  statutory  "federal  officer"  requirement,  and  would  ex-
tend the statute beyond its intended, basically federal, scope.  Fashion-
ing a standard based on the word "likely" is consistent with the statute's 
language and objectives.  Thus, where the defendant kills a person with 
an intent  to prevent communication  with law enforcement officers gen-
erally,  that  intent  includes  an  intent  to  prevent  communications  with

panied by petitioner James Alford, a Deschutes County dep-uty  sheriff,  went  to  S.  G.'s  elementary  school  and  inter-

viewed  her  about  the  allegations.  Camreta  and  Alford  did not  have  a  warrant,  nor  had  they  obtained  parental  consent 
to conduct the interview.  Although S. G. at first denied that her  father  had  molested  her,  she  eventually  stated  that  she 
had  been  abused.  Greene  was  indicted  and  stood  trial  for sexually abusing  S. G., but the jury  failed to reach a verdict 
and the charges were later dismissed. Respondent  Sarah  Greene,  S.  G.'s  mother,  subsequently 
sued  Camreta  and  Alford  on  S.  G.'s  behalf 1  for  damages 
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, which authorizes suits against state officials  for violations  of constitutional rights.  S. G. alleged 

that  the  officials'  in-school  interview  had  breached  the Fourth Amendment's proscription on unreasonable seizures.

The  District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  Cam-reta and Alford, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court 

of  Appeals  first  ruled  that  the  interview  violated  S.  G.'s 
rights because Camreta and Alford had "seize[d] and interro-gate[d] S. G. in  the  absence  of a warrant,  a  court order, exi-

gent  circumstances,  or  parental  consent."  588  F.  3d  1011, 1030  (2009)  (footnote  omitted).  But  the  court  further  held 
that  the  officials  were  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  from damages  liability  because  no  clearly  established  law  had 
warned  them  of  the  illegality  of  their  conduct.  Id.,

an  unreviewable  decision  "from  spawning  any  legal  conse-quences," so that no party is harmed by what we have called

732  ASHCROFT  v.  al-KIDD 

Syllabus 
Court  of  Appeals  was  mistaken  in  believing  that  Edmond  established 
that " `programmatic purpose' is relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis 
of  programs  of  seizures  without  probable  cause."  580  F.  3d  949,  968. 
It  was  not  the  absence  of  probable  cause  that  triggered  Edmond's 
invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the checkpoints' failure to be based on 
"individualized suspicion."  531 U. S., at 47.  Here a neutral Magistrate 
Judge  issued  a  warrant  authorizing  al-Kidd's  arrest,  and  the  affidavit 
accompanying  the  warrant  application  gave  individualized  reasons  to 
believe  that  he  was  a  material  witness  who  would  soon  disappear.  A 
warrant  based  on individualized  suspicion  grants  more  protection  than 
existed  in  most  of  this  Court's  cases  eschewing  inquiries  into  intent, 
e. g., Whren v.  United States, 517 U. S.  806, 813, and Terry  v.  Ohio, 392 
U. S. 1, 21-22.  Al-Kidd's contrary, narrow reading of those cases is re-
jected.  Because  he  concedes  that  individualized  suspicion  supported 
the issuance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert 
that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pre-
text; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here.  Pp. 735-740. 

2.  Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is entitled 
to qualified immunity.  A Government official's conduct violates clearly 
established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, "[t]he con-
tours  of  [a]  right  [are]  sufficiently  clear"  that  every  "reasonable  official 
would  have  understood  that  what  he  is  doing  violates  that  right." 
Anderson v.  Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640.  Here, the asserted constitu-
tional  right  falls  far  short  of  that  threshold.  At  the  time  of  al-Kidd's 
arrest,  not  a  single  judicial  opinion  had  held  that  pretext  could  render 
an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant 
unconstitutional.  The  Ninth  Circuit's  reliance  on  a  District  Court's 
footnoted  dictum,  irrelevant  cases  from  this  Court,  and  the  Fourth 
Amendment's  broad  purposes  and  history  is  rejected.  Because  Ash-
croft  did  not  violate  clearly  established  law,  the  question  whether  he 
enjoys absolute immunity need not be addressed.  Pp. 741-743.

734  ASHCROFT  v.  al-KIDD 

Opinion of the Court 
Because  this  case  arises  from  a  motion  to  dismiss,  we  ac-
cept  as  true  the  factual  allegations  in  Abdullah  al-Kidd's 
complaint.  The  complaint  alleges  that,  in  the  aftermath  of 
the September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney General 
John  Ashcroft  authorized  federal  prosecutors  and  law  en-
forcement officials to use the material-witness statute to de-
tain  individuals  with  suspected  ties  to  terrorist  organiza-
tions.  It is  alleged  that  federal officials  had  no  intention  of 
calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that they 
were  detained,  at  Ashcroft's  direction,  because  federal  offi-
cials  suspected  them  of  supporting  terrorism  but  lacked 
sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime. 

It  is  alleged  that  this  pretextual  detention  policy  led 
to  the  material-witness  arrest  of  al-Kidd,  a  native-born 
United  States  citizen.  FBI  agents  apprehended  him  in 
March  2003  as  he  checked  in  for  a  flight  to  Saudi  Arabia. 
Two days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magistrate 
Judge  that,  if  al-Kidd  boarded  his  flight,  they  believed 
information "crucial" to the prosecution of Sami Omar 
al-Hussayen  would  be  lost.  App.  64.  Al-Kidd  remained  in 
federal  custody  for  16  days  and  on  supervised  release  until 
al-Hussayen's  trial  concluded  14  months  later.  Prosecutors 
never called him as a witness. 

In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens action, see Bivens 
v.  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), 
to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcrof t's alleged 
policy;  he  also  asserted  several  other  claims  not  relevant 
here  against  Ashcroft  and  others.  Ashcroft  filed  a  motion 
to  dismiss  based  on  absolute  and  qualified  immunity,  which 
the  District  Court  denied.  A  divided  panel  of  the  United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, hold-
ing that the Fourth Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests 
absent  probable  cause  of  criminal  wrongdoing,  and  that 
Ashcroft  could  not  claim  qualified  or  absolute  immunity.

Judge Bea dissented, id., at 981, and eight judges dissented from  the  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc,  see  598  F.  3d  1129,

II 
Qualified  immunity  shields  federal and state  officials  from money  damages  unless  a  plaintiff  pleads  facts  showing 

(1)  that  the  official  violated  a  statutory  or  constitutional right,  and (2)  that the  right was "clearly established"  at the 
time  of  the  challenged  conduct.  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457 U. S.  800,  818  (1982).  We  recently  reaffirmed  that  lower 
courts  have  discretion  to  decide  which  of  the  two  prongs  of qualified-immunity  analysis  to  tackle  first.  See  Pearson  v. 
Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009). Courts should think carefully before expending "scarce ju-
dicial  resources"  to  resolve  difficult  and  novel  questions  of constitutional  or  statutory  interpretation  that  will  "have  no 
effect  on  the  outcome  of  the  case."  Id.,  at  236-237;  see  id., at 237-242.  When, however, a court of appeals does address 
both  prongs  of  qualified-immunity  analysis,  we  have  discre-tion  to correct  its  errors at  each  step.  Although not  neces-
sary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so ensures that courts do not insulate constitutional decisions at the frontiers 
of  the  law  from  our  review  or  inadvertently  undermine  the values qualified immunity seeks to promote.  The former oc-
curs  when  the  constitutional-law  question  is  wrongly  de-cided; the latter when what is not clearly established is held 
to be so.  In this case, the Court of Appeals' analysis at both steps of the qualified-immunity inquiry needs correction. 

A 
The Fourth Amendment protects "[t]he right of the people to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and  effects, 

against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures."  An  arrest,  of course, qualifies as a "seizure" of a "person" under this provi-

sion,  Dunaway  v.  New  York,  442  U. S.  200,  207-208  (1979), 
and  so  must  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  AlKidd  does  not  assert  that  Government  officials  would  have 
acted unreasonably if they had used a material-witness war-
rant to arrest him for the purpose of securing his testimony 
for  trial.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  16-17;  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg. 
20-22.  He  contests,  however  (and  the  Court  of  Appeals 
here  rejected),  the  reasonableness  of  using  the  warrant  to 
detain him as a suspected criminal. 

Fourth  Amendment  reasonableness  "is  predominantly  an 
objective  inquiry."  Indianapolis  v.  Edmond,  531  U. S.  32, 
47  (2000).  We  ask  whether  "the  circumstances,  viewed  ob-
jectively,  justify  [the  challenged]  action."  Scott  v.  United 
States,  436  U. S.  128,  138  (1978).  If  so,  that  action  was  rea-
sonable "whatever the subjective intent" motivating the rele-
vant  officials.  Whren  v.  United  States,  517  U. S.  806,  814 
(1996).  This  approach  recognizes  that  the  Fourth  Amend-
ment  regulates  conduct  rather  than  thoughts,  Bond  v. 
United States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000); and it promotes 
evenhanded,  uniform  enforcement  of  the  law,  Devenpeck  v. 
Alford, 543 U. S. 146, 153-154 (2004). 

Two  "limited  exception[s]"  to  this  rule  are  our  specialneeds  and  administrative-search  cases,  where  "actual  moti-
vations" do matter.  United States v.  Knights, 534 U. S. 112, 
122  (2001)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  A  judicial 
warrant and probable cause are not needed where the search 
or  seizure  is  justified  by  "special  needs,  beyond  the  normal 
need  for  law  enforcement,"  such  as  the  need  to  deter  drug 
use  in  public  schools,  Vernonia  School  Dist.  47J  v.  Acton, 

515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995)  (internal quotation marks  omitted),

compliance with a housing code, Camara v.  Municipal Court 
of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 535-538

the  investigation  for  which  the  administrative  inspection  is 
justified.  See Whren, supra, at 811-812.  The Government seeks  to  justify  the  present  arrest  on  the  basis  of  a  prop-

erly  issued  judicial  warrant--so  that  the  special-needs  and administrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a pur-
pose inquiry here. 

Apart  from  those  cases,  we  have  almost  uniformly  re-
jected  invitations  to probe  subjective  intent.  See Brigham 
City v.  Stuart, 547  U. S. 398, 404  (2006).  There  is  one cate-
gory  of  exception,  upon  which  the  Court  of  Appeals  princi-
pally  relied.  In  Edmond,  supra,  we  held  that  the  Fourth 
Amendment  could  not  condone  suspicionless  vehicle  check-
points  set  up  for  the  purpose  of  detecting  illegal  narcotics. 
Although  we  had  previously  approved  vehicle  checkpoints 
set  up  for  the  purpose  of  keeping  off  the  road  unlicensed 
drivers,  Delaware  v.  Prouse,  440  U. S.  648,  663  (1979),  or 
alcohol-impaired  drivers,  Michigan  Dept.  of  State  Police  v. 
Sitz,  496  U. S.  444  (1990);  and  for  the  purpose  of  interdict-
ing  those  who  illegally  cross  the  border,  United  States  v. 
Martinez-Fuerte,  428  U. S.  543  (1976);  we  found  the  drugdetection  purpose  in  Edmond  invalidating  because  it  was 
"ultimately  indistinguishable  from  the  general  interest  in 
crime  control,"  531  U. S.,  at  44.  In  the  Court  of  Appeals' 
view,  Edmond  established  that  " `programmatic  purpose'  is 
relevant  to  Fourth  Amendment  analysis  of  programs  of  sei-
zures without probable cause."  580 F. 3d, at 968. 

That  was  mistaken.  It  was  not  the  absence  of  probable 
cause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in Ed-
mond.  To  the  contrary,  Edmond  explicitly  said  that  it 
would  approve  checkpoint  stops  for  "general  crime  control

purposes"  that  were  based  upon  merely  "some  quantum  of individualized  suspicion."  531  U. S.,  at  47.  Purpose  was 

relevant  in  Edmond  because  "programmatic  purposes  may be relevant  to the  validity  of Fourth Amendment  intrusions 
undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without individu-
alized suspicion," id., at 45-46 (emphasis added).1 Needless to say, warrantless, "suspicionless intrusions pur-

suant to a general scheme,"  id., at 47,  are far removed  from the facts of this case.  A warrant issued by a neutral Magis-
trate  Judge  authorized  al-Kidd's  arrest.  The  affidavit  ac-companying  the  warrant  application  (as  al-Kidd  concedes) 
gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness and that he would soon disappear.  The existence of 
a  judicial  warrant  based  on  individualized  suspicion  takes this  case  outside  the  domain  of  not  only  our  special-needs 
and administrative-search cases, but of Edmond as well. A warrant based on individualized suspicion 

2 in fact grants 

more protection against the malevolent and the incompetent than  existed  in  most  of  our  cases  eschewing  inquiries  into 

intent.  In  Whren,  supra,  at  813,  and  Devenpeck,  supra,  at 153,  we  declined  to  probe  the  motives  behind  seizures  sup-
ported by probable cause but lacking a warrant approved by a  detached  magistrate.

(1968),  and  Knights,  534  U. S.,  at  121-122,  applied  an  objec-tive  standard  to  warrantless  searches  justified  by  a  lesser 

showing of reasonable suspicion.  We review even some sus-picionless searches for objective reasonableness.  See 

Bond, 
529 U. S., at 335-336,  338, n. 2.  If concerns about  improper motives  and  pretext  do  not  justify  subjective  inquiries  in 

those less protective contexts, we see no reason to adopt that 
inquiry here. Al-Kidd would read our cases more narrowly.  He asserts 

that Whren establishes that we ignore subjective intent only when there exists "probable cause to believe that a violation 
of  law  has  occurred,"  517  U. S.,  at  811--which  was  not  the 
case  here.  That  is  a  distortion  of  Whren.  Our  unanimous 
opinion  held  that  we  would  not  look  behind  an  objectively 
reasonable  traffic  stop  to determine  whether  racial  profiling 
or a desire to investigate other potential crimes was the real 
motive.  See id., at 810, 813.  In the  course  of our  analysis, 
we  dismissed  Whren's  reliance  on  our  inventory-search  and 
administrative-inspection  cases  by  explaining  that  those 
cases  do  not  "endors[e]  the  principle  that  ulterior  motives 
can  invalidate  police  conduct  that  is  justifiable  on  the  basis 
of  probable  cause  to  believe  that  a  violation  of  law  has  oc-
curred," id., at 811.  But to say that ulterior motives do not 
invalidate  a  search  that  is  legitimate  because  of  probable 
cause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it does 
invalidate all searches that  are  legitimate for other  reasons. 

"[O]nly  an  undiscerning  reader,"  ibid.,  would  think  other-
wise.  We referred to probable cause to believe that a viola-
tion  of  law  had  occurred  because  that  was  the  legitimating 
factor  in  the  case  at  hand.  But  the  analysis  of  our  opinion 
swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive generally.  See 
id.,  at  812-815.  We  remarked  that  our  special-needs  and 
administrative-inspection  cases  are  unusual in  their  concern 
for  pretext,  and  do  nothing  more  than  "explain  that  the 
exemption  from  the  need  for  probable  cause  (and  warrant), 
which is accorded to searches made for the purpose of inven-

tory or administrative regulation, is not accorded to searches that are not made for those purposes," id., at 811-812.  And 

our  opinion  emphasized  that  we  had  at  that  time  (prior  to Edmond)  rejected  every  request  to  examine  subjective  in-
tent outside the narrow context of special needs and adminis-trative  inspections.  See  517  U. S.,  at  812.  Thus,  al-Kidd's 
approach  adds  an  "only"  to  a  sentence  plucked  from  the 
Whren  opinion,  and  then  elevates  that  sentence  (as  so  re-vised)  over  the  remainder  of  the  opinion,  and  over  the  con-

sistent holdings of our other cases. Because  al-Kidd  concedes  that  individualized  suspicion 
supported  the  issuance  of  the  material-witness  arrest  war-rant;  and  does  not  assert  that  his  arrest  would  have  been 
unconstitutional  absent  the  alleged  pretextual  use  of  the warrant;  we  find  no  Fourth  Amendment  violation.

3  Effi-

cient 4  and  evenhanded  application  of  the  law  demands  that we look to whether the  arrest is objectively justified, rather 

than to the motive of the arresting officer. 

3 The concerns of Justices

Opinion of the Court 

B 
A  Government  official's  conduct  violates  clearly  estab-lished law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, "[t]he 

contours  of [a]  right  [are] sufficiently  clear"  that  every  "rea-sonable  official  would  [have  understood]  that  what  he  is 
doing violates that right."  Anderson v.  Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640  (1987).  We do  not  require a  case directly  on point, 
but  existing  precedent  must  have  placed  the  statutory  or constitutional question beyond  debate.  See 

ibid.; Malley v. 
Briggs,  475  U. S.  335,  341  (1986).  The  constitutional  ques-tion in this case falls far short of that threshold. 

At the time of al-Kidd's arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable 
arrest  pursuant  to  a  material-witness  warrant  unconstitu-tional.  A  district-court  opinion  had  suggested,  in  a  foot-
noted  dictum  devoid  of  supporting  citation,  that  using  such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects "is an illegiti-
mate  use  of  the  statute"--implying  (we  accept  for  the  sake of argument) that the detention would therefore be unconsti-
tutional.  United  States  v.  Awadallah,  202  F.  Supp.  2d  55, 77, n. 28 (SDNY 2002).  The Court of Appeals thought noth-
ing  could  "have  given  John  Ashcroft  fair[er]  warning"  that his  conduct  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment,  because  the 
footnoted  dictum  "call[ed]  out  Ashcroft  by  name"!  580 F. 3d, at 972-973 (internal  quotation marks omitted; empha-
sis  added).  We  will indulge  the  assumption  (though  it does not  seem  to  us  realistic)  that  Justice  Department  lawyers 
bring  to  the  Attorney  General's  personal  attention  all  dis-trict judges' footnoted speculations that boldly "call him out 
by name."  On that assumption, would it prove that for him (and for him only?) it became clearly established that pretex-
tual  use  of  the  material-witness  statute  rendered  the  arrest unconstitutional?  An  extraordinary  proposition.  Even  a 
district  judge's ipse dixit of a holding  is not  "controlling au-thority"  in  any  jurisdiction,  much  less  in  the  entire  United 
States; and his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short 

742  ASHCROFT  v.  al-KIDD 

Opinion of the Court 
of  what  is  necessary  absent  controlling  authority:  a  robust 
"consensus  of  cases  of  persuasive  authority."  Wilson  v. 
Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999). 

The  Court  of  Appeals'  other  cases  "clearly  establishing" 
the  constitutional violation are, of course, those we  rejected 
as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was any con-
stitutional violation at all.  And the Court of Appeals' refer-
ence  to  those  cases  here  makes  the  same  error  of  assuming 
that  purpose  is  only  disregarded  when  there  is  probable 
cause to suspect a violation of law. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  also  found  clearly  established  law 
lurking  in  the  broad  "history  and  purposes  of  the  Fourth 
Amendment."  580  F.  3d,  at  971.  We  have  repeatedly  told 
courts--and  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  particular,  see  Brosseau  v. 
Haugen,  543  U. S.  194,  198-199  (2004)  (per  curiam)--not  to 
define  clearly  established  law  at  a  high  level  of  generality. 
See  also,  e. g.,  Wilson,  supra,  at  615;  Anderson,  supra, 
at  639-640;  cf.  Sawyer  v.  Smith,  497  U. S.  227,  236  (1990). 
The  general  proposition,  for  example,  that  an  unreasonable 
search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little 
help in determining whether the violative nature of particu-
lar  conduct  is  clearly  established.  See Saucier  v.  Katz,  533 
U. S. 194, 201-202 (2001); Wilson, supra, at 615. 

The same is true of the Court of Appeals' broad historical 
assertions.  The  Fourth  Amendment  was  a  response  to  the 
English  Crown's  use  of  general  warrants,  which  often  al-
lowed royal officials to search and seize whatever and whom-
ever  they  pleased  while  investigating  crimes  or  affronts  to 
the  Crown.  See  Stanford  v.  Texas,  379  U. S.  476,  481-485 
(1965).  According to the Court of Appeals, Ashcroft should 
have  seen  that  a  pretextual  warrant  similarly  "gut[s]  the 
substantive  protections  of  the  Fourth  Amendmen[t]"  and 
allows the State  "to arrest  upon the  executive's mere suspi-
cion."  580 F. 3d, at 972. 

Ashcroft  must  be  forgiven  for  missing  the  parallel,  which 
escapes  us  as  well.  The  principal  evil  of  the  general  war-

Opinion of the Court 
rant  was  addressed  by  the  Fourth  Amendment's  particular-ity  requirement, 

Stanford,  supra,  at  485,  which  Ashcroft's 
alleged policy made no effort to evade.  The warrant author-izing  al-Kidd's  arrest  named  al-Kidd  and  only  al-Kidd.  It 

might  be  argued,  perhaps,  that  when,  in  response  to  the English  abuses,  the  Fourth  Amendment  said  that  warrants 
could  only  issue  "on  probable  cause"  it  meant  only  probable 
cause to suspect a violation of law, and not probable cause to believe that the individual named in the warrant was a mate-

rial  witness.  But  that  would  make  all  arrests  pursuant  to material-witness warrants unconstitutional, whether pretex-
tual or not--and that is not  the position taken  by al-Kidd in 
this case. 

While  featuring  a  District  Court's  footnoted  dictum,  the 
Court of Appeals made no mention of this Court's affirmation 
in  Edmond  of  the  "predominan[t]"  rule  that  reasonableness 
is  an  objective  inquiry,  531  U. S.,  at  47.  Nor  did  it  mention 
Whren's  and  Knights'  statements  that  subjective  intent 
mattered  in  a  very  limited  subset  of  our  Fourth  Amend-
ment  cases;  or  Terry's  objective  evaluation  of  investigatory 
searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather than prob-
able  cause;  or  Bond's  objective  evaluation  of  a  suspicionless 
investigatory  search.  The  Court  of  Appeals  seems  to  have 
cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions that gave colorable 
support to the proposition that the unconstitutionality of the 
action here was clearly established. 

Qualified  immunity  gives  government  officials  breathing 
room  to  make  reasonable  but  mistaken  judgments  about 
open  legal  questions.  When  properly  applied,  it  protects 
"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly vio-
late  the  law."  Malley,  supra,  at  341.  Ashcroft  deserves 
neither label, not least because eight Court of Appeals judges 
agreed with his judgment in a case of first impression.  See 
Wilson, supra, at 618.  He deserves qualified immunity even 
assuming--contrafactually--that his alleged detention policy 
violated the Fourth Amendment.

sell its deep fryers; and second, SEB claimed that Pentalpha had  contravened  $ 271(b)  by  actively  inducing  Sunbeam, 
Fingerhut,  and  Montgomery  Ward  to  sell  or  to  offer  to  sell Pentalpha's  deep  fryers  in  violation  of  SEB's  patent  rights. 

Following  a  5-day  trial,  the  jury  found  for  SEB  on  both theories  and  also  found  that  Pentalpha's  infringement  had 
been  willful.  Pentalpha  filed  post-trial  motions  seeking  a new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several grounds. 
As  relevant  here,  Pentalpha  argued  that  there  was  insuffi-cient  evidence  to  support  the  jury's  finding  of  induced  in-
fringement under $ 271(b) because Pentalpha did not actually know of SEB's patent until it received the notice of the Sun-
beam lawsuit in April 1998. The  District  Court  rejected  Pentalpha's  argument,  as  did 
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the  judgment,  SEB

B 
While  the  Courts  of  Appeals  articulate  the  doctrine  of willful  blindness  in  slightly  different  ways,  all  appear  to 

agree  on  two  basic  requirements:  (1)  The  defendant  must subjectively  believe  that  there  is  a  high  probability  that  a 
fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.

9  We think these requirements 

give  willful  blindness  an  appropriately  limited  scope  that surpasses recklessness and negligence.  Under this formula-

tion,  a  willfully  blind  defendant  is  one  who  takes  deliberate 
actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the criti-

cal facts.  See G. Williams, Criminal Law $ 57, p. 159 (2d ed.

the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes 
of  Health  (NIH),  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  applied.  In  accordance  with  the 
Act's requirements, Stanford notified NIH that it was electing to retain 
title to the invention and conferred on the Government a license to use 
the patented procedure. 

Petitioner,  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  Stanford  University,  filed  suit 
against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits infringed 
Stanford's  patents.  Roche  responded  that  Holodniy's  agreement  with 
Cetus  gave  it co-ownership  of  the procedure,  and thus  Stanford lacked 
standing  to  sue  it  for  patent  infringement.  Stanford  countered  that 
Holodniy  had  no  rights  to  assign  because  the  University  had  superior 
rights under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The District Court agreed with Stan-
ford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holodniy had  no rights  to 
assign  to  Cetus.  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Federal  Circuit  dis-
agreed,  concluding  that  Holodniy's  agreement  with  Cetus  assigned  his 
rights  to  Cetus,  and  thus  to  Roche.  It  also  found  that  the  Bayh-Dole 
Act  did  not  automatically  void  an  inventor's  rights  in  federally  funded 
inventions.  Thus, the  Act did not extinguish Roche's ownership inter-
est in the invention, and Stanford was deprived of standing.

mental  precepts  of  patent  law  and  deprive  inventors  of  rights  in  their 
own  inventions.  To  do  so  under  such  unusual  terms  would  be  truly 
surprising.  Had  Congress  intended  such  a  sea  change  in  intellectual 
property rights it would have said so clearly--not obliquely through an 
ambiguous  definition  of  "subject  invention"  and  an  idiosyncratic  use  of 
the word "retain." 

The  Court's  construction  of  the  Act  is  also  reflected  in  the  common 
practice  of  contractors,  who  generally  obtain  assignments  from  their 
employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typically 
expect those contractors to obtain assignments.  With effective assign-
ments, federally funded inventions become "subject inventions" and the 
Act  as  a  practical  matter  works  pretty  much  the  way  Stanford  says 
it  should.  The  only  significant  difference  is  that  it  does  so  without 
violence  to  the  basic  patent  law  principle  that  inventors  own  their 

inventions.  Pp. 786-793.

Opinion of the Court 
the  efficacy  of  new  AIDS  drugs.  Dr.  Mark  Holodniy  joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that 

time.  When  he  did  so,  he  signed  a  Copyright  and  Patent Agreement  (CPA)  stating  that  he  "agree[d]  to  assign"  to 
Stanford  his  "right,  title  and  interest  in"  inventions  result-ing from his employment at the University.  App. to Pet. for 
Cert. 118a-119a. 

At  Stanford  Holodniy  undertook  to  develop  an  improved method for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood samples, 

using  PCR.  Because  Holodniy  was  largely  unfamiliar  with PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at 
Cetus.  As  a  condition  of  gaining  access  to  Cetus,  Holodniy 
signed  a  Visitor's  Confidentiality  Agreement  (VCA).  That 
agreement  stated  that  Holodniy  "will  assign  and  do[es] 
hereby assign" to Cetus his "right, title, and interest in each 
of the ideas, inventions and improvements" made "as a conse-
quence of [his] access" to Cetus.  Id.,

under  certain  circumstances,  such  as  when  the  contractor fails to take "effective steps to achieve practical application" 

of  the  invention.  $ 203.  The  Act  further  provides  that when the contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject 
invention, the Government "may consider and after consulta-tion  with  the  contractor  grant  requests  for  retention  of 
rights by the inventor."  $ 202(d). Some  of  Stanford's  research  related  to  the  HIV  measure-
ment  technique  was  funded  by  the  National  Institutes  of Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the BayhDole  Act.  Accordingly,  Stanford  disclosed  the  invention, conferred  on  the  Government  a  nonexclusive,  nontransfer-
able, paid-up  license to use  the  patented  procedure, and  for-mally  notified  NIH  that  it  elected  to  retain  title  to  the 
invention.  C 

In 2005, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University filed suit against Roche  Molecular Systems,  Inc., Roche  Diagnos-
tics  Corporation,  and  Roche  Diagnostics  Operations,  Inc. (collectively  Roche),  contending  that  Roche's  HIV  test  kits 
infringed  Stanford's  patents.  As  relevant  here,  Roche  re-sponded  by  asserting  that  it  was  a  co-owner  of  the  HIV 
quantification  procedure,  based  on  Holodniy's  assignment  of his rights in the VCA.  As a result, Roche argued, Stanford 
lacked  standing  to  sue  it  for  patent  infringement.  487 F.  Supp.  2d  1099,  1111,  1115  (ND  Cal.  2007).  Stanford 
claimed  that  Holodniy  had  no  rights  to  assign  because  the University's  HIV  research  was  federally  funded,  giving  the 
school  superior rights  in  the  invention under  the  Bayh-Dole Act. 

Ibid.1 The  District  Court  held  that  the  "VCA  effectively  as-

signed  any  rights  that  Holodniy  had  in  the  patented  inven-

1 Roche submitted a host of other claims to the District Court, including 
that  it  had  "shop  rights"  to  the  patents  and  was  entitled  to  a  license  to 
use  the  patents.  See  583  F.  3d  832,  838  (CA  Fed.  2009).  None  of  those 
claims is  now before us; we deal only with Roche's  claim to co-ownership 
to rebut Stanford's standing to bring an infringement action.

Opinion of the Court 
Inventors  the  exclusive  Right  to  their  respective  Writings and Discoveries."  U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8.  The First 

Congress  put  that  power  to  use  by  enacting  the  Patent  Act of  1790.  That  Act  provided  "[t]hat  upon  the  petition  of  any 
person  or  persons  .  .  .  setting  forth,  that  he,  she,  or  they, hath  or  have  invented  or  discovered"  an  invention,  a  patent 
could be granted to "such petitioner or petitioners" or "their heirs,  administrators  or  assigns."  Act  of  Apr.  10,  1790,  $ 1, 
1  Stat.  109-110.  Under  that  law,  the  first  patent  was granted  in  1790 to Samuel  Hopkins, who  had devised  an im-
proved method  for making potash, America's  first industrial chemical.  U. S. Patent No. X1 (issued July 31, 1790).

Although much in intellectual property law has changed in the  220  years  since  the  first  Patent  Act,  the  basic  idea  that 

inventors  have  the  right  to  patent  their  inventions  has  not. Under the law in its current form, "[w]hoever invents or dis-
covers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter . . . may obtain a patent therefor."  35 
U. S. C.  $ 101.  The  inventor  must  attest  that  "he  believes himself  to  be  the  original  and  first  inventor  of  the  [inven-
tion]  for  which  he  solicits  a  patent."  $ 115.  In  most  cases, a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor, or--be-
cause  an  inventor's  interest  in  his  invention  is  "assignable in law by an instrument in writing"--an inventor's assignee. 

$$ 151, 152, 261. Our  precedents  confirm  the  general  rule  that  rights  in 
an  invention  belong  to  the  inventor.  See,  e.

ployees"  is  plausible  enough  in  the  abstract;  it  is  often  the case  that  whatever  an  employee  produces  in  the  course  of 

his  employment  belongs  to  his  employer.  No  one  would claim that an  autoworker who builds  a car  while working  in 
a  factory  owns  that  car.  But,  as  noted,  patent  law  has  al-ways  been  different:  We  have  rejected  the  idea  that  mere 
employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee's inven-tion  in  the  employer.  Against  this  background,  a  contrac-
tor's  invention--an  "invention  of  the  contractor"--does  not automatically  include  inventions  made  by  the  contractor's 
employees.4 The  Bayh-Dole  Act's  provision  stating  that  contractors 
may  "elect  to  retain

Opinion of the Court 
inventor"  "[i]f  a  contractor  does  not  elect  to  retain  title  to a  subject  invention."  $ 202(d).  If  an  employee  inventor 

never  had  title  to  his  invention  because  title  vested  in  the contractor  by  operation  of  law--as  Stanford  submits--it 
would  be  odd  to  allow  the  Government  to  grant  "requests for retention of rights by the inventor."  By using the word 
"retention," $ 202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights in the subject invention at some point, undermining the notion 
that the Act automatically vests title to federally funded in-ventions in federal contractors.

6 

The  limited  scope  of  the  Act's  procedural  protections  also bolsters  our  conclusion.  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  expressly  con-

fers  on  contractors  the  right  to  challenge  a  Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention. 

$ 202(b)(3)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III).  As  Roche  correctly  notes, however,  "the  Act  contains  not  a  single  procedural  protec-
tion  for  third  parties  that  have  neither  sought  nor  received federal funds," such  as  cooperating private research institu-
tions.  Brief  for  Respondents  29.  Nor  does  the  Bayh-Dole Act  allow  inventors  employed by federal  contractors to con-
test their employer's claim to a subject invention.  The Act, for  example,  does  not  expressly  permit  an  interested  third 
party  or  an  inventor  to  challenge  a  claim  that  a  particular invention  was  supported  by  federal  funding.  In  a  world  in 
which  there  is  frequent  collaboration  between  private  enti-ties,  inventors,  and  federal  contractors,  see  Brief  for  Phar-

6 Stanford  contends  that  it  cannot  be  the  case  "that  the  contractor  can 
only  `retain  title'  to  an  invention  that  it  already  owns,  while  an  inventor 
may  be  considered  for  `retention'  of  title  only  when  he  has  assigned  title 
away."  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  8.  That  argument  has  some  force. 
But there may be situations where an inventor, by the terms of an assign-
ment,  has  subsidiary  rights  in  an  invention  to  which  a  contractor  has 
title,  as  $ 202(d)  suggests.  Compare  $ 202(d)  ("retention  of  rights")  with 

$ 202(a) ("retain title") (emphasis added).  And at the end of the day, it is 
Stanford's  contention  that  "retain"  must  be  "read  as  a  synonym  for  `ac-
quire'  or  `receive' "  that  dooms  its  argument  on  this  point.  Brief  for 
Petitioner 37.

(b)  The  statute's  broader  context,  specifically  the  adjacent  defini-
tion  of  "violent  felony,"  confirms  this  interpretation.  Although  Con-
gress  used  the  present  tense  in  defining  "violent  felony,"  see  $ 924(e) 
(2)(B),  this  Court  has  repeatedly  turned  to  the  version  of  state  law 
that  the  defendant  was  actually  convicted  of  violating  in  determin-
ing whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.

serious  drug  offenses,  the  court  applied  ACCA's  sentencing enhancement.  The  court  then  departed  upward  from  the 
advisory  Sentencing  Guidelines  range  and  sentenced  Mc-Neill  to  300  months  in  prison  in  light  of  his  "long  and  unre-

him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses, McNeill now contends  that  the  "maximum  term  of  imprisonment"  for 
those offenses is 30 or 38 months.  We find it "hard to accept the  proposition  that  a  defendant  may  lawfully  [have]  be[en]

Opinion of the Court 
A  standard  allowing  more  expansive  fee-shifting  would furnish  windfalls  to  some  defendants,  making  them  better 

off  because  they  were  subject  to  a  suit  including  frivolous claims.  For  under  any  more  permissive  test,  the  simple 
presence  of  a  frivolous  claim  would  allow  the  court  to  shift to the plaintiff some of the costs of defending against regular, 
non-frivolous  charges.  So  two  defendants  (call  them  Vice and  Rice)  could  face  identical  non-frivolous  allegations,  but 
because Vice also confronted a frivolous claim, he might end by paying less than Rice to his attorneys.  The chance asser-
tion--for  Vice,  the  downright  lucky  assertion--of  the  frivo-lous claim could relieve him not only of the incremental costs 
of that claim but also of costs  that  he, like  Rice,  would have had to pay in its absence.  Section 1988 provides no warrant 
for that  peculiar  result; that  statute was "never  intended to produce  windfalls"  for  parties.  See  Farrar

. . . . . 
(c)  Supporting information.

terest  in  property  of  the  debtor  securing  the  claim,  is based on a writing, the original or a duplicate shall be filed 

with  the  proof  of  claim.  If  the  writing  has  been  lost  or destroyed,  a  statement  of  the  circumstances  of  the  loss 
or destruction shall be filed with the claim. (

2)  Additional  requirements  in  an  individual  debtor 
case;  sanctions for failure to  comply.--In  a case  in  which 
the debtor is an individual: 

(A)  If,  in  addition  to  its  principal  amount,  a  claim  in-
cludes interest, fees, expenses, or other charges incurred 
before  the  petition  was  filed,  an  itemized  statement  of 
the  interest,  fees,  expenses,  or  charges  shall  be  filed 
with the proof of claim. 

(B)  If  a  security  interest  is  claimed  in  the  debtor's 
property,  a  statement  of  the  amount  necessary  to  cure 
any  default  as  of  the  date  of  the  petition  shall  be  filed 
with the proof of claim. 

(C)  If  a  security  interest  is  claimed  in  property  that

scribed  by  the  appropriate  Official  Form  shall  be  filed 

RULES  OF  BANKRUPTCY  PROCEDURE  1059 
with the  proof of claim.  If  an escrow  account has  been 
established  in  connection  with  the  claim,  an  escrow  ac-
count statement prepared as of the date the petition was 
filed  and  in  a  form  consistent  with  applicable  nonbank-
ruptcy  law  shall  be  filed  with  the  attachment  to  the 
proof of claim. 

(D)  If the holder  of a  claim fails to provide  any infor-
mation  required  by  this  subdivision  (c),  the  court  may, 
after  notice  and  hearing,  take  either  or  both  of  the  fol-
lowing actions: 

(i)  preclude the holder from presenting the omitted 
information, in any form, as evidence in any contested 
matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the 
court  determines  that  the  failure  was  substantially 
justified or is harmless; or 

(ii)  award  other  appropriate  relief,  including  rea-
sonable  expenses  and  attorney's  fees  caused  by  the 
failure. . . . . . 

Rule  3002.1.  Notice  relating  to  claims  secured  by  security 

interest in the debtor's principal residence. 

(a)  In  general.--This  rule  applies  in  a  chapter  13  case 
to  claims  that  are  (1)  secured  by  a  security  interest  in  the 
debtor's  principal  residence,  and  (2)  provided  for  under 

$ 1322(b)(5) of the Code in the debtor's plan. 

(b)  Notice  of  payment  changes.--The  holder  of  the  claim 
shall  file  and  serve  on  the  debtor,  debtor's  counsel,  and  the 
trustee  a  notice  of  any  change  in  the  payment  amount,  in-
cluding  any  change  that  results  from  an  interest  rate  or  es-
crow account adjustment, no later than 21 days before a pay-
ment in the new amount is due. 

(c)  Notice  of  fees,  expenses,  and  charges.--The  holder  of 
the claim shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor's counsel, 
and  the  trustee  a  notice  itemizing  all  fees,  expenses,  or 
charges  (1)  that  were  incurred  in  connection  with  the  claim 
after  the  bankruptcy  case  was  filed,  and  (2)  that  the  holder 
asserts  are  recoverable  against  the  debtor  or  against  the 

1060  RULES  OF  BANKRUPTCY  PROCEDURE 
debtor's  principal  residence.  The  notice  shall  be  served 
within  180  days  after  the  date  on  which  the  fees,  expenses, 
or charges are incurred. 

(d)  Form  and  content.--A  notice  filed  and  served  under 
subdivision  (b)  or  (c)  of  this  rule  shall  be  prepared  as  pre-
scribed  by the  appropriate  Official Form,  and  filed  as a  sup-
plement  to  the  holder's  proof  of  claim.  The  notice  is  not 
subject to Rule 3001(f ). 

(e)  Determination  of  fees,  expenses,  or  charges.--On  mo-
tion of the debtor or trustee filed within one year after serv-
ice  of  a  notice  under  subdivision  (c)  of  this  rule,  the  court 
shall,  after  notice  and  hearing,  determine  whether  payment 
of  any  claimed  fee,  expense,  or  charge  is  required  by  the 
underlying  agreement  and  applicable  nonbankruptcy  law  to 
cure  a  default  or  maintain  payments  in  accordance  with 

$ 1322(b)(5) of the Code. 

( f )  Notice  of  final  cure  payment.--Within  30  days  after 
the debtor completes all payments under the plan, the trustee 
shall  file  and  serve  on  the  holder  of  the  claim,  the  debtor, 
and debtor's counsel a notice stating that the debtor has paid 
in full the amount required to cure any default on the claim. 
The notice shall also inform the holder of its obligation to file 
and  serve  a  response  under  subdivision  (g).  If  the  debtor 
contends that final cure payment has been made and all plan 
payments  have  been  completed,  and  the  trustee  does  not 
timely file and serve the notice required by this subdivision, 
the debtor may file and serve the notice. 

( g)  Response to notice of final cure payment.--Within  21 
days  after  service  of  the  notice  under  subdivision  (f)  of  this 
rule,  the  holder  shall  file  and  serve  on  the  debtor,  debtor's 
counsel,  and  the  trustee  a  statement  indicating  (1)  whether 
it agrees that the debtor has paid in full the amount required 
to  cure the  default  on  the  claim, and  (2)  whether the  debtor 
is  otherwise  current  on  all  payments  consistent  with 

$ 1322(b)(5)  of  the  Code.  The  statement  shall  itemize  the 
required cure or postpetition amounts, if any, that the holder 
contends  remain  unpaid  as  of  the  date  of  the  statement. 

RULES  OF  BANKRUPTCY  PROCEDURE  1061 
The  statement shall  be filed  as  a supplement  to the  holder's 
proof of claim and is not subject to Rule 3001(f ). 

(h)  Determination  of  final  cure  and  payment.--On  mo-
tion of the debtor or trustee filed within 21 days after service 
of the statement under subdivision (g) of this rule, the court 
shall, after notice and hearing, determine whether the debtor 
has  cured  the  default  and  paid  all  required  postpetition 
amounts. 

(i)  Failure to notify.--If the holder of a claim fails to pro-
vide  any  information  as  required  by  subdivision  (b),  (c),  or 
(g) of this rule, the court may, after notice and hearing, take 
either or both of the following actions: 

(1)  preclude  the  holder  from  presenting  the  omitted  in-
formation,  in any  form,  as  evidence  in  any contested  mat-
ter  or  adversary  proceeding  in  the  case,  unless  the  court 
determines  that  the  failure  was  substantially  justified  or 
is harmless; or 

(2)  award  other appropriate relief,  including reasonable 
expenses and attorney's fees caused by the failure. 

Rule 4004.  Grant or denial of discharge. . . . . . 

(b)  Extension of time.

hearing, the court may for cause extend the time to object 
to discharge.  Except as provided in subdivision (b)(2), the 
motion shall be filed before the time has expired. 

(2)  A  motion  to  extend  the  time  to  object  to  discharge 
may  be  filed  after  the  time  for  objection  has  expired  and 
before discharge is granted if (A) the objection is based on 
facts  that,  if  learned  after  the  discharge,  would  provide  a 
basis for revocation under $ 727(d) of the Code, and (B) the 
movant  did  not  have  knowledge  of  those  facts  in  time  to 
permit  an  objection.  The  motion  shall  be  filed  promptly 
after the movant discovers the facts on which the objection 
is based. . . . . .
