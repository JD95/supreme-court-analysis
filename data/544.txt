CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2004

TENET et al. v. DOE et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-1395. Argued January 11, 2005--Decided March 2, 2005
Respondent husband and wife filed suit against the United States and the

Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel
and due process claims for the CIA's alleged failure to provide them
with financial assistance it had promised in return for their espionage
services during the Cold War. The District Court denied the Government's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, finding that respondents' claims were not barred by the rule of Totten v. United States,
92 U. S. 105, prohibiting suits against the Government based on covert
espionage agreements. Affirming in relevant part, the Ninth Circuit
reasoned that Totten posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents'
claims and thus the case could proceed to trial, subject to the Government's asserting the evidentiary state secrets privilege and the District
Court's resolving that issue.

Held: Respondents' suit is barred by the Totten rule. In Totten, this

Court concluded with no difficulty that the President had the authority
to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, observed that
the very essence of such a contract was that it was secret and had to
remain so, and found that allowing a former spy to bring suit to enforce
such a contract would be entirely incompatible with the contract's nature. The Ninth Circuit was quite wrong in holding that Totten does
not require dismissal of respondents' claims. It reasoned that Totten
developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-of-contract claims
seeking to enforce an espionage agreement's terms but not barring due

Syllabus
process or estoppel claims. However, Totten was not so limited. It
precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents' where success
depends on the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the
Government. Id., at 107. The Ninth Circuit also claimed that Totten
had been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary "state
secrets" privilege, rather than a categorical bar to respondents' claims,
relying mainly on United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, in which widows of civilians killed in a military plane crash sought privileged military information in their wrongful-death action against the Government. While the Reynolds Court looked to Totten in invoking the "well
established" state secrets privilege, it in no way signaled a retreat from
Totten's broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage
agreements are altogether forbidden. The Court later credited Totten's
more sweeping holding in Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw. /Peace
Ed. Project, 454 U. S. 139, 146-147, thus confirming its continued validity. Reynolds therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced
Totten's categorical bar in the distinct class of cases that depend upon
clandestine spy relationships. Nor does Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592,
which addressed constitutional claims made by acknowledged (though
covert) CIA employees, support respondents' claim. Only in the case
of an alleged former spy is Totten's core concern implicated: preventing
the existence of the plaintiff's relationship with the Government from
being revealed. The state secrets privilege and the use of in camera
judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection the
Court found necessary in enunciating the Totten rule. The possibility
that a suit may proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed
is unacceptable. Forcing the Government to litigate these claims would
also make it vulnerable to "graymail," i. e., individual lawsuits brought
to induce the CIA to settle a case out of fear that litigation would reveal
classified information that might undermine covert operations. And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis
risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships
with individual plaintiffs. Pp. 7-11.

Dav id J. Bur man argued the cause for respondents.With him on the brief were Steven W. Hale, Elizabeth A.
Alaniz, and Marie Aglion.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

In Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105 (1876), we held thatpublic policy forbade a self-styled Civil War spy from suing
the United States to enforce its obligations under their se-cret espionage agreement. Respondents here, alleged former Cold War spies, filed suit against the United States andthe Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel and due process claims for the CIA's allegedfailure to provide respondents with the assistance it had
promised in return for their espionage services. Findingthat

Totten did not bar respondents' suit, the District Courtand the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the

case could proceed. We reverse because this holding con-travenes the longstanding rule, announced more than a century ago in Totten, prohibiting suits against the Governmentbased on covert espionage agreements.

Respondents, a husband and wife who use the fictitiousnames John and Jane Doe, brought suit in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Washington.1 Ac-cording to respondents, they were formerly citizens of a foreign country that at the time was considered to be an enemyof the United States, and John Doe was a high-ranking diplomat for the country. After respondents expressed interestin defecting to the United States, CIA agents persuaded
them to remain at their posts and conduct espionage for the

1 The Government has neither confirmed nor denied any of respondents'
allegations. We therefore describe the facts as asserted in respondents'
second amended complaint. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a-136a. They
are, of course, no more than allegations.

United States for a specified period of time, promising inreturn that the Government "would arrange for travel to the

United States and ensure financial and personal security forlife." App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a. After "carrying out their
end of the bargain" by completing years of purportedlyhigh-risk, valuable espionage services, id., at 123a, respondents defected (under new names and false backgrounds) andbecame United States citizens, with the Government's help.
The CIA designated respondents with "PL-110" status andbegan providing financial assistance and personal security.

With the CIA's help, respondent John Doe obtained em-ployment in the State of Washington. As his salary increased, the CIA decreased his living stipend until, at somepoint, he agreed to a discontinuation of benefits while he was
working. Years later, in 1997, John Doe was laid off after acorporate merger. Because John Doe was unable to find
new employment as a result of CIA restrictions on the type

2 While the Government neither confirms nor denies that respondents
are part of any "PL-110" program, the parties agree this reference is to
50 U. S. C. $ 403h, a provision enacted as part of the Central Intelligence
Agency Act of 1949, $ 8, 63 Stat. 212 (renumbered $ 7, 72 Stat. 337). This
provision allows a limited number of aliens and members of their immediate families per year to be admitted to the United States for permanent
residence, regardless of their admissibility under the immigration laws,
upon a determination by the Director of the CIA, the Attorney General,
and the Commissioner of Immigration that admission of the particular
alien "is in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance
of the national intelligence mission." $ 403h. However, nothing in this
statute, nor anything in the redacted CIA regulations and related materials respondents cite, see Brief for Respondents 41-43; App. to Brief in
Opposition 41-50, represents an enforceable legal commitment by the CIA

of jobs he could hold, respondents contacted the CIA for fi-nancial assistance.

3 Denied such assistance by the CIA,

they claim they are unable to properly provide for them-selves. Thus, they are faced with the prospect of either returning to their home country (where they say they face ex-treme sanctions), or remaining in the United States in their
present circumstances.Respondents assert, among other things, that the CIA violated their procedural and substantive due process rights bydenying them support and by failing to provide them with a
fair internal process for reviewing their claims. They seekinjunctive relief ordering the CIA to resume monthly financial support pending further agency review. They alsorequest a declaratory judgment stating that the CIA failed
to provide a constitutionally adequate review process, anddetailing the minimal process the agency must provide. Finally, respondents seek a mandamus order requiring the CIAto adopt agency procedures, to give them fair review, and to
provide them with security and financial assistance.The Government moved to dismiss the complaint under
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), princi-pally on the ground that Totten bars respondents' suit. The
District Court dismissed some of respondents' claims but de-nied the Government's Totten objection, ruling that the due
process claims could proceed. 99 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1289-1294 (WD Wash. 2000). After minimal discovery, the Gov3 Respondents document their alleged series of contacts with the CIA.
See id., at 128a-136a (Second Amended Complaint). For instance,
respondents allegedly received a letter from the CIA in June 1997, expressing regret that the agency no longer had funds available to provide
assistance. Id., at 128a. Later, respondents claim they were told the
agency determined "the benefits previously provided were adequate for
the services rendered." Id., at 129a. Although the CIA apparently did
not disclose to respondents the agency's appeals process, respondents were
permitted to appeal the initial determination both to the Director of the
CIA and to a panel of former agency officials called the Helms Panel; both
appeals were denied. Id., at 129a-132a.

ernment renewed its motion to dismiss based on Totten, andit moved for summary judgment on respondents' due process

claims. Apparently construing the complaint as also raisingan estoppel claim, the District Court denied the Government's motions, ruled again that Totten did not bar respond-ents' claims, and found there were genuine issues of material
fact warranting a trial on respondents' due process and es-toppel claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a-94a. The District
Court certified an order for interlocutory appeal and stayedfurther proceedings pending appeal.

Id., at 79a-83a.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. 329 F. 3d 1135 (2003). Itreasoned that Totten posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents' claims and thus that the case could proceed totrial, subject to the Government's asserting the evidentiary
state secrets privilege and the District Court's resolving thatissue. 329 F. 3d, at 1145-1155. Over dissent, the Court of
Appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc. 353 F. 3d1141 (CA9 2004). The Government sought review, and we
granted certiorari.4 542 U. S. 936 (2004).

4 Preliminarily, we must address whether Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better
Environment, 523 U. S. 83 (1998), prevents us from resolving this case
based on the Totten issue. In Steel Co., we adhered to the requirement
that a court address questions pertaining to its or a lower court's jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits. 523 U. S., at 94-95. In the lower
courts, in addition to relying on Totten, the Government argued that the
Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1), required that respondents' claims be
brought in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than in the District Court.
The District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and
the Government did not seek review on this question in its petition for
certiorari. Pet. for Cert. 8, n. 2.

We may assume for purposes of argument that this Tucker Act question
is the kind of jurisdictional issue that Steel Co. directs must be resolved
before addressing the merits of a claim. Cf. United States v. Mitchell,
463 U. S. 206, 212, 215 (1983) (holding that "the Tucker Act effects a waiver
of sovereign immunity" and observing that "the existence of consent [to
be sued] is a prerequisite for jurisdiction"). Nevertheless, application of
the Totten rule of dismissal, like the abstention doctrine of Younger v.

Opinion of the Court
In Totten, the administrator of William A. Lloyd's estatebrought suit against the United States to recover compensation for services that Lloyd allegedly rendered as a spy dur-ing the Civil War. 92 U. S. 105. Lloyd purportedly entered
into a contract with President Lincoln in July 1861 to spybehind Confederate lines on troop placement and fort plans,
for which he was to be paid $200 a month. Id., at 105-106.
The lower court had found that Lloyd performed on the con-tract but did not receive full compensation.

Id., at 106.
After concluding with "no difficulty," ibid., that the Presi-dent had the authority to bind the United States to contracts

with secret agents, we observed that the very essence of the
alleged contract between Lloyd and the Government was
that it was secret, and had to remain so:

"The service stipulated by the contract was a secret
service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the
employment and the service were to be equally concealed. Both employer and agent must have understood that the lips of the other were to be for ever sealed
respecting the relation of either to the matter. This

Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), or the prudential standing doctrine, represents
the sort of "threshold question" we have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdiction. See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526
U. S. 574, 585 (1999) ("It is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among
threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits"); see also
Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 129 (2004) (assuming Article III standing in order to "address the alternative threshold question whether" attorneys had third-party standing); Steel Co., supra, at 100, n. 3 (approving a
decision resolving Younger abstention before addressing subject-matter
jurisdiction). It would be inconsistent with the unique and categorical
nature of the Totten bar--a rule designed not merely to defeat the asserted claims, but to preclude judicial inquiry--to first allow discovery or
other proceedings in order to resolve the jurisdictional question. Thus,
whether or not the Government was permitted to waive the Tucker Act
question, we may dismiss respondents' cause of action on the ground that
it is barred by Totten.

Opinion of the Court
condition of the engagement was implied from the na-ture of the employment, and is implied in all secret employments of the government in time of war, or uponmatters affecting our foreign relations, where a disclosure of the service might compromise or embarrass ourgovernment in its public duties, or endanger the person
or injure the character of the agent." Ibid.
Thus, we thought it entirely incompatible with the nature ofsuch a contract that a former spy could bring suit to enforce

it. Id., at 106-107.We think the Court of Appeals was quite wrong in holding
that Totten does not require dismissal of respondents' claims.That court, and respondents here, reasoned first that Totten
developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-of-contract claims seeking to enforce the terms of espionage
agreements but not barring claims based on due process orestoppel theories. In fact, Totten was not so limited: "[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court ofjustice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential."Id., at 107 (emphasis added); see also ibid. ("The secrecy
which such contracts impose precludes any action for theirenforcement" (emphasis added)). No matter the clothing in
which alleged spies dress their claims, Totten precludes judi-cial review in cases such as respondents' where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relation-ship with the Government.

Relying mainly on United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1(1953), the Court of Appeals also claimed that

Totten hasbeen recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary

"state secrets" privilege, rather than a categorical bar totheir claims. Reynolds involved a wrongful-death action
brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C.$ 1346, by the widows of three civilians who died in the crash
of a military B-29 aircraft. 345 U. S., at 2-3. In the courseof discovery, the plaintiffs sought certain investigation544US1 Unit: $U26 [01-25-06 14:09:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

related documents, which the Government said contained" `highly secret,' " privileged military information.

Id., at
3-4. We recognized "the privilege against revealing mili-tary secrets, a privilege which is well established in the law

of evidence," id., at 6-7, and we set out a balancing approachfor courts to apply in resolving Government claims of privilege, id., at 7-11. We ultimately concluded that the Government was entitled to the privilege in that case. Id., at10-12.

When invoking the "well established" state secrets privi-lege, we indeed looked to

Totten. Reynolds, supra, at 7,
n. 11 (citing Totten, supra, at 107). See also Brief for United
States in United States v. Reynolds, O. T. 1952, No. 21, pp. 36,
42 (citing Totten in support of a military secrets privilege).
But that in no way signaled our retreat from Totten's
broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage
agreements are altogether forbidden. Indeed, our opinion
in Reynolds refutes this very suggestion: Citing Totten as a
case "where the very subject matter of the action, a contract
to perform espionage, was a matter of state secret," we declared that such a case was to be "dismissed on the pleadings
without ever reaching the question of evidence, since it was
so obvious that the action should never prevail over the privilege." 345 U. S., at 11, n. 26 (emphasis added).

In a later case, we again credited the more sweeping holding in Totten, thus confirming its continued validity. See
Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw. /Peace Ed. Project,
454 U. S. 139, 146-147 (1981) (citing Totten in holding that
"whether or not the Navy has complied with [$ 102(2)(C) of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 853,
42 U. S. C. $ 4332(2)(C)] `to the fullest extent possible' is beyond judicial scrutiny in this case," where, "[d]ue to national
security reasons," the Navy could "neither admit nor deny"
the fact that was central to the suit, i. e., "that it propose[d]
to store nuclear weapons" at a facility). Reynolds therefore
cannot plausibly be read to have replaced the categorical

Opinion of the Court
Totten bar with the balancing of the state secrets evidentiary
privilege in the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.

Nor does Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988), support respondents' claim. There, we held that $ 102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 498, 50 U. S. C. $ 403(c),
may not be read to exclude judicial review of the constitutional claims made by a former CIA employee for alleged
discrimination. 486 U. S., at 603. In reaching that conclusion, we noted the " `serious constitutional question' that
would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any
judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim." Ibid.
But there is an obvious difference, for purposes of Totten,
between a suit brought by an acknowledged (though covert)
employee of the CIA and one filed by an alleged former spy.
Only in the latter scenario is Totten's core concern implicated: preventing the existence of the plaintiff 's relationship
with the Government from being revealed.5 That is why the
CIA regularly entertains Title VII claims concerning the
hiring and promotion of its employees, as we noted in Webster, supra, at 604, yet Totten has long barred suits such as
respondents'.

There is, in short, no basis for respondents' and the Court
of Appeals' view that the Totten bar has been reduced to an
example of the state secrets privilege. In a far closer case
than this, we observed that if the "precedent of this Court
has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on
reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court

5 The Court of Appeals apparently believed that the plaintiff's relationship with the CIA was secret in Webster, just as in this case. See 329
F. 3d 1135, 1153 (CA9 2003). It is true that the plaintiff in Webster proceeded under a pseudonym because "his status as a CIA employee cannot
be publicly acknowledged." Brief for United States in Webster v. Doe,
O. T. 1987, No. 86-1294, p. 3, n. 1. But the fact that the plaintiff in Webster
kept his identity secret did not mean that the employment relationship
between him and the CIA was not known and admitted by the CIA.

decisions." Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/AmericanExpress, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).

We adhere to Totten. The state secrets privilege and themore frequent use of in camera judicial proceedings simply
cannot provide the absolute protection we found necessaryin enunciating the

Totten rule. The possibility that a suitmay proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed,

if the state secrets privilege is found not to apply, is unac-ceptable: "Even a small chance that some court will order
disclosure of a source's identity could well impair intelligencegathering and cause sources to `close up like a clam.' " CIA
v. Sims, 471 U. S. 159, 175 (1985). Forcing the Governmentto litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to
"graymail," i. e., individual lawsuits brought to induce theCIA to settle a case (or prevent its filing) out of fear that
any effort to litigate the action would reveal classified in-formation that may undermine ongoing covert operations.
And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on acase-by-case basis risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed

and President Lincoln was unenforceable. There may besituations in which the national interest would be well

(1998), in which he would have held that a jurisdictional bardoes not prevent the resolution of a merits issue. When today's opinion refers to the issue in Totten v. United States,92 U. S. 105 (1876), as "the sort of `threshold question' we
have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdic-tion,"

ante, at 7, n. 4, it is surely not referring to the run-of-the-mill, nonthreshold merits question whether a cause of

action exists. And when it describes "the unique and cate-gorical nature of the Totten bar--a rule designed not merely
to defeat the asserted claims, but to preclude judicial in-quiry," ibid., it is assuredly not describing the mere everyday
absence of a cause of action. As applied today, the bar ofTotten is a jurisdictional one.

Of course even if it were not, given the squarely applicableprecedent of

Totten, the absence of a cause of action is soclear that respondents' claims are frivolous--establishing

another jurisdictional ground for dismissal that the Steel Co.majority opinion acknowledges. See 523 U. S., at 89.

13OCTOBER TERM, 2004
Syllabus

SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 03-9168. Argued November 8, 2004--Decided March 7, 2005
After petitioner Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of

a firearm in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), the Government sought
to increase his sentence from a 37-month maximum to the 15-year minimum that $ 924(e), popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act
(ACCA), mandates for such felons who have three prior convictions for
violent felonies or drug offenses. Shepard's predicate felonies were
Massachusetts burglary convictions entered upon guilty pleas. This
Court has held that only "generic burglary"--meaning, among other
things, that it was committed in a building or enclosed space--is a violent crime under the ACCA, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599,
and that a court sentencing under the ACCA can look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether
an earlier conviction after a jury trial was for generic burglary in States
(like Massachusetts) with broader burglary definitions, id., at 602. Refusing to consider the 15-year minimum, the District Court found that
a Taylor investigation did not show that Shepard had three generic burglary convictions and rejected the Government's argument that the
court should examine police reports and complaint applications in determining whether Shepard's guilty pleas admitted and supported generic
burglary convictions. The First Circuit vacated, ruling that such reports and applications should be considered. On remand, the District
Court again declined to impose the enhanced sentence. The First Circuit vacated.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
348 F. 3d 308, reversed and remanded.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to
Part III, concluding that enquiry under the ACCA to determine
whether a guilty plea to burglary under a nongeneric statute necessarily
admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the
charging document, to the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of
colloquy between judge and defendant in which the defendant confirmed
the factual basis for the plea, or to some comparable judicial record of
this information. Guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses,
and Taylor's reasoning controls the identification of generic convictions
following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with nonge544US1 Unit: $U27 [11-07-07 19:15:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14 SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
neric offenses. The ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried
and pleaded cases should be regarded differently, and nothing in Taylor's rationale limits it to prior jury convictions. This Court, then, must
find the right analogs for applying Taylor to pleaded cases. The Taylor
Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify generic convictions in jury cases. In cases tried without a jury, the closest
analogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judge's formal ruling
of law and finding of fact; in pleaded cases, they would be the statement
of factual basis for the charge shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or
by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of
comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the
plea. A later court could generally tell from such material whether the
prior plea had "necessarily" rested on the fact identifying the burglary
as generic. Taylor, supra, at 602. The Government's arguments for a
wider evidentiary cast that includes documents submitted to lower
courts even prior to charges amount to a call to ease away from Taylor's
conclusion that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require confining generic conviction evidence to the convicting court's records approaching the certainty of the record of conviction
in a generic crime State. That was the heart of the Taylor decision,
and there is no justification for upsetting that precedent where the
Court is dealing with statutory interpretation and where Congress has
not, in the nearly 15 years since Taylor, taken any action to modify the
statute. Pp. 19-23, 26.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and
Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part III that the rule in the Jones v.
United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6, and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466, 490, line of cases--that any fact other than a prior conviction
sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be
found by a jury, absent a waiver by the defendant--is also relevant to
ACCA sentencing. In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to show a
generic crime is not established by the record of conviction as it would
be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of Almendarez-Torres v. United States,
523 U. S. 224. Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Government's view) make a disputed finding
of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood
as the prior plea's factual basis, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
guarantee a jury's standing between a defendant and the power of the
State, and they guarantee a jury's finding of any disputed fact essential
to increase a potential sentence's ceiling. The disputed fact here is too
far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record,

Opinion of the Court
and too much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say
that Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute. The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels the Court to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea. Pp. 24-26.

Justice Thomas agreed that the Court should not broaden the scope
of the evidence judges may consider under Taylor v. United States, 495
U. S. 575, because it would give rise to constitutional error, not constitutional doubt. Both Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224,
and Taylor, which permit judicial factfinding that concerns prior convictions, have been eroded by this Court's subsequent Sixth Amendment
jurisprudence. Pp. 26-28.

Opinion of the Court
lent felony only if committed in a building or enclosed space("generic burglary"), not in a boat or motor vehicle. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), we held that a courtsentencing under the ACCA could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to deter-mine whether an earlier conviction after trial was for generic
burglary. The question here is whether a sentencing court
can look to police reports or complaint applications to deter-mine whether an earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted,

and supported a conviction for, generic burglary. We holdthat it may not, and that a later court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to exam-ining the statutory definition, charging document, written
plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicitfactual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant
assented. I

Petitioner Reg inald Shepard was indicted under 18U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), barring felons from possessing a firearm,
and pleaded guilty. At sentencing the Government claimedthat Shepard's prior convictions raised his sentencing range
from between 30 and 37 months (under the United StatesSentencing Guidelines) to the 15-year minimum required by

$ 924(e), pointing to four prior convictions entered upon
Shepard's pleas of guilty under one of Massachusetts's twoburglary statutes.

1 Whereas the Government said that each

conviction represented a predicate ACCA offense of genericburglary, the District Court ruled that

Taylor barred counting any of the prior convictions as predicates for the manda-tory minimum. 125 F. Supp. 2d 562, 569 (Mass. 2000).

In Taylor we read the listing of "burglary" as a predicate"violent felony" (in the ACCA) to refer to what we called

after failing to obtain adequate documentation about this conviction the
Government focused on the other four.

Opinion of the Court
"generic burglary," an "unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime." 495 U. S., at 599. Because statutes in someStates (like Massachusetts) define burglary more broadly, as
by extending it to entries into boats and cars, we had toconsider how a later court sentencing under the ACCA might
tell whether a prior burglary conviction was for the genericoffense.

2 We held that the ACCA generally prohibits the

later court from delving into particular facts disclosed by therecord of conviction, thus leaving the court normally to "look

only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition ofthe prior offense."

Id., at 602. We recognized an exceptionto this "categorical approach" only for "a narrow range of

cases where a jury [in a State with a broader definition ofburglary] was actually required to find all the elements of "
the generic offense. Ibid. We held the exception applica-ble "if the indictment or information and jury instructions
show that the defendant was charged only with a burglaryof a building, and that the jury necessarily had to find an
entry of a building to convict . . . ." Ibid. Only then mighta conviction under a "nongeneric" burglary statute qualify
as an ACCA predicate.In this case, the offenses charged in state complaints were
broader than generic burglary, and there were of course nojury instructions that might have narrowed the charges to
the generic limit. The Government nonetheless urged theDistrict Court to examine reports submitted by the police
with applications for issuance of the complaints, as a way oftelling whether Shepard's guilty pleas went to generic burglaries notwithstanding the broader descriptions of the of-fenses in the complaints, descriptions that tracked the more
expansive definition in Massachusetts law. The court con-cluded that Taylor forbade this, and that investigation
within the Taylor limits failed to show that Shepard had

three generic burglary convictions. The court accordinglyrefused to consider the 15-year mandatory minimum, though

it did sentence Shepard somewhat above the standard levelunder the Sentencing Guidelines, on the ground that his
criminal history category under the Guidelines did not dojustice to his ample criminal record.

On appeal the First Circuit, following its earlier decision
in United States v. Harris, 964 F. 2d 1234 (1992), vacatedthe sentence and ruled that complaint applications and police

reports may count as "sufficiently reliable evidence for deter-mining whether a defendant's plea of guilty constitutes an
admission to a generically violent crime," 231 F. 3d 56, 67
(2000). As to each of Shepard's prior convictions, the court
remanded the case for the District Court to determine
whether there was "sufficiently reliable evidence that the
government and the defendant shared the belief that the defendant was pleading guilty to a generically violent crime."
Id., at 70.

The District Court again declined to impose the 15-year
mandatory minimum, even though the Government supplemented its earlier submission with police reports or complaint applications on two additional burglary convictions.
The District Judge noted that the only account of what occurred at each of the prior plea hearings came from an affidavit submitted by Shepard, who stated "that none of the
details in th[e police] reports w[as] ever mentioned at his
pleas," that "the reports themselves were never read by the
judge to him during the plea colloquy," and that at no time
"was he ever asked if the information contained in the . . .
[r]eports w[as] true." 181 F. Supp. 2d 14, 19 (Mass. 2002).
Shepard further swore that "with respect to each report:
[he] did not admit the truth of the information contained in
the . . . [r]eport as part of [his] plea and [had] never admitted
in court the facts alleged in the report . . . ." Id., at 19-20
(internal quotation marks omitted). Based on this, the District Court found that the Government had failed to carry

Opinion of the Court
its burden to demonstrate that Shepard had pleaded to threegeneric burglaries.

The Court of Appeals again vacated the sentence. Afterobserving that Shepard had never "seriously disputed" that
he did in fact break into the buildings described in the policereports or complaint applications, 348 F. 3d 308, 311 (CA1
2003), the court rejected the District Court's conclusionthat the Government had not shown the requisite predicate
offenses for the 15-year minimum sentence, id., at 314.The case was remanded with instructions to impose that
sentence.We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 918 (2004), to address divergent decisions in the Courts of Appeals applying Taylorwhen prior convictions stem from guilty pleas, not jury verdicts. We now reverse. II

We agree with the First Circuit (and every other Court ofAppeals to speak on the matter) that guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses and that Taylor's reasoningcontrols the identification of generic convictions following
pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with non-generic offenses. See 348 F. 3d, at 312, n. 4 (citing cases).
Shepard wisely refrains from challenging this position, forthe ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried and
pleaded cases are to be regarded differently. It drops nohint that Congress contemplated different standards for
establishing the fact of prior convictions, turning on thebasis of trial or plea. Nothing to that effect is suggested,
after all, by the language imposing the categorical approach,which refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior
conduct but of prior "convictions" and the "element[s]"of crimes. Taylor, supra, at 600-601 (citing 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(e)). Nor does the ACCA's legislative history reveal alesser congressional preference for a categorical, as distinct
from fact-specific, approach to recognizing ACCA predicatesin cases resolved by plea.

Opinion of the Court
certainly, "the practical difficulties and potential unfairnessof a factual approach are daunting," ibid., no less in pleaded

than in litigated cases. Finally, nothing in Taylor's ration-ale limits it to prior jury convictions; our discussion of the
practical difficulties inherent in looking into underlying cir-cumstances spoke specifically of "cases where the defendant
pleaded guilty, [in which] there often is no record of the un-derlying facts."

Ibid. Our job, then, is to find the rightanalogs for applying the Taylor rule to pleaded cases.

The Taylor Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about thebest way to identify generic convictions in jury cases, while
respecting Congress's adoption of a categorical criterion thatavoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual
basis for the earlier conviction. The Court held that genericburglary could be identified only by referring to charging
documents filed in the court of conviction, or to recorded ju-dicial acts of that court limiting convictions to the generic
category, as in giving instruction to the jury.The Court did not, however, purport to limit adequate judicial record evidence strictly to charges and instructions,
id., at 602 (discussing the use of these documents as an "ex-ample"), since a conviction might follow trial to a judge alone

or a plea of guilty. In cases tried without a jury, the closestanalogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judge's
formal rulings of law and findings of fact, and in pleadedcases they would be the statement of factual basis for the
charge, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(a)(3), shown by a transcriptof plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to
the court, or by a record of comparable findings of factadopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.

use of some or all of these documents. United States v. Bonat, 106 F. 3d

Opinion of the Court
such material in a pleaded case, a later court could generallytell whether the plea had "necessarily" rested on the fact

identifying the burglary as generic, Taylor, supra, at 602,just as the details of instructions could support that conclusion in the jury case, or the details of a generically limitedcharging document would do in any sort of case.

The Government argues for a wider evidentiary cast, however, going beyond conclusive records made or used in adju-dicating guilt and looking to documents submitted to lower

courts even prior to charges. It argues for considering apolice report submitted to a local court as grounds for issuing
a complaint under a nongeneric statute; if that report alleges
facts that would satisfy the elements of a generic statute,
the report should suffice to show that a later plea and conviction were for a predicate offense under the ACCA. There
would be no reason for concern about unavailable witnesses
or stale memories, the Government points out, and such limited enquiry would be consistent with Taylor because "[t]he
underlying purpose [would be] the same as in examining the
charging paper and jury instructions (which the Court endorsed in Taylor): to determine the nature of the offense of
which petitioner was convicted, rather than to determine
what he actually did." Brief for United States 22-23. The
Government stresses three points.

First, it says that the more accommodating view of evidence competent to prove that the plea was to a generic offense will yield reliable conclusions. Although the records
of Shepard's pleas with their notations that he "[a]dmit[ted]
suff[icient] facts" do not necessarily show that he admitted
entering buildings or structures, as would be true under a
generic burglary statute or charge, the police reports suffice
to show that the record of admitting sufficient facts "can only
have plausibly rested on petitioner's entry of a building."
Id., at 25.

Second, the Government pulls a little closer to Taylor's
demand for certainty when identifying a generic offense by

544US1 Unit: $U27 [11-07-07 19:15:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
22 SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
emphasizing that the records of the prior convictions used
in this case are in each instance free from any inconsistent,
competing evidence on the pivotal issue of fact separating
generic from nongeneric burglary. "[T]here is nothing in
the record to indicate that petitioner had pleaded guilty
based on entering a ship or vehicle on any of the occasions
at issue." Brief for United States 16.

Finally, the Government supports its call for a more inclusive standard of competent evidence by invoking the virtue
of a nationwide application of a federal statute unaffected by
idiosyncrasies of recordkeeping in any particular State. A
bar on review of documents like police reports and complaint
applications would often make the ACCA sentencing enhancement "hinge on the happenstance of state court
record-keeping practices and the vagaries of state prosecutors' charging practices." Brief in Opposition 13 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

On each point, however, the Government's position raises
an uncomfortable implication: every one of its arguments
could have been pressed in favor of an enquiry beyond what
Taylor allows when a jury conviction follows nongeneric instructions, and each is therefore as much a menace to Taylor
as a justification for an expansive approach to showing
whether a guilty plea admitted the generic crime. If the
transcript of a jury trial showed testimony about a building
break, one could say that the jury's verdict rested on a finding to that effect. If the trial record showed no evidence of
felonious entrance to anything but a building or structure,
the odds that the offense actually committed was generic
burglary would be a turf accountant's dream. And, again, if
it were significant that vagaries of abbreviated plea records
could limit the application of the ACCA, the significance
would be no less when the disputed, predicate conviction followed a jury trial and the stenographic notes of the charge
had been thrown away.

Opinion of the Court
The Government's position thus amounts to a call to easeaway from the Taylor conclusion, that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require thatevidence of generic conviction be confined to records of the
convicting court approaching the certainty of the record ofconviction in a generic crime State. But that limitation was
the heart of the decision, and we cannot have Taylor and the
Government's position both.There is not, however, any sufficient justification for upsetting precedent here. We are, after all, dealing with an issueof statutory interpretation, see,

e. g., Taylor, 495 U. S., at
602, and the claim to adhere to case law is generally powerfulonce a decision has settled statutory meaning, see

Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) ("Con-siderations of

stare decisis have special force in the area of
statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context ofconstitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we havedone"). In this instance, time has enhanced even the usual
precedential force, nearly 15 years having passed since Taylor came down, without any action by Congress to modifythe statute as subject to our understanding that it allowed

only a restricted look beyond the record of conviction undera nongeneric statute.

4 Like the Government, the dissent would allow district courts to examine a wider range of documents than we approve today, and its proposal
is no more consistent with Taylor than the Government's. Taylor is clear
that any enquiry beyond statute and charging document must be narrowly
restricted to implement the object of the statute and avoid evidentiary
disputes. In the case before it, the Court drew the line after allowing
courts to review documents showing "that the jury necessarily had to find
an entry of a building to convict." 495 U. S., at 602; see also ibid. (permitting a sentencing court to look beyond the state statute "in a narrow range
of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of
generic burglary"). As we say in the text, there are certainly jury trials
with record documents like those at issue here, never introduced at trial

Opinion of Souter, J.

III
Developments in the law since Taylor, and since the First
Circuit's decision in Harris, provide a further reason to adhere to the demanding requirement that any sentence under
the ACCA rest on a showing that a prior conviction "necessarily" involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts
equating to generic burglary. The Taylor Court, indeed,
was prescient in its discussion of problems that would follow
from allowing a broader evidentiary enquiry. "If the sentencing court were to conclude, from its own review of the
record, that the defendant [who was convicted under a nongeneric burglary statute] actually committed a generic burglary, could the defendant challenge this conclusion as
abridging his right to a jury trial?" 495 U. S., at 601. The
Court thus anticipated the very rule later imposed for the
sake of preserving the Sixth Amendment right, that any fact
other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of
the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, in the
absence of any waiver of rights by the defendant. Jones v.
United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999); see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000).

The Government dismisses the relevance of the JonesApprendi implementation of the jury right here by describbut "uncontradicted," post, at 31 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), and "internally
consistent," ibid., with the evidence that came in. The dissent would presumably permit examination of such documents, but Taylor assuredly
does not.

The only way to reconcile the dissent's approach with Taylor is to say
that in Taylor the prior convictions followed jury verdicts while in this
case each prior conviction grew out of a guilty plea. See post, at 36 ("Taylor itself set no rule for guilty pleas"). But Taylor has no suggestion that
its reasoning would not apply in plea cases, and its discussion of the practical difficulties specifically referred to prior guilty pleas. 495 U. S., at 601.
Moreover, as we have noted, see supra, at 19, and as the dissent nowhere
disputes, the ACCA provides no support for such a distinction. We decline to create a distinction that Congress evidently had no desire to draw,
that Taylor did not envision, and that we would be hard pressed to explain.

Opinion of Souter, J.
ing the determination necessary to apply the ACCA as "in-volv[ing] only an assessment of what the state court itself

already has been `required to find' in order to find the de-fendant guilty." Brief for United States 38 (quoting

Taylor,
supra, at 602). But it is not that simple. The problem isthat "what the state court . . . has been `required to find' " is

debatable. In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to
show a generic crime is not established by the record of con-viction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authorityof

Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998).
The state statute requires no finding of generic burglary, and
without a charging document that narrows the charge to generic limits, the only certainty of a generic finding lies in
jury instructions, or bench-trial findings and rulings, or (in a
pleaded case) in the defendant's own admissions or accepted
findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea.
In this particular pleaded case, the record is silent on the
generic element, there being no plea agreement or recorded
colloquy in which Shepard admitted the generic fact.

Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Government's view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state
judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior
plea, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones
and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jury standing between a defendant and the power of
the State, and they guarantee a jury's finding of any disputed
fact essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence.
While the disputed fact here can be described as a fact about
a prior conviction, it is too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like
the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that
Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the
dispute. The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks
of unconstitutionality, see Jones, supra, at 239, therefore

Opinion of Thomas, J.
counsels us to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the
disputed generic character of a prior plea, just as Taylor
constrained judicial findings about the generic implication of
a jury's verdict.5

IV
We hold that enquiry under the ACCA to determine
whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric
statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense
is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms
of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge
and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was
confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial
record of this information.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

case.

Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to proof of prior convictions,
a move which (if it should occur) "surely will do no favors for future defendants in Shepard's shoes." Post, at 38. According to the dissent, the
Government, bearing the burden of proving the defendant's prior burglaries to the jury, would then have the right to introduce evidence of
those burglaries at trial, and so threaten severe prejudice to the defendant. It is up to the future to show whether the dissent is good prophesy,
but the dissent's apprehensiveness can be resolved right now, for if the
dissent turns out to be right that Apprendi will reach further, any defendant who feels that the risk of prejudice is too high can waive the right to
have a jury decide questions about his prior convictions.

United States v. Booker, 543
U. S. 220, 317-318 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).Yet that is what the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II), permits in this case. Peti-tioner Reginald Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in
possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1),
which exposed him to a maximum sentence of 10 years under$ 924(a)(2) and a Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of 30-

to-37 months. However, $ 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II) man-dated a minimum 15-year sentence if Shepard had three previous convictions for "a violent felony or a serious drug
offense." Shepard has never conceded that his prior statecourt convictions qualify as violent felonies or serious drug
offenses under $ 924(e). Even so, the Court of Appeals resolved this contested factual matter by ordering the District
Court to impose the enhancement on remand.

The constitutional infirmity of $ 924(e)(1) as applied to
Shepard makes today's decision an unnecessary exercise.
Nevertheless, the plurality today refines the rule of Taylor
v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), and further instructs
district courts on the evidence they may consider in determining whether prior state convictions are $ 924(e) predicate
offenses. Taylor and today's decision thus explain to lower
courts how to conduct factfinding that is, according to the
logic of this Court's intervening precedents, unconstitutional
in this very case. The need for further refinement of Taylor endures because this Court has not yet reconsidered
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998),
which draws an exception to the Apprendi line of cases for
judicial factfinding that concerns a defendant's prior convictions. See Apprendi, supra, at 487-490.

Almendarez-Torres, like Taylor, has been eroded by this
Court's subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a
majority of the Court now recognizes that AlmendarezTorres was wrongly decided. See 523 U. S., at 248-249

O'Connor, J., dissenting
(Scalia, J., joined by Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ.,dissenting);

Apprendi, supra, at 520-521 (Thomas, J.,
concurring). The parties do not request it here, but in anappropriate case, this Court should consider

AlmendarezTorres' continuing viability. Innumerable criminal defend-ants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the

flawed rule of Almendarez-Torres, despite the fundamental
"imperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to theprotections of the individual afforded by the notice, trial by

jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirements." Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 581-582 (2002) (Thomas,
J., dissenting).In my view, broadening the evidence judges may consider

when finding facts under Taylor--by permitting sentencing
courts to look beyond charging papers, jury instructions, and
plea agreements to an assortment of other documents such
as complaint applications and police reports--would not give
rise to constitutional doubt, as the plurality believes. See
ante, at 24-26. It would give rise to constitutional error, no
less than does the limited factfinding that Taylor's rule permits. For this reason, as well as those set forth in Parts I,
II, and IV of the Court's opinion, the Court correctly declines
to broaden the scope of the evidence judges may consider
under Taylor. But because the factfinding procedure the
Court rejects gives rise to constitutional error, not doubt,
I cannot join Part III of the opinion.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court today adopts a rule that is not compelled by
statute or by this Court's precedent, that makes little sense
as a practical matter, and that will substantially frustrate
Congress' scheme for punishing repeat violent offenders who
violate federal gun laws. The Court is willing to acknowledge that petitioner's prior state burglary convictions occurred, and that they involved unpermitted entries with

intent to commit felonies. But the Court refuses to acceptone additional, commonsense inference, based on substantial

documentation and without any evidence to the contrary:that petitioner was punished for his entries into buildings.

Petitioner, Reginald Shepard, has never actually deniedthat the prior crimes at issue were burglaries of buildings.
Nor has he denied that, in pleading guilty to those crimes,he understood himself to be accepting punishment for burglarizing buildings. Instead, seeking to benefit from the un-availability of certain old court records and from a minor
ambiguity in the prior crimes' charging documents, peti-tioner asks us to foreclose any resort to the clear and uncontradicted background documents that gave rise to andsupported his earlier convictions.

The Court acquiesces in that wish and instructs the fed-eral courts to ignore all but the narrowest evidence regarding an Armed Career Criminal Act defendant's prior guiltypleas. I respectfully dissent.

I
The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for certain federal firearms violations where the defendant has three prior convictions fora "violent felony." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e). In defining violent
felonies for this purpose, Congress has specified that theterm includes any crime, punishable by more than one year's
imprisonment, that "is burglary, arson, or extortion, involvesuse of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another."$ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We held in Taylor v. United States, 495
U. S. 575 (1990), that the statute's use of the term "burglary"was meant to encompass only what we described as "generic" burglary, a crime with three elements: (1) "unlawfulor unprivileged entry into, or remaining in," (2) "a building
or structure," (3) "with intent to commit a crime." Id., at598-599.

30 SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
That left the problem of how to determine whether a de-fendant's past conviction qualified as a conviction for generic

burglary. The most formalistic approach would have beento find the ACCA requirement satisfied only when the

statute under which the defendant was convicted was one limitedto "generic" burglary. But

Taylor wisely declined to follow
that course. The statutes which some States--like Massachusetts here, or Missouri in Taylor--use to prosecute ge-neric burglary are overbroad for ACCA purposes: They are

not limited to "generic" burglary, but also punish the nonge-neric kind. Restricting the sentencing court's inquiry to the
face of the statute would have frustrated the purposes of
the ACCA by allowing some violent recidivists convicted of
federal gun crimes to escape the ACCA's heightened punishment based solely on the fortuity of where they had committed their previous crimes.

Instead, Taylor adopted a more "pragmatic" approach.
Ante, at 20 (majority opinion). Every statute punishes a
certain set of criminalized actions; the problem with some
burglary statutes, for purposes of the ACCA, is that they
are overinclusive. But Taylor permitted a federal court to
"go beyond the mere fact of conviction"--and to determine,
by using other sources, whether the defendant's prior crime
was in the subset of the statutory crime qualifying as generic
burglary. For example, where a defendant's prior conviction occurred by jury trial, Taylor instructed the federal
court to review "the indictment or information and jury instructions" from the earlier conviction, to see whether they
had "required the jury to find all the elements of generic
burglary in order to convict." 495 U. S., at 602.

As the Court recognizes, however, Taylor's use of that one
example did not purport to be exhaustive. See ante, at 20-
21. See also United States v. Harris, 964 F. 2d 1234, 1236
(CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.). Rather, Taylor left room for
courts to determine which other reliable and simple sources
might aid in determining whether a defendant had in fact

been convicted of generic burglary. The Court identifiesseveral such sources that a sentencing judge may consult

under the ACCA: the "charging document, written pleaagreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant as-sented."

Ante, at 16. I would expand that list to include
any uncontradicted, internally consistent parts of the record
from the earlier conviction. That would include the twosources the First Circuit relied upon in this case.

Shepard's four prior convictions all occurred by guiltypleas to charges under Massachusetts' two burglary statutes--statutes that punish "[w]hoever . . . breaks and enters
a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with intent to commit a
felony." Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, $ 16 (West 2000)
(emphasis added); see also $ 18. The criminal complaints
used as charging documents for the convictions at issue did
not specify that Shepard's offenses had involved a building,
but instead closely copied the more inclusive language of the
appropriate statute. If these complaints were the only evidence of the factual basis of Shepard's guilty pleas, then I
would agree with the majority that there was no way to
know whether those convictions were for burglarizing a
building. But the Government did have additional evidence.
For each of the convictions, the Government had both the
applications by which the police had secured the criminal
complaints and the police reports attached to those applications. Those documents decisively show that Shepard's illegal act in each prior conviction was the act of entering a
building. Moreover, they make inescapable the conclusion
that, at each guilty plea, Shepard understood himself to be
admitting the crime of breaking into a building.

Consider, for instance, the first burglary conviction at
issue. The complaint for that conviction alleged that, on
May 6, 1989, Shepard "did break and enter in the night time
the building, ship, vessel or vehicle, the property of Jerri
Cothran, with intent to commit a felony therein" in violation

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of $ 16. 3 App. 5. The place of the offense was allegedas "30 Harlem St.," and the complaint contained a crossreference to "CC#91-394783."The majority would have us stop there. Since both the
statute and the charging document name burglary of a"building, ship, vessel or vehicle," the majority concludes
that there is no way to tell whether Massachusetts punished
Shepard for transgressing its laws by burglarizing a build-ing, or for doing so by burglarizing a vehicle, ship, or vessel.

(Although the majority would also allow a look at Shepard'swritten plea agreement or a transcript of the plea proceedings, those items are no longer available in Shepard's case,since Massachusetts has apparently seen little need to preserve the miscellany of long-past convictions.)I would look as well to additional portions of the record
from that plea--the complaint application and police report.The complaint application lists the same statute, describes
(in abbreviated form) the same offense, names the same vic-tim and address, and contains the same reference number
(though differently hyphenated) as the complaint itself. In
addition, the application specifies as relevant "PROPERTY"(meaning "Goods stolen, what destroyed, etc.") a "Cellar

Door." Id., at 6. The police report (which also names thesame victim, date, and place of offense, and contains the same
reference number as the other two documents) gives sub-stantially more detail about why Massachusetts began criminal proceedings against Shepard:

"[R]esponded to [radio call] to 30 Harlem St. for B-E in
progress. On arrival observed cellar door in rear had
been broken down. Spoke to victim who stated that
approx 3:00 a.m. she heard noises downstairs. She then
observed suspect . . . in her pantry." Id., at 7.

Three points need to be made about the relationship between the complaint (whose use the majority finds completely unobjectionable) and the application and police report

O'Connor, J., dissenting
(which I would also consider). First, all of the documentsconcern the same crime. Second, the three documents are

entirely consistent--nothing in any of them casts doubt onthe veracity of the others. Finally, and most importantly,
the common understanding behind all three documents wasthat, whatever the range of conduct punishable by the state
statute, this defendant was being prosecuted for burglary of
a building. See 348 F. 3d 308, 314 (CA1 2003) ("[T]here isa compelling inference that the plea was to the complaint

and that the complaint embodied the events described in theapplication or police report in the case file").

There certainly is no evidence in the record contradicting
that understanding. Notably, throughout these proceedings, Shepard has never denied that the four guilty pleas at
issue involved breaking into buildings. Nor has he denied
that his contemporaneous understanding of each plea was
that, as a result of his admission, he would be punished for
having broken into a building. During his federal sentencing hearings, Shepard did submit an affidavit about his prior
convictions. But that affidavit carefully dances around the
key issues of what Shepard actually did to run afoul of the
law and what he thought was the substance of his guilty
plea. Rather, the affidavit focuses on what the judge said
to Shepard at the hearing and what Shepard said in response. Even in that regard, the affidavit is strangely ambiguous. In discussing the first conviction, for instance, the
affidavit states that "the judge [who took the plea] did not
read" the police report to Shepard, "and did not ask me
whether or not the information contained in the . . . report
was true." 1 App. 100. See also ibid. ("I did not admit the
truth of the information contained in the . . . report as part
of my plea and I have never admitted in court that the facts
alleged in the reports are true"). The affidavit's statements
about the other three prior convictions are similar.

Those statements could be taken as Shepard's denial that
he was ever asked about (or ever admitted to) any of the

O'Connor, J., dissenting
specific facts of his crime that happen to be mentioned in the
police reports--facts like the date and place of the offense,
whether he entered through a cellar door and proceeded to
the pantry, and so on. But to believe that, we would have
to presume that all four Massachusetts courts violated their
duty under state law to assure themselves of the factual
basis for Shepard's plea. In Massachusetts, "[a] defendant's
choice to plead guilty will not alone support conviction; the
defendant's guilt in fact must be established." Commonwealth v. DelVerde, 398 Mass. 288, 296, 496 N. E. 2d 1357,
1362 (1986). As a result, even if "the defendant admits to
the crime in open court, . . . a court may not convict unless
there are sufficient facts on the record to establish each element of the offense." Id., at 297, 496 N. E. 2d, at 1363. See
also Commonwealth v. Colon, 439 Mass. 519, 529, n. 13, 789
N. E. 2d 566, 573, n. 13 (2003) (guilty plea requires admission
to the facts); 2 E. Blumenson, S. Fisher, & D. Kanstroom,
Massachusetts Criminal Practice $ 37.7B, p. 288 (1998) ("Usually this is accomplished by the recitation of either the grand
jury minutes or police reports, but defendant's admissions
during the plea, or trial evidence, can also support the
factual basis" (footnote omitted)). Cf. Commonwealth v.
Forde, 392 Mass. 453, 458, 466 N. E. 2d 510, 513 (1984) (conviction cannot be based on uncorroborated confession; rather,
there must be some evidence that the crime was "real and
not imaginary"). It is thus unlikely that Shepard really intended his affidavit as a statement that none of the various
facts found in the police reports were ever admitted by him
or discussed in his presence during his guilty pleas.

More likely, Shepard's attorney carefully phrased the affidavit so that it would admit of a different meaning: that the
plea courts never asked, and Shepard never answered, the
precise question: "Is what the police report says true?" But
I fail to see how that is relevant, so long as Shepard understood that, in pleading guilty, he was agreeing to be punished

for the building break-in that was the subject of the entire
proceeding.

There may be some scenarios in which--as the result of
charge bargaining, for instance, or due to unexpected twists
in an investigation--a defendant's guilty plea is premised on
substantially different facts than those that were the basis
for the original police investigation. In such a case, a defendant might well be confused about the practical meaning
of his admission of guilt. Cf. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601-602
("[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense was the
result of a plea bargain, it would seem unfair to impose a
sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty
to burglary"). But there is no claim of such circumstances
here: All signs are that everyone involved in each prior
plea--from the judge, to the prosecutor, to the defense
lawyer, to Shepard himself--understood each plea as Shepard's admission that he had broken into the building where
the police caught him. Given each police report's neversuperseded allegation that Shepard had burglarized a building, it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to assert
that, in each case, Shepard was actually prosecuted for and
pleaded guilty to burglarizing a ship or a car. The lower
court was surely right to detect "an air of make-believe"
about Shepard's case. 348 F. 3d, at 311.

The majority's rule, which forces the federal sentencing
court to feign agnosticism about clearly knowable facts, cannot be squared with the ACCA's twin goals of incapacitating repeat violent offenders, and of doing so consistently
notwithstanding the peculiarities of state law. Cf. Taylor,
supra, at 582 (" `[I]n terms of fundamental fairness, the Act
should ensure, to the extent that it is consistent with the
prerogatives of the States in defining their own offenses, that
the same type of conduct is punishable on the Federal level
in all cases' " (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-190, p. 20 (1983))). The
Court's overscrupulous regard for formality leads it not only

to an absurd result, but also to a result that Congress plainlyhoped to avoid.

II
The Court gives two principal reasons for today's ruling:adherence to the Court's decision in

Taylor, and constitu-tional concerns about the defendant's right to a jury trial.

The first is hardly convincing. As noted above, Tayloritself set no rule for guilty pleas, and its list of sources for a
sentencing court to consider was not intended to be exhaus-tive. Supra, at 30-31. The First Circuit's disposition of
this case, therefore, was not in direct conflict with Taylor.Nor did it conflict with the spirit of

Taylor. Taylor was inpart about "[f]air[ness]" to defendants. 495 U. S., at 602.

But there is nothing unfair (and a great deal that is positivelyjust) about recognizing and acting upon plain and uncontradicted evidence that a defendant, in entering his prior plea,knew he was being prosecuted for and was pleading guilty
to burglary of a building. Taylor also sought to avoid theimpracticality of mini-sentencing-trials featuring opposing
witnesses perusing lengthy transcripts of prior proceedings.Id., at 601. But no such problem presents itself in this case:
The Government proposed using only the small documentaryrecord behind Shepard's pleas. Those documents relate to
facts that Shepard does not dispute, and Shepard has notindicated any desire to submit counterevidence.

The issue most central to Taylor was the need to effectu-ate Congress' "categorical approach" to sentencing recidivist
federal offenders--an approach which responds to the realityof a defendant's prior crimes, rather than the happenstance
of how those crimes "were labeled by state law." Id., at 589.But rather than promote this goal, the majority opinion
today injects a new element of arbitrariness into the ACCA:A defendant's sentence will now depend not only on the peculiarities of the statutes particular States use to prosecutegeneric burglary, but also on whether those States' record
retention policies happen to preserve the musty "written

plea agreement[s]" and recordings of "plea colloqu[ies]" ancil-lary to long-past convictions.

Ante, at 16. In other words,
with respect to this most critical issue, the majority's rule isnot consistent with

Taylor at all.
That is why I strongly suspect that the driving force be-hind today's decision is not

Taylor itself, but rather "[d]evelopments in the law since Taylor." Ante, at 24 (plurality opinion). A majority of the Court defends its rule as necessaryto avoid a result that might otherwise be unconstitutional

under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and re-lated cases.

Ante, at 24-26 (plurality opinion); ante, at 27-28
(Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
I have criticized that line of cases from the beginning, and I
need not repeat my reasoning here. See Apprendi, supra,
at 523 (dissenting opinion); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584,
619 (2002) (dissenting opinion); Blakely v. Washington, 542
U. S. 296, 344-345 (2004) (dissenting opinion). See also
Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 254 (1999) (Kennedy,
J., dissenting); Blakely, supra, at 340-344 (Breyer, J., dissenting); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 327-331
(2005) (Breyer, J., dissenting). It is a battle I have lost.

But it is one thing for the majority to apply its Apprendi
rule within that rule's own bounds, and quite another to extend the rule into new territory that Apprendi and succeeding cases had expressly and consistently disclaimed. Yet today's decision reads Apprendi to cast a shadow possibly
implicating recidivism determinations, which until now had
been safe from such formalism. See Blakely, supra, at 301
(" `Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that
increases the penalty of a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt' " (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 490;
emphasis added)). See also Booker, supra, at 244 (opinion
of the Court by Stevens, J.) (similar).

Even in a post-Apprendi world, I cannot understand how
today's case raises any reasonable constitutional concern.

38 SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
To the contrary, this case presents especially good reasonsfor respecting Congress' long "tradition of treating recidivism as a sentencing factor" determined by the judge,Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 243
(1998), rather than as a substantive offense element deter-mined by the jury. First, Shepard's prior convictions were
themselves "established through procedures satisfying thefair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees."
Jones, supra, at 249. Second, as with most recidivism deter-minations, see

Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 235, the bur-glary determination in Shepard's case concerned an extremely narrow issue, with the relevant facts not seriouslycontested. See supra, at 33-35 (discussing shortcomings of
Shepard's affidavit). Finally, today's hint at extending theApprendi rule to the issue of ACCA prior crimes surely will
do no favors for future defendants in Shepard's shoes.When ACCA defendants in the future go to trial rather
than plead guilty, the majority's ruling in effect invites theGovernment, in prosecuting the federal gun charge, also
"to prove to the jury" the defendant's prior burglaries.
Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 234-235. "[T]he introduc-tion of evidence of a defendant's prior crimes risks significant

prejudice," id., at 235, and that prejudice is likely to be espe-cially strong in ACCA cases, where the relevant prior crimes
are, by definition, "violent," 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e). In short,whatever the merits of the Apprendi doctrine, that doctrine
does not currently bear on, and should not be extended tobear on, determinations of a defendant's past crimes, like the
ACCA predicates at issue in Shepard's case. The plurality'sconcern about constitutional doubt, ante, at 24-26, and

Justice Thomas' concern about constitutional error, ante, at 27-28, are therefore misplaced.

BALLARD et ux. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNALREVENUE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 03-184. Argued December 7, 2004--Decided March 7, 2005*
The Tax Court's Chief Judge appoints auxiliary officers, called special trial

judges, to hear certain cases, 26 U. S. C. $ 7443A(a), (b), but ultimate
decision, when tax deficiencies exceed $50,000, is reserved for the court
itself, $ 7443A(b)(5), (c). Tax Court Rule 183(b) governs the two-tiered
proceedings in which a special trial judge hears the case, but the court
renders the final decision. Rule 183(b) directs that, after trial and submission of briefs, the special trial judge "shall submit a report, including
findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, [who] will assign the
case to a Judge . . . of the Court." In acting on the report, the assigned
Tax Court judge must give "[d]ue regard . . . to the circumstance that
the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility
of the witnesses," must "presum[e] to be correct" factfindings contained
in the report, and "may adopt the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge's report or may
modify it or may reject it in whole or in part." Rule 183(c). Until
1983, such special trial judge reports were made public and included in
the record on appeal. Coincident with a rule revision that year, the
Tax Court stopped disclosing those reports to the public and has excluded them from the appellate record. Further, Tax Court judges do
not disclose whether the final decision "modi[fies]" or "reject[s]" the special trial judge's initial report. Instead, the final decision invariably
begins with a stock statement that the Tax Court judge "agrees with
and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge." Whether and
how the final decision deviates from the special trial judge's original
report is never revealed.

Petitioners Claude Ballard, Burton Kanter, and another taxpayer received notices of deficiency from respondent Commissioner of Internal
Revenue (Commissioner) charging them with failure to report certain
payments on their individual tax returns and with tax fraud. They
filed petitions for redetermination in the Tax Court, where the Chief
Judge assigned the consolidated case to Special Trial Judge Couvillion.

*Together with No. 03-1034, Estate of Kanter, Deceased, et al. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on certiorari to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

Syllabus
After trial, Judge Couvillion submitted a Rule 183(b) report to the Chief
Judge, who issued an order assigning the case to Tax Court Judge
Dawson "for review [of that report] and, if approved, for adoption." Ultimately, Judge Dawson issued the Tax Court's decision, finding that the
taxpayers had acted with intent to deceive the Commissioner, and holding them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penalties.
That decision, consisting wholly of a document labeled "Opinion of the
Special Trial Judge," declared: "The Court agrees with and adopts the
opinion of the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below."

Based on conversations between Kanter's attorney and two Tax Court
judges, the taxpayers came to believe that the decision was not in fact
a reproduction of Judge Couvillion's Rule 183(b) report. According to
a declaration submitted by Kanter's attorney, Judge Couvillion had concluded that the taxpayers did not owe taxes with respect to some of the
payments at issue and that the fraud penalty was not applicable. The
taxpayers therefore filed motions seeking access to Judge Couvillion's
initial report as submitted to the Chief Judge or, in the alternative,
permission to place that report under seal in the appellate record. Denying the requested relief, the Tax Court stated: "Judge Dawson . . .
and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agre[e] that . . . Judge Dawson
adopted the findings of fact and opinion of . . . Judge Couvillion, . . .
presumed [those] findings of fact . . . were correct, and . . . gave due
regard" to Judge Couvillion's credibility findings. The order added that
"any preliminary drafts" of the special trial judge's report were "not
subject to production because they relate to [the court's] internal deliberative processes." On appeal, both the Eleventh Circuit in Ballard's
case and the Seventh Circuit in Kanter's case rejected the taxpayers'
objection to the absence of the special trial judge's Rule 183(b) report
from the appellate record. Proceeding to the merits, both Courts of
Appeals affirmed the Tax Court's final decision in principal part.

Held: The Tax Court may not exclude from the record on appeal Rule

183(b) reports submitted by special trial judges. No statute authorizes,
and Rule 183's current text does not warrant, the concealment at issue.
Pp. 53-65.

(a) Rule 183(c)'s promulgation history confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that deference is due the trial judge's factfindings
under the "[d]ue regard" and "presumed to be correct" formulations.
Under Rule 183's precursor, the Tax Court's review of the special trial
judge's report was a transparent process. The report was served on
the parties, who were authorized to file objections to it, and the regular
Tax Court judge reviewed the report independently, on the basis of the
record and the parties' objections. Parties were therefore equipped to

42 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Syllabus
argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special
trial judge's findings the required measure of respect. On adoption of
the 1983 amendments, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging
instances in which it rejected or modified special trial judge findings.
Instead, it appears that the Tax Court inaugurated a novel practice
whereby the special trial judge's report is treated essentially as an inhouse draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular Tax Court
judge and the special trial judge. The regular Tax Court judge then
issues a decision purporting to "agre[e] with and adop[t] the opinion of
the Special Trial Judge."

Nowhere in the Tax Court's current Rules is this joint enterprise
described or authorized. Notably, the Rules provide for only one special trial judge "opinion": Rule 183(b) instructs that the special trial
judge's report, submitted to the Chief Judge before a regular Tax Court
judge is assigned to the case, shall consist of findings of fact and opinion.
It is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c), tellingly captioned "Action on the Report,"
instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject.
It is difficult to comprehend how a Tax Court judge would give "[d]ue
regard" to, and "presum[e] to be correct," an opinion he himself collaborated in producing.

The Tax Court, like all other decisionmaking tribunals, is obliged to
follow its own Rules. See, e. g., Service v. Dulles, 354 U. S. 363, 388.
Although the Tax Court is not without leeway in interpreting its Rules,
it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 an unprovided-for collaborative
process, and to interpret the formulations "due regard" and "presumed
to be correct," to convey something other than what those same words
meant prior to the 1983 rule changes. Pp. 53-59.

(b) The Tax Court's practice of not disclosing the special trial judge's
original report, and of obscuring the Tax Court judge's mode of reviewing that report, impedes fully informed appellate review of the
Tax Court's decision. In directing the regular judge to give "due
regard" to the special trial judge's credibility determinations and to
"presum[e] . . . correct" the special trial judge's factfindings, Rule 183(c)
recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The
officer who hears witnesses and sifts through evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a paper record. Fraud cases, in particular, may
involve critical credibility assessments, rendering the appraisals of the
judge who presided at trial vital to the ultimate determination. In the
present cases, for example, the Tax Court's decision repeatedly draws
outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard,

Syllabus
Kanter, and other witnesses. Absent access to the special trial judge's
Rule 183(b) report in this and similar cases, the appellate court will be
at a loss to determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings
made in that report were accorded "[d]ue regard" and were "presumed . . . correct" by the Tax Court judge, or (2) whether they were
displaced without adherence to those standards.

The Tax Court's practice is extraordinary, for it is routine in federal
judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose a hearing
officer's initial report, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 636(b)(1)(C), and to make
that report part of the record available to an appellate forum, see, e. g.,
5 U. S. C. $ 557(c). The Commissioner asserts a statutory analogy, however, 26 U. S. C. $ 7460(b), which instructs that when the full Tax Court
reviews the decision of a single Tax Court judge, the initial one-judge
decision "shall not be a part of the record." This Court rejects the
Commissioner's endeavor to equate proceedings that differ markedly.
Full Tax Court review is designed for resolution of legal issues. Review of that order is de novo. In contrast, findings of fact are key to
special trial judge reports. Those findings, under the Tax Court's
Rules, are not subject to de novo review. Instead, they are measured
against "due regard" and "presumed correct" standards. Furthermore,
all regular Tax Court members are equal in rank, each has an equal
voice in the Tax Court's business, and the regular judge who issued the
original decision is free to file a dissenting opinion recapitulating that
judge's initial opinion. The special trial judge, who serves at the pleasure of the Tax Court, lacks the regular judges' independence and the
prerogative to publish dissenting views.

Given this Court's holding that the Tax Court's practice is not described and authorized by that court's Rules, this Court need not reach,
and expresses no opinion on, the taxpayers' further arguments based on
due process and other statutory provisions. Should the Tax Court
some day amend its Rules to adopt the idiosyncratic procedure here
rejected, the changed character of the Tax Court judge's review of special trial judge reports would be subject to appellate review for consistency with the relevant federal statutes and due process. Pp. 59-65.

These cases concern the Tax Court's employment of specialtrial judges, auxiliary officers appointed by the Chief Judge

of the Tax Court to assist in the work of the court. See26 U. S. C. $ 7443A(a). Unlike Tax Court judges, who are
appointed by the President for 15-year terms, see $ 7443(b),(e), special trial judges have no fixed term of office,

$ 7443A(a). Any case before the Tax Court may be assignedto a special trial judge for hearing. Ultimate decision in
cases involving tax deficiencies that exceed $50,000, however,is reserved for the Tax Court. $ 7443A(c).

itself renders the final decision. The Rule directs that, after

report, "a copy . . . shall forthwith be served on each party."See Rule 183 note, 81 T. C. 1069-1070 (1984). Correspondingly, the revision deleted the prior provision giving parties
an opportunity to set forth "exceptions" to the report.

n. 2 (CA7 2003) (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(describing the Tax Court's lack of a "formal documented procedure" for
amending its Rules as "oddly out of sync with prevailing practices in other
areas of the law"). Although the Tax Court solicits comments on proposed rule changes from the American Bar Association's Section on Taxation, see ABA Members Suggest Modifications to Proposed Amendments
of Tax Court Rules, 97 Tax Notes Today, p. 167-25 (Aug. 28, 1997), the
court apparently does not publish its proposals to, or accept comments
from, the general public.

46 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion of the Court
uary 16, 1984 effective date of the rule revision, the post-trial
report submitted to the Chief Judge, then transmitted to the
Tax Court judge assigned to make the final decision, has
been both withheld from the public and excluded from the
record on appeal. Further, since that time, Tax Court
judges have refrained from disclosing, in any case, whether
the final decision in fact "modi[fies]" or "reject[s] [the special
trial judge's initial report] in whole or in part." Cf. Rule
183(c), 26 U. S. C. App., p. 1619. Instead, the final decision
invariably begins with a stock statement that the Tax Court
judge "agrees with and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial
[t]rial [ j]udge." See, e. g., Investment Research Assoc., Ltd.
v. Commissioner, 78 TCM 951, 963 (1999), || 99,407 RIA
Memo TC, pp. 2562-2563. Whether and how the opinion
thus adopted deviates from the special trial judge's original
report is never made public.

Petitioners are taxpayers who were unsuccessful in the
Tax Court and on appeal. They object to the concealment
of the special trial judge's initial report and, in particular,
exclusion of the report from the record on appeal. They
urge that, under the Tax Court's current practice, the parties
and the Court of Appeals lack essential information: One cannot tell whether, as Rule 183(c) requires, the final decision
reflects "[d]ue regard" for the special trial judge's "opportunity to evaluate the credibility of [the] witnesses," and presumes the correctness of that judge's initial factfindings.
We agree that no statute authorizes, and the current text of
Rule 183 does not warrant, the concealment at issue. We so
hold, mindful that it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose the initial report of a
hearing officer, and to make that report part of the record
available to an appellate forum. A departure of the bold
character practiced by the Tax Court--the creation and attribution solely to the special trial judge of a superseding
report composed in unrevealed collaboration with a regular

I
After repeated Internal Revenue Service audits spanningseveral years, taxpayers Claude Ballard, Burton W. Kanter,

and Robert Lisle received multiple notices of deficiency fromthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner).

The Commissioner charged that during the 1970's and 1980's,Ballard and Lisle, real estate executives at the Prudential

Life Insurance Company of America (Prudential), had anarrangement with Kanter, a tax lawyer and business entrepreneur, under which people seeking to do business withPrudential made payments to corporations controlled by

2 The dissent observes that the parties did not discretely refer to the
ground on which our decision rests. See post, at 68, n. 1 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); Brief for Petitioner Kanter (i) (asking whether Tax Court
Rule 183 requires Tax Court judges to uphold findings made by special
trial judges unless "clearly erroneous" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The meaning of Rule 183, however, is a question anterior to all
other questions the parties raised, and the requirements of the Rule were
indeed aired in the taxpayers' briefs. See id., at 34-39; Reply Brief for
Petitioner Ballard 2-3, 8-10; Reply Brief for Petitioner Kanter 3-8.
Under the circumstances, we think it evident that our disposition is in
entire accord with "our own Rule." Compare post, at 68, n. 1 (opinion of
Rehnquist, C. J.), with this Court's Rule 14.1(a) ("The statement of any
question presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly
included therein."); and R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 381, n. 3 (1992).
See generally R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme
Court Practice 414 (8th ed. 2002) (observing that "[q]uestions not explicitly
mentioned but essential to analysis of the decisions below or to the correct
disposition of the other issues have been treated as subsidiary issues fairly
comprised by the question presented" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

of deficiency because she filed joint returns with her husband; Kanter's
estate; Kanter's executor; and Kanter's wife. Brief for Petitioner Ballard

then distributed to Kanter, Ballard, and Lisle, or to entities
they controlled. Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle did not report
the payments on their individual tax returns. See Investment Research Assoc., 78 TCM, at 1058, || 99,407 RIA Memo

Brief for Petitioner Kanter 11. After the initial deficiency
notices, the Commissioner, in 1994, additionally charged that
the taxpayers' actions were fraudulent. See Investment
Research Assoc., 78 TCM, at 966, || 99,407 RIA Memo TC,
p. 2693. As to each asserted deficiency, Ballard, Kanter, and
Lisle filed petitions for redetermination in the Tax Court.
See Ballard, 321 F. 3d, at 1040.

The Tax Court is composed of 19 regular judges appointed
by the President for 15-year terms, and several special trial
judges appointed, from time to time, by the Tax Court's
Chief Judge. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 7443(a)-(b), (e), 7443A(a).4
The statute governing the appointment and competence of
special trial judges, $ 7443A,5 prescribes no term of office
for them, but sets their salaries at 90% of the salary paid
to regular judges of the Tax Court, see $ 7443A(d). The
Tax Court may authorize special trial judges to hear and
render final decisions in declaratory judgment proceedings,
"small tax cases," and levy and lien proceedings. See

$ 7443A(b)(1)-(4), (c); Tax Ct. Rule 182, 26 U. S. C. App.,
p. 1619; Brief for Respondent 3. If the amount of the taxes
at issue exceeds $50,000, a special trial judge may be as4 Special trial judges were called "commissioners" when the office was
created in 1943. The Tax Court changed the title to "special trial judge"
in 1979. See Tax Ct. Rule 182 note, 71 T. C. 1215 (1979); Brief for Petitioner Kanter 6.

5 Section 7443A was amended and renumbered in 1998, some years after

the 1994 trial in these cases. See Pub. L. 105-206, $ 3401(c), 112 Stat. 749.
The alterations did not change the statute's text in any relevant respect.

signed to preside over the trial and issue a report containing
recommended factfindings and conclusions as to the taxpayers' liability, but decisional authority is reserved for the
Tax Court. See $ 7443A(b)(5), (c); Freytag v. Commissioner,
501 U. S. 868, 881-882 (1991) (noting that special trial judges
"take testimony, conduct trials, [and] rule on the admissibility of evidence," but "lack authority to enter a final decision"
in certain cases). Tax Court Rule 183 governs the Tax
Court's review of the special trial judge's findings and opinion. See supra, at 44-45.

After Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle sought review in the Tax
Court, the Chief Judge assigned the consolidated case to
Special Trial Judge D. Irvin Couvillion for trial. Judge
Couvillion presided over a five-week trial during the summer
of 1994, and the parties' briefing was completed in May 1995.
App. 7; see also Ballard, 321 F. 3d, at 1040. The post-trial
proceedings in the case are not fully memorialized in either
the Tax Court's docket records or its published orders, but
certain salient events can be traced. On or before September 2, 1998, Judge Couvillion submitted to the Chief Judge
a report containing his findings of fact and opinion, "as
required by [Tax Court] Rule 183(b)." Order of Dec. 15,
1999, in No. 43966-85 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for

assigned the case to Tax Court Judge Howard A. Dawson,
Jr., "for review [of the special trial judge's report] and, if
approved, for adoption." Id., at 114a.6 Fifteen months
later, on December 15, 1999, the Chief Judge "reassigned"
the case "from [Judge] Couvillion to [Judge] Dawson." Id.,

from 1962 until 1985, as a regular member of the court. He was recalled
to judicial duties by the Chief Judge of the Tax Court in 1990. See 26
U. S. C. $ 7447(c). Recalled judges serve "for any period . . . specified by
the chief judge." Ibid. Their salary, unlike that of special trial judges,
see supra, at 48, is equal to that of Tax Court judges.

50 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion of the Court
at 113a. That same day, Judge Dawson issued the decisionof the Tax Court.

Judge Dawson found that Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle hadacted with intent to deceive the Commissioner, and held
them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penal-ties. See, e. g., Investment Research Assoc., 78 TCM, at
1071, 1075, 1085, || 99,407 RIA Memo TC, pp. 2689, 2692-2693,2705-2706. In so ruling, Judge Dawson purported to adopt
the findings contained in the report submitted by JudgeCouvillion: "The Court agrees with and adopts the opinion
of the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below." Id.,at 963, || 99,407 RIA Memo TC, pp. 2562-2563. Judge
Dawson's decision consists in its entirety of a document, over600 pages in length, labeled "Opinion of the Special Trial
Judge." Ibid.The taxpayers came to believe that the document titled
"Opinion of the Special Trial Judge" was not in fact a repro-duction of Judge Couvillion's Rule 183(b) report. A declaration, dated August 21, 2000, submitted by Kanter's attorney,Randall G. Dick, accounts for this belief. Dick attested to
conversations with two Tax Court judges regarding the TaxCourt's decision. According to the declaration, the judges
told Dick that in the Rule 183(b) report submitted to theChief Judge, Judge Couvillion had concluded that Ballard,
Kanter, and Lisle did not owe taxes with respect to pay-ments made by certain individuals seeking to do business
with Prudential, and that the fraud penalty was not applica-ble. App. to Ballard Pet. for Cert. 308a-309a, || 4. Attorney Dick's declaration further stated:

"In my conversations with the judges of the Tax Court,I was told the following: That substantial sections of the

opinion were not written by Judge Couvillion, and thatthose sections containing findings related to the credibility of witnesses and findings related to fraud werewholly contrary to the findings made by Judge Couvillion in his report. The changes to Judge Couvillion's

Opinion of the Court
findings relating to credibility and fraud were made byJudge Dawson." Id., at 309a, || 5.

Concerned that Judge Dawson had modified or rejectedspecial trial judge findings tending in their favor, see Tax Ct.
Rule 183(c), the taxpayers filed three successive motions inthe Tax Court; each motion sought access to the report Special Trial Judge Couvillion had submitted to the Chief Judgeor, in the alternative, permission to place the special trial
judge's report under seal in the record on appeal. SeeOrder of Aug. 30, 2000, App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 99a-
101a; Motion of May 25, 2000, id., at 105a. The Tax Courtdenied the motions. See Order of Aug. 30, 2000,

id., at100a-101a, 103a. In response to the taxpayers' third motion, filed in August 2000, the Tax Court elaborated: "JudgeDawson states and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agrees,
that, after a meticulous and time-consuming review of thecomplex record in these cases, Judge Dawson adopted the
findings of fact and opinion of Special Trial Judge Couvil-lion, . . . Judge Dawson presumed the findings of fact recommended by Special Trial Judge Couvillion were correct,and . . . Judge Dawson gave due regard" to Judge Couvillion's credibility findings. Id., at 102a. To the extent thatthe taxpayers sought "any preliminary drafts" of the special
trial judge's report, the Tax Court added, such documentsare "not subject to production because they relate to the internal deliberative processes of the Court." Id., at 101a(quoting Order of Apr. 26, 2000,

id., at 109a).Appeals from Tax Court decisions are taken to the court

of appeals for the circuit in which the taxpayer resides. 26U. S. C. $ 7482(b)(1)(A). Ballard therefore appealed to the
Eleventh Circuit, Kanter to the Seventh Circuit, and Lisle tothe Fifth Circuit. All three Courts of Appeals accepted the
Commissioner's argument that the special trial judge's signa-ture on the Tax Court's final decision rendered that decision
in fact Special Trial Judge Couvillion's report. Estate of
Kanter v. Commissioner, 337 F. 3d 833, 840-841 (CA7 2003);

Opinion of the Court
Ballard, 321 F. 3d, at 1042; accord Estate of Lisle v. Commissioner, 341 F. 3d 364, 384 (CA5 2003) (adopting the reasoning
of the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits without elaboration).
The appeals courts further agreed with the Commissioner
that the special trial judge's original report, submitted to the
Chief Judge pursuant to Rule 183(b), qualified as a confidential document, shielded as part of the Tax Court's internal
deliberative process. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 841-844;
Ballard, 321 F. 3d, at 1042-1043; accord Estate of Lisle, 341
F. 3d, at 384.

Having rejected the taxpayers' objection to the absence of
the special trial judge's Rule 183(b) report from the record
on appeal, the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits proceeded to
the merits of the Tax Court's final decision and affirmed that
decision in principal part. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 873-
874; Ballard, 321 F. 3d, at 1044.7 The Fifth Circuit's judgment, which is not before this Court, reversed the fraud penalties assessed against Lisle for evidentiary insufficiency but
upheld the Tax Court's determination of tax deficiencies for
certain years. See Estate of Lisle, 341 F. 3d, at 384-385.8
Seventh Circuit Judge Cudahy dissented on the issue of the
special trial judge's initial report, maintaining that intelligent review of the Tax Court's decision required inclusion of
that report in the record on appeal. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d,
at 874, 884-888.

We granted certiorari, 541 U. S. 1009 (2004), to resolve the
question whether the Tax Court may exclude from the record on appeal Rule 183(b) reports submitted by special trial
judges. We now reverse the decisions of the Seventh and
Eleventh Circuits upholding the exclusion.

7 Finding one of Kanter's deductions legitimate, the Seventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court's ruling on that issue. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at
854-857.

8 Lisle's estate did not seek this Court's review of the adverse portions

of the Fifth Circuit's decision.

Opinion of the Court

II
Central to these cases is Tax Court Rule 183, which delin-eates the procedural framework and substantive standards

governing Tax Court review of special trial judge findings.Rule 183(b), captioned "Special Trial Judge's Report," provides that after the trial of a case and submission of theparties' briefs, "the Special Trial Judge shall submit a report,
including findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, andthe Chief Judge will assign the case to a Judge . . . of the
Court." 26 U. S. C. App., p. 1619.9 Rule 183(c), directed tothe Tax Court judge to whom the case is assigned for final
decision, reads:

"Action on the Report: The Judge to whom . . . the caseis assigned may adopt the Special Trial Judge's report

or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part, ormay direct the filing of additional briefs or may receive
further evidence or may direct oral argument, or mayrecommit the report with instructions. Due regard
shall be given to the circumstance that the Special TrialJudge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of
witnesses, and the findings of fact recommended by theSpecial Trial Judge shall be presumed to be correct."

The Tax Court judge assigned to take action on the specialtrial judge's report in these cases invoked none of the means
Rule 183(c) provides to supplement the record. He did not"direct the filing of additional briefs[,] receive further evidence or . . . direct oral argument." See ibid. Nor doesthe record show, or the Commissioner contend, see Brief for
Respondent 14-15, that the Tax Court judge "recommit[ed]

9 Rule 183 has been amended since these cases were before the Tax
Court, but the substantive provisions of the Rule have not been altered
in any relevant respect. Compare Tax Ct. Rule 183, 26 U. S. C. App.,
p. 1483 (1994 ed.), with Tax Ct. Rule 183 (interim amendment), 26 U. S. C.
App., p. 1670 (2000 ed.). Citations in this opinion are to the version of
the Rule reprinted in the 2000 edition of the United States Code.

Opinion of the Court
the [special trial judge's] report with instructions." Rule183(c).

10 From all that appears on the record, then, Judge

Dawson's review of the factfindings contained in JudgeCouvillion's report rested on the Rule 183(b) report itself,

the trial transcript, and the other documents on file. Rule183(c) guides the appraisal of those filed materials.

Rule 183(c)'s origin confirms the clear understanding, from
the start, that deference is due to factfindings made by thetrial judge. Commenting in 1973 on then newly adopted

Rule 182(d), the precursor to Rule 183(c), the Tax Courtobserved that the Rule was modeled on Rule 147(b) of the
former Court of Claims. Tax Ct. Rule 182 note, 60 T. C.1150 (Tax Court review procedures were to be "comparable"
to those used in the Court of Claims). Rule 182(d)'s "[d]ue

10 The record does contain an order stating in its entirety:
"For cause, it is ORDERED: That these cases are reassigned from Special Trial Judge D. Irvin Couvillion to Judge Howard A. Dawson, Jr., for
disposition.

"After the Special Trial Judge submitted a report, as required by Rule
183(b), Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure, these cases were referred to Judge Dawson on September 2, 1998, for review and, if approved,
for adoption.. . . . .

"Dated: Washington, D. C. December 15, 1999." App. to Kanter Pet.
for Cert. 113a-114a.

One might speculate, from the reference to a "reassign[ment]," that at
some point between September 1998 and December 1999, Judge Dawson
"recommitted" the report to Judge Couvillion, who subsequently submitted a revised report to the Chief Judge who, in turn, referred that report
to Judge Dawson. The Commissioner does not urge such an interpretation of the December 15, 1999 order, however, and it is, in any event,
implausible. The Tax Court's docket reveals no action taken between the
initial assignment and the enigmatic reassignment. Had Judge Dawson
turned back the report after first receiving it, an order recommitting the
case to Judge Couvillion "with instructions," Rule 183(c), should have memorialized that action. Moreover, Judge Dawson rendered the final decision of the Tax Court on the same day the case was "reassigned" to him.
Had he faced a recast Rule 183(b) report, it is doubtful that he could have
absorbed and acted upon it so swiftly.

Opinion of the Court
regard" and "presumed to be correct" formulations weretaken directly from that earlier Rule,

11 which the Court of

Claims interpreted to require respectful attention to thetrial judge's findings of fact. See

Hebah v. United States,
456 F. 2d 696, 698 (Ct. Cl. 1972) (per curiam) (challengermust make "a strong affirmative showing" to overcome the

presumption of correctness that attaches to trial judge findings). The Tax Court's acknowledgment of Court of ClaimsRule 147(b) as the model for its own Rule, indeed the Tax

Court's adoption of nearly identical language, lead to the con-clusion the Tax Court itself expressed: Under the Rule formerly designated Rule 182(b), now designated 183(c), specialtrial judge findings carry "special weight insofar as those
findings are determined by the opportunity to hear and ob-serve the witnesses." Tax Ct. Rule 182 note, 60 T. C. 1150
(1973); see Stone v. Commissioner, 865 F. 2d 342, 345
(CADC 1989).

Under Rule 182 as it was formulated in 1973, the Tax
Court's review of the special trial judge's report was a transparent process. Rule 182(b) provided for service of copies
of the special trial judge's report on the parties and Rule
182(c) allowed parties to file exceptions to the report. 60
T. C., at 1149. The process resembled a district court's review of a magistrate judge's report and recommendation:
The regular Tax Court judge reviewed the special trial
judge's report independently, on the basis of the record and
the parties' objections to the report. See Rule 182(c), (d),
id., at 1149-1150. In years before 1984, the Tax Court ac11 Court of Claims Rule 147(b) provided:
"The court may adopt the [trial judge's] report, including conclusions of
fact and law, or may modify it, or reject it in whole or in part, or direct
the [trial judge] to receive further evidence, or refer the case back to him
with instructions. Due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the
[trial judge] had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses; and the findings of fact made by the [trial judge] shall be presumed
to be correct." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 7903 (1970 ed.).

knowledged instances in which it "disagree[d] with the Spe-cial Trial Judge," see

Rosenbaum v. Commissioner, 45 TCM
825, 827 (1983), || 83,113 P-H Memo TC, p. 373, or modifiedthe special trial judge's findings, see

Taylor v. Commissioner, 41 TCM 539 (1980), || 80,552 P-H Memo TC, p. 2344(adopting special trial judge's report with "some modifications"). Parties were therefore equipped to argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the specialtrial judge's findings the measure of respect required by

Rule 182(d)'s "[d]ue regard" and "presumed to be correct"formulations.

In 1983, the Tax Court amended the Rule, which it simultaneously renumbered as Rule 183. The 1983 change eliminated the provision, formerly in Rule 182(b), for service of
copies of the special trial judge's report on the parties; it also
eliminated the procedure, formerly in Rule 182(c), permitting
the parties to file exceptions to the report. See Rule 183
note, 81 T. C., at 1069-1070. The Tax Court left intact, however, the Rule's call for "[d]ue regard" to the special trial
judge's credibility determinations and the instruction that
"the findings of fact recommended by the Special Trial Judge
shall be presumed to be correct." Rule 183(c), id., at 1069.
Further, the 1983 amendments did not purport to change the
character of the action the Tax Court judge could take on
the special trial judge's report; as before, the Tax Court
could "adopt" the report, "modify it," or "reject it in whole
or in part." Ibid. In practice, however, the Tax Court
stopped acknowledging instances in which it rejected or
modified special trial judge findings. Judge Cudahy, in
dissent in the Seventh Circuit, commented on the "extraordinary unanimity" that has prevailed since the 1983 amendments: "Never, in any instance since the adoption of the current Rule 183 that I could find," Judge Cudahy reported,
"has a Tax Court judge not agreed with and adopted the
[special trial judge's] opinion." Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 876;

sponse to the Court's question, stated: "We're not aware ofany cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the

[special trial judge's] findings . . . .").It appears from these cases and from the Commissioner's
representations to this Court that the Tax Court, followingthe 1983 amendments to Rule 183, inaugurated a novel practice regarding the report the special trial judge submitspost-trial to the Chief Judge. No longer does the Tax Court
judge assigned to the case alone review the report and issuea decision adopting it, modifying it, or rejecting it in whole
or in part. Instead, the Tax Court judge treats the specialtrial judge's report essentially as an in-house draft to be
worked over collaboratively by the regular judge and thespecial trial judge. See

id., at 38 (Counsel for the Commis-sioner acknowledged that the special trial judge and regular

Tax Court judge engage in "a collegial deliberative process,"and that such a process, "involving more than one person . . .
in the decision-making," is "unusual"); see also id., at 29-30(referring to "the deliberative process" occurring after the
special trial judge submits his report to the Chief Judge);
Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 876-877 (Cudahy, J., dissenting). No-where in the Tax Court's Rules is this joint enterprise

described.12When the collaborative process is complete, the Tax Court
judge issues a decision in all cases "agree[ing] with andadopt[ing] the opinion of the Special Trial Judge." See
supra, at 46. The extent to which that "opinion" modifiesor rejects the special trial judge's Rule 183(b) findings and
opinion, and is in significant part prompted or written by theregular Tax Court judge, is undisclosed. Cf. Order of Apr.

altered the internal process by which the Tax Court judge reviews the

58 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion of the Court
under Rule 183(b), Tax Court Judge Dawson stated: "SpecialTrial Judge Couvillion submitted his report . . . pursuant

to Rule 183(b), which ultimately became the MemorandumFindings of Fact and Opinion . . . filed on December 15,
1999.").13Judge Cudahy appears accurately to have described the
process operative in the Tax Court:

"[T]here are two `[special trial judge's] reports' in many. . . Tax Court cases--the original `report' filed under

Rule 183 with the Chief Judge of the Tax Court, whichis solely the work product of the [special trial judge] (and
which represented the [special trial judge's] views at theend of trial) and the later `opinion' of the [special trial
judge], which is a collaborative effort, but which the TaxCourt then `agrees with and adopts' as the opinion of
the Tax Court." Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 876.
Notably, however, the Tax Court Rules refer only once to aspecial trial judge "opinion": "[T]he Special Trial Judge shall

submit a report, including findings of fact and opinion, to theChief Judge." Tax Ct. Rule 183(b), 26 U. S. C. App., p. 1619
(emphasis added). That opinion, included in a report com-pleted and submitted

before a regular Tax Court judge isassigned to the case, is the sole opinion properly ascribed to

the special trial judge under the current Rules. Corre-spondingly, it is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c),tellingly captioned "Action on the Report," instructs the Tax
Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject. SeeRule 183(c) (the Tax Court judge "may adopt the Special

Onewould be hard put to explain, however, how a final decisionmaker, here the Tax Court judge, would give "[d]ue regard"to, and "presum[e] to be correct," an opinion the judge himself collaborated in producing.However efficient the Tax Court's current practice may be,
we find no warrant for it in the Rules the Tax Court pub-lishes. The Tax Court, like all other decisionmaking tribunals, is obliged to follow its own Rules. See Service v.
Dulles, 354 U. S. 363, 388 (1957) (Secretary of State "couldnot, so long as the Regulations remained unchanged, proceed

without regard to them"); see also Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359U. S. 535, 540 (1959) (Secretary bound by regulations he promulgated "even though without such regulations" he couldhave taken the challenged action);

and "rightly so," "must be rigorously held to the standards

own Rules, it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 anunprovided-for collaborative process, and to interpret the
formulations "[d]ue regard" and "presumed to be correct"to convey something other than what those same words
meant prior to the 1983 rule changes. See supra, at 54-56.The Tax Court's practice of not disclosing the special trial

to prevent a special trial judge from correcting a clerical error. But see
post, at 71, n. 6 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Moreover, if the special
trial judge, on rereading his Rule 183(b) report postsubmission, detects an
error of substance, the special trial judge might ask to have the report
"recommit[ted]" for modification. See Rule 183(c).

Opinion of the Court
formed appellate review of the Tax Court's decision. In
directing the Tax Court judge to give "[d]ue regard" to the
special trial judge's credibility determinations and to "presum[e] . . . correct" the special trial judge's factfindings, Rule
183(c) recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The officer who hears witnesses and sifts through
evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view
of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a
paper record.

Fraud cases, in particular, may involve critical credibility
assessments, rendering the appraisals of the judge who
presided at trial vital to the Tax Court's ultimate determinations. These cases are illustrative. The Tax Court's decision repeatedly draws outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard, Kanter, and several other
witnesses. See, e. g., Investment Research Assoc., 78 TCM,
at 1060, || 99,407 RIA Memo TC, p. 2675 ("We find Kanter's
testimony to be implausible."); id., at 1083, || 99,407 RIA
Memo TC, p. 2703 ("[W]e find Ballard's testimony vague, evasive, and unreliable."); id., at 1079, || 99,407 RIA Memo TC,
p. 2698 ("The testimony of Thomas Lisle, Melinda Ballard,
Hart, and Albrecht is not credible."); id., at 1140, || 99,407
RIA Memo TC, p. 2776 ("[T]he witnesses presented on behalf
of [Investment Research Associates] in this case were obviously biased, and their testimony was not credible."). Absent access to the special trial judge's Rule 183(b) report in
this and similar cases, the appellate court will be at a loss to
determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings
made in that report were accorded "[d]ue regard" and were
"presumed . . . correct" by the Tax Court judge, or
(2) whether they were displaced without adherence to those
standards. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 886 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("I can think of no single
item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's decision

judge] who stood watch over the trial.").

The Commissioner urges, however, that the special trial
judge's report is an internal draft, a mere "step" in a "confidential decisional process," and therefore properly withheld
from a reviewing court. See Brief for Respondent 16-17
(courts should not "probe the mental processes" of decisional
authorities (quoting United States v. Morgan, 313 U. S. 409,
422 (1941))); accord Order of Aug. 30, 2000, App. to Kanter
Pet. for Cert. 101a. Our conclusion that Rule 183 does not
authorize the Tax Court to treat the special trial judge's
Rule 183(b) report as a draft subject to collaborative revision, see supra, at 59-60, disposes of this argument. The
Commissioner may not rely on the Tax Court's arbitrary construction of its own rules to insulate special trial judge reports from disclosure. Cf. Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 888 (Cudahy,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (access on appeal to the special trial judge's Rule 183(b) report should not
be blocked by the Tax Court's "concealment of [its] revision
process behind th[e] verbal formula" through which the Tax
Court judge purports to "agre[e] with and adop[t]" the opinion of the special trial judge (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

We are all the more resistant to the Tax Court's concealment of the only special trial judge report its Rules authorize
given the generally prevailing practice regarding a tribunal's
use of hearing officers. The initial findings or recommendations of magistrate judges, special masters, and bankruptcy
judges are available to the appellate court authorized to review the operative decision of the district court. See 28
U. S. C. $ 636(b)(1)(C) (magistrate judge's proposed findings
must be filed with the court and mailed to the parties); Fed.

the district court). And the Administrative Procedure Act
provides: "All decisions, including initial, recommended, and
tentative decisions, are a part of the record" on appeal. 5
U. S. C. $ 557(c); see also $ 706 (the reviewing court shall evaluate the "whole record"). In comparison to the nearly
universal practice of transparency in forums in which one
official conducts the trial (and thus sees and hears the witnesses), and another official subsequently renders the final
decision, the Tax Court's practice is anomalous. As one observer asked: "[I]f there are policy reasons that dictate
transparency for everyone else, why do these reasons not
apply to the Tax Court?" Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 874 (Cudahy,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. Mazza v.
Cavicchia, 15 N. J. 498, 519, 105 A. 2d 545, 557 (1954) ("We
have not been able to find a single case in any state . . .
justifying or attempting to justify the use of secret reports
by a hearer to the head of an administrative agency.").15

The Commissioner asserts, however, that the Tax Court's
practice of replacing the special trial judge's initial report
with a "collaborative" report and refusing to disclose the initial report is neither "unique" nor "aberrational." Brief for
Respondent 31. As a "direct statutory analog," ibid., the
Commissioner points to 26 U. S. C. $ 7460(b), the provision

15 It is curious that the Commissioner, always a party in Tax Court proceedings, argues strenuously in support of concealment of the special trial
judge's report. As Judge Cudahy noted, the Tax Court's current practice
allows it "very easily [to] reverse findings (credibility-related and otherwise) of [special trial judges] in a manner that is detrimental to the Commissioner as well as to" taxpayers. Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 888 (concurring
in part and dissenting in part). Inclusion of the report in the record on
appeal would therefore seem "a procedural result that may benefit all parties." Ibid.; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 28 (Court inquired of counsel for the
Commissioner: "[A]ren't there situations where it might be that the special
trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and
then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might
like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility
findings were?").

Opinion of the Court
governing cases reviewed by the full Tax Court. Section
7460(b) instructs that when the full Tax Court reviews the
decision of a single Tax Court judge, the initial one-judge
decision "shall not be a part of the record." For several
reasons, we reject the Commissioner's endeavor to equate
proceedings that differ markedly.

First, as the Commissioner himself observes, omission of
the single Tax Court judge's opinion from the record when
full court review occurs has been the statutory rule "[f]rom
the earliest days of the Tax Court's predecessor." Brief for
Respondent 31 (citing Revenue Act of 1928, ch. 852, $ 601, 45
Stat. 871). To this day, Congress has ordered no corresponding omission of special trial judge initial reports. Understandably so. Full Tax Court review is designed for the
resolution of legal issues, not for review of findings of fact
made by the judge who presided at trial. See L. Lederman & S. Mazza, Tax Controversies: Practice and Procedure
247 (2000). When the full Tax Court reviews, it is making
a de novo determination of the legal issue presented. In
contrast, findings of fact are key to special trial judge reports. See Tax Ct. Rule 183(c), 26 U. S. C. App., p. 1619.
And those findings, under the Tax Court's Rules, are not
subject to review de novo. Instead, they are measured
against "[d]ue regard" and "presumed correct" standards.
Ibid.; see supra, at 54-56.

Furthermore, the judges composing the full Tax Court and
the individual Tax Court judge who made the decision under
review are presidential appointees equal in rank. Each has
an equal voice in the business of the Tax Court. To the
extent that the individual judge disagrees with his colleagues, he is free to file a dissenting opinion repeating or
borrowing from his initial decision. The special trial judge,
serving at the pleasure of the Tax Court, lacks the independence enjoyed by regular Tax Court judges and the prerogative to publish dissenting views. See Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at

We note, finally, other arguments tendered by the taxpay-ers. Ballard and Kanter urge that the Due Process Clause

requires disclosure of a trial judge's factfindings that haveoperative weight in a court's final decision. Brief for Petitioner Ballard 43-48; Brief for Petitioner Kanter 19-27.
They also argue that, just as reports of special masters, mag-istrate judges, and bankruptcy judges form part of the record on appeal from a district court, so special trial judgereports must form part of the record on appeal from the Tax
Court. They base this argument on the appellate reviewstatute, 26 U. S. C. $ 7482(a)(1), which instructs courts of
appeals to review Tax Court decisions "in the same mannerand to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in
civil actions tried without a jury." Brief for Petitioner Bal-lard 23-27 (internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for Petitioner Kanter 27, 34-35. In addition, they maintain that 26
U. S. C. $$ 7459(b) and 7461(a) require disclosure of all re16 The Commissioner also notes that "numerous boards of contract appeals established by various agencies . . . do not require disclosure of initial
reports prepared by presiding judges." Brief for Respondent 31-32.
This analogy, too, is unimpressive. The contract dispute resolution panels
to which the Commissioner points issue decisions after reviewing the initial report of a "presiding judge," designated to conduct an evidentiary
hearing on behalf of the panel. Only the final decision is served on the
parties and included in the record on appeal. Ibid. Unlike the situation
of the special trial judge, however, the presiding judge holds a position
equal in stature to that of the other panel members, and can file a dissent.
See Reply Brief for Petitioner Kanter 15.

In discussing the text of Rule 183(b) and (c), and the Tax Court's current
interpretation of that text, we surely do not intend to "impugn the integrity" of any Tax Court judge. Compare post, at 72 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), with Kanter, 337 F. 3d, at 880, n. 6 (Cudahy, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part) ("I am not suggesting that . . . the judges
of the Tax Court . . . exert undue influence over [special trial judges].
The judicial independence of finders of fact, however, is a structural
principle.").

ports generated in Tax Court proceedings, absent specificexemption. Brief for Petitioner Kanter 42-44. Because we

hold that the Tax Court's Rules do not authorize the practicethat the Tax Court now follows, we need not reach these
arguments and express no opinion on them.The idiosyncratic procedure the Commissioner describes
and defends, although not the system of adjudication thatRule 183 currently creates, is one the Tax Court might someday adopt. Were the Tax Court to amend its Rules to ex-press the changed character of the Tax Court judge's review
of special trial judge reports, that change would, of course,be subject to appellate review for consistency with the relevant federal statutes and due process.

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgments of the Courts ofAppeals for the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits are reversed,

and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consist-ent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.

I concur in the opinion of the Court and note some pointsthat may be considered in further proceedings, after the
cases are remanded.The Court is correct, in my view, in holding, first, that
Tax Court Rule 183(c) mandates "that deference is due tofactfindings made by the [special] trial judge,"

ante, at 54,and, second, that "it is the Rule 183(b) report . . . that Rule

183(c) . . . instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt,modify, or reject," ante, at 58.

The latter holding is supported by the most natural read-ing of the text of Rule 183. Accepting the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue's contrary construction would requirereading the word "report" in subdivisions (b) and (c) to mean

66 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Kennedy, J., concurring
two different things. One additional indication in the text,moreover, is contrary to the Commissioner's position. Rule

183(c) authorizes the Tax Court judge to "recommit thereport with instructions" to the special trial judge. Recommittal is generally a formal mechanism for initiating recon-sideration or other formal action by the initial decisionmaker.
See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 72(b) ("The district judge may
accept, reject, or modify the recommended decision, receivefurther evidence, or recommit the matter to the magistrate

judge with instructions"); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 53(e)(2)(amended 2003) ("The court after hearing may adopt the
[special master's] report or may modify it or may reject it in
whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may
recommit it with instructions"); cf. Kansas v. Colorado, 543
U. S. 86, 106 (2004) ("We accept the Special Master's recommendations and recommit the case to the Special Master

for preparation of a decree consistent with this opinion").
Given that Tax Court Rule 183(c) provides a formal channel
for the Tax Court judge to send a report back to the special
trial judge for reconsideration, it is difficult to interpret the
Rule to permit the informal process the Commissioner and
the dissenting opinion defend here.

If the Tax Court deems it necessary to allow informal consultation and collaboration between the special trial judge
and the Tax Court judge, it might design a rule for that
process. If, on the other hand, it were to insist on more
formality--with deference to the special trial judge's report
and an obligation on the part of the Tax Court judge to describe the reasons for any substantial departures from the
original findings--without requiring disclosure of the initial
report, that would present a more problematic approach. It
is not often that a rule requiring deference to the original
factfinder exists, but the affected parties have no means of
ensuring its enforcement.

That brings us to the questions of how these cases should
be resolved on remand and how the current version of the

544US1 Unit: $U28 [11-02-07 16:34:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

67Cite as: 544 U. S. 40 (2005)
Kennedy, J., concurring
Rule should be interpreted in later cases. As to the former,this question is difficult because we do not know what happened in the Tax Court, a point that is important to under-score here. From a single affidavit, the majority extrapolates "a novel practice" whereby the Tax Court treats theinitial special trial judge report as "an in-house draft to be
worked over collaboratively by the regular judge and the
special trial judge." Ante, at 57. I interpret the opinion asindicating that there might be such a practice, not that there

is. The dissent, in contrast, appears to assume that anychanges to the initial report were the result of reconsideration by the special trial judge or informal suggestions by the
Tax Court judge. Post, at 70-71 (opinion of Rehnquist,
C. J.). Given the sparse record before us, I would not be so
quick to make either assumption, particularly given that the
Commissioner, charged with defending the Tax Court's decision, is no more privy to the inner workings of the Tax Court
than we are.

Given the lingering uncertainty about whether the initial
report was in fact altered or superseded, and the extent of
any changes, there are factual questions that still must be
resolved. If the initial report was not substantially altered,
then there will have been no violation of the Rule. If, on
the other hand, substantial revisions were made during a
collaborative effort between the special trial judge and the
Tax Court judge, the Tax Court might remedy that breach
of the Rule in different ways. For instance, it could simply
recommit the special trial judge's initial report and start
over from there. More likely in these circumstances the
remedy would be for the Tax Court to disclose the report
that Judge Couvillion submitted on or before September 2,
1998.

This leads to the question of how Rule 183 should be interpreted in future cases. Rule 183's requirement of deference
to the special trial judge surely implies that the parties to
the litigation will have the means of knowing whether defer544US1 Unit: $U28 [11-02-07 16:34:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
ence has been given and of mounting a challenge if it hasnot. Thus, a reasonable reading of the Rule requires the

litigants and the courts of appeals to be able to evaluate anychanges made to the findings of fact in the special trial
judge's initial report. Including the original findings of factin the record on appeal would make that possible.

All of these matters should be addressed in the first in-stance by the Courts of Appeals or by the Tax Court.
With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Thomasjoins

, dissenting.

The Court reverses the judgments of the Courts ofAppeals on the ground that Tax Court Rule 183 does not

"authorize the practice that the Tax Court now follows."
Ante, at 65.1 I disagree. The Tax Court's compliance withits own Rules is a matter on which we should defer to the

interpretation of that court. I therefore dissent.The Tax Court interprets Rule 183 not to require the disclosure of the report submitted by the special trial judge

1 It bespeaks the weakness of the taxpayers' arguments that the Court
hinges its conclusion on an argument not even presented for our consideration. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46 (Deputy Solicitor General Hungar noting
that compliance with Rule 183 was not included within the questions presented). This Court does not consider claims that are not included within
a petitioner's questions presented. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a); Yee v.
Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535-538 (1992). Two of the taxpayers' three
claims included in the four questions presented do not even mention Rule
183, instead claiming violations of due process, U. S. Const., Art. III, and
governing federal statutes, 26 U. S. C. $$ 7459, 7461, and 7482. The only
question presented that mentions Rule 183 is limited to asking whether
Rule 183 requires the Tax Court to uphold findings of fact made by a
special trial judge unless they are " `clearly erroneous.' " Kanter Pet. for
Cert. (i). Nor was this argument contained within the taxpayers' certiorari petitions or in their briefs submitted to the Courts of Appeals. See
Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 244, n. 6 (2001). Only by failing to abide by
our own Rules can the Court hold that the Tax Court failed to follow
its Rules.

pursuant to paragraph (b) when the Tax Court judge adoptsthe special trial judge's report. In 1983, the Tax Court

amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement that the spe-cial trial judge's submitted report be disclosed to the parties
so that they could file exceptions before the Tax Court judgeacted on the report. See Tax Ct. Rule 183 note, 81 T. C.
1069-1070 (1984). The 1983 amendment also changed theRule to require that the special trial judge "submit" his report to the Chief Judge instead of "file" it, see Tax Ct. Rule182(b), 60 T. C. 1150 (1973), thereby removing the initial report from the appellate record. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.10(a)(1) (requiring the record on appeal contain "the original

Consistent with these amendments, in an opinion signedby Judge Dawson, Special Trial Judge Couvillion, and Chief

Judge Wells, the Tax Court held that disclosure of the Rule183(b) report was not required in these cases because "[t]he

with its practice during the more than 20 years since Rule183 was adopted in its current form, the Tax Court interprets Rule 183 as not requiring disclosure of "any prelimi-nary drafts of reports or opinions." Order of Apr. 26, 2000,

Notwithstanding the deference owed the Tax Court's legit-imate interpretation of this Rule, the Court reads the Rule

as requiring disclosure of the submitted report because para-graph (c) requires action on "the Special Trial Judge's [initial] report." See ante, at 58-59 (internal quotation marksomitted). To the contrary, Rule 183 mandates only that action be taken on "the Special Trial Judge's report." TheRule is silent on whether the special trial judge may correct

agency, Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887-888 (1991), there is no
reason why Seminole Rock deference does not extend to the Tax Court's
interpretation of its own procedural rules. See ante, at 59 ("[T]he Tax
Court is not without leeway in interpreting its own Rules").

technical or substantive errors in his original report after itis submitted to the Chief Judge and before the Tax Court

judge takes action, either on his own initiative or by informalsuggestion. Paragraph (c)'s use of the possessive "Special
Trial Judge's report" is most naturally read to refer to thereport authored and ascribed to by the special trial judge.

5

If the special trial judge changes his report, then the new
version becomes "the Special Trial Judge's report." It isthe special trial judge's signature that makes the report attributable to him. At the very least, it is not unreasonableor arbitrary for the Tax Court to construe the Rule as not
requiring the disclosure of preliminary drafts or reports.6See

Estate of Kanter v. Commissioner, 337 F. 3d 833, 841
(CA7 2003) ("[I]t is clear that the Tax Court's own rules donot require the report to be disclosed . . . ").

Nor does the Court's claim that judicial review is impededwithstand scrutiny. Because paragraph (c) can be read, as
the Tax Court does, to permit the adoption of the report
authored and signed by the special trial judge, the Courts of

5 There can be no claim made that Tax Court Judge Dawson, and not
Special Trial Judge Couvillion, wrote and controlled the content of the
report. See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 11 (noting that any changes to a
special trial judge's report "would presumptively be the result of the STJ's
legitimate reevaluation of the case"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 ("The only way
it is possible for there to be a change is for the special trial judge himself
to determine, in the exercise of his responsibility as a judicial officer, that
he made a mistake"); Order of Aug. 30, App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert.
102a (indicating the adopted report was written "by Special Trial Judge
Couvillion" and "adopted by Judge Dawson").

6 Indeed, following the Court's interpretation that a Tax Court judge

must act on the report submitted pursuant to paragraph (b), a Tax Court
judge would be required to presume correct any factual findings that a
special trial judge had disclaimed. For example, if the Special Trial
Judge, after submitting a copy of his report to the Chief Judge, found a
critical typographical error that the Tax Court judge might not recognize
as such, then the Tax Court judge would be required, under the Court's
view, to defer to the report as initially drafted instead of a corrected version of the report.

72 BALLARD v. COMMISSIONER

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Appeals both determined that Tax Judge Dawson expresslyadopted Special Trial Judge Couvillion's report. Id., at 840-

841; Ballard v. Commissioner, 321 F. 3d 1037, 1038-1039(CA11 2003). There can be no doubt that in adopting Special Trial Judge Couvillion's findings of fact as well as hislegal conclusions in their entirety, Tax Court Judge Dawson
complied with whatever degree of deference is required byRule 183(c).

Contrary to the Court's claimed distinctions, the statutoryrequirement that a Tax Court judge's initial opinion not be
published when the Chief Judge directs that such opinion bereviewed by the full Tax Court is quite analogous to the Tax
Court's interpretation of Rule 183. See 26 U. S. C. $ 7460(b);
Estate of Varian v. Commissioner, 396 F. 2d 753 (CA9 1968).A Tax Court judge whose decision is being reviewed may

dissent from the full court's decision. Similarly, the specialtrial judge may choose not to change his initial findings of
fact and opinion. In order to distinguish $ 7460(b), theCourt implies that Tax Court Judge Dawson exercised, or at
least may have exercised, undue influence or improper con-trol over Special Trial Judge Couvillion.

7 See ante, at 62.

This Court generally does not assume abdication or impro-priety, see

Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 872, n. 2(1991); United States v. Morgan, 313 U. S. 409, 422 (1941);

Fayerweather v. Ritch, 195 U. S. 276, 306 (1904), and shouldnot impugn the integrity of judges based on an unsubstantiated, nonspecific affidavit.8

7 Any implication that Judge Dawson used his higher "rank" to exert
improper influence or control is particularly inapt in these cases: Judge
Dawson, as a retired Tax Court judge recalled into duty by the Chief
Judge, has absolutely no authority over Special Trial Judge Couvillion as
both serve at the will of the Tax Court's Chief Judge. See 26 U. S. C.

$$ 7443A, 7447(c).

8 The mere absence of any post-1983 decisions in which a Tax Court

judge disagreed with a special trial judge does not support the Court's
broad charges. A similar degree of agreement was evident prior to 1983
when the special trial judge's report was filed and served on the parties,

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
In sum, Rule 183 is silent on the question whether thereport submitted to the Chief Judge pursuant to paragraph

(b) must be the same report acted on by the Tax Court judgeunder paragraph (c). This Court should therefore defer to
the Tax Court's interpretation of the Rule, as amended in1983, allowing the disclosure of only the special trial judge's
report that was adopted by the Tax Court judge.

As every Court of Appeals to consider the arguments hasconcluded, the taxpayer's statutory and constitutional arguments are not colorable. See Estate of Lisle v. Commissioner, 341 F. 3d 364, 384 (CA5 2003); Estate of Kanter v.
Commissioner, supra, at 840-843; Ballard v. Commissioner,
supra, at 1042-1043. I agree with those conclusions.9

For these reasons, I would affirm the Courts of Appeals.

who had the opportunity to file exceptions. From 1976 to 1983, for example, less than one percent (6 out of 680) of special trial judge reports were
not adopted by the Tax Court judge, only 1 case reversed the special trial
judge, and only 14 cases involved adoption with mostly minor modifications. See Brief for Respondent 17-18, and n. 4.

9 With respect to the taxpayers' statutory arguments, 26 U. S. C. $$ 7459

and 7461 require only the disclosure of reports adopted by the Tax Court
and not those reports that are not adopted. See $$ 7459 ("shall be the
duty of the Tax Court . . . to include in its report upon any proceeding its
findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion" (emphasis added)),
7461 ("[R]eports of the Tax Court" shall be public records (emphasis
added)). Section 7482, which requires courts of appeals to review "decisions of the Tax Court" in the same manner as they review similar district
court decisions, was passed to eliminate any special deference paid to Tax
Court decisions, see Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489 (1943), does
not portend to govern the record on appeal, cf. Fed. Rules App. Proc. 10
and 13, and addresses only the decisions of the Tax Court--not special
trial judge reports.

As to their constitutional arguments, neither due process nor Article III
requires disclosure. Disclosure of any report that has been abandoned by
the special trial judge is in no way necessary to effective appellate review
because the adoption of the special trial judge's report ensures that sufficient deference was given. Nor must all reports be disclosed in order for
the Tax Court procedure itself to comport with due process. See Morgan
v. United States, 298 U. S. 468, 478, 481-482 (1936).

WILKINSON, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF

REHABILITATION AND CORRECTION, et al. v.

DOTSON et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 03-287. Argued December 6, 2004--Decided March 7, 2005
Respondents Dotson and Johnson are Ohio state prisoners. After parole

officials determined that Dotson was not eligible for parole and that
Johnson was not suitable for parole, they brought separate actions for
declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming that
Ohio's parole procedures violate the Federal Constitution. In each
case, the Federal District Court concluded that a $ 1983 action does not
lie and that the prisoner would have to seek relief through a habeas
corpus suit. The Sixth Circuit ultimately consolidated the cases and
reversed, finding that the actions could proceed under $ 1983.

Held: State prisoners may bring a $ 1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of state parole procedures; they need not seek relief exclusively under the federal habeas
corpus statutes. Pp. 78-85.

(a) Ohio argues unsuccessfully that respondents' claims may only be
brought in federal habeas (or similar state) proceedings because a state
prisoner cannot use a $ 1983 action to challenge "the fact or duration
of his confinement," e. g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489, and
respondents' lawsuits, in effect, collaterally attack their confinements'
duration. That argument jumps from a true premise (that in all likelihood the prisoners hope their suits will help bring about earlier release)
to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief). This
Court's case law makes clear that the connection between the constitutionality of the prisoners' parole proceedings and release from confinement is too tenuous here to achieve Ohio's legal door-closing objective.
From Preiser to Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, this Court has developed an exception from $ 1983's otherwise broad scope for actions that
lie "within the core of habeas corpus," Preiser, supra, at 487, i. e., where
a state prisoner requests present or future release. Section 1983 remains available for procedural challenges where success would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner, e. g., Wolff
v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, but the prisoner cannot use $ 1983 to obtain
relief where success would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of

Syllabus
confinement or its duration, e. g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477.
Here, respondents' claims are cognizable under $ 1983, i. e., they do not
fall within the implicit habeas exception. They seek relief that will
render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility
(Dotson) and parole suitability (Johnson). See Wolff, supra, at 554-555.
Neither prisoner seeks an injunction ordering his immediate or speedier
release into the community. See, e. g., Preiser, supra, at 500. And as
in Wolff, a favorable judgment will not "necessarily imply the invalidity
of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s]." Heck, supra, at 487. Success
for Dotson does not mean immediate release or a shorter stay in prison;
it means at most new eligibility review, which may speed consideration
of a new parole application. Success for Johnson means at most a new
parole hearing at which parole authorities may, in their discretion, decline to shorten his prison term. Because neither prisoner's claim
would necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at "the core of
habeas corpus." Preiser, supra, at 489. Finally, the prisoners' claims
for future relief (which, if successful, will not necessarily imply the invalidity of confinement or shorten its duration) are yet more distant from
that core. See Balisok, supra, at 648. Pp. 78-83.

(b) Ohio's additional arguments--(1) that respondents' $ 1983 actions
cannot lie because a favorable judgment would "necessarily imply the
invalidity of [their] sentence[s]," Heck, supra, at 487 (emphasis added),
which sentences include particular state parole procedures; and (2) that
a decision for them would violate principles of federal/state comity by
opening the door to federal court without prior exhaustion of state-court
remedies--are not persuasive. Pp. 83-84.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
Two state prisoners brought an action under 42 U. S. C.$ 1983 claiming that Ohio's state parole procedures violate

the Federal Constitution. The prisoners seek declaratoryand injunctive relief. The question before us is whether
they may bring such an action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, or whether they
must instead seek relief exclusively under the federal habeascorpus statutes. We conclude that these actions may be
brought under $ 1983. I

The two respondents, William Dotson and RogericoJohnson, are currently serving lengthy terms in Ohio prisons. Dotson began to serve a life sentence in 1981. Theparole board rejected his first parole request in 1995; and a
parole officer, after reviewing Dotson's records in the year2000, determined that he should not receive further consideration for parole for at least five more years. In reachingthis conclusion about Dotson's parole eligibility, the officer
used parole guidelines first adopted in 1998, after Dotson

began to serve his term. Dotson claims that the retroactiveapplication of these new, harsher guidelines to his preguidelines case violates the Constitution's Ex Post Facto and DueProcess Clauses. He seeks a federal-court declaration to
that effect as well as a permanent injunction ordering prisonofficials to grant him an "immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and administrative rules in
place when [he] committed his crimes." App. 20 (DotsonComplaint, Prospective Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,

|| 3).Johnson began to serve a 10- to 30-year prison term in
1992. The parole board considered and rejected his first parole request in 1999, finding him unsuitable for release. In
making this determination, the board applied the new 1998
guidelines. Johnson too claims that the application of these
new, harsher guidelines to his preguidelines case violated the
Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. He also alleges that
the parole board's proceedings (by having too few members present and by denying him an adequate opportunity
to speak) violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause.
Johnson's complaint seeks a new parole hearing conducted
under constitutionally proper procedures and an injunction
ordering the State to comply with constitutional due process
and ex post facto requirements in the future.

Both prisoners brought $ 1983 actions in federal court. In
each case, the Federal District Court concluded that a $ 1983
action does not lie and that the prisoner would have to seek
relief through a habeas corpus suit. Dotson v. Wilkinson,

No. 4:00 CV 1075 (ND Ohio, July 16, 2000). Each prisoner
appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ultimately consolidated the two appeals and heard both cases en
banc. The court found that the actions could proceed under

$ 1983, and it reversed the lower courts. 329 F. 3d 463, 472

and we granted review.

78 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Opinion of the Court

II
This Court has held that a prisoner in state custody cannotuse a $ 1983 action to challenge "the fact or duration of his

confinement." Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489(1973); see also

Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 554 (1974);Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 481 (1994); Edwards v.

Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, 648 (1997). He must seek federalhabeas corpus relief (or appropriate state relief) instead.

Ohio points out that the inmates in these cases attack theirparole-eligibility proceedings (Dotson) and parole-suitability
proceedings (Johnson) only because they believe that victoryon their claims will lead to speedier release from prison.
Consequently, Ohio argues, the prisoners' lawsuits, in effect,collaterally attack the

duration of their confinement; hence,such a claim may only be brought through a habeas corpus

action, not through $ 1983.The problem with Ohio's argument lies in its jump from a
true premise (that in all likelihood the prisoners hope theseactions will help bring about earlier release) to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief). A con-sideration of this Court's case law makes clear that the connection between the constitutionality of the prisoners' paroleproceedings and release from confinement is too tenuous
here to achieve Ohio's legal door-closing objective.The Court initially addressed the relationship between

$ 1983 and the federal habeas statutes in Preiser v. Rodriguez, supra. In that case, state prisoners brought civilrights actions attacking the constitutionality of prison disciplinary proceedings that had led to the deprivation of theirgood-time credits. Id., at 476. The Court conceded that
the language of $ 1983 literally covers their claims. See$ 1983 (authorizing claims alleging the deprivation of constitutional rights against every "person" acting "under colorof " state law). But, the Court noted, the language of the
federal habeas statutes applies as well. See 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(a) (permitting claims by a person being held "in cus544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

79Cite as: 544 U. S. 74 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
tody in violation of the Constitution"). Moreover, the Courtobserved, the language of the habeas statute is more specific,

and the writ's history makes clear that it traditionally "hasbeen accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release
from [unlawful] confinement." Preiser, 411 U. S., at 486.Finally, habeas corpus actions require a petitioner fully to
exhaust state remedies, which $ 1983 does not. Id., at 490-
491; see also Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496,507 (1982). These considerations of linguistic specificity, history, and comity led the Court to find an implicit excep-tion from $ 1983's otherwise broad scope for actions that
lie "within the core of habeas corpus." Preiser, 411 U. S.,
at 487.

Defining the scope of that exception, the Court concluded
that a $ 1983 action will not lie when a state prisoner challenges "the fact or duration of his confinement," id., at 489,
and seeks either "immediate release from prison," or the
"shortening" of his term of confinement, id., at 482. Because an action for restoration of good-time credits in effect
demands immediate release or a shorter period of detention,
it attacks "the very duration of . . . physical confinement,"
id., at 487-488, and thus lies at "the core of habeas corpus,"
id., at 487. Therefore, the Court held, the Preiser prisoners
could not pursue their claims under $ 1983.

In Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, the Court elaborated the
contours of this habeas corpus "core." As in Preiser, state
prisoners brought a $ 1983 action challenging prison officials'
revocation of good-time credits by means of constitutionally
deficient disciplinary proceedings. 418 U. S., at 553. The
Court held that the prisoners could not use $ 1983 to obtain
restoration of the credits because Preiser had held that "an
injunction restoring good time improperly taken is foreclosed." 418 U. S., at 555. But the inmates could use $ 1983
to obtain a declaration ("as a predicate to" their requested
damages award) that the disciplinary procedures were
invalid. Ibid. They could also seek "by way of ancillary

80 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Opinion of the Court
relief[,] an otherwise proper injunction enjoining the prospective enforcement of invalid prison regulations." Ibid.
(emphasis added). In neither case would victory for theprisoners necessarily have meant immediate release or a

shorter period of incarceration; the prisoners attacked onlythe "wrong procedures, not . . . the wrong result (

i. e., [the
denial of] good-time credits)." Heck, supra, at 483 (discussing Wolff ).In

Heck, the Court considered a different, but related, circumstance. A state prisoner brought a $ 1983 action fordamages, challenging the conduct of state officials who, the

prisoner claimed, had unconstitutionally caused his conviction by improperly investigating his crime and destroying
evidence. 512 U. S., at 479. The Court pointed to "the
hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal
judgments." Id., at 486. And it held that where "establishing the basis for the damages claim necessarily demonstrates
the invalidity of the conviction," id., at 481-482, a $ 1983 action will not lie "unless . . . the conviction or sentence has
already been invalidated," id., at 487. The Court then
added that, where the $ 1983 action, "even if successful, will
not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal
judgment . . . , the action should be allowed to proceed."
Ibid. (footnote omitted).

Finally, in Edwards v. Balisok, supra, the Court returned
to the prison disciplinary procedure context of the kind it
had addressed previously in Preiser and Wolff. Balisok
sought "a declaration that the procedures employed by state
officials [to deprive him of good-time credits] violated due
process, . . . damages for use of the unconstitutional procedures, [and] an injunction to prevent future violations." 520
U. S., at 643. Applying Heck, the Court found that habeas
was the sole vehicle for the inmate's constitutional challenge
insofar as the prisoner sought declaratory relief and money
damages, because the "principal procedural defect com544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

81Cite as: 544 U. S. 74 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
plained of," namely, deceit and bias on the part of the deci-sionmaker, "would, if established, necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of [Balisok's] good-time credits."520 U. S., at 646. Hence, success on the prisoner's claim for
money damages (and the accompanying claim for declaratoryrelief) would "necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed." Id., at 648. Nonetheless, the prisoner's
claim for an injunction barring future unconstitutional proce-dures did

not fall within habeas' exclusive domain. That is
because "[o]rdinarily, a prayer for such prospective relief willnot `necessarily imply' the invalidity of a previous loss of

good-time credits." Ibid.

Throughout the legal journey from Preiser to Balisok, the
Court has focused on the need to ensure that state prisoners
use only habeas corpus (or similar state) remedies when they
seek to invalidate the duration of their confinement--either
directly through an injunction compelling speedier release or
indirectly through a judicial determination that necessarily implies the unlawfulness of the State's custody. Thus,
Preiser found an implied exception to $ 1983's coverage
where the claim seeks--not where it simply "relates to"--
"core" habeas corpus relief, i. e., where a state prisoner requests present or future release. Cf. post, at 92 (Kennedy,
J., dissenting) (arguing that Preiser covers challenges that
"relate . . . to" the duration of confinement). Wolff makes
clear that $ 1983 remains available for procedural challenges
where success in the action would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner. Heck specifies that a prisoner cannot use $ 1983 to obtain damages
where success would necessarily imply the unlawfulness of
a (not previously invalidated) conviction or sentence. And
Balisok, like Wolff, demonstrates that habeas remedies do
not displace $ 1983 actions where success in the civil rights
suit would not necessarily vitiate the legality of (not previously invalidated) state confinement. These cases, taken
together, indicate that a state prisoner's $ 1983 action is

544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
82 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Opinion of the Court
barred (absent prior invalidation)--no matter the relief
sought (damages or equitable relief), no matter the target
of the prisoner's suit (state conduct leading to conviction or
internal prison proceedings)--if success in that action would
necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its
duration.

Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude
that respondents' claims are cognizable under $ 1983, i. e.,
they do not fall within the implicit habeas exception.
Dotson and Johnson seek relief that will render invalid the
state procedures used to deny parole eligibility (Dotson) and
parole suitability (Johnson). See Wolff, 418 U. S., at 554-555.
Neither respondent seeks an injunction ordering his immediate or speedier release into the community. See Preiser, 411
U. S., at 500; Wolff, supra, at 554. And as in Wolff, a favorable judgment will not "necessarily imply the invalidity of
[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s]." Heck, supra, at 487.
Success for Dotson does not mean immediate release from
confinement or a shorter stay in prison; it means at most new
eligibility review, which at most will speed consideration of
a new parole application. Success for Johnson means at
most a new parole hearing at which Ohio parole authorities
may, in their discretion, decline to shorten his prison term.
See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2967.03 (Lexis 2003) (describing
the parole authority's broad discretionary powers); Inmates
of Orient Correctional Inst. v. Ohio State Adult Parole
Auth., 929 F. 2d 233, 236 (CA6 1991) (same); see also Tr. of
Oral Arg. 18 (petitioners' counsel conceding that success on
respondents' claims would not inevitably lead to release).
Because neither prisoner's claim would necessarily spell
speedier release, neither lies at "the core of habeas corpus."
Preiser, supra, at 489. Finally, the prisoners' claims for future relief (which, if successful, will not necessarily imply the
invalidity of confinement or shorten its duration) are yet
more distant from that core. See Balisok, supra, at 648.

Opinion of the Court
The dissent disagrees with our legal analysis and advo-cates use of a different legal standard in critical part because, in its view, (1) a habeas challenge to a sentence (a"core" challenge) does not necessarily produce the prisoner's
"release" (so our standard "must be . . . wrong"), see post, at88, 91; and (2) Heck's standard is irrelevant because Heck
concerned only damages, see post, at 91. As to the first, webelieve that a case challenging a sentence seeks a prisoner's
"release" in the only pertinent sense: It seeks invalidation (inwhole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the prisoner's
confinement; the fact that the State may seek a new judg-ment (through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding) is
beside the point. As to the second, Balisok applied Heck'sstandard and addressed a claim seeking not only damages,
but also a separate declaration that the State's procedureswere unlawful. See 520 U. S., at 643, 647-648.

III
Ohio makes two additional arguments. First, Ohio pointsto language in

Heck indicating that a prisoner's $ 1983 dam-ages action cannot lie where a favorable judgment would

"necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sen-tence." 512 U. S., at 487 (emphasis added). Ohio then argues that its parole proceedings are part of the prisoners'"sentence[s]"--indeed, an aspect of the "sentence[s]" that the

$ 1983 claims, if successful, will invalidate.We do not find this argument persuasive. In context,
Heck uses the word "sentence" to refer not to prison proce-dures, but to substantive determinations as to the length of
confinement. See Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S. 749, 751,n. 1 (2004)

(per curiam) ("[T]he incarceration that mattersunder
Heck is the incarceration ordered by the original judgment of conviction"). Heck uses the word "sentence" inter-changeably with such other terms as "continuing confinement" and "imprisonment." 512 U. S., at 483, 486; see also

544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
84 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Opinion of the Court
Balisok, supra, at 645, 648 (referring to the invalidity of "the
judgment" or "punishment imposed"). So understood, Heck
is consistent with other cases permitting prisoners to bring

$ 1983 challenges to prison administrative decisions. See,
e. g., Wolff, supra, at 554-555; Muhammad, 540 U. S., at 754;
see also ibid. (rejecting "the mistaken view . . . that Heck
applies categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings"). Indeed, this Court has repeatedly permitted prisoners to bring $ 1983 actions challenging the conditions of their confinement--conditions that, were Ohio
right, might be considered part of the "sentence." See, e. g.,
Cooper v. Pate, 378 U. S. 546 (1964) (per curiam); Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249, 251 (1971) (per curiam). And
this interpretation of Heck is consistent with Balisok, where
the Court held the prisoner's suit Heck-barred not because it
sought nullification of the disciplinary procedures but rather
because nullification of the disciplinary procedures would
lead necessarily to restoration of good-time credits and hence
the shortening of the prisoner's sentence. 520 U. S., at 646.

Second, Ohio says that a decision in favor of respondents
would break faith with principles of federal/state comity by
opening the door to federal court without prior exhaustion
of state-court remedies. Our earlier cases, however, have
already placed the States' important comity considerations
in the balance, weighed them against the competing need to
vindicate federal rights without exhaustion, and concluded
that prisoners may bring their claims without fully exhausting state-court remedies so long as their suits, if established,
would not necessarily invalidate state-imposed confinement.
See Part II, supra. Thus, we see no reason for moving the
line these cases draw--particularly since Congress has already strengthened the requirement that prisoners exhaust
state administrative remedies as a precondition to any $ 1983
action. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S.
516, 524 (2002).

Scalia, J., concurring
For these reasons, the Sixth Circuit's judgment is affirmed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent

with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, which in my view reads Heck v.
Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), and Edwards v. Balisok, 520
U. S. 641 (1997), correctly. And I am in full agreement withthe Court's holding that "[b]ecause neither prisoner's claim

would necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at `thecore of habeas corpus' " and both may be brought under Rev.
Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Ante, at 82. I write sepa-rately to note that a contrary holding would require us to
broaden the scope of habeas relief beyond recognition.

Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973), and the cases
that follow it hold that Congress, in enacting $ 1983, preserved the habeas corpus statute as the sole authorization
for challenges to allegedly unlawful confinement. Id., at
489-490. At the time of $ 1983's adoption, the federal
habeas statute mirrored the common-law writ of habeas corpus, in that it authorized a single form of relief: the prisoner's immediate release from custody. See Act of Feb.
5, 1867, $ 1, 14 Stat. 386. Congress shortly thereafter
amended the statute, authorizing federal habeas courts to
"dispose of the party as law and justice require," Rev. Stat.

$ 761. The statute reads virtually the same today, 28
U. S. C. $ 2243 ("dispose of the matter as law and justice
require"). We have interpreted this broader remedial language to permit relief short of release. For example, when
a habeas petitioner challenges only one of several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate the challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains in custody to serve
the others. See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, 67 (1968);
Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U. S. 335, 336-337 (1968) (per cu544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring
riam). Thus, in Preiser we held the prisoners' $ 1983 actionbarred because the relief it sought--restoration of good-time

credits, which would shorten the prisoners' incarceration andhasten the date on which they would be transferred to supervised release--was available in habeas. See 411 U. S., at487-488.

It is one thing to say that permissible habeas relief, as
our cases interpret the statute, includes ordering a "quantumchange in the level of custody,"

Graham v. Broglin, 922 F. 2d
379, 381 (CA7 1991) (Posner, J.), such as release from incar-ceration to parole. It is quite another to say that the habeas

statute authorizes federal courts to order relief that neither
terminates custody, accelerates the future date of release
from custody, nor reduces the level of custody. That is what
is sought here: the mandating of a new parole hearing that
may or may not result in release, prescription of the composition of the hearing panel, and specification of the procedures
to be followed. A holding that this sort of judicial immersion in the administration of discretionary parole lies at the
"core of habeas" would utterly sever the writ from its
common-law roots. Cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 526,
n. 6 (1979) (treating as open the question whether prisonconditions claims are cognizable in habeas). The dissent
suggests that because a habeas court may issue a conditional
writ ordering a prisoner released unless the State conducts
a new sentencing proceeding, the court may also issue a conditional writ ordering release absent a new parole proceeding. See post, at 88-91 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). But the
prisoner who shows that his sentencing was unconstitutional
is actually entitled to release, because the judgment pursuant to which he is confined has been invalidated; the conditional writ serves only to "delay the release . . . in order to
provide the State an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation." Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 775
(1987); see In re Bonner, 151 U. S. 242, 259, 262 (1894) (conditional writ for proper resentencing). By contrast, the val544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

87Cite as: 544 U. S. 74 (2005)
Scalia, J., concurring
idly sentenced prisoner who shows only that the State madea procedural error in denying discretionary parole has

not
established a right to release, and so cannot obtain habeasrelief--conditional or otherwise. Conditional writs enable

habeas courts to give States time to replace an invalid judg-ment with a valid one, and the consequence when they fail
to do so is always release. Conditional writs are not an allpurpose weapon with which federal habeas courts can extortfrom the respondent custodian forms of relief short of release, whether a new parole hearing or a new mattress inthe applicant's cell.

Petitioners counter that we need not be concerned about
this expansion of habeas relief because prisoners will naturally prefer $ 1983 to habeas corpus, in light of the burdensome prerequisites attached to habeas relief by 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254. But those prerequisites, such as exhaustion of state
remedies, reliance on "clearly established Federal law," and
deference to previous findings of fact, apply only to "a person
in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,"

$$ 2254(b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1). By contrast, $ 2243's delineation
of the scope of permissible relief applies to all federal habeas
proceedings, whether the petitioner is in federal or state custody, see $ 2241(c). Thus, while $ 2254 may shield petitioners
and their fellow state wardens from the impact of the broadened writ they urge us to create, not every warden responding to a habeas petition can claim the same protection. And
federal prisoners, whose custodians are not acting under
color of state law and hence cannot be sued under $ 1983,
have greater incentives to shoehorn their claims into habeas.

Finally, I note that the Court's opinion focuses correctly
on whether the claims respondents pleaded were claims that
may be pursued in habeas--not on whether respondents can
be successful in obtaining habeas relief on those claims.
See, e. g., ante, at 80-81. Thus, for example, a prisoner who
wishes to challenge the length of his confinement, but who
cannot obtain federal habeas relief because of the statute

544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
88 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Kennedy, J., dissenting
of limitations or the restrictions on successive petitions,$$ 2244(a), (b), (d), cannot use the unavailability of federal

habeas relief in his individual case as grounds for proceedingunder $ 1983. Cf.

Preiser, supra, at 489-490 ("It would
wholly frustrate explicit congressional intent to hold that[state prisoners] could evade [the exhaustion] requirement by

the simple expedient of putting a different label on their
pleadings").With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
In this case, the Court insists that an attack on paroleproceedings brought under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983, may not be dismissed on the grounds that habeas cor-pus is the exclusive remedy for such claims. The primary
reason offered for the Court's holding is that an order entitling a prisoner to a new parole proceeding might not result
in his early release. That reason, however, applies with
equal logic and force to a sentencing proceeding. And since
it is elementary that habeas is the appropriate remedy for
challenging a sentence, something must be quite wrong with
the Court's own first premise.

Everyone knows that when a prisoner succeeds in a habeas
action and obtains a new sentencing hearing, the sentence
may or may not be reduced. The sentence can end up being
just the same, or perhaps longer. The prisoner's early
release is by no means assured simply because the first sentence was found unlawful. Yet no one would say that an
attack on judicial sentencing proceedings following conviction may be raised through an action under $ 1983. The inconsistency in the Court's treatment of sentencing proceedings and parole proceedings is thus difficult to justify. It
is, furthermore, in tension with our precedents. For these
reasons, I write this respectful dissent.

Challenges to parole proceedings are cognizable in habeas.
Here respondents challenge parole determinations that not

Kennedy, J., dissenting
only deny release (or eligibility for consideration for release)but also guarantee continued confinement until the next

scheduled parole proceeding. See ante, at 76-77 (majorityopinion). If a parole determination is made in a proceeding
flawed by errors of constitutional dimensions, as these re-spondents now allege, their continued confinement may well
be the result of constitutional violation. Respondents thus
raise a cognizable habeas claim of being "in custody in viola-tion of the Constitution." 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(c)(3); see also 1

R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice andProcedure $ 9.1, pp. 431-437, and n. 33 (4th ed. 2001) (noting
that "[t]he range of claims cognizable in federal habeas corpus" includes challenges to "the duration of sentence (including on the basis of parole, good time, and other prison- or
administratively, as opposed to court-administered rules)"
and citing numerous cases to that effect). In recognition of
this elementary principle, this Court and the courts of appeals have adjudicated the merits of many parole challenges
in federal habeas corpus proceedings. See, e. g., California
Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499 (1995);
Mickens-Thomas v. Vaughn, 321 F. 3d 374 (CA3 2003); Nulph
v. Faatz, 27 F. 3d 451 (CA9 1994) (per curiam); Fender v.
Thompson, 883 F. 2d 303 (CA4 1989).

My concerns with the Court's holding are increased, not
diminished, by the fact that the Court does not seem to
deny that respondents' claims indeed could be cognizable in
habeas corpus proceedings. Justice Scalia's concurring
opinion suggests otherwise, because respondents seek a form
of relief (new parole hearings) unavailable in habeas. Ante,
at 86-87. But the common practice of granting a conditional
writ--ordering that a State release the prisoner or else correct the constitutional error through a new hearing--already
allows a habeas court to compel the type of relief Justice
Scalia supposes to be unavailable. See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 775 (1987) ("Federal habeas corpus practice, as reflected by the decisions of this Court, indicates that

544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
90 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Kennedy, J., dissenting
a court has broad discretion in conditioning a judgment
granting habeas relief ").

Because habeas is available for parole challenges like respondents', Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973), thus
requires a holding that it also provides the exclusive vehicle
for them. In Preiser, the Court held that challenges to "the
very fact or duration of [a prisoner's] confinement," as opposed to "the conditions of . . . prison life," must be brought
in habeas, not under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. 411 U. S., at 499-
500. The language of $ 1983, to be sure, is capacious enough
to include a challenge to the fact or duration of confinement;
Preiser, nonetheless, established that because habeas is the
most specific applicable remedy it should be the exclusive
means for raising the challenge. Id., at 489. Respondents'
challenges to adverse parole system determinations relate
not at all to conditions of confinement but rather to the fact
and duration of confinement. See Butterfield v. Bail, 120
F. 3d 1023, 1024 (CA9 1997) ("[A] challenge to the procedures used in the denial of parole necessarily implicates the
validity of the denial of parole and, therefore, the prisoner's continuing confinement"). Straightforward application
of Preiser and the cases after it would yield the conclusion
that these claims must be brought in habeas.

The majority's contrary holding, permitting parole determination challenges to go forward under $ 1983, is not based
on any argument that these claims should be characterized
as challenges to conditions of confinement rather than to its
fact or duration. That argument is unavailable to the Court.
The majority must say instead that respondents' claims do
not fall into the " `core of habeas.' " Ante, at 82. For this,
it gives two reasons.

The first is that success on the claims will not necessarily entitle respondents to immediate release. Ibid. This,
as noted at the very outset, proves far too much. If the
Court's line of reasoning is sound, it would remove from the

544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

91Cite as: 544 U. S. 74 (2005)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
"core of habeas" any challenge to an unconstitutional sentencing procedure.

The second reason, that success on the claims does not
necessarily imply the invalidity of respondents' convictions
or sentences, ibid., is both misplaced and irrelevant. It is
misplaced, because it takes out of context the test employed
in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), and in Edwards
v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997). In both those cases there
was a temptation to seek only relief unavailable in habeas,
such as damages (and declaratory relief serving as a predicate to damages), and thus to do an end run around Preiser.
Heck, supra, at 481; Balisok, supra, at 643-644; see also
Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S. 749 (2004) (per curiam) (recognizing that damages are unavailable in habeas). Today's
case does not present that problem. The fact that respondents' claims do not impugn the validity of their convictions or
sentences is also irrelevant. True, respondents' contentions
have nothing to do with their original state-court convictions
or sentencing determinations. Stating this fact, however,
gets the Court no closer to resolving whether parole determinations themselves are subject to direct challenge only in
habeas. That is why we have held that administrative decisions denying good-time credits are subject to attack only
in habeas. Preiser, supra, at 477, 500; Balisok, supra, at
643-644.

The Court makes it a point to cite a sentence fragment
from Close, observing that " `the incarceration that matters
under Heck is the incarceration ordered by the original judgment of conviction,' " ante, at 83 (quoting 540 U. S., at 751,
n. 1). That statement, however, is inapplicable even on its
own terms, because it addresses the Heck problem, not this
one. Furthermore, even apart from Heck's inapplicability to
this case, the full sentence from which the majority takes
the quotation makes clear that the Court in Close was contrasting confinement per se with "special disciplinary con544US1 Unit: $U29 [11-07-07 19:16:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN
92 WILKINSON v. DOTSON

Kennedy, J., dissenting
finement for infraction of prison rules," 540 U. S., at 751, n. 1.That simply is not at issue here. In sum, neither of the

majority's stated principles can justify its deviation from theholding Preiser demands.

Today's ruling blurs the Preiser formulation. It is appar-ent that respondents' challenges relate not at all to conditions of confinement but solely to its duration. Notwith-standing

Preiser's direction that challenges to the fact orduration of confinement should be restricted to habeas, the

Court's decision will allow numerous $ 1983 challenges tostate parole system determinations that do relate solely to
the duration of the prisoners' confinement.It is unsurprising, then, that 18 States have filed an amicus brief joining with Ohio in urging the opposite result, seeBrief for Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae. Today's decision
allows state prisoners raising parole challenges to circum-vent the state courts. Compare 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A)
(providing that a person in custody pursuant to a state-courtjudgment must in general exhaust all "remedies available in
the courts of the State" before seeking federal habeas relief)with 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (requiring only that a prisoner exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a $ 1983 ac-tion to challenge "prison conditions"). Parole systems no
doubt have variations from State to State. It is within thespecial province and expertise of the state courts to address
challenges to their own state parole determinations in thefirst instance, particularly because many challenges raise
state procedural questions. Today the Court, over the ob-jection of many States, deprives the federal courts of the
invaluable assistance and frontline expertise found in thestate courts.

For the reasons given above, I would reverse.

MUEHLER et al. v. MENA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-1423. Argued December 8, 2004--Decided March 22, 2005
Respondent Mena and others were detained in handcuffs during a search

of the premises they occupied. Petitioners were lead members of a police detachment executing a search warrant of these premises for, inter
alia, deadly weapons and evidence of gang membership. Mena sued
the officers under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the District Court found in her
favor. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the use of handcuffs to
detain Mena during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that
the officers' questioning of Mena about her immigration status during
the detention constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation.

Held:

1. Mena's detention in handcuffs for the length of the search did not
violate the Fourth Amendment. That detention is consistent with
Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, in which the Court held that
officers executing a search warrant for contraband have the authority
"to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted." The Court there noted that minimizing the risk of harm to
officers is a substantial justification for detaining an occupant during a
search, id., at 702-703, and ruled that an officer's authority to detain
incident to a search is categorical and does not depend on the "quantum
of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed
by the seizure," id., at 705, n. 19. Because a warrant existed to search
the premises and Mena was an occupant of the premises at the time of
the search, her detention for the duration of the search was reasonable
under Summers. Inherent in Summers' authorization to detain is the
authority to use reasonable force to effectuate the detention. See
Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396. The use of force in the form
of handcuffs to detain Mena was reasonable because the governmental
interest in minimizing the risk of harm to both officers and occupants,
at its maximum when a warrant authorizes a search for weapons and a
wanted gang member resides on the premises, outweighs the marginal
intrusion. See id., at 396-397. Moreover, the need to detain multiple
occupants made the use of handcuffs all the more reasonable. Cf.
Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414. Although the duration of a
detention can affect the balance of interests, the 2- to 3-hour detention

Syllabus
in handcuffs in this case does not outweigh the government's continuing
safety interests. Pp. 98-100.

2. The officers' questioning of Mena about her immigration status during her detention did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights. The
Ninth Circuit's holding to the contrary appears premised on the assumption that the officers were required to have independent reasonable suspicion in order to so question Mena. However, this Court has "held
repeatedly that mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure."
Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 434. Because Mena's initial detention
was lawful and the Ninth Circuit did not hold that the detention was
prolonged by the questioning, there was no additional seizure within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and, therefore, no additional Fourth
Amendment justification for inquiring about Mena's immigration status
was required. Cf. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407-408. Pp. 100-
101.

3. Because the Ninth Circuit did not address Mena's alternative argument that her detention extended beyond the time the police completed
the tasks incident to the search, this Court declines to address it. See,
e. g., Pierce County v. Guillen, 537 U. S. 129, 148, n. 10. P. 102.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Respondent Iris Mena was detained in handcuffs during asearch of the premises that she and several others occupied.
Petitioners were lead members of a police detachment exe-cuting a search warrant of these premises. She sued the
officers under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the
District Court found in her favor. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgment, holding that the use of handcuffs to
detain Mena during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers' questioning of Mena about her
immigration status during the detention constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation. Mena v. Simi
Valley, 332 F. 3d 1255 (CA9 2003). We hold that Mena's
detention in handcuffs for the length of the search was consistent with our opinion in Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S.
692 (1981), and that the officers' questioning during that
detention did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights.

* * *
Based on information gleaned from the investigation of a
gang-related, driveby shooting, petitioners Muehler and Brill
had reason to believe at least one member of a gang--the
West Side Locos--lived at 1363 Patricia Avenue. They also
suspected that the individual was armed and dangerous,
since he had recently been involved in the driveby shooting.

Opinion of the Court
evidence of gang membership. In light of the high degree
of risk involved in searching a house suspected of housing at
least one, and perhaps multiple, armed gang members, a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team was used to secure
the residence and grounds before the search.

At 7 a.m. on February 3, 1998, petitioners, along with the
SWAT team and other officers, executed the warrant. Mena
was asleep in her bed when the SWAT team, clad in helmets and black vests adorned with badges and the word
"POLICE," entered her bedroom and placed her in handcuffs
at gunpoint. The SWAT team also handcuffed three other
individuals found on the property. The SWAT team then
took those individuals and Mena into a converted garage,
which contained several beds and some other bedroom furniture. While the search proceeded, one or two officers
guarded the four detainees, who were allowed to move
around the garage but remained in handcuffs.

Aware that the West Side Locos gang was composed primarily of illegal immigrants, the officers had notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that they would
be conducting the search, and an INS officer accompanied
the officers executing the warrant. During their detention
in the garage, an officer asked for each detainee's name, date
of birth, place of birth, and immigration status. The INS
officer later asked the detainees for their immigration documentation. Mena's status as a permanent resident was confirmed by her papers.

The search of the premises yielded a .22 caliber handgun
with .22 caliber ammunition, a box of .25 caliber ammunition,
several baseball bats with gang writing, various additional
gang paraphernalia, and a bag of marijuana. Before the officers left the area, Mena was released.

In her $ 1983 suit against the officers she alleged that she
was detained "for an unreasonable time and in an unreasonable manner" in violation of the Fourth Amendment. App.

Opinion of the Court
19. In addition, she claimed that the warrant and its execution were overbroad, that the officers failed to comply with
the "knock and announce" rule, and that the officers had
needlessly destroyed property during the search. The officers moved for summary judgment, asserting that they were
entitled to qualified immunity, but the District Court denied
their motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed that denial,
except for Mena's claim that the warrant was overbroad; on
this claim the Court of Appeals held that the officers were
entitled to qualified immunity. Mena v. Simi Valley, 226
F. 3d 1031 (CA9 2000). After a trial, a jury, pursuant to a
special verdict form, found that Officers Muehler and Brill
violated Mena's Fourth Amendment right to be free from
unreasonable seizures by detaining her both with force
greater than that which was reasonable and for a longer period than that which was reasonable. The jury awarded
Mena $10,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive damages against each petitioner for a total of $60,000.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on two
grounds. 332 F. 3d 1255 (CA9 2003). Reviewing the denial
of qualified immunity de novo, id., at 1261, n. 2, it first held
that the officers' detention of Mena violated the Fourth
Amendment because it was objectively unreasonable to confine her in the converted garage and keep her in handcuffs
during the search, id., at 1263-1264. In the Court of Appeals' view, the officers should have released Mena as soon
as it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. Id.,
at 1263. The court additionally held that the questioning of
Mena about her immigration status constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation. Id., at 1264-1266. The
Court of Appeals went on to hold that those rights were
clearly established at the time of Mena's questioning, and
thus the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity.
Id., at 1266-1267. We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 903
(2004), and now vacate and remand.

98 MUEHLER v. MENA

Opinion of the Court

* * *
In Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), we heldthat officers executing a search warrant for contraband have

the authority "to detain the occupants of the premises whilea proper search is conducted."

Id., at 705. Such detentionsare appropriate, we explained, because the character of the

additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and becausethe justifications for detention are substantial. Id., at 701-
705. We made clear that the detention of an occupant is"surely less intrusive than the search itself," and the presence of a warrant assures that a neutral magistrate hasdetermined that probable cause exists to search the home.
Id., at 701. Against this incremental intrusion, we positedthree legitimate law enforcement interests that provide substantial justification for detaining an occupant: "preventingflight in the event that incriminating evidence is found";
"minimizing the risk of harm to the officers"; and facilitating"the orderly completion of the search," as detainees' "selfinterest may induce them to open locked doors or locked con-tainers to avoid the use of force."

Id., at 702-703.Mena's detention was, under Summers, plainly permissible.1 An officer's authority to detain incident to a searchis categorical; it does not depend on the "quantum of proof
justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be im-posed by the seizure."

Id., at 705, n. 19. Thus, Mena's de-tention for the duration of the search was reasonable under

Summers because a warrant existed to search 1363 PatriciaAvenue and she was an occupant of that address at the time
of the search.Inherent in Summers' authorization to detain an occupant
of the place to be searched is the authority to use reasonable

1 In determining whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred we
draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the jury verdict, but as
we made clear in Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 697-699 (1996),
we do not defer to the jury's legal conclusion that those facts violate the
Constitution.

force to effectuate the detention. See Graham v. Connor,490 U. S. 386, 396 (1989) ("Fourth Amendment jurisprudence

has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or inves-tigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some
degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it").Indeed, Summers itself stressed that the risk of harm to
officers and occupants is minimized "if the officers routinelyexercise unquestioned command of the situation. " 452
U. S., at 703.The officers' use of force in the form of handcuffs to effectuate Mena's detention in the garage, as well as the detentionof the three other occupants, was reasonable because the
governmental interests outweigh the marginal intrusion.See

Graham, supra, at 396-397. The imposition of correctlyapplied handcuffs on Mena, who was already being lawfully

detained during a search of the house, was undoubtedly aseparate intrusion in addition to detention in the converted
garage.2 The detention was thus more intrusive than thatwhich we upheld in

Summers. See 452 U. S., at 701-702(concluding that the additional intrusion in the form of a detention was less than that of the warrant-sanctioned search);Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 413-414 (1997) (conclud2 In finding the officers should have released Mena from the handcuffs,
the Court of Appeals improperly relied upon the fact that the warrant did
not include Mena as a suspect. See Mena v. Simi Valley, 332 F. 3d 1255,
1263, n. 5 (CA9 2003). The warrant was concerned not with individuals
but with locations and property. In particular, the warrant in this case
authorized the search of 1363 Patricia Avenue and its surrounding grounds
for, among other things, deadly weapons and evidence of street gang membership. In this respect, the warrant here resembles that at issue in
Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), which allowed the search of a
residence for drugs without mentioning any individual, including the
owner of the home whom police ultimately arrested. See People v.
Summers, 407 Mich. 432, 440-443, 286 N. W. 2d 226, 226-227 (1979), rev'd,
Michigan v. Summers, supra. Summers makes clear that when a neutral
magistrate has determined police have probable cause to believe contraband exists, "[t]he connection of an occupant to [a] home" alone "justifies
a detention of that occupant." 452 U. S., at 703-704.

Opinion of the Court
ing that the additional intrusion from ordering passengersout of a car, which was already stopped, was minimal).

But this was no ordinary search. The governmental in-terests in not only detaining, but using handcuffs, are at their
maximum when, as here, a warrant authorizes a search forweapons and a wanted gang member resides on the premises.
In such inherently dangerous situations, the use of handcuffs
minimizes the risk of harm to both officers and occupants.Cf.

Summers, supra, at 702-703 (recognizing the execution
of a warrant to search for drugs "may give rise to suddenviolence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence").

Though this safety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for weapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs, the need to detain multiple occupants made the use of
handcuffs all the more reasonable. Cf. Maryland v. Wilson,
supra, at 414 (noting that "danger to an officer from a traffic
stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in
addition to the driver in the stopped car").

Mena argues that, even if the use of handcuffs to detain
her in the garage was reasonable as an initial matter, the
duration of the use of handcuffs made the detention unreasonable. The duration of a detention can, of course, affect
the balance of interests under Graham. However, the 2- to
3-hour detention in handcuffs in this case does not outweigh
the government's continuing safety interests. As we have
noted, this case involved the detention of four detainees by
two officers during a search of a gang house for dangerous
weapons. We conclude that the detention of Mena in handcuffs during the search was reasonable.

The Court of Appeals also determined that the officers violated Mena's Fourth Amendment rights by questioning her
about her immigration status during the detention. 332
F. 3d, at 1264-1266. This holding, it appears, was premised
on the assumption that the officers were required to have
independent reasonable suspicion in order to question Mena
concerning her immigration status because the questioning

Opinion of the Court
constituted a discrete Fourth Amendment event. But thepremise is faulty. We have "held repeatedly that mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure." Florida v.Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 434 (1991); see also INS v. Delgado,
466 U. S. 210, 212 (1984). "[E]ven when officers have nobasis for suspecting a particular individual, they may generally ask questions of that individual; ask to examine theindividual's identification; and request consent to search his
or her luggage." Bostick, supra, at 434-435 (citations omit-ted). As the Court of Appeals did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the questioning, there was no addi-tional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
Hence, the officers did not need reasonable suspicion to askMena for her name, date and place of birth, or immigration
status.Our recent opinion in

Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405(2005), is instructive. There, we held that a dog sniff performed during a traffic stop does not violate the FourthAmendment. We noted that a lawful seizure "can become
unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably re-quired to complete that mission," but accepted the state
court's determination that the duration of the stop was notextended by the dog sniff.

Id., at 407. Because we heldthat a dog sniff was not a search subject to the Fourth

Amendment, we rejected the notion that "the shift in pur-pose" "from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation"
was unlawful because it "was not supported by any reason-able suspicion." Id., at 408. Likewise here, the initial
Summers detention was lawful; the Court of Appeals didnot find that the questioning extended the time Mena was
detained. Thus no additional Fourth Amendment justifica-tion for inquiring about Mena's immigration status was
required.3

3 The Court of Appeals' reliance on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422
U. S. 873 (1975), is misplaced. Brignoni-Ponce held that stops by roving
patrols near the border "may be justified on facts that do not amount to

Kennedy, J., concurring
In summary, the officers' detention of Mena in handcuffsduring the execution of the search warrant was reasonable

and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Additionally,the officers' questioning of Mena did not constitute an independent Fourth Amendment violation. Mena has advancedin this Court, as she did before the Court of Appeals, an
alternative argument for affirming the judgment below.She asserts that her detention extended beyond the time the
police completed the tasks incident to the search. Becausethe Court of Appeals did not address this contention, we too
decline to address it. See Pierce County v. Guillen, 537U. S. 129, 148, n. 10 (2003);

National Collegiate AthleticAssn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 469-470 (1999).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is thereforevacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I concur in the judgment and in the opinion of the Court.It does seem important to add this brief statement to help

ensure that police handcuffing during searches becomes nei-ther routine nor unduly prolonged.

The safety of the officers and the efficacy of the search arematters of first concern, but so too is it a matter of first
concern that excessive force is not used on the personsdetained, especially when these persons, though lawfully
detained under Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981),are not themselves suspected of any involvement in criminal

the probable cause require[ment] for an arrest." Id., at 880. We considered only whether the patrols had the "authority to stop automobiles in
areas near the Mexican border," id., at 874 (emphasis added), and expressed no opinion as to the appropriateness of questioning when an individual was already seized. See United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428
U. S. 543, 556-562 (1976). We certainly did not, as the Court of Appeals
suggested, create a "requirement of particularized reasonable suspicion
for purposes of inquiry into citizenship status." 332 F. 3d, at 1267.

activity. The use of handcuffs is the use of force, and suchforce must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances, Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989).The reasonableness calculation under

Graham is in part a
function of the expected and actual duration of the search.If the search extends to the point when the handcuffs can

cause real pain or serious discomfort, provision must be
made to alter the conditions of detention at least long enoughto attend to the needs of the detainee. This is so even if

there is no question that the initial handcuffing was objec-tively reasonable. The restraint should also be removed if,
at any point during the search, it would be readily apparent
to any objectively reasonable officer that removing the handcuffs would not compromise the officers' safety or risk interference or substantial delay in the execution of the search.
The time spent in the search here, some two to three hours,
certainly approaches, and may well exceed, the time beyond
which a detainee's Fourth Amendment interests require revisiting the necessity of handcuffing in order to ensure the
restraint, even if permissible as an initial matter, has not
become excessive.

That said, under these circumstances I do not think handcuffing the detainees for the duration of the search was objectively unreasonable. As I understand the record, during
much of this search 2 armed officers were available to watch
over the 4 unarmed detainees, while the other 16 officers on
the scene conducted an extensive search of a suspected gang
safe house. Even if we accept as true--as we must--the
factual assertions that these detainees posed no readily apparent danger and that keeping them handcuffed deviated
from standard police procedure, it does not follow that the
handcuffs were unreasonable. Where the detainees outnumber those supervising them, and this situation could not
be remedied without diverting officers from an extensive,
complex, and time-consuming search, the continued use of
handcuffs after the initial sweep may be justified, subject to

adjustments or temporary release under supervision to avoidpain or excessive physical discomfort. Because on this record it does not appear the restraints were excessive, I jointhe opinion of the Court.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in thejudgment.

The jury in this case found that the two petitioners vio-lated Iris Mena's Fourth Amendment right to be free from
unreasonable seizure by detaining her with greater force andfor a longer period of time than was reasonable under the
circumstances. In their post-trial motion in the DistrictCourt, petitioners advanced three legal arguments: (1) They
were entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitu-tionality of their conduct was not clearly established;

1 (2) the

judge's instruction to the jury was erroneous; 2 and (3) theevidence was not sufficient to support the jury's award of

1 The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the officers were not entitled to
qualified immunity was not challenged in the petition for certiorari and is
therefore waived. See Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 645-
646 (1992).

2 The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:

" `Generally, a police officer carrying out a search authorized by a warrant may detain occupants of the residence during the search, so long as
the detention is reasonable.

" `In determining the reasonableness of a detention conducted in connection with a search, you may look to all the circumstances, including the
severity of the suspected crime, whether the person being detained is the
subject of the investigation, whether such person poses an immediate
threat to the security of the police or others or to the ability of the police
to conduct the search, and whether such person is actively resisting arrest
or attempting to flee. A detention may be unreasonable if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged or if it involves an undue invasion of
privacy. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in
connection with a lawful search as soon as the officers' right to conduct
the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.' "

punitive damages. The trial judge's thoughtful explanationof his reasons for denying the motion does not address either

of the issues the Court discusses today.In its opinion affirming the judgment, the Court of Appeals made two mistakes. First, as the Court explains,ante, at 100-101, it erroneously held that the immigration
officers' questioning of Mena about her immigration statuswas an independent violation of the Fourth Amendment.

3

Second, instead of merely deciding whether there was suffi-cient evidence in the record to support the jury's verdict, the

Court of Appeals appears to have ruled as a matter of lawthat the officers should have released her from the handcuffs
sooner than they did. I agree that it is appropriate to re-mand the case to enable the Court of Appeals to consider
whether the evidence supports Mena's contention that shewas held longer than the search actually lasted. In doing
so, the Court of Appeals must of course accord appropriatedeference to the jury's reasonable factual findings, while
applying the correct legal standard. See Ornelas v. UnitedStates, 517 U. S. 690, 699 (1996).

In my judgment, however, the Court's discussion of theamount of force used to detain Mena pursuant to Michigan
v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), is analytically unsound.Although the Court correctly purports to apply the "objective reasonableness" test announced in Graham v. Connor,490 U. S. 386 (1989), it misapplies that test. Given the facts
of this case--and the presumption that a reviewing courtmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of supporting
the verdict--I think it clear that the jury could properlyhave found that this 5-foot-2-inch young lady posed no threat
to the officers at the scene, and that they used excessiveforce in keeping her in handcuffs for up to three hours. Although Summers authorizes the detention of any individual

3 While I agree with the Court's discussion of this issue, I note that the
issue was not properly presented to the Ninth Circuit because it was not
raised by either petitioners or respondent.

who is present when a valid search warrant is being exe-cuted, that case does not give officers carte blanche to keep

individuals who pose no threat in handcuffs throughout asearch, no matter how long it may last. On remand, I would
therefore instruct the Court of Appeals to consider whetherthe evidence supports Mena's contention that the petitioners
used excessive force in detaining her when it considers thelength of the

Summers detention.

As the Court notes, the warrant in this case authorizedthe police to enter the Mena home to search for a gun belonging to Raymond Romero that may have been used in a gang-related driveby shooting. Romero, a known member of the
West Side Locos gang, rented a room from the Mena family.The house, described as a " `poor house,' " was home to several unrelated individuals who rented from the Menas.Brief for Petitioners 4. Each resident had his or her own
bedroom, which could be locked with a padlock on the out-side, and each had access to the living room and kitchen. In
addition, several individuals lived in trailers in the back yardand also had access to the common spaces in the Mena home.
Id., at 5.In addition to Romero, police had reason to believe that at
least one other West Side Locos gang member had lived atthe residence, although Romero's brother told police that the
individual had returned to Mexico. The officers in charge ofthe search, petitioners Muehler and Brill, had been at the
same residence a few months earlier on an unrelated do-mestic violence call, but did not see any other individuals
they believed to be gang members inside the home on thatoccasion.

In light of the fact that the police believed that Romeropossessed a gun and that there might be other gang members at the residence, petitioner Muehler decided to use aSpecial Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team to execute the

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
warrant. As described in the majority opinion, eight mem-bers of the SWAT team forcefully entered the home at 7 a.m.

In fact, Mena was the only occupant of the house, and shewas asleep in her bedroom. The police woke her up at gunpoint, and immediately handcuffed her. At the same time,officers served another search warrant at the home of Romero's mother, where Romero was known to stay several nightseach week. In part because Romero's mother had previously cooperated with police officers, they did not use aSWAT team to serve that warrant. Romero was found at
his mother's house; after being cited for possession of a smallamount of marijuana, he was released.

Meanwhile, after the SWAT team secured the Mena resi-dence and gave the "all clear," police officers transferred
Mena and three other individuals (who had been in trailersin the back yard) to a converted garage.

4 To get to the garage, Mena, who was still in her bedclothes, was forced towalk barefoot through the pouring rain. The officers kept

her and the other three individuals in the garage for up tothree hours while they searched the home. Although she
requested them to remove the handcuffs, they refused to doso. For the duration of the search, two officers guarded
Mena and the other three detainees. A .22-caliber handgun,ammunition, and gang-related paraphernalia were found in
Romero's bedroom, and other gang-related paraphernaliawas found in the living room. Officers found nothing of significance in Mena's bedroom.5 Id., at 6-9.

4 The other individuals were a 55-year-old Latina female, a 40-year-old
Latino male who was removed from the scene by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), and a white male who appears to be in his
early 30's and who was cited for possession of a small amount of marijuana.

5 One of the justifications for our decision in Michigan v. Summers, 452

U. S. 692 (1981), was the fact that the occupants may be willing to "open
locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only
damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at
hand." Id., at 703. Mena, however, was never asked to assist the officers, although she testified that she was willing to do so. See 3 Tr. 42

II
In analyzing the quantum of force used to effectuate the
Summers detention, the Court rightly employs the "objec-tive reasonableness" test of Graham. Under Graham, the

trier of fact must balance " `the nature and quality of theintrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests'
against the countervailing governmental interests at stake."490 U. S., at 396. The District Court correctly instructed
the jury to take into consideration such factors as " `theseverity of the suspected crime, whether the person being
detained is the subject of the investigation, whether suchperson poses an immediate threat to the security of the police or others or to the ability of the police to conduct thesearch, and whether such person is actively resisting arrest
or attempting to flee.' " See n. 2, supra. The DistrictCourt also correctly instructed the jury to consider whether
the detention was prolonged and whether Mena was detainedin handcuffs after the search had ended.

Ibid. Many ofthese factors are taken from Graham itself, and the jury instruction reflects an entirely reasonable construction of theobjective reasonableness test in the Summers context.

Considering those factors, it is clear that the SWAT team'sinitial actions were reasonable. When officers undertake a
dangerous assignment to execute a warrant to search property that is presumably occupied by violence-prone gangmembers, it may well be appropriate to use both overwhelming force and surprise in order to secure the premises aspromptly as possible. In this case the decision to use a
SWAT team of eight heavily armed officers and to executethe warrant at 7 a.m. gave the officers maximum protection
against the anticipated risk. As it turned out, there wasonly one person in the house--Mena--and she was sound
asleep. Nevertheless, "[t]he `reasonableness' of a particular
(June 14, 2001). Instead, officers broke the locks on several cabinets and
dressers to which Mena possessed the keys.

use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reason-able officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of

hindsight." Graham, 490 U. S., at 396. At the time theyfirst encountered Mena, the officers had no way of knowing
her relation to Romero, whether she was affiliated with theWest Side Locos, or whether she had any weapons on her
person. Further, the officers needed to use overwhelmingforce to immediately take command of the situation; by handcuffing Mena they could more quickly secure her room andjoin the other officers. It would be unreasonable to expect
officers, who are entering what they believe to be a high risk
situation, to spend the time necessary to determine whetherMena was a threat before they handcuffed her. To the extent that the Court of Appeals relied on the initial actions ofthe SWAT team to find that there was sufficient evidence to
support the jury's verdict, it was in error.Whether the well-founded fears that justified the extraordinary entry into the house should also justify a prolongedinterruption of the morning routine of a presumptively innocent person, however, is a separate question and one that
depends on the specific facts of the case. This is true withrespect both to how the handcuffs were used, and to the

totality of the circumstances surrounding the detention, in-cluding whether Mena was detained in handcuffs after the
search had concluded. With regard to the handcuffs, policemay use them in different ways.

6 Here, the cuffs kept

Mena's arms behind her for two to three hours. She testi-fied that they were " `real uncomfortable' " and that she had

asked the officers to remove them, but that they had refused.App. 105. Moreover, she was continuously guarded by two

join the wrists either in the front or the back of the torso. They can be
so tight that they are painful, particularly when applied for prolonged

flight if the prisoner is not kept under constant surveillance.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
police officers who obviously made flight virtually impossible
even if the cuffs had been removed.

A jury could reasonably have found a number of facts supporting a conclusion that the prolonged handcuffing was unreasonable. No contraband was found in Mena's room or on
her person. There were no indications suggesting she was
or ever had been a gang member, which was consistent with
the fact that during the police officers' last visit to the home,
no gang members were present. She fully cooperated with
the officers and the INS agent, answering all their questions.
She was unarmed, and given her small size, was clearly no
match for either of the two armed officers who were guarding her. In sum, there was no evidence that Mena posed
any threat to the officers or anyone else.

The justifications offered by the officers are not persuasive. They have argued that at least six armed officers were
required to guard the four detainees, even though all of them
had been searched for weapons. Since there were 18 officers at the scene, and since at least 1 officer who at one point
guarded Mena and the other three residents was sent home
after offering to assist in the search, it seems unlikely that
lack of resources was really a problem. While a court
should not ordinarily question the allocation of police officers
or resources, a jury could have reasonably found that this is
a case where ample resources were available.

The jury may also have been skeptical of testimony that
the officers in fact feared for their safety given that the actual suspect of the shooting had been found at the other location and promptly released. Additionally, while the officers
testified that as a general matter they would not release an
individual from handcuffs while searching a residence, the
SWAT team's tactical plan for this particular search arguably
called for them to do just that, since it directed that "[a]ny
subjects encountered will be handcuffed and detained until
they can be patted down, their location noted, [field identi544US1 Unit: $U30 [11-02-07 17:31:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fied], and released by Officer Muehler or Officer R. Brill." 2Record 53. The tactical plan suggests that they can, and

often do, release individuals who are not related to thesearch. The SWAT team leader testified that handcuffs are
not always required when executing a search.In short, under the factors listed in Graham and those
validly presented to the jury in the jury instructions, a jurycould have reasonably found from the evidence that there
was no apparent need to handcuff Mena for the entire dura-tion of the search and that she was detained for an unreasonably prolonged period. She posed no threat whatsoever tothe officers at the scene. She was not suspected of any
crime and was not a person targeted by the search warrant.She had no reason to flee the scene and gave no indication
that she desired to do so. Viewing the facts in the lightmost favorable to the jury's verdict, as we are required to
do, there is certainly no obvious factual basis for rejectingthe jury's verdict that the officers acted unreasonably, and
no obvious basis for rejecting the conclusion that, on thesefacts, the quantum of force used was unreasonable as a matter of law. III

Police officers' legitimate concern for their own safety isalways a factor that should weigh heavily in balancing the
relevant Graham factors. But, as Officer Brill admitted attrial, if that justification were always sufficient, it would authorize the handcuffing of every occupant of the premises forthe duration of every

Summers detention. Nothing in
either the Summers or the Graham opinion provides anysupport for such a result. Rather, the decision of what force

to use must be made on a case-by-case basis. There is evi-dence in this record that may well support the conclusion
that it was unreasonable to handcuff Mena throughout thesearch. On remand, therefore, I would instruct the Ninth
Circuit to consider that evidence, as well as the possibility

CITY OF RANCHO PALOS VERDES et al. v. ABRAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-1601. Argued January 19, 2005--Decided March 22, 2005
After petitioner City denied respondent Abrams permission to construct

a radio tower on his property, he filed this action seeking, inter alia,
injunctive relief under $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of
1934, 47 U. S. C. $ 332(c)(7), as added by the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (TCA), and money damages under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Section
332(c)(7) imposes specific limitations on the traditional authority of
state and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and
modification of wireless communications facilities, and provides, in

$ 332(c)(7)(B)(v), that anyone "adversely affected by any final action . . .
by [such] a . . . government . . . may . . . commence an action in
any court of competent jurisdiction." The District Court held that

$ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the City's actions
and, accordingly, ordered the City to grant respondent's application for
a conditional-use permit, but refused respondent's request for damages
under $ 1983. The Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point.

Held: An individual may not enforce $ 332(c)(7)'s limitations on local zoning authority through a $ 1983 action. The TCA--by providing a judicial remedy different from $ 1983 in $ 332(c)(7) itself--precluded resort
to $ 1983. Pp. 119-127.

(a) Even after a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates
an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he
belongs, see Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 285, the defendant
may rebut the presumption that the right is enforceable under $ 1983
by, inter alia, showing a contrary congressional intent from the statute's
creation of a "comprehensive remedial scheme that is inconsistent with
individual enforcement under $ 1983," Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S.
329, 341. The Court's cases demonstrate that the provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress did not intend to leave open a remedy under

$ 1983. Pp. 119-120.

(b) Congress could not have meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by $ 332(c)(7) to coexist with an alternative remedy available
under $ 1983, since enforcement of the former through the latter would
distort the scheme of expedited judicial review and limited remedies
created by $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The TCA adds no remedies to those avail544US1 Unit: $U31 [11-02-07 17:37:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
able under $ 1983, and limits relief in ways that $ 1983 does not. In
contrast to a $ 1983 action, TCA judicial review must be sought within
30 days after the governmental entity has taken "final action," and, once
the action is filed, the court must "hear and decide" it "on an expedited
basis." $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). Moreover, unlike $ 1983 remedies, TCA remedies perhaps do not include compensatory damages, and certainly do
not include attorney's fees and costs. The Court rejects Abrams's
arguments for borrowing $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s 30-day limitations period,
rather than applying the longer statute of limitations authorized under
42 U. S. C. $ 1988 or 28 U. S. C. $ 1658, in $ 1983 actions asserting

$ 332(c)(7)(B) violations. Pp. 120-125.

(c) In concluding that Congress intended to permit plaintiffs to proceed under $ 1983, the Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the TCA's so-called
"saving clause," which provides: "This Act . . . shall not be construed
to . . . impair . . . Federal . . . law." Construing $ 332(c)(7), as this Court
does, to create rights that may be enforced only through the statute's
express remedy does not "impair" $ 1983 because it leaves $ 1983's preTCA operation entirely unaffected. Pp. 125-127.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
We decide in this case whether an individual may enforcethe limitations on local zoning authority set forth in

U. S. C. $ 1983. I

Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996(TCA), 110 Stat. 56, to promote competition and higher quality in American telecommunications services and to "encour-age the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies." Ibid. One of the means by which it sought toaccomplish these goals was reduction of the impediments imposed by local governments upon the installation of facilitiesfor wireless communications, such as antenna towers. To
this end, the TCA amended the Communications Act of 1934,48 Stat. 1064, to include $ 332(c)(7), which imposes specific
limitations on the traditional authority of state and local gov-ernments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of such facilities, 110 Stat. 151, codified at 47 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 332(c)(7). Under this provision, local governments maynot "unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services," $ 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), take actionsthat "prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services," $ 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), orlimit the placement of wireless facilities "on the basis of
the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,"$ 332(c)(7)(B)(iv). They must act on requests for authorization to locate wireless facilities "within a reasonable periodof time," $ 332(c)(7)(B)(ii), and each decision denying such a
request must "be in writing and supported by substantialevidence contained in a written record," $ 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).
Lastly, $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which is central to the present case,provides as follows:

"Any person adversely affected by any final action orfailure to act by a State or local government or any
instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with thissubparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or
failure to act, commence an action in any court of compe-tent jurisdiction."

Respondent Mark Abrams owns a home in a low-density,residential neighborhood in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes,
California (City). His property is located at a high eleva-tion, near the peak of the Rancho Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 101 Cal. App. 4th 367, 371,124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 80, 82 (2002). The record reflects that the
location is both scenic and, because of its high elevation, idealfor radio transmissions.

Id., at 371-372, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d,at 82-83.

In 1989, respondent obtained a permit from the City toconstruct a 52.5-foot antenna on his property for amateur
use.1 He installed the antenna shortly thereafter, and in the

1 The City's approval specified a maximum height of 40 feet, but, because
of an administrative error, the permit itself authorized respondent to construct a tower 12.5 feet taller. 354 F. 3d 1094, 1095 (CA9 2004).

Opinion of the Court
years that followed placed several smaller, tripod antennason the property without prior permission from the City. He

used the antennas both for noncommercial purposes (to pro-vide an amateur radio service and to relay signals from other
amateur radio operators) and for commercial purposes (toprovide customers two-way radio communications from portable and mobile transceivers, and to repeat the signals of
customers so as to enable greater range of transmission).
Ibid.

In 1998, respondent sought permission to construct a sec-ond antenna tower. In the course of investigating that

application, the City learned that respondent was using his
antennas to provide a commercial service, in violation of a
City ordinance requiring a "conditional-use permit" from the
City Planning Commission (Commission) for commercial antenna use. See Commission Resolution No. 2000-12 ("A
Resolution of the Planning Commission of the City of Rancho
Palos Verdes Denying With Prejudice Conditional Use Permit No. 207 for the Proposed Commercial Use of Existing
Antennae on an Existing Antenna Support Structure, Located at 44 Oceanaire Drive in the Del Cerro Neighborhood"), App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. On suit by the City, Los
Angeles County Superior Court enjoined respondent from
using the antennas for a commercial purpose. Rancho
Palos Verdes, supra, at 373, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 84; App. to
Pet. for Cert. 35a.

Two weeks later, in July 1999, respondent applied to the
Commission for the requisite conditional-use permit. The
application drew strong opposition from several of respondent's neighbors. The Commission conducted two hearings
and accepted written evidence, after which it denied the application. Id., at 54a-63a. The Commission explained that
granting respondent permission to operate commercially
"would perpetuate . . . adverse visual impacts" from respondent's existing antennas and establish precedent for similar
projects in residential areas in the future. Id., at 57a. The

Commission also concluded that denial of respondent's appli-cation was consistent with 47 U. S. C. $ 332(c)(7), making specific findings that its action complied with each of that provi-sion's requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a-62a. The
city council denied respondent's appeal. Id., at 52a. Seegenerally No. CV00-09071-SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Jan. 9,
2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a-23a.

On August 24, 2000, respondent filed this action againstthe City in the District Court for the Central District

of California, alleging, as relevant, that denial of the use per-mit violated the limitations placed on the City's zoning
authority by $ 332(c)(7). In particular, respondent charged
that the City's action discriminated against the mobile
relay services he sought to provide, $ 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), effectively prohibited the provision of mobile relay services, $ 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), and was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, $ 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). App. to Pet.
for Cert. 17a. Respondent sought injunctive relief under

$ 332(c)(7)(B)(v), and money damages and attorney's fees
under 42 U. S. C. $$ 1983 and 1988. Plaintiff/Petitioner's
Brief Re: Remedies and Damages, Case No. 00-09071-SVW
(RNBx) (CD Cal., Feb. 25, 2002), App. to Reply Brief for
Petitioners 2a-7a.

Notwithstanding $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s direction that courts
"hear and decide" actions "on an expedited basis," the District Court did not act on respondent's complaint until January 9, 2002, 16 months after filing; it concluded that the City's
denial of a conditional-use permit was not supported by substantial evidence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-26a. The
court explained that the City could not rest its denial on
esthetic concerns, since the antennas in question were already in existence and would remain in place whatever the
disposition of the permit application. Id., at 23a-24a. Nor,
the court said, could the City reasonably base its decision on
the fear of setting precedent for the location of commercial
antennas in residential areas, since adverse impacts from

Opinion of the Court
new structures would always be a basis for permit denial.Id., at 25a. In light of the paucity of support for the City's

action, the court concluded that denial of the permit was "anact of spite by the community." Id., at 24a. In an order
issued two months later, the District Court held that$ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the City's
actions. Judgment of Injunction, No. CV00-09071-SVW(RNBx) (CD Cal., Mar. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.
Accordingly, it ordered the City to grant respondent's appli-cation for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondent's
request for damages under $ 1983. Respondent appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on
the latter point, and remanded for determination of moneydamages and attorney's fees. 354 F. 3d 1094, 1101 (2004).
We granted certiorari. 542 U. S. 965 (2004).

Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides:

"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordi-nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizenof the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,
shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."

In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980), we held that thissection "means what it says" and authorizes suits to enforce
individual rights under federal statutes as well as the Consti-tution. Id., at 4.

Our subsequent cases have made clear, however, that$ 1983 does not provide an avenue for relief every time a
state actor violates a federal law. As a threshold matter,the text of $ 1983 permits the enforcement of "

rights, not the

broader or vaguer `benefits' or `interests.' " Gonzaga Univ.v.

Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 283 (2002) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, to sustain a $ 1983 action, the plaintiff must dem-onstrate that the federal statute creates an individually

enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which hebelongs. See

id., at 285.
Even after this showing, "there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under $ 1983." Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 341 (1997). The defendant
may defeat this presumption by demonstrating that Con-gress did not intend that remedy for a newly created right.

See ibid.; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1012 (1984).
Our cases have explained that evidence of such congressional
intent may be found directly in the statute creating the right,
or inferred from the statute's creation of a "comprehensive
enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under $ 1983." Blessing, supra, at 341.2 See
also Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea
Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 19-20 (1981). "The crucial
consideration is what Congress intended." Smith, supra,
at 1012.

B

The City conceded below, and neither the City nor the
Government as amicus disputes here, that $ 332(c)(7) creates
individually enforceable rights; we assume, arguendo, that
this is so. The critical question, then, is whether Congress

2 This does not contravene the canon against implied repeal, see Posadas
v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936), because we have held that
canon inapplicable to a statute that creates no rights but merely provides a
civil cause of action to remedy "some otherwise defined federal right,"
Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442 U. S. 366, 376
(1979) (dealing with a provision related to $ 1983, 42 U. S. C. $ 1985(3)). In
such a case, "we are not faced . . . with a question of implied repeal," but
with whether the rights created by a later statute "may be asserted within
the remedial framework" of the earlier one. Great American Fed. Sav. &
Loan Assn., supra, at 376-377.

Opinion of the Court
meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by $ 332(c)(7)to coexist with an alternative remedy available in a $ 1983

action. We conclude not.The provision of an express, private means of redress in
the statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress didnot intend to leave open a more expansive remedy under

$ 1983. As we have said in a different setting, "[t]he express
provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule sug-gests that Congress intended to preclude others."

Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 290 (2001). Thus, the exist-ence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory

violations has been the dividing line between those cases in
which we have held that an action would lie under $ 1983 and
those in which we have held that it would not.

We have found $ 1983 unavailable to remedy violations of
federal statutory rights in two cases: Sea Clammers and
Smith. Both of those decisions rested upon the existence of
more restrictive remedies provided in the violated statute
itself. See Smith, supra, at 1011-1012 (recognizing a $ 1983
action "would . . . render superfluous most of the detailed
procedural protections outlined in the statute"); Sea Clammers, supra, at 20 ("[W]hen a state official is alleged to have
violated a federal statute which provides its own comprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit
directly under $ 1983" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Moreover, in all of the cases in which we have held that

$ 1983 is available for violation of a federal statute, we have
emphasized that the statute at issue, in contrast to those in
Sea Clammers and Smith, did not provide a private judicial
remedy (or, in most of the cases, even a private administrative remedy) for the rights violated. See Blessing, supra,
at 348 ("Unlike the federal programs at issue in [Sea Clammers and Smith], Title IV-D contains no private remedy--
either judicial or administrative--through which aggrieved
persons can seek redress"); Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.

107, 133-134 (1994) (there was a "complete absence of provision for relief from governmental interference" in the statute); Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S.
103, 108-109 (1989) ("There is . . . no comprehensive enforcement scheme for preventing state interference with federally
protected labor rights that would foreclose the $ 1983 remedy"); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 521

those in Sea Clammers and Smith); Wright v. Roanoke
Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 427
(1987) ("In both Sea Clammers and Smith . . . , the statutes
at issue themselves provided for private judicial remedies,
thereby evidencing congressional intent to supplant the

$ 1983 remedy. There is nothing of that kind found in the
. . . Housing Act").

The Government as amicus, joined by the City, urges us
to hold that the availability of a private judicial remedy is
not merely indicative of, but conclusively establishes, a congressional intent to preclude $ 1983 relief. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 17; Brief for Petitioners 35. We
decline to do so. The ordinary inference that the remedy
provided in the statute is exclusive can surely be overcome
by textual indication, express or implicit, that the remedy is
to complement, rather than supplant, $ 1983.

There is, however, no such indication in the TCA, which
adds no remedies to those available under $ 1983, and limits
relief in ways that $ 1983 does not. Judicial review of zoning
decisions under $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) must be sought within 30
days after the governmental entity has taken "final action,"
and, once the action is filed, the court must "hear and decide"
it "on an expedited basis." $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The remedies
available, moreover, perhaps do not include compensatory
damages (the lower courts are seemingly in disagreement on

this point 3), and certainly do not include attorney's fees and
costs.4 A $ 1983 action, by contrast, can be brought much
later than 30 days after the final action,5 and need not be
heard and decided on an expedited basis. And the successful plaintiff may recover not only damages but reasonable
attorney's fees and costs under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988. Thiboutot, 448 U. S., at 9. Liability for attorney's fees would have
a particularly severe impact in the $ 332(c)(7) context, making local governments liable for the (often substantial) legal
expenses of large commercial interests for the misapplication
of a complex and novel statutory scheme. See Nextel Partners Inc. v. Kingston Township, 286 F. 3d 687, 695 (CA3

of attorney's fees in a number of provisions, but not in $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v).
See, e. g., 47 U. S. C. $$ 206, 325(e)(10), 551(f)(2)(C), 605(e)(3)(B)(iii).

5 The statute of limitations for a $ 1983 claim is generally the applicable

state-law period for personal-injury torts. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S.
261, 275, 276 (1985); see also Owens v. Okure, 488 U. S. 235, 240-241 (1989).
On this basis, the applicable limitations period for respondent's $ 1983 action would presumably be one year. See Silva v. Crain, 169 F. 3d 608,
610 (CA9 1999) (citing Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. $ 340(3) (West 1982)). It
may be, however, that this limitations period does not apply to respondent's $ 1983 claim. In 1990, Congress enacted 28 U. S. C. $ 1658(a) (2000
ed., Supp. II), which provides a 4-year, catchall limitations period applicable to "civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after" December 1, 1990. In Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U. S. 369
(2004), we held that this 4-year limitations period applies to all claims
"made possible by a post-1990 [congressional] enactment." Id., at 382.
Since the claim here rests upon violation of the post-1990 TCA, $ 1658
would seem to apply.

2002) (Alito, J.) ("TCA plaintiffs are often large corporationsor affiliated entities, whereas TCA defendants are often

small, rural municipalities"); Primeco Personal Communications, Ltd. Partnership v. Mequon, 352 F. 3d 1147, 1152
(CA7 2003) (Posner, J.) (similar).Respondent's only response to the attorney's-fees point is

that it is a "policy argumen[t]," properly left to Congress.
Brief for Respondent 35-36. That response assumes, how-ever, that Congress's refusal to attach attorney's fees to the

remedy that it created in the TCA does not itself representa congressional choice.

Sea Clammers and Smith adopt the
opposite assumption--that limitations upon the remedy contained in the statute are deliberate and are not to be evaded
through $ 1983. See Smith, 468 U. S., at 1011-1012, and n. 5;
Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 14, 20.

Respondent disputes that a $ 1983 action to enforce

$ 332(c)(7)(B) would enjoy a longer statute of limitations than
an action under $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). He argues that the rule
adopted in Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261 (1985), that $ 1983
claims are governed by the state-law statute of limitations
for personal-injury torts, does not apply to $ 1983 actions to
enforce statutes that themselves contain a statute of limitations; in such cases, he argues, the limitations period in the
federal statute displaces the otherwise applicable state statute of limitations. This contention cannot be reconciled
with our decision in Wilson, which expressly rejected the
proposition that the limitations period for a $ 1983 claim depends on the nature of the underlying right being asserted.
See id., at 271-275. We concluded instead that 42 U. S. C.

$ 1988 is "a directive to select, in each State, the one most
appropriate statute of limitations for all $ 1983 claims." 471
U. S., at 275 (emphasis added); see also Owens v. Okure, 488

Respondent also argues that, if 28 U. S. C. $ 1658 (2000 ed.,Supp. II), rather than Wilson, applies to his $ 1983 action,
see n. 5, supra, $ 1658's 4-year statute of limitations is inap-plicable. This is so, he claims, because $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s requirement that actions be filed within 30 days falls within$ 1658's prefatory clause, "Except as otherwise provided by
law." 6 We think not. The language of $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) thatimposes the limitations period ("within 30 days after such
action or failure to act") is inextricably linked to--indeed, isembedded within--the language that creates the right of action ("may . . . commence an action in any court of competentjurisdiction"). It cannot possibly be regarded as a statute
of limitations generally applicable to any action to enforcethe rights created by $ 332(c)(7)(B). Cf.

Agency HoldingCorp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 168

(1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("Federal stat-utes of limitations . . . are almost invariably tied to specific
causes of action"). Respondent's argument thus reduces toa suggestion that we "borrow" $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s statute of
limitations and attach it to $ 1983 actions asserting violationsof $ 332(c)(7)(B). Section 1658's "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law" clause does not support this suggestion.

C
The Ninth Circuit based its conclusion that Congress in-tended to permit plaintiffs to proceed under $ 1983, in part,

on the TCA's so-called "saving clause," TCA $ 601(c)(1), 110Stat. 143, note following 47 U. S. C. $ 152. 354 F. 3d, at
1099-1100. That provision reads as follows:

6 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1658(a) provides as follows:
"Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an
Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section
may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action
accrues."

Opinion of the Court
"(1) No implied effect--This Act and the amend-ments made by this Act shall not be construed to modify,

impair, or supersede Federal, State, or local law unlessexpressly so provided in such Act or amendments."

The Court of Appeals took this to be an express statementof Congress's intent not to preclude an action under $ 1983,
reasoning that to do so would be to " `impair' " the operationof that section. Id., at 1100.

We do not think this an apt assessment of what "impair-[ment]" consists of. Construing $ 332(c)(7), as we do, to create rights that may be enforced only through the statute'sexpress remedy leaves the pre-TCA operation of $ 1983 entirely unaffected. Indeed, the crux of our holding is that$ 332(c)(7) has no effect on $ 1983 whatsoever: The rights

$ 332(c)(7) created may not be enforced under $ 1983 and, con-versely, the claims available under $ 1983 prior to the enactment of the TCA continue to be available after its enactment.The saving clause of the TCA does not require a court to go
further and permit enforcement under $ 1983 of the TCA'ssubstantive standards. To apply to the present case what
we said with regard to a different statute: "The right[Abrams] claims under [$ 332(c)(7)] did not even arguably
exist before the passage of [the TCA]. The only questionhere, therefore, is whether the rights created by [the TCA]
may be asserted within the remedial framework of [$ 1983]."Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442
U. S. 366, 376-377 (1979).This interpretation of the saving clause is consistent with
Sea Clammers. Saving clauses attached to the statutes atissue in that case provided that the statutes should not be
interpreted to " `restrict any right which any person . . . mayhave under any statute or common law to seek enforcement
of any . . . standard or limitation or to seek any other re-lief (including relief against the Administrator or a State
agency).' 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(e)." 453 U. S., at 7, n. 10; see

* * *
Enforcement of $ 332(c)(7) through $ 1983 would distort thescheme of expedited judicial review and limited remedies

created by $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). We therefore hold that theTCA--by providing a judicial remedy different from $ 1983
in $ 332(c)(7) itself--precluded resort to $ 1983. The judg-ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring.

I agree with the Court. It wisely rejects the Govern-ment's proposed rule that the availability of a private judicial

remedy "conclusively establishes . . . a congressional intentto preclude [Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.] $ 1983 relief."
Ante, at 122 (emphasis added). The statute books are toomany, federal laws too diverse, and their purposes too complex for any legal formula to provide more than generalguidance. Cf. Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 291
(2002) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). The Courttoday provides general guidance in the form of an "ordinary
inference" that when Congress creates a specific judicialremedy, it does so to the exclusion of $ 1983. Ante, at 122.
I would add that context, not just literal text, will often leada court to Congress' intent in respect to a particular statute.
Cf. ibid. (referring to "implicit" textual indications).Context here, for example, makes clear that Congress saw
a national problem, namely, an "inconsistent and, at times,

conflicting patchwork" of state and local siting requirements,which threatened "the deployment" of a national wireless

communication system. H. R. Rep. No. 104-204, pt. 1, p. 94(1995). Congress initially considered a single national solution, namely, a Federal Communications Commission wire-less tower siting policy that would pre-empt state and local
authority. Ibid.; see also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458,
p. 207 (1996). But Congress ultimately rejected the nationalapproach and substituted a system based on cooperative federalism. Id., at 207-208. State and local authorities wouldremain free to make siting decisions. They would do so,
however, subject to minimum federal standards--both substantive and procedural--as well as federal judicial review.

The statute requires local zoning boards, for example,
to address permit applications "within a reasonable period of time"; the boards must maintain a "written record"
and give reasons for denials "in writing." 47 U. S. C.

$$ 332(c)(7)(B)(ii), (iii). Those "adversely affected" by "final
action" of a state or local government (including their "failure to act") may obtain judicial review provided they file
their review action within 30 days. $ 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The
reviewing court must "hear and decide such action on an
expedited basis." Ibid. And the court must determine,
among other things, whether a zoning board's decision
denying a permit is supported by "substantial evidence."

$ 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).

This procedural and judicial review scheme resembles that
governing many federal agency decisions. See H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 104-458, at 208 ("The phrase `substantial evidence
contained in a written record' is the traditional standard
used for judicial review of agency actions"). Section 1983
suits, however, differ considerably from ordinary review of
agency action. The former involve plenary judicial evaluation of asserted rights deprivations; the latter involves deferential consideration of matters within an agency's expertise.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
mine the compromise--between purely federal and purelylocal siting policies--that the statute reflects.

For these reasons, and for those set forth by the Court,I agree that Congress, in this statute, intended its judicial
remedy as an exclusive remedy. In particular, Congressintended that remedy to foreclose--not to supplement--

$ 1983 relief.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
When a federal statute creates a new right but fails tospecify whether plaintiffs may or may not recover damages

or attorney's fees, we must fill the gap in the statute's textby examining all relevant evidence that sheds light on the
intent of the enacting Congress. The inquiry varies fromstatute to statute. Sometimes the question is whether, despite its silence, Congress intended us to recognize an implied cause of action. See, e. g., Cannon v. University of
Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979). Sometimes we ask whether,
despite its silence, Congress intended us to enforce the preexisting remedy provided in Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 4 (1980). And
still other times, despite Congress' inclusion of specific
clauses designed specifically to preserve pre-existing remedies, we have nevertheless concluded that Congress impliedly foreclosed the $ 1983 remedy. See Middlesex
County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers
Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 13 (1981). Whenever we perform this
gap-filling task, it is appropriate not only to study the text
and structure of the statutory scheme, but also to examine
its legislative history. See, e. g., id., at 17-18; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1009 (1984); Cannon, 441 U. S., at 694.

In this case the statute's text, structure, and history all
provide convincing evidence that Congress intended the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA) to operate as a comprehensive and exclusive remedial scheme. The structure
of the statute appears fundamentally incompatible with the

130 RANCHO PALOS VERDES v. ABRAMS

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
private remedy offered by $ 1983.* Moreover, there is nota shred of evidence in the legislative history suggesting that,

despite this structure, Congress intended plaintiffs to be ableto recover damages and attorney's fees. Thus, petitioners
have made "the difficult showing that allowing $ 1983 ac-tions to go forward in these circumstances `would be inconsistent with Congress' carefully tailored scheme.' " Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 346 (1997) (quoting GoldenState Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 107 (1989);

emphasis added). I therefore join the judgment of theCourt without reservation.

Two flaws in the Court's approach, however, persuade meto write separately. First, I do not believe that the Court
has properly acknowledged the strength of our normal pre-sumption that Congress intended to preserve, rather than
preclude, the availability of $ 1983 as a remedy for the en-forcement of federal statutory rights. Title 42 U. S. C.

*The evidence supporting this conclusion is substantial. It includes,
inter alia, the fact that the private remedy specified in 47 U. S. C.

$ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) requires all enforcement actions to be brought in any court
of competent jurisdiction "within 30 days after such action or failure to
act." Once a plaintiff brings such an action, the statute requires the court
both to "hear and decide" the case "on an expedited basis." Ibid. As
the Court properly notes, ante, at 122-123, the TCA's streamlined and
expedited scheme for resolving telecommunication zoning disputes is fundamentally incompatible with the applicable limitations periods that generally govern $ 1983 litigation, see, e. g., Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261
(1985), as well as the deliberate pace with which civil rights litigation
generally proceeds. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, pp. 208-209
(1996) (expressing the intent of the congressional Conference that zoning
decisions should be "rendered in a reasonable period of time" and that
Congress expected courts to "act expeditiously in deciding such cases"
that may arise from disputed decisions). Like the Court, I am not persuaded that the statutory requirements can simply be mapped onto the
existing structure of $ 1983, and there is nothing in the legislative history
to suggest that Congress would have wanted us to do so. For these reasons, among others, I believe it is clear that Congress intended $ 332(c)(7)
to operate as the exclusive remedy by which plaintiffs can obtain judicial
relief for violations of the TCA.

$ 1983 was "intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly con-strued, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights." Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 700-701 (1978). "We do not lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on $ 1983as a remedy . . . . Since 1871, when it was passed by Congress, $ 1983 has stood as an independent safeguard against
deprivations of federal constitutional and statutory rights."
Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012. Although the Court is correct to
point out that this presumption is rebuttable, it remains truethat only an

exceptional case--such as one involving an unusually comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme--will
lead us to conclude that a given statute impliedly forecloses a

$ 1983 remedy. See Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and
Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 425 (1987) (statutory
scheme must be "sufficiently comprehensive and effective to
raise a clear inference that Congress intended to foreclose a

$ 1983 cause of action"). While I find it easy to conclude
that petitioners have met that heavy burden here, there will
be many instances in which $ 1983 will be available even
though Congress has not explicitly so provided in the text of
the statute in question. See, e. g., id., at 424-425; Blessing,
520 U. S., at 346-348.

Second, the Court incorrectly assumes that the legislative
history of the statute is totally irrelevant. This is contrary
to nearly every case we have decided in this area of law, all of
which have surveyed, or at least acknowledged, the available
legislative history or lack thereof. See, e. g., Wright, 479
U. S., at 424-426 (citing legislative history); Smith, 468 U. S.,
at 1009-1010 (same); Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 17-18 (noting that one of the relevant factors in the Court's inquiry
"include[s] the legislative history"); Cannon, 441 U. S., at
694 (same).

Additionally, as a general matter of statutory interpretation, Congress' failure to discuss an issue during prolonged
legislative deliberations may itself be probative. As The

544US1 Unit: $U31 [11-02-07 17:37:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 RANCHO PALOS VERDES v. ABRAMS

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Chief Justice has cogently observed: "In a case where theconstruction of legislative language such as this makes so

sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that madehere, I think judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in thenight." Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 602
(1980) (dissenting opinion). The Court has endorsed theview that Congress' silence on questions such as this one
"can be likened to the dog that did not bark." Chisom v.
Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 396, n. 23 (1991) (citing A. Doyle,Silver Blaze, in The Complete Sherlock Holmes 335 (1927)).

Congressional silence is surely probative in this case be-cause, despite the fact that awards of damages and attorney's
fees could have potentially disastrous consequences for thelikely defendants in most private actions under the TCA, see
Primeco Personal Communications v. Mequon, 352 F. 3d1147, 1152 (CA7 2003), nowhere in the course of Congress'
lengthy deliberations is there any hint that Congress wanteddamages or attorney's fees to be available. That silence reinforces every other clue that we can glean from the statute'stext and structure.

For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment.

133OCTOBER TERM, 2004
Syllabus

BROWN, WARDEN v. PAYTON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-1039. Argued November 10, 2004--Decided March 22, 2005
In the penalty phase of respondent Payton's trial following his conviction

on capital murder and related charges, his counsel presented witnesses
who testified that, during the one year and nine months Payton had
been incarcerated since his arrest, he had made a sincere commitment
to God, participated in prison Bible study and a prison ministry, and had
a calming effect on other prisoners. The trial judge gave jury instructions that followed verbatim the text of a California statute, setting
forth 11 different factors, labeled (a) through (k), to guide the jury in
determining whether to impose a death sentence or life imprisonment.
The last such instruction, the so-called factor (k) instruction, directed
jurors to consider "[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime." In
his closing, the prosecutor offered jurors his incorrect opinion that factor (k) did not allow them to consider anything that happened after the
crime. Although he also told them several times that, in his view, they
had not heard any evidence of mitigation, he discussed Payton's evidence
in considerable detail and argued that the circumstances and facts of the
case, coupled with Payton's prior violent acts, outweighed the mitigating
effect of Payton's religious conversion. When the defense objected to
the argument, the court admonished the jury that the prosecutor's comments were merely argument, but it did not explicitly instruct that the
prosecutor's interpretation was incorrect. Finding the special circumstance of murder in the course of rape, the jury recommended that Payton be sentenced to death, and the judge complied. The California Supreme Court affirmed. Applying Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370,
which had considered the constitutionality of the identical factor
(k) instruction, the state court held that, considering the context of the
proceedings, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed
it was required to disregard Payton's mitigating evidence. The Federal
District Court disagreed and granted Payton habeas relief, ruling also
that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA) did not apply. The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed and, like
the District Court, held that AEDPA did not apply. On remand from
this Court in light of Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, the Ninth
Circuit purported to decide the case under the deferential standard

544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
134 BROWN v. PAYTON

Syllabus
AEDPA mandates. It again affirmed, concluding that the California
Supreme Court had unreasonably applied Boyde in holding the factor
(k) instruction was not unconstitutionally ambiguous in Payton's case.
The error, the court determined, was that the factor (k) instruction did
not make it clear to the jury that it could consider the evidence concerning Payton's postcrime religious conversion and the prosecutor was allowed to urge this erroneous interpretation.

Held: The Ninth Circuit's decision was contrary to the limits on federal

habeas review imposed by AEDPA. Pp. 141-147.

(a) AEDPA provides that, when a habeas petitioner's claim has been
adjudicated on the merits in state court, a federal court may not grant
relief unless the state court's adjudication "resulted in a decision that
was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). A state-court decision is contrary to this Court's clearly established precedents if it applies a rule
that contradicts the governing law set forth in this Court's cases, or if
it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a
decision of this Court but reaches a different result. E. g., Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405. A state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court's clearly established precedents if the state
court applies such precedents to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner. E. g., ibid. These conditions have not been established.
P. 141.

(b) In light of Boyde, the California Supreme Court cannot be said to
have acted unreasonably in declining to distinguish between precrime
and postcrime mitigating evidence. The California Supreme Court
read Boyde as establishing that factor (k)'s text was broad enough to
accommodate Payton's postcrime mitigating evidence, but the Ninth
Circuit held that Boyde's reasoning did not control in this case because
Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence. However, Boyde held that factor (k) directed consideration of any circumstance that might excuse the crime, see 494 U. S., at 382, and it is not
unreasonable to believe that a postcrime character transformation could
do so. Pp. 141-143.

(c) Even were the Court to assume that the California Supreme Court
was incorrect in concluding that the prosecutor's argument and remarks
did not mislead the jury into believing it could not consider Payton's
mitigation evidence, the state court's conclusion was not unreasonable,
and is therefore just the type of decision that AEDPA shields on habeas
review. The state court's conclusion was an application of Boyde to
similar but not identical facts. Considering the whole context of the
proceedings, it was not unreasonable for the state court to determine

135Cite as: 544 U. S. 133 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
that the jury most likely believed that the mitigation evidence, while
within the factor (k) instruction's reach, was simply too insubstantial
to overcome the arguments for imposing the death penalty; nor was
it unreasonable for the state court to rely upon Boyde to support its
analysis. Pp. 143-147.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,convening en banc, granted habeas relief to respondent

William Payton. It held that the jury instructions in thepenalty phase of his trial for capital murder did not permit
consideration of all the mitigation evidence Payton pre-sented. The error, the court determined, was that the general mitigation instruction did not make it clear to the jurythat it could consider evidence concerning Payton's postcrime religious conversion and the prosecutor was allowed

Opinion of the Court
to urge this erroneous interpretation. We granted the peti-tion for certiorari, 541 U. S. 1062 (2004), to decide whether

the Ninth Circuit's decision was contrary to the limits onfederal habeas review imposed by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). We
now reverse. I

In 1980, while spending the night at a boarding house, Pay-ton raped another boarder, Pamela Montgomery, and then
used a butcher knife to stab her to death. Payton proceededto enter the bedroom of the house's patron, Patricia Pensinger, and to stab her as she slept aside her 10-year-old son,Blaine. When Blaine resisted, Payton started to stab him
as well. Payton's knife blade bent, and he went to thekitchen to retrieve another. Upon the intervention of other
boarders, Payton dropped the second knife and fled.Payton was arrested and tried for the first-degree murder
and rape of Pamela Montgomery and for the attempted mur-ders of Patricia and Blaine Pensinger. Payton presented no
evidence in the guilt phase of the trial and was convicted onall counts. The trial proceeded to the penalty phase, where
the prosecutor introduced evidence of a prior incident whenPayton stabbed a girlfriend; a prior conviction for rape; a
prior drug-related felony conviction; and evidence of jail-house conversations in which Payton admitted he had an
"urge to kill" and a "severe problem with sex and women"that caused him to view all women as potential victims
to "stab . . . and rape." People v. Payton, 3 Cal. 4th 1050,1058, 839 P. 2d 1035, 1040 (1992) (internal quotation marks
omitted).Defense counsel concentrated on Payton's postcrime behavior and presented evidence from eight witnesses. Theytestified that in the year and nine months Payton spent in
prison since his arrest, he had made a sincere commitment toGod, participated in prison Bible study classes and a prison
ministry, and had a calming effect on other prisoners.

Opinion of the Court
Before the penalty phase closing arguments, the judge
held an in-chambers conference with counsel to discuss jury
instructions. He proposed to give--and later did give--an
instruction which followed verbatim the text of a California
statute. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3 (West 1988). The instruction set forth 11 different factors, labeled (a) through
(k), for the jury to "consider, take into account and be guided
by" in determining whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment or death. 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.84.1
(4th rev. ed. 1979).

The in-chambers conference considered in particular the
last instruction in the series, the so-called factor (k) instruction. Factor (k) was a catchall instruction, in contrast to
the greater specificity of the instructions that preceded it.
As set forth in the statute, and as explained to the jury, it
directed jurors to consider "[a]ny other circumstance which
extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a
legal excuse for the crime." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3
(West 1988). (The statute has since been amended.)

Defense counsel objected to the instruction and asked that
it be modified to direct the jury, in more specific terms, to
consider evidence of the defendant's character and background. The prosecution, on the other hand, indicated that
in its view factor (k) was not intended to encompass evidence
concerning a defendant's background or character. The
court agreed with defense counsel that factor (k) was a general instruction covering all mitigating evidence. It declined, however, to modify the wording, in part because the
instruction repeated the text of the statute. In addition, the
court stated: "I assume you gentlemen, as I said, in your
argument can certainly relate--relate back to those factors
and certainly can argue the defendant's character, background, history, mental condition, physical condition; certainly fall into category `k' and certainly make a clear argument to the jury." App. 59.

138 BROWN v. PAYTON

Opinion of the Court
The judge prefaced closing arguments by instructing thejury that what it would hear from counsel was "not evidence

but argument" and "[you] should rely on your own recollec-tion of the evidence."

Id., at 62. In his closing, the prosecutor offered jurors his opinion that factor (k) did not allowthem to consider anything that happened "after the [crime]

or later." Id., at 68. The parties do not now dispute that
this was a misstatement of law. The defense objected to thecomment and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. The court admonished the jury that the prosecutor'scomments were merely argument, but it did not explicitly
instruct the jury that the prosecutor's interpretation was incorrect. Id., at 69-70.

Although the prosecutor again told the jury several times
that, in his view, the jury had not heard any evidence of
mitigation, he proceeded to argue that the circumstances and
facts of the case, coupled with Payton's prior violent acts,
outweighed the mitigating effect of Payton's newfound
Christianity. Id., at 70. He discussed the mitigation evidence in considerable detail and concluded by urging that
the circumstances of the case and Payton's prior violent acts
outweighed his religious conversion. Id., at 75-76. In his
closing, defense counsel argued to the jury that, although it
might be awkwardly worded, factor (k) was a catchall instruction designed to cover precisely the kind of evidence
Payton had presented.

The trial court's final instructions to the jury included the
factor (k) instruction, as well as an instruction directing the
jury to consider all evidence presented during the trial. Id.,
at 94. The jury found the special circumstance of murder in
the course of committing rape and returned a verdict recommending a death sentence. The judge sentenced Payton to
death for murder and to 21 years and 8 months for rape and
attempted murder.

On direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, Payton
argued that his penalty phase jury incorrectly was led to

Opinion of the Court
believe it could not consider the mitigating evidence of hispostconviction conduct in determining whether he should receive a sentence of life imprisonment or death, in violationof the Eighth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution.

Lockett
v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 602-609 (1978) (plurality opinion).The text of the factor (k) instruction, he maintained, was

misleading, and rendered more so in light of the prosecutor's argument.In a 5-to-2 decision, the California Supreme Court rejected

Payton's claims and affirmed his convictions and sentence.3 Cal. 4th 1050, 839 P. 2d 1035 (1992). Applying

Boyde v.
California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), which had considered the
constitutionality of the same factor (k) instruction, the state
court held that in the context of the proceedings there was
no reasonable likelihood that Payton's jury believed it was
required to disregard his mitigating evidence. 3 Cal. 4th, at
1070-1071, 839 P. 2d, at 1048. Payton sought review of the
California Supreme Court's decision here. We declined to
grant certiorari. Payton v. California, 510 U. S. 1040 (1994).

Payton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, reiterating that the jury was prevented from considering his mitigation evidence. The District Court held that
the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, did not apply to Payton's petition
because he had filed a motion for appointment of counsel before AEDPA's effective date, even though he did not file the
petition until after that date. The District Court considered
his claims de novo and granted the petition.

On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a
divided panel reversed. Payton v. Woodford, 258 F. 3d 905
(2001). The Court of Appeals granted Payton's petition for
rehearing en banc and, by a 6-to-5 vote, affirmed the District
Court's order granting habeas relief. Payton v. Woodford,
299 F. 3d 815 (2002). The en banc panel, like the District
Court, held that AEDPA did not govern Payton's petition.

140 BROWN v. PAYTON

Opinion of the Court
It, too, conducted a de novo review of his claims, and con-cluded that postcrime mitigation evidence was not encompassed by the factor (k) instruction, a view it found to havebeen reinforced by the prosecutor's arguments.

The State petitioned for certiorari. Pursuant to Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202 (2003), which held that a request for appointment of counsel did not suffice to make
"pending" a habeas petition filed after AEDPA's effectivedate, we granted the State's petition,

Woodford v. Payton,
538 U. S. 975 (2003), and remanded to the Court of Appealsfor reconsideration of its decision under AEDPA's deferential

standards. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000).

On remand, the en banc panel affirmed the District Court's
previous grant of habeas relief by the same 6-to-5 vote.
Payton v. Woodford, 346 F. 3d 1204 (CA9 2003). In light of
Garceau, the Court of Appeals purported to decide the case
under the deferential standard AEDPA mandates. It concluded, however, that the California Supreme Court had unreasonably applied this Court's precedents in holding the factor (k) instruction was not unconstitutionally ambiguous in
Payton's case.

The Court of Appeals relied, as it had in its initial decision,
on the proposition that Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence. Boyde, in its view, reasoned
that a jury would be unlikely to disregard mitigating evidence as to character because of the long-held social belief
that defendants who commit criminal acts attributable to a
disadvantaged background may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse. As to postcrime mitigating
evidence, however, the Court of Appeals concluded that
"there is reason to doubt that a jury would similarly consider
post-crime evidence of a defendant's religious conversion and
good behavior in prison." 346 F. 3d, at 1212. It cited no
precedent of this Court to support that supposition.

In addition, it reasoned that unlike in Boyde the prosecutor in Payton's case misstated the law and the trial court did

544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

141Cite as: 544 U. S. 133 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
not give a specific instruction rejecting that misstatement,relying instead on a general admonition that counsel's arguments were not evidence. These two differences, the Courtof Appeals concluded, made Payton's case unlike Boyde. 346
F. 3d, at 1216. In its view, the factor (k) instruction waslikely to have misled the jury and it was an unreasonable
application of this Court's cases for the California SupremeCourt to have concluded otherwise.

II
AEDPA provides that, when a habeas petitioner's claimhas been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings, a federal court may not grant relief unless the statecourt's adjudication of the claim "resulted in a decision that
was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).A state-court decision is contrary to this Court's clearly established precedents if it applies a rule that contradicts thegoverning law set forth in our cases, or if it confronts a set
of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decisionof this Court but reaches a different result. Williams v.
Taylor, supra, at 405; Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002)(per curiam). A state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court's clearly established precedentsif the state court applies this Court's precedents to the facts
in an objectively unreasonable manner. Williams v. Taylor,supra, at 405; Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24-25
(2002) (per curiam). These conditions for the grant of fed-eral habeas relief have not been established.

A
The California Supreme Court was correct to identifyBoyde as the starting point for its analysis. Boyde involved

a challenge to the same instruction at issue here, factor (k).As to the text of factor (k),

Boyde established that it does

544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
142 BROWN v. PAYTON

Opinion of the Court
not limit the jury's consideration of extenuating circum-stances solely to circumstances of the crime. See 494 U. S.,

at 382. In so holding, we expressly rejected the suggestionthat factor (k) precluded the jury from considering evidence
pertaining to a defendant's background and character be-cause those circumstances did not concern the crime itself.
Boyde instead found that factor (k), by its terms, directed
the jury to consider any other circumstance that might ex-cuse the crime, including factors related to a defendant's

background and character. We held:

"The [factor (k)] instruction did not, as petitioner seemsto suggest, limit the jury's consideration to `any other

circumstance of the crime which extenuates the gravity
of the crime.' The jury was directed to consider any
other circumstance that might excuse the crime, which
certainly includes a defendant's background and charac-ter."

Ibid. (emphasis in original).

The California Supreme Court read Boyde as establishing
that the text of factor (k) was broad enough to accommodatethe postcrime mitigating evidence Payton presented.

People v. Payton, 3 Cal. 4th, at 1070, 839 P. 2d, at 1048. The
Court of Appeals held Boyde's reasoning did not control Pay-ton's case because

Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime,
mitigation evidence. 346 F. 3d, at 1211-1212.We do not think that, in light of

Boyde, the California
Supreme Court acted unreasonably in declining to distin-guish between precrime and postcrime mitigating evidence.

After all, Boyde held that factor (k) directed considerationof any circumstance that might excuse the crime, and it is
not unreasonable to believe that a postcrime character transformation could do so. Indeed, to accept the view that such
evidence could not because it occurred after the crime, one
would have to reach the surprising conclusion that remorse
could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime. But remorse,
which by definition can only be experienced after a crime's

143Cite as: 544 U. S. 133 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
commission, is something commonly thought to lessen or ex-cuse a defendant's culpability.

B
That leaves respondent to defend the decision of the Courtof Appeals on grounds that, even if it was at least reasonable

for the California Supreme Court to conclude that the textof factor (k) allowed the jury to consider the postcrime evidence, it was unreasonable to conclude that the prosecutor'sargument and remarks did not mislead the jury into believing it could not consider Payton's mitigation evidence. Aswe shall explain, however, the California Supreme Court's
conclusion that the jury was not reasonably likely to haveaccepted the prosecutor's narrow view of factor (k) was an
application of Boyde to similar but not identical facts. Evenon the assumption that its conclusion was incorrect, it was
not unreasonable, and is therefore just the type of decisionthat AEDPA shields on habeas review.

The following language from Boyde should be noted atthe outset:

"We think the proper inquiry in such a case is whetherthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied
the challenged instruction in a way that prevents theconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. . . .
Jurors do not sit in solitary isolation booths parsing in-structions for subtle shades of meaning in the same way
that lawyers might. Differences among them in inter-pretation of instructions may be thrashed out in the deliberative process, with commonsense understanding ofthe instructions in the light of all that has taken place
at the trial likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting."494 U. S., at 380-381 (footnote omitted).

Unlike in Boyde the prosecutor here argued to jurorsduring his closing that they should not consider Payton's mitigation evidence, evidence which concerned postcrime as op544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
144 BROWN v. PAYTON

Opinion of the Court
posed to precrime conduct. Because Boyde sets forth a gen-eral framework for determining whether a challenged instruction precluded jurors from considering a defendant'smitigation evidence, however, the California Supreme Court
was correct to structure its own analysis on the premisesthat controlled

Boyde. The Boyde analysis applies here,
and, even if it did not dictate a particular outcome in Payton's
case, it refutes the conclusion of the Court of Appeals thatthe California Supreme Court was unreasonable.

The prosecutor's mistaken approach appears most promi-nently at three different points in the penalty phase. First,
in chambers and outside the presence of the jury he argued
to the judge that background and character (whether of precrime or postcrime) was simply beyond the ambit of the instruction. Second, he told the jurors in his closing statement that factor (k) did not allow them to consider what
happened "after the [crime] or later." App. 68. Third,
after defense counsel objected to his narrow view, he argued
to the jury that it had not heard any evidence of mitigation.
Id., at 70. Boyde, however, mandates that the whole context
of the trial be considered. And considering the whole context of the trial, it was not unreasonable for the state court
to have concluded that this line of prosecutorial argument
did not put Payton's mitigating evidence beyond the jury's
reach.

The prosecutor's argument came after the defense presented eight witnesses, spanning two days of testimony
without a single objection from the prosecution as to its relevance. As the California Supreme Court recognized, like in
Boyde, for the jury to have believed it could not consider
Payton's mitigating evidence, it would have had to believe
that the penalty phase served virtually no purpose at all.
Payton's counsel recognized as much, arguing to the jury
that "[t]he whole purpose for the second phase [of the] trial
is to decide the proper punishment to be imposed. Everything that was presented by the defense relates directly to

544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

145Cite as: 544 U. S. 133 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
that." App. 88. He told the jury that if the evidence Pay-ton presented was not entitled to consideration, and therefore "all the evidence we presented [would not be] applicable,why didn't we hear any objections to its relevance?" Ibid.
The prosecutor was not given an opportunity to rebut de-fense counsel's argument that factor (k) required the jury to
consider Payton's mitigating evidence.For his part, the prosecutor devoted specific attention to
disputing the sincerity of Payton's evidence, stating that "ev-erybody seems to get religion in jail when facing the death
penalty" and that "[s]tate prison is full of people who getreligion when they are in jail."

Id., at 74. Later, he inti-mated the timing of Payton's religious conversion was suspect, stating "he becomes a newborn Christian, after he's incustody" after "he gets caught." Ibid. As the California
Supreme Court reasonably surmised, this exercise wouldhave been pointless if the jury believed it could not consider
the evidence.Along similar lines, although the prosecutor characterized
Payton's evidence as not being evidence of mitigation, he de-voted substantial attention to discounting its importance as
compared to the aggravating factors. He said:

"The law in its simplicity is that the aggravating--if theaggravating factors outweigh the mitigating, the sentence the jury should vote for should be the death pen-alty. How do the factors line up? The circumstances
and facts of the case, the defendant's other acts showingviolence . . . , the defendant's two prior convictions line
up against really nothing except [the] defendant's new-born Christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old.
This is not close. You haven't heard anything to miti-gate what he's done. If you wanted to distribute a
thousand points over the factors, 900 would have to go towhat he did to [the victim], and I really doubt if [defense
counsel] would dispute that breakdown of the facts."
Id., at 76.

544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
146 BROWN v. PAYTON

Opinion of the Court
Indeed, the prosecutor characterized testimony concerningPayton's religious conversion as "evidence" on at least four

separate occasions. Id., at 68, 70, 73. In context, it was notunreasonable for the state court to conclude that the jury
believed Payton's evidence was neither credible nor sufficientto outweigh the aggravating factors, not that it was not evidence at all.

To be sure, the prosecutor advocated a narrow interpreta-tion of factor (k), an interpretation that neither party accepts

as correct. There is, however, no indication that the prose-cutor's argument was made in bad faith, nor does Payton
suggest otherwise. In addition, the first time the jury was
exposed to the prosecutor's narrow and incorrect view of factor (k), it had already heard the entirety of Payton's mitigating evidence. Defense counsel immediately objected to the
prosecutor's narrow characterization, and the trial court,
noting at a side bar that one could "argue it either way,"
admonished the jury that "the comments by both the prosecution and the defense are not evidence. You've heard the
evidence and, as I said, this is argument. And it's to be
placed in its proper perspective." Id., at 69-70.

The trial judge, of course, should have advised the jury
that it could consider Payton's evidence under factor (k), and
allowed counsel simply to argue the evidence's persuasive
force instead of the meaning of the instruction itself. The
judge is, after all, the one responsible for instructing the
jury on the law, a responsibility that may not be abdicated
to counsel. Even in the face of the trial court's failure to
give an instant curative instruction, however, it was not
unreasonable to find that the jurors did not likely believe
Payton's mitigation evidence beyond their reach. The jury
was not left without any judicial direction. Before it began
deliberations as to what penalty was appropriate, the court
instructed it to consider all evidence received "during any
part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter
instructed," id., at 94, and it was not thereafter instructed

147Cite as: 544 U. S. 133 (2005)
Scalia, J., concurring
to disregard anything. It was also instructed as to factor
(k) which, as we held in Boyde, by its terms directs jurors
to consider any other circumstance that might lessen a defendant's culpability.

Testimony about a religious conversion spanning one year
and nine months may well have been considered altogether
insignificant in light of the brutality of the crimes, the prior
offenses, and a proclivity for committing violent acts against
women. It was not unreasonable for the state court to determine that the jury most likely believed that the evidence
in mitigation, while within the reach of the factor (k)
instruction, was simply too insubstantial to overcome the
arguments for imposing the death penalty; nor was it unreasonable for the state court to rely upon Boyde to support its
analysis. Even were we to assume the " `relevant statecourt decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly,' " Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76
(2003) (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 411), there
is no basis for further concluding that the application of our
precedents was "objectively unreasonable," Lockyer, supra,
at 76. The Court of Appeals made this last mentioned assumption, and it was in error to do so. The judgment of the
Ninth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this
case.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,

I join the Court's opinion, which correctly holds that the
California Supreme Court's decision was not "contrary to"
or "an unreasonable application of " our cases. 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(1). Even if our review were not circumscribed by
statute, I would adhere to my view that limiting a jury's
discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate

the Eighth Amendment. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639, 673 (1990) (

Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

Justice Breyer, concurring.
In my view, this is a case in which Congress' instruction
to defer to the reasonable conclusions of state-court judges
makes a critical difference. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).Were I a California state judge, I would likely hold that Payton's penalty-phase proceedings violated the Eighth Amend-ment. In a death case, the Constitution requires sentencing
juries to consider all mitigating evidence. See, e. g., Penryv.

Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319 (1989). And here, there
might well have been a "reasonable likelihood" that Payton'sjury interpreted factor (k), 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim.,

No. 8.84.1(k) (4th rev. ed. 1979), "in a way that prevent[ed]"
it from considering "constitutionally relevant" mitigating evidence--namely, evidence of his postcrime religious conversion. Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990).

Unlike Boyde, the prosecutor here told the jury repeatedly--and incorrectly--that factor (k) did not permit it to
take account of Payton's postcrime religious conversion.
See post, at 154-155, 159-160 (Souter, J., dissenting).
Moreover, the trial judge--also incorrectly--did nothing to
correct the record, likely leaving the jury with the impression that it could not do that which the Constitution says it
must. See ante, at 146 (majority opinion); post, at 159-160.
Finally, factor (k) is ambiguous as to whether it encompassed
Payton's mitigation case. Factor (k)'s text focuses on evidence that reduces a defendant's moral culpability for committing the offense. And evidence of postcrime conversion
is less obviously related to moral culpability than is evidence
of precrime background and character. See Boyde, supra,
at 382, n. 5 (suggesting a distinction between precrime and
postcrime evidence). For all these reasons, one could conclude that the jury here might have thought factor (k) barred

Souter, J., dissenting
its consideration of mitigating evidence, even if the jury inBoyde would not there have reached a similar conclusion.

Nonetheless, in circumstances like the present, a federaljudge must leave in place a state-court decision unless the
federal judge believes that it is "contrary to, or involved anunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."$ 2254(d)(1). For the reasons that the Court discusses, I
cannot say that the California Supreme Court decision failsthis deferential test. I therefore join the Court's opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

From a time long before William Payton's trial, it has beenclear law under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments

that a sentencing jury in a capital case must be able to con-sider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence a
defendant offers for a sentence less than death. The prose-cutor in Payton's case effectively negated this principle in
arguing repeatedly to the jury that the law required it todisregard Payton's mitigating evidence of postcrime religious conversion and rehabilitation. The trial judge utterlyfailed to correct these repeated misstatements or in any
other way to honor his duty to give the jury an accuratedefinition of legitimate mitigation. It was reasonably likely
in these circumstances that the jury failed to consider Pay-ton's mitigating evidence, and in concluding otherwise, the
Supreme Court of California unreasonably applied settledlaw, with substantially injurious effect. The Court of Appeals was correct, and I respectfully dissent.

At the time the Supreme Court of California took up Pay-ton's direct appeal of his death sentence for homicide, it was

settled law that a capital defendant has a plenary right topresent evidence going to any aspect of his character, back544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ground, or record, as well as to any circumstance particular
to the offense, that might justify a sentence less than death,
Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586
(1978), including evidence of the defendant's behavior after
the offense, Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4-5
(1986). The law was equally explicit that the sentencer may
not refuse to consider any evidence in mitigation, or be precluded from giving it whatever effect it may merit. Penry
v. Lynaugh, supra, at 318-320; Eddings v. Oklahoma, supra,
at 113-114.

When Payton was tried, California's sentencing law was
not well designed to satisfy the State's obligation to provide
the sentencer with a way to give effect to all mitigating evidence including developments after commission of the crime.
Trial courts were generally bound to charge a sentencing
jury to take into account and be guided by a set of legislatively adopted pattern instructions that described relevant
subjects of aggravation and mitigation in terms of 11 "factors." These factors ran the gamut from a defendant's age
and state of mind at the time of the crime to a qualified
catchall at the end: " `(k) [a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal
excuse for the crime.' " Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370,
373-374, and n. 1 (1990); 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.84.1
(4th rev. ed. 1979).

This catchall provision, known as factor (k), was the subject of Boyde, in which the capital defendant had presented
extensive testimony of favorable character in struggling
against great childhood disadvantages. 494 U. S., at 381-
383. It was understood that the evidence was not open to
the jury's consideration under any factor except possibly (k),
and the question was whether the instruction to consider
"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of
the crime" adequately conveyed the idea that character was

Souter, J., dissenting
such a circumstance, even though it was not a fact limited tothe setting of the crime itself.

The Court first laid down the general standard: "whetherthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the
challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consider-ation of constitutionally relevant evidence."

Id., at 380. A
"reasonable likelihood" is more than a mere possibility that
the jury mistook the law, but a defendant "need not establishthat the jury was more likely than not to have been impermissibly inhibited by the instruction." Ibid. A majority ofthe Court then concluded on the facts of Boyde's trial that
there had been no showing that any ambiguity in the instruction had kept the jury from considering the character evidence. Id., at 383-385.

In support of its application of the general standard in
Boyde's case, the Court noted that not all of the other factors
in the instruction were tied to the specifics of the crime; the
defendant's youth at the time of commission could be considered, for example, along with prior criminal activity and
prior felony record. Id., at 383. It was, moreover, only
natural for the jury to consider evidence of character in the
face of hardships, since society generally holds people less
culpable for bad acts related to disadvantages in life. Id., at
382, and n. 5. The Court found it highly implausible that
the jury would have thought it had to ignore testimony of
such evidence, spanning four days and generating over 400
pages of transcript. Id., at 383-384. The pattern instructions as read by the judge included the admonition to make
the penalty decision after considering " `all of the evidence
which has been received during any part of the trial,' " id.,
at 383 (emphasis deleted), and the prosecutor never claimed
that the testimony was not relevant, id., at 385. Rather,
"the prosecutor explicitly assumed that petitioner's character evidence was a proper factor in the weighing process, but
argued that it was minimal in relation to the aggravating
circumstances." Ibid.

Payton, too, was sentenced to death by a jury that had
been given a version of the same pattern instructions, including factor (k). Both the nature of Payton's evidence, however, and the behavior of Payton's prosecutor contrasted
sharply with their counterparts in Boyde, and in a significant
respect the version of the pattern instructions read to Payton's jury differed from the version the Boyde jury heard.

Although the penalty phase of Payton's trial stretched
over three days, mitigation evidence offered through testimony on Payton's behalf came in during parts of two half
days. App. 15-54. In the first such session, two witnesses,
one a minister and the other her congregation's missions director, said that since the commission of his crimes Payton
had made a "commitment to the Lord" that they believed to
be sincere, id., at 18, 23; that he had demonstrated remorse,
id., at 18; and that he manifested his new faith in Bible study,
writing, and spiritual help to fellow inmates, id., at 22-29.
Because Payton's remaining witnesses were not available,
the trial judge excused the jury after just "a short day."
Id., at 31.

Following a weekend break, six witnesses appeared for
Payton, including four former fellow inmates who testified
that he frequently led religious discussions among prisoners,
that he exerted "a very good influence" on others, id., at 34,
and that he "always tr[ied] to help people out," id., at 39.
See generally id., at 32-44. A fifth witness, a deputy sheriff
at Payton's jail, corroborated this testimony, id., at 45-48,
and said that he was glad to have Payton at the jail because
he had a calming influence on other inmates, and because he
occasionally informed the authorities of developing problems,
id., at 49. Finally, Payton's mother testified that she had
seen a change in him during incarceration and believed his
religious conversion was sincere. Id., at 52-54. Thus, Payton's evidence went entirely to his postcrime conversion and

his potential for rehabilitation and usefulness; the presenta-tion of this evidence produced a transcript of only 50 pages.

The trial court sent the case to the jury the next day, aftermeeting with the prosecutor and defense counsel to discuss
the charge, including the factor (k) instruction to considerany other circumstance extenuating the gravity of the crime.
Boyde had not been decided at that point, and defense coun-sel expressed concern that factor (k) could be understood to
exclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence be-cause the facts shown "have something to do with his potential for rehabilitation or his character or his background, butthey don't have anything to do with the crime itself . . . ."
App. 55. The prosecutor readily agreed with that reading.He responded that the language of factor (k) was intended
to reach only circumstances extenuating the gravity of thecrime, to the exclusion of character and background.

Ibid.Indeed, the prosecutor maintained that he did not see "any

ambiguity" in factor (k), id., at 57, and that if the legislaturehad meant background or character to be considered under
factor (k), it would have said so explicitly, id., at 58.The trial court agreed with defense counsel that background and character (including the claimed conversion)should be subject to consideration under factor (k), but
declined to alter the instruction because it was hesitant todepart from the statutory text.

Id., at 58, 61. Instead, thejudge advised the lawyers that they were free to "argue

[that] the defendant's character, background, history, mentalcondition, physical condition . . . certainly fall into category
`k' and certainly make a clear argument to the jury." Id.,at 59. After the judge said explicitly that he thought " `k'
is the all encompassing one that includes . . . what you wantadded,"

id., at 60, defense counsel lobbied one last time for amore accurate instruction, but was rebuffed:

"[Defense counsel]: My only problem is I think we allagree that that's the law, but the jury's not going to
know.

154 BROWN v. PAYTON

Souter, J., dissenting
"The Court: I agree with you. . . . But I'm going todeny [your request], and for the reasons stated." Id.,

at 61.
The trial court then brought in the jury for argument andcharge. When the prosecutor's closing argument got to the

subject of factor (k), this is what he said to the jury:

" `K' says any other circumstance which extenuates orlessens the gravity of the crime. What does that mean?

That to me means some fact--okay?--some factor[s] atthe time of the offense that somehow operates to reduce
the gravity for what the defendant did. It doesn't referto anything after the fact or later. That's particularly
important here because the only defense evidence youhave heard has been about this new born Christianity."
Id., at 68.
Payton's lawyer interrupted, both counsel approached thebench, and, out of the jury's hearing, defense counsel moved

for mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor's statementwas "completely contrary" to the previously agreed interpretation of factor (k). Ibid. When the prosecutor repliedthat defense counsel was wrong and that Payton's mitigating
evidence did not fall within factor (k), id., at 69, the trialcourt failed to resolve the matter, saying that "you can argue
it either way," ibid. Upon return to open court, the judgeinstructed the jury that "the comments by both the prosecution and the defense are not evidence. You've heard the evi-dence and, as I said, this is argument. And it's to be placed
in its proper perspective." Id., at 69-70.The prosecutor then took up exactly where he had left off,
arguing that Payton's proffered mitigating evidence couldnot be considered in the jury's deliberations:

"Referring back to `k' which I was talking about, anyother circumstance which extenuates or lessens the
gravity of the crime, the only defense evidence you'veheard had to do with defendant's new Christianity and

Souter, J., dissenting
that he helped the module deputies in the jail while hewas in custody.

"The problem with that is that evidence is well afterthe fact of the crime and cannot seem to me in any way
to logically lessen the gravity of the offense that thedefendant has committed.

"[Defense counsel] will tell you that somehow that be-coming a newborn Christian, if in fact he really believed
that took place, makes it a less severe crime, but thereis no way that can happen when--under any other circumstance which extenuates or lessens the gravity ofthe crime, refers--seems to refer to a fact in operation
at the time of the offense."What I am getting at, you have not heard during
the past few days any legal evidence mitigation. Whatyou've heard is just some jailhouse evidence to win your
sympathy, and that's all. You have not heard any evi-dence of mitigation in this trial."

Id., at 70.

After the prosecutor recounted the aggravating circum-stances and argued for the death penalty, he turned to the

evidence of Payton's religious conversion, questioned its sin-cerity, and argued that it did not warrant a sentence less
than death when weighed against the aggravating factors.Throughout this discussion, he returned to his point that factor (k) authorizes consideration only of facts as of the timeof the crime. He reminded the jurors again that they had
"heard no evidence of any mitigating factors." Id., at 73.And again: "I don't really want to spend too much time on
[religion] because I don't think it's really applicable and Idon't think it comes under any of the eleven factors." Ibid.
And again: "You haven't heard anything to mitigate whathe's done." Id., at 76.

With the prosecutor arguing that Payton's mitigation evi-dence was not open to consideration under (k) or any other
factor, and with the trial judge sitting on the fence, defensecounsel was left to argue the law himself, stating that "sec544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion (k) may be awkwardly worded, but it does not precludeor exclude the kind of evidence that was presented. It's a

catch-all ph[r]ase. It was designed to include, not exclude,that kind of evidence." Id., at 88. Defense counsel discussed the mitigating evidence at some length before con-cluding that "I think there are a lot of good reasons to keep
Bill Payton alive, an awful lot of good reasons. And that'sexactly what I think `k' is talking about."

Id., at 92.The trial court then gave the jury its final instructions:

"In determining the penalty to be imposed on the de-fendant, you shall consider all of the evidence which has
been received during any part of the trial in this case,except as you may be hereafter instructed. You shall
consider, take into account and be guided by the follow-ing factors, [including] . . . (k), [which says] [a]ny other
circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crimeeven though not a legal excuse for the crime. . . .

"After having heard all of the evidence and after hav-ing heard and considered the argument of counsel, you
shall consider, take into account and be guided by theapplicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed."If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances
outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall imposea sentence of death.

"However, if you determine that the mitigating cir-cumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances,
you shall impose a sentence of confinement in the stateprison for life without the possibility of parole."

Id.,at 94-96.

The jury returned a death verdict.

Souter, J., dissenting
consideration of all mitigating evidence is plain at every stepof the jury's instruction, starting with the trial court's reliance on the pattern jury charge adopted by the legislature.

A
It is undisputed that factor (k) was the instruction thatcomes closest to addressing the jury's obligation to consider

Payton's evidence of postoffense conversion, and the prosecu-tor's remarks in the chambers colloquy both demonstrate the
inadequacy of factor (k) to explain that responsibility andpoint to the seriousness of the trial court's failure to give a
group of laypersons an intelligible statement of the control-ling law. Factor (k) calls on the jury to consider evidence
going to the "gravity of the crime," a notion commonly un-derstood as the joint product of intent, act, and consequence:
intentionally shooting a police officer through the heart isworse than knocking down a pedestrian by careless skateboarding. It is coherent with this understanding to say, asthe Court did in Boyde, that evaluating a defendant's state
of mind at the time of the offense can include considerationof his general character and the experiences that affected its
development, 494 U. S., at 381-382; as the Court explained,when society sits in judgment, it does not ignore the early
hardships of those who turn out bad, id., at 382. But itwould be more than a stretch to say that the seriousness
of the crime itself is affected by a defendant's subsequentexperience. A criminal's subsequent religious conversion is
not a fact commonly accepted as affecting the gravity of thecrime, and even jurors who could overcome their skepticism
about the sincerity of the conversion claim would see it asaddressed not to the nature of the crime but to other issues
bearing on sentence: the moral argument for executing a de-fendant who claims to have realized the awfulness of what he
had done, and the practical argument for protecting others inthe future by taking a life of one who claims to have been
transformed. See, e. g., Skipper v. South Carolina, 476

Souter, J., dissenting
U. S., at 4-5. I will assume that a jury instructed by a judge
to consider evidence of postoffense experience that extenuates the gravity of the crime could have given effect to the
instruction, but without such an explanation it would have
been unnatural to think of evidence of later events as affecting the seriousness of an earlier crime.

Indications of the way factor (k) was understood in California at the time of Payton's trial, in fact, point this way.
The prosecutor who spoke for the State at the trial repeatedly argued to judge and jury that a "circumstance which
extenuates or lessens the gravity of the crime, refers--seems
to refer to a fact in operation at the time of the offense."
App. 70. The prosecutor held this view in good faith, ante,
at 146 (majority opinion), and, indeed, his view was shared
by the state judiciary; even before Boyde, the Supreme
Court of California had found factor (k) inadequate to require consideration of all types of mitigating evidence. In
1983, following our discussion in Eddings, that court directed
that factor (k) be adorned in future cases so as to inform the
jury that it may consider "any other `aspect of [the] defendant's character or record . . . that the defendant proffers as
a basis for a sentence less than death.' " People v. Easley,
34 Cal. 3d 858, 878, n. 10, 671 P. 2d 813, 826, n. 10 (alterations
in original). And, again before Boyde came down, the Legislature of California amended factor (k) to instruct the jury
to consider " `[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the
gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse
for the crime [and any sympathetic or other aspect of the
defendant's character or record [that the defendant offers] as
a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related
to the offense for which he is on trial . . . ].' " 494 U. S., at
374, n. 2 (quoting 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (5th
ed. 1988); alterations in original). Without that amendment, any claim that factor (k) called for consideration of a
defendant's personal development in the wake of his crime

was simply at odds with common attitudes and the Englishlanguage.

B
The next step in the process that failed to give the juryan intelligible instruction to consider all mitigating evidence

consisted of the prosecutor's repeated statements telling thejury to ignore Payton's conversion evidence because it was
not legally relevant:

"[Defense counsel] will tell you that somehow that be-coming a newborn Christian, if in fact he really believed

that took place, makes it a less severe crime, but thereis no way that can happen when--under any other circumstance which extenuates or lessens the gravity ofthe crime, refers--seems to refer to a fact in operation
at the time of the offense."What I am getting at, you have not heard during
the past few days any legal evidence mitigation. Whatyou've heard is just some jailhouse evidence to win your
sympathy, and that's all. You have not heard any evi-dence of mitigation in this trial." App. 70.

Although the prosecutor's argument rested on a perfectlyfair reading of the text of the pattern instruction, its effect,
in the absence of any further instruction, was to tell the jurythat it could not consider the conversion evidence as mitigating. Payton's lawyer immediately objected. He expressedhis understanding that the trial judge had agreed that consideration of the mitigating evidence was constitutionally re-quired and meant to let respective counsel argue only about
its probative value, even though the judge himself had re-fused to address this essential constitutional issue specifically in any particular instruction. One would reasonablysuppose that the trial judge would have realized that the
prosecutor's argument put him on the spot, forcing him tocorrect the misleading statement of law with an explicit instruction that the jury was free to treat the conversion evi544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
160 BROWN v. PAYTON

Souter, J., dissenting
dence as mitigating, evaluating its weight as the jury saw fit.It is, after all, elementary law, federal and state, that the

judge bears ultimate responsibility for instructing a lay juryin the law.

Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 302-303
(1981); Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607, 612-614(1946);

Quercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466, 469 (1933);

Beardslee, 53 Cal. 3d 68, 97, 806 P. 2d 1311, 1326 (1991).
But the trial judge did no such thing. Instead, he merelytold the jury that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence. This instruction cured nothing. The prosecutor's
objectionable comment was not a statement about evidence
but a statement of law. Telling the jury that a statement of
law was not evidence did nothing to correct its functional
error in misstating the law.

It is true that the prosecutor argued that Payton's postcrime evidence was not only beyond the jury's consideration
legally, but also insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The prosecutor, however, minimized the significance even of these brief observations by saying, "I don't
really want to spend too much time on it because I don't
think it's really applicable and I don't think it comes under
any of the eleven factors." App. 73. Far from "explicitly
assum[ing]" that the jury's consideration of the evidence was
proper, Boyde, 494 U. S., at 385, the prosecutor's comments,
interwoven with his clear statements on the scope of factor
(k), could not have left the listener with any doubt about the
prosecutor's view of the legal relevance of the evidence.

Nothing could be further from the circumstances in Boyde.
There the prosecutor agreed that the character evidence was
properly subject to the jury's consideration as mitigating,
even under the ambiguous terms of factor (k). Ibid. The
Boyde jury heard argument about the weight of the evidence, but not a word denying its relevance. Ibid. Indeed,
the Boyde majority specifically distinguished the facts before

Souter, J., dissenting
it from the facts confronting us here, in disclaiming any sug-gestion "that prosecutorial misrepresentations may never

have a decisive effect on the jury," id., at 384; "arguments ofcounsel, like the instructions of the court, must be judged in
the context in which they are made," id., at 385. If theBoyde majority thus anticipated a case like this one, with a
possibility of substantial prejudice arising from misrepresen-tation of the law, the Court's prescience is attributable to
the State's position in the Boyde argument: the SupervisingDeputy Attorney General of California appearing for the
State in Boyde urged the Court to see that case in a lightfavorable to the State, in contrast to Payton's case, to which
counsel referred by name, as a case in which the prosecutorhad "misled the jurors." Tr. of Oral Arg. in O. T. 1989,
No. 88-6613, p. 29. Boyde is thus no authority for giving theState a pass here. The Court is faced with the prosecutor's
conceded misstatement, ante, at 138 (majority opinion), mis-leading to the jury, which obliged the trial court, however
"reluctant to strike out on its own" beyond the pattern in-structions, to "do more than figuratively throw up its hands."
People v. Beardslee, supra, at 97, 806 P. 2d, at 1326.

C
The final misstep that distinguishes this case from the au-thority of

Boyde is the judge's charge, which must be under-stood against the background of the mitigating testimonial

evidence that the jury did, after all, hear. At each stage ofPayton's appeal and collateral challenge, the State has argued that it makes no sense to suggest the jury would havedisregarded substantive evidence with no other purpose than
mitigation, when ignoring it would have meant that Payton'smitigation witnesses were just putting on a pointless charade. An argument like this was one of the reasons for af-firming the conviction in Boyde, supra, at 383, and both the
Supreme Court of California and the majority today rely ona reprise of it to affirm here,

People v. Payton, 3 Cal. 4th

Souter, J., dissenting
1050, 1072, 839 P. 2d 1035, 1049 (1992); ante, at 144 (majorityopinion). This is, however, an argument to be entertained

only with great caution in the best of circumstances, andwhile

Boyde's circumstances were good, this is a very different case from Boyde.The need for caution is plain: the constitutional concern

with mitigating evidence is not satisfied by the mere ability
of a defendant to present it. The sentencing body musthave a genuine opportunity to consider it and give effect to

it. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S., at 320. As the Court saidin

Boyde, "[p]resentation of mitigating evidence alone . . .
does not guarantee that a jury will feel entitled to consider
that evidence." 494 U. S., at 384. For this reason, the
Court has found Eighth Amendment violations in circumstances precluding the sentencing body from considering the
defendant's mitigating evidence, even where the evidence
was extensive and where it accordingly might have been
thought unnatural for the sentencer to disregard it. See,
e. g., Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 788, 803-804 (2001);
Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S., at 107, 113-114.

What is equally plain is that Boyde is no authority for
thinking the combination of evidence, argument, and charge
passes muster here. Boyde's mitigation evidence was extensive enough to take four days and produce over 400 pages
of transcript. It addressed character and hardship, subjects
recognized by the Court as commonly thought relevant to
sentencing, and ignoring it would thus have ignored a large
chunk of intuitively acceptable evidence. Payton's evidence,
in contrast, required parts of two half days and generated only 50 pages, addressing a claim of dramatic selfreformation that most people would treat with considerable
caution. While it would have been unnatural for the jury in
Boyde to feel barred from considering the character evidence
when no lawyer or judge had ever called it irrelevant, Payton's jury had plenty of reason to feel itself precluded: the
prosecutor emphatically and repeatedly said that the evi544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
dence did not count as the kind of evidence that could exten-uate the crime, and the trial judge allowed the prosecutor's

statements to go uncorrected.More significant even than those contrasts between

Boyde
and the facts here is the difference between the two sets ofinstructions from the trial judges. In

Boyde, this Court
found it significant that "[t]he jury was instructed that it
`shall consider all the evidence which has been received dur-ing any part of the trial of this case.' " 494 U. S., at 383

(emphasis added by Boyde majority). Reasonable jurorscould therefore hardly "have felt constrained by the factor
(k) instruction to ignore all of the evidence presented by
[the] petitioner during the sentencing phase." Id., at 383-
384 (emphasis again supplied by Boyde majority).

Here, however, the instruction was different, a variant
permitted by the legislature's pattern charge. Here the instruction was not simply to consider all the evidence, but
rather, "you shall consider all of the evidence which has been
received during any part of the trial in this case, except as
you may be hereafter instructed." App. 94. "Hereafter,"
of course, came the instruction to determine the penalty by
applying the 11 enumerated factors, including factor (k). As
to the factor (k) focus on the "gravity of the crime," the
prosecutor repeatedly had said that evidence of postcrime
conversion was irrelevant, and his mistaken and misleading
statements of law had never been corrected by the trial
judge.

The upshot was this. The jury was told by the judge that
some evidence could be excluded from its consideration.
The judge presumably had some reason to say this. The
only evidence that could reasonably have fallen within the
exception was the evidence the prosecutor had just said was
legally irrelevant, in a statement that was eminently plausible owing to the language of factor (k) and the subject matter
of the evidence. The jurors could naturally have made sense
of all they had heard by concluding they were required not

to scrutinize and discount the conversion evidence if theyfound it unpersuasive, but to skip the scrutiny altogether

and ignore the evidence as legally beside the point. Thiscase is nothing like

Boyde.
But even if the case were closer to Boyde than it is, andeven if the course of Payton's penalty trial were best viewed

the way the majority suggests, that would not satisfy
Boyde's test. Boyde asks only whether there is a "reason-able likelihood" that the jury understood an instruction as

foreclosing consideration of the defendant's mitigating evi-dence. 494 U. S., at 380. A defendant has no need to show
it is "more likely than not" that the jury misunderstood.
Ibid. Accordingly, even if the best explanation for the jury's
verdict were the one the majority offers, that would not
resolve Payton's claim. Identifying the "most likely" interpretation of events at Payton's trial, ante, at 147 (majority
opinion), falls short of negating the reasonably likely alternative that the jury believed it could not consider the story of
Payton's postcrime conversion.

The Court's oft-repeated conclusion that the state court
did not unreasonably apply Boyde seems to rest on two assumptions. The first is a loose understanding of Boyde as
holding that factor (k) "directs jurors to consider any other
circumstance that might lessen a defendant's culpability,"
ante, at 147 (majority opinion). The second is that factor
(k) as so understood directs jurors to consider circumstances
that do not excuse a crime or lessen a defendant's culpability
but nevertheless supply some different (even postcrime) reason to forgo a sentence of death. But Boyde held only that
the factor (k) instruction tells jurors "to consider any other
circumstance that might excuse the crime, which certainly
includes a defendant's background and character," 494 U. S.,
at 382 (emphasis deleted). Boyde did not purport to hold
that factor (k) naturally called for consideration of postcrime
changes of fundamental views. It is thus only by broadening Boyde to sanction a misreading of factor (k), a misreading

that the prosecutor himself rejected in good faith, that theCourt can find a reasonable application of law in the state

court's decision. The mistake will unfortunately reverber-ate even beyond this case, for the majority further obscures
the necessarily inexact distinction between cases that aremerely wrong and cases with objectively unreasonable error.
Cf. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782 (finding that a confusingjury instruction created a reasonable likelihood the jury
would not feel free to consider mitigating evidence, and thatthe state court's contrary conclusion was "objectively unreasonable," even though the jury heard extensive mitigatingevidence submitted without objection as to relevance, even
though the judge took care to instruct the jury to consider" `any aspect of the defendant's character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make adeath sentence inappropriate,' "

when addressing the jury, and even though both counsel ar-gued at length to the jury about the weight of the evidence).

IV
By the State's admission in this case, the prosecutor's ar-gument was a "misstatement" of constitutional law. By the

State's admission in Boyde, the prosecutor here "misled" thejury. Despite objection by defense counsel, the trial judge
refused to correct the misstatement, which the prosecutorproceeded to repeat. The judge's subsequent charge to consider all evidence was subject to a qualification that the jurycould reasonably have understood only as referring to the
mitigation evidence the prosecutor had branded as irrelevantunder a straightforward reading of the pattern instructions.

If a prosecutor had stood before a jury and denied that adefendant was entitled to a presumption of innocence; if the
judge refused to correct him and failed to give any instruc-tion on the presumption of innocence; if the judge's instructions affirmatively suggested there might not be a presump544US1 Unit: $U32 [11-02-07 17:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of innocence; would anyone doubt that there was areasonable possibility that the jury had been misled? There

is no more room here to doubt the reasonable possibility thatPayton's jurors failed to consider the postoffense mitigation
evidence that the Constitution required them to consider.In a case that contrasts with Boyde at every significant step,
the State Supreme Court's affirmance of Payton's convictioncan only be seen as an unreasonable misapplication of the
governing federal standard, not mere error. And since Pay-ton's death sentence is subject to this reasonable possibility
of constitutional error, since he may die as a consequence,the effect of the instruction failure is surely substantial and
injurious, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 638 (1993),beyond any possible excuse as harmless error.

JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BOARD OF EDUCATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 02-1672. Argued November 30, 2004--Decided March 29, 2005
After petitioner, the girls' basketball coach at a public high school, discovered that his team was not receiving equal funding and equal access to
athletic equipment and facilities, he complained unsuccessfully to his
supervisors. He then received negative work evaluations and ultimately was removed as the girls' coach. He brought this suit alleging
that respondent school board (Board) had retaliated against him because
he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school's athletic
program, and that such retaliation violated Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a), which provides that "[n]o person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, be . . . subjected to discrimination
under any education program . . . receiving Federal financial assistance."
The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Title
IX's private cause of action does not include claims of retaliation, and
the Eleventh Circuit agreed and affirmed. The appeals court also concluded that, under Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, the Department of Education's Title IX regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation
does not create a private cause of action, and that, even if Title IX
prohibits retaliation, petitioner is not within the class of persons the
statute protects.

Held: Title IX's private right of action encompasses claims of retaliation

against an individual because he has complained about sex discrimination. Pp. 173-184.

(a) When a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he
complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional "discrimination" "on the basis of sex," in violation of Title IX. This Court has held
that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforce its prohibition
on intentional sex discrimination, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441
U. S. 677, 690-693, and that that right includes actions for monetary
damages by private persons, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and encompasses intentional sex discrimination in
the form of a recipient's deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of
a student by a teacher, Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist.,
524 U. S. 274, 290-291, or by another student, Davis v. Monroe County
Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 642. In all of these cases, the Court relied on

168 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.

Syllabus
Title IX's broad language prohibiting a funding recipient from intentionally subjecting any person to "discrimination" "on the basis of sex."
Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It is a form of "discrimination" because the complainant is subjected to differential treatment.
Moreover, it is discrimination "on the basis of sex" because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination. The Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that Title IX does not
prohibit retaliation because it is silent on the subject ignores the import
of this Court's repeated holdings construing "discrimination" under
Title IX broadly to include conduct, such as sexual harassment, which
the statute does not expressly mention. The fact that Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits retaliation is of limited use
with respect to Title IX. Title VII is a vastly different statute, which
details the conduct that constitutes prohibited discrimination. Because
Congress did not list any specific discriminatory practices in Title IX,
its failure to mention one such practice says nothing about whether it
intended that practice to be covered. Moreover, Congress' enactment
of Title IX just three years after Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.,
396 U. S. 229--in which this Court interpreted 42 U. S. C. $ 1982's general prohibition of racial discrimination to include retaliation against a
white man for advocating the rights of blacks--provides a realistic basis
for presuming that Congress expected Title IX to be interpreted in
conformity with Sullivan. Pp. 173-177.

(b) The Board cannot rely on this Court's holding in Sandoval, supra,
at 285, that, because Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself prohibits only intentional discrimination, private parties could not obtain
redress for disparate-impact discrimination based on the Justice Department's Title VI regulations prohibiting federal funding recipients from
adopting policies with such an impact. Citing the Education Department's Title IX retaliation regulation, the Board contends that Jackson,
like the Sandoval petitioners, seeks an impermissible extension of the
statute when he argues that Title IX's private right of action encompasses retaliation. This argument, however, entirely misses the point.
The Court does not here rely on the Education Department regulation
at all, because Title IX's text itself contains the necessary prohibition:
Retaliation against a person who speaks out against sex discrimination
is intentional "discrimination" "on the basis of sex" within the statute's
meaning. Pp. 177-178.

(c) Nor is the Court convinced by the Board's argument that, even if
Title IX's private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson
is not entitled to invoke it because he is an "indirect victi[m]" of sex
discrimination. The statute is broadly worded; it does not require that
the victim of the retaliation also be the victim of the discrimination that

Syllabus
is the subject of the original complaint. Where the retaliation occurs
because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the statute's "on the basis of sex" requirement is satisfied. The complainant is
himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he
was the subject of the original complaint. Cf. Sullivan, supra, at 237.
Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of federal dollars
to support discriminatory practices, but also "to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices." Cannon, supra, at
704. This objective would be difficult to achieve if persons complaining
about sex discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation. Pp. 179-181.

(d) Nor can the Board rely on the principle that, because Title IX was
enacted as an exercise of Congress' Spending Clause powers, a private
damages action is available only if the federal funding recipient had
adequate notice that it could be held liable for the conduct at issue, see,
e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,
17. Pennhurst does not preclude such an action where, as here, the
funding recipient engages in intentional acts that clearly violate Title
IX. See, e. g., Davis, supra, at 642. Moreover, the Board should have
been put on notice that it could be held liable for retaliation by the fact
that this Court's cases since Cannon have consistently interpreted Title
IX's private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination; by Title IX itself, which expressly prohibits
intentional conduct that violates clear statutory terms, Davis, 526 U. S.,
at 642; by the regulations implementing Title IX, which clearly prohibit
retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years; and by the
holdings of all of the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question
at the time of the conduct at issue that Title IX covers retaliation. The
Board could not have realistically supposed that, given this context, it
remained free to retaliate against those who reported sex discrimination. Cf. id., at 644. Pp. 181-184.

(e) To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove that the Board
retaliated against him because he complained of sex discrimination. At
the present stage, the issue is not whether he will ultimately prevail, but
whether he is entitled to offer evidence to support his claims. P. 184.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Roderick Jackson, a teacher in the Birmingham, Alabama,public schools, brought suit against the Birmingham Board

of Education (Board) alleging that the Board retaliatedagainst him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school's athletic program. Jackson claimedthat the Board's retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-318, 86 Stat. 373, asamended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681

et seq. The District Court dis-missed Jackson's complaint on the ground that Title IX does

not prohibit retaliation, and the Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit affirmed. 309 F. 3d 1333 (2002). We consider here whether the private right of action implied byTitle IX encompasses claims of retaliation. We hold that it
does where the funding recipient retaliates against an indi-vidual because he has complained about sex discrimination.

I
Because Jackson's Title IX claim was dismissed under Fed-eral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a

claim upon which relief can be granted, "we must assumethe truth of the material facts as alleged in the complaint."
Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U. S. 322, 325 (1991).According to the complaint, Jackson has been an employee
of the Birmingham school district for over 10 years. In1993, the Board hired Jackson to serve as a physical education teacher and girls' basketball coach. Jackson was trans-ferred to Ensley High School in August 1999. At Ensley, he
discovered that the girls' team was not receiving equal fund-ing and equal access to athletic equipment and facilities.
The lack of adequate funding, equipment, and facilities madeit difficult for Jackson to do his job as the team's coach.

In December 2000, Jackson began complaining to hissupervisors about the unequal treatment of the girls' basketball team, but to no avail. Jackson's complaints went unan-swered, and the school failed to remedy the situation. In544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stead, Jackson began to receive negative work evaluationsand ultimately was removed as the girls' coach in May 2001.

Jackson is still employed by the Board as a teacher, but heno longer receives supplemental pay for coaching.

After the Board terminated Jackson's coaching duties, hefiled suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. He alleged, among other things,
that the Board violated Title IX by retaliating against himfor protesting the discrimination against the girls' basketball

team. Amended Complaint 2-3, App. 10-11. The Boardmoved to dismiss on the ground that Title IX's private cause
of action does not include claims of retaliation. The District
Court granted the motion to dismiss.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
309 F. 3d 1333 (2002). It assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that the Board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about Title IX violations. It then held that Jackson's
suit failed to state a claim because Title IX does not provide
a private right of action for retaliation, reasoning that
"[n]othing in the text indicates any congressional concern
with retaliation that might be visited on those who complain
of Title IX violations." Id., at 1344. Relying on our decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275 (2001), the
Court of Appeals also concluded that a Department of Education regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does not
create a private cause of action for retaliation: "Because Congress has not created a right through Title IX to redress
harms resulting from retaliation, [the regulation] may not be
read to create one either." 309 F. 3d, at 1346. Finally, the
court held that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, Jackson
would not be entitled to relief because he is not within the
class of persons protected by the statute.

We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 903 (2004), to resolve a
conflict in the Circuits over whether Title IX's private right
of action encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints
about sex discrimination. Compare Lowrey v. Texas A & M

A

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination by recipients of fed-eral education funding. The statute provides that "[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, beexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any education programor activity receiving Federal financial assistance. " 20
U. S. C. $ 1681(a). More than 25 years ago, in Cannon v.University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 690-693 (1979), we held
that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforceits prohibition on intentional sex discrimination. In subsequent cases, we have defined the contours of that right ofaction. In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
503 U. S. 60 (1992), we held that it authorizes private partiesto seek monetary damages for intentional violations of Title
IX. We have also held that the private right of action en-compasses intentional sex discrimination in the form of a
recipient's deliberate indifference to a teacher's sexual har-assment of a student,

Gebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1998), or to sexual harassment of a student by another student, Davis v. MonroeCounty Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 642 (1999).

In all of these cases, we relied on the text of Title IX,which, subject to a list of narrow exceptions not at issue
here, broadly prohibits a funding recipient from subjectingany person to "discrimination" "on the basis of sex." 20
U. S. C. $ 1681. Retaliation against a person because thatperson has complained of sex discrimination is another form
of intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX'sprivate cause of action. Retaliation is, by definition, an in544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.

Opinion of the Court
tentional act. It is a form of "discrimination" because thecomplainant is being subjected to differential treatment.

See generally Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U. S. 581, 614 (1999)(

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (the "normal definition of discrimination" is "differential treatment"); see also
Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462
U. S. 669, 682, n. 22 (1983) (discrimination means "less favorable" treatment). Moreover, retaliation is discrimination"on the basis of sex" because it is an intentional response to

the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimina-tion. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates
against a person because he complains of sex discrimination,
this constitutes intentional "discrimination" "on the basis of
sex," in violation of Title IX.

The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Title IX does not
prohibit retaliation because the "statute makes no mention
of retaliation," 309 F. 3d, at 1344, ignores the import of our
repeated holdings construing "discrimination" under Title IX
broadly. Though the statute does not mention sexual harassment, we have held that sexual harassment is intentional
discrimination encompassed by Title IX's private right of action. Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75; see also id., at 75 (noting
that, under Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.
57, 64 (1986), " `when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor "discriminate[s]" on the basis of sex,' " and holding that "the
same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses . . .
a student"). Thus, a recipient's deliberate indifference to a
teacher's sexual harassment of a student also "violate[s] Title
IX's plain terms." Davis, supra, at 643 (citing Gebser,
supra, at 290-291). Likewise, a recipient's deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of a student by another student
also squarely constitutes "discrimination" "on the basis of
sex." Davis, 526 U. S., at 643; see also id., at 650 ("Having
previously determined that `sexual harassment' is `discrimination' . . . under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude

Opinion of the Court
that student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficientlysevere, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination actionable under the statute"). "Discrimination" is a term thatcovers a wide range of intentional unequal treatment; by
using such a broad term, Congress gave the statute a broadreach. See

North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512,
521 (1982) (Courts " `must accord' " Title IX " `a sweep as
broad as its language' ").Congress certainly could have mentioned retaliation in

Title IX expressly, as it did in $ 704 of Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 86 Stat. 109, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a) (providing that it is an "unlawful employment practice" for an employer to retaliate against an
employee because he has "opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because he has
made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any
manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under
[Title VII]"). Title VII, however, is a vastly different
statute from Title IX, see Gebser, 524 U. S., at 283-284,
286-287, and the comparison the Board urges us to draw is
therefore of limited use. Title IX's cause of action is implied, while Title VII's is express. See id., at 283-284.
Title IX is a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination, followed by specific, narrow exceptions to that broad
prohibition. See 20 U. S. C. $ 1681. By contrast, Title VII
spells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute. See 42 U. S. C.

$$ 2000e-2 (giving examples of unlawful employment practices), 2000e-3 (prohibiting "[o]ther unlawful employment
practices," including (a) "[d]iscrimination" in the form of retaliation; and (b) the discriminatory practice of "[p]rinting or
publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference . . . "). Because Congress did not list any
specific discriminatory practices when it wrote Title IX, its
failure to mention one such practice does not tell us anything
about whether it intended that practice to be covered.

176 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.

Opinion of the Court
Title IX was enacted in 1972, three years after our deci-sion in

Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229
(1969). In Sullivan, we held that Rev. Stat. $ 1978, 42U. S. C. $ 1982, which provides that "[a]ll citizens of the

United States shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed bywhite citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and
convey real and personal property," protected a white man
who spoke out against discrimination toward one of his ten-ants and who suffered retaliation as a result. Sullivan had

rented a house to a black man and assigned him a member-ship share and use rights in a private park. The corporation
that owned the park would not approve the assignment tothe black lessee. Sullivan protested, and the corporation retaliated against him by expelling him and taking his shares.Sullivan sued the corporation, and we upheld Sullivan's cause
of action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1982 for "[retaliation] for theadvocacy of [the black person's] cause." 396 U. S., at 237.
Thus, in Sullivan we interpreted a general prohibition onracial discrimination to cover retaliation against those who
advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition.1

Congress enacted Title IX just three years after Sullivanwas decided, and accordingly that decision provides a valuable context for understanding the statute. As we recog-nized in

Cannon, "it is not only appropriate but also realistic
to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan] and that it expected its enactment [of Title IX] to be
interpreted in conformity with [it]." 441 U. S., at 699; see
also id., at 698, n. 22. Retaliation for Jackson's advocacy of
the rights of the girls' basketball team in this case is "dis1 Justice Thomas contends that Sullivan merely decided that the white
owner had standing to assert the rights of the black lessee. Post, at 194
(dissenting opinion). But Sullivan's holding was not so limited. It
plainly held that the white owner could maintain his own private cause of
action under $ 1982 if he could show that he was "punished for trying to
vindicate the rights of minorities." 396 U. S., at 237.

Opinion of the Court
crimination" "on the basis of sex," just as retaliation for ad-vocacy on behalf of a black lessee in Sullivan was discrimination on the basis of race. B

The Board contends that our decision in Alexander v. San-doval, 532 U. S. 275 (2001), compels a holding that Title IX's
private right of action does not encompass retaliation. San-doval involved an interpretation of Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000d et seq., which provides in $ 601 that no person shall,
"on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excludedfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" cov-ered by Title VI. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d. Section 602 of Title
VI authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisionsin $ 601 by enacting regulations. Pursuant to that authority,
the Department of Justice promulgated regulations prohibit-ing funding recipients from adopting policies that had "the
effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because oftheir race, color, or national origin." 28 CFR $ 42.104(b)(2)
(1999). The Sandoval petitioners brought suit to enjoin anEnglish-only policy of the Alabama Department of Public
Safety on grounds that it disparately impacted non-Englishspeakers in violation of the regulations. Though we assumed that the regulations themselves were valid, see 532U. S., at 281, we rejected the contention that the private
right of action to enforce intentional violations of Title VIencompassed suits to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. We did so because "[i]t is clear . . . that thedisparate-impact regulations do not simply apply $ 601--

178 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.

Opinion of the Court
(1994) (A "private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on aregulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited by

the text of [the statute]"). Thus, Sandoval held that privateparties may not invoke Title VI regulations to obtain redress
for disparate-impact discrimination because Title VI itselfprohibits only intentional discrimination.

The Board cites a Department of Education regulationprohibiting retaliation "against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by[Title IX]," 34 CFR $ 100.7(e) (2004) (incorporated by reference by $ 106.71), and contends that Jackson, like the peti-tioners in

Sandoval, seeks an "impermissible extension ofthe statute" when he argues that Title IX's private right

of action encompasses retaliation. Brief for Respondent 45.This argument, however, entirely misses the point. We do
not rely on regulations extending Title IX's protection be-yond its statutory limits; indeed, we do not rely on the Department of Education's regulation at all, because the statute
itself contains the necessary prohibition. As we explainabove, see supra, at 174-175, the text of Title IX prohibits a

funding recipient from retaliating against a person whospeaks out against sex discrimination, because such retaliation is intentional "discrimination" "on the basis of sex."We reach this result based on the statute's text. In step
with Sandoval, we hold that Title IX's private right of actionencompasses suits for retaliation, because retaliation falls
within the statute's prohibition of intentional discriminationon the basis of sex.

under Title IX for conduct not prohibited by that statute. Post, at 193

plaintiff may not bring a 10b-5 suit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of $ 10(b)"). But we part ways with regard to our
reading of the statute. We interpret Title IX's text to clearly prohibit
retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination.

Opinion of the Court

C
Nor are we convinced by the Board's argument that, evenif Title IX's private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not entitled to invoke it because he is an"indirect victi[m]" of sex discrimination. Brief for Respondent 33. The statute is broadly worded; it does not requirethat the victim of the retaliation must also be the victim of
the discrimination that is the subject of the original com-plaint. If the statute provided instead that "no person shall
be subjected to discrimination on the basis of such individual's sex," then we would agree with the Board. Cf. 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1) ("It shall be an unlawful employment

practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's race, color, religion,sex, or national origin" (emphasis added)). However, Title

IX contains no such limitation. Where the retaliation oc-curs because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the "on the basis of sex" requirement is satisfied.The complainant is himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the originalcomplaint.

3 As we explain above, see supra, at 176-177, this

is consistent with Sullivan, which formed an important part

3 Justice Thomas contends that "extending the implied cause of action
under Title IX to claims of retaliation expands the class of people the
statute protects beyond the specified beneficiaries." Post, at 194 (dissenting opinion). But Title IX's beneficiaries plainly include all those who are
subjected to "discrimination" "on the basis of sex." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a).
Because, as we explain above, see supra, at 174-175, retaliation in response to a complaint about sex discrimination is "discrimination" "on the
basis of sex," the statute clearly protects those who suffer such retaliation.
The following hypothetical, offered by petitioner at oral argument, illustrates this point: If the male captain of the boys' basketball team and the
female captain of the girls' basketball team together approach the school
principal to complain about discrimination against the girls' team, and the
principal retaliates by expelling them both from the honor society, then
both the female and the male captains have been "discriminated" against
"on the basis of sex." Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54.

Opinion of the Court
of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX.
Sullivan made clear that retaliation claims extend to those
who oppose discrimination against others. See 396 U. S., at237 (holding that a person may bring suit under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1982 if he can show that he was "punished for trying tovindicate the rights of minorities").

Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of
federal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also"to provide individual citizens effective protection against

those practices." Cannon, 441 U. S., at 704. We agree withthe United States that this objective "would be difficult, if
not impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about sex
discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.
If recipients were permitted to retaliate freely, individuals
who witness discrimination would be loath to report it, and
all manner of Title IX violations might go unremedied as
a result. See Sullivan, supra, at 237 (noting that without
protection against retaliation, the underlying discrimination
is perpetuated).

Reporting incidents of discrimination is integral to Title
IX enforcement and would be discouraged if retaliation
against those who report went unpunished. Indeed, if retaliation were not prohibited, Title IX's enforcement scheme
would unravel. Recall that Congress intended Title IX's
private right of action to encompass claims of a recipient's
deliberate indifference to sexual harassment. See generally
Davis, 526 U. S. 629. Accordingly, if a principal sexually
harasses a student, and a teacher complains to the school
board but the school board is indifferent, the board would
likely be liable for a Title IX violation. See generally
Gebser, 524 U. S. 274. But if Title IX's private right of action does not encompass retaliation claims, the teacher would
have no recourse if he were subsequently fired for speaking
out. Without protection from retaliation, individuals who
witness discrimination would likely not report it, indiffer544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

181Cite as: 544 U. S. 167 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
ence claims would be short circuited, and the underlying dis-crimination would go unremedied.

Title IX's enforcement scheme also depends on individualreporting because individuals and agencies may not bring
suit under the statute unless the recipient has received "ac-tual notice" of the discrimination. Id., at 288, 289-290 (holding that an appropriate official of the funding recipient musthave actual knowledge of discrimination and respond with
deliberate indifference before a private party may bringsuit); 20 U. S. C. $ 1682 (providing that a federal agency may
terminate funding only after it "has advised the appropriateperson or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be securedby voluntary means"). If recipients were able to avoid such
notice by retaliating against all those who dare complain,the statute's enforcement scheme would be subverted. We
should not assume that Congress left such a gap in itsscheme.

Moreover, teachers and coaches such as Jackson areoften in the best position to vindicate the rights of their
students because they are better able to identify discrimina-tion and bring it to the attention of administrators. Indeed,
sometimes adult employees are " `the only effective adver-sar[ies]' " of discrimination in schools. See Sullivan, supra,
at 237 ("[A] white owner is at times `the only effective adver-sary' of the unlawful restrictive covenant" (citing Barrows v.
Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 259 (1953))).

The Board is correct in pointing out that, because Title IXwas enacted as an exercise of Congress' powers under the

Spending Clause, see, e. g., Davis, supra, at 640; Gebser,
supra, at 287; Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75, and n. 8, "privatedamages actions are available only where recipients of federal funding had adequate notice that they could be liable forthe conduct at issue,"

Davis, supra, at 640. When Congress

Opinion of the Court
enacts legislation under its spending power, that legislationis "in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the

States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions."
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451
U. S. 1, 17 (1981). As we have recognized, "[t]here can . . .be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the contract] if a

State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the legislation
on its receipt of funds]." Ibid.The Board insists that we should not interpret Title IX to

prohibit retaliation because it was not on notice that it couldbe held liable for retaliating against those who complain of
Title IX violations. We disagree. Funding recipients have
been on notice that they could be subjected to private suits
for intentional sex discrimination under Title IX since 1979,
when we decided Cannon. Pennhurst does not preclude
private suits for intentional acts that clearly violate Title IX.
Davis, supra, at 642.

Indeed, in Davis, we held that Pennhurst did not pose an
obstacle to private suits for damages in cases of a recipient's
deliberate indifference to one student's sexual harassment of
another, because the deliberate indifference constituted intentional discrimination on the basis of sex. Davis, supra,
at 650. See also Franklin, supra, at 75 ("Congress surely
did not intend for federal moneys to be expended to support
the intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe").
Similarly, we held in Gebser that a recipient of federal funding could be held liable for damages under Title IX for deliberate indifference to a teacher's harassment of a student.
524 U. S., at 287-288. In Gebser, as in Davis, we acknowledged that federal funding recipients must have notice that
they will be held liable for damages. See Davis, supra, at
642; Gebser, supra, at 287. But we emphasized that "this
limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liability
where a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute."
Davis, supra, at 642 (citing Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75).
See also ibid. ("[T]he [Pennhurst] notice problem does not

Opinion of the Court
arise in a case such as this, in which intentional discrimina-tion is alleged");

Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S.
656, 665-666 (1985) (holding that there was sufficient no-tice under

Pennhurst where a statute made clear that some
conditions were placed on the receipt of federal funds, andstating that Congress need not "specifically identif[y] and

proscrib[e]" each condition in the legislation). Simply put,
"Pennhurst does not bar a private damages action underTitle IX where the funding recipient engages in intentional

conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute." Davis,
supra, at 642.

Thus, the Board should have been put on notice by the fact
that our cases since Cannon, such as Gebser and Davis, have
consistently interpreted Title IX's private cause of action
broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination. Indeed, retaliation presents an even easier
case than deliberate indifference. It is easily attributable
to the funding recipient, and it is always--by definition--
intentional. We therefore conclude that retaliation against
individuals because they complain of sex discrimination is
"intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute," Davis, 526 U. S., at 642, and that Title IX itself therefore supplied sufficient notice to the Board that it could not
retaliate against Jackson after he complained of discrimination against the girls' basketball team.

The regulations implementing Title IX clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years.
Cf., e. g., id., at 643 (holding that Title IX's regulatory
scheme "has long provided funding recipients with notice
that they may be liable for their failure to respond to the
discriminatory acts of certain nonagents"). More importantly, the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue in this case all had
already interpreted Title IX to cover retaliation. See, e. g.,
Lowrey, 117 F. 3d, at 252; Preston, 31 F. 3d, at 206. The
Board could not have realistically supposed that, given this

Thomas, J., dissenting
context, it remained free to retaliate against those who re-ported sex discrimination. Cf.

Davis, supra, at 644 (stating
that the common law of torts "has put schools on notice thatthey may be held responsible under state law for their failure

to protect students from the tortious acts of third parties").A reasonable school board would realize that institutions
covered by Title IX cannot cover up violations of that law
by means of discriminatory retaliation.To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove that

the Board retaliated against him because he complained ofsex discrimination. The amended complaint alleges that the
Board retaliated against Jackson for complaining to his su-pervisor, Ms. Evelyn Baugh, about sex discrimination at Ensley High School. At this stage of the proceedings, "[t]heissue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but
whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to supportthe claims."

Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 236 (1974).
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The Court holds that the private right of action under
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, for sex discrimination that it implied in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), extends to claims of retaliation.
Its holding is contrary to the plain terms of Title IX, because
retaliatory conduct is not discrimination on the basis of sex.
Moreover, we require Congress to speak unambiguously in
imposing conditions on funding recipients through its spending power. And, in cases in which a party asserts that a
cause of action should be implied, we require that the statute
itself evince a plain intent to provide such a cause of action.

Section 901 of Title IX meets none of these requirements.I therefore respectfully dissent.

I
Title IX provides education funding to States, subject to$ 901's condition that "[n]o person in the United States shall,

on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, bedenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving Federalfinancial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). Section 901
does not refer to retaliation. Consequently, the statute pro-hibits such conduct only if it falls within $ 901's prohibition
against discrimination "on the basis of sex." It does not.A claim of retaliation is not a claim of discrimination on the
basis of sex. In the context of $ 901, the natural meaning ofthe phrase "on the basis of sex" is on the basis of the plaintiff 's sex, not the sex of some other person. See Leocal v.
Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004) ("When interpreting a statute,we must give words their ordinary or natural meaning" (internal quotation marks omitted)). For example, suppose asexist air traffic controller withheld landing permission for a
plane because the pilot was a woman. While the sex dis-crimination against the female pilot no doubt adversely impacted male passengers aboard that plane, one would neversay that they were discriminated against "on the basis of
sex" by the controller's action.Congress' usage of the phrase "on the basis of sex" confirms this commonsense conclusion. Even within Title VIIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself, Congress used the
phrase "on the basis of sex" as a shorthand for discrimination"on the basis of such individual's sex." Specifically, in ensuring that Title VII reached discrimination because of preg-nancy, Congress provided that "[t]he terms `because of sex'
or `on the basis of sex' include, but are not limited to, becauseof or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(k); cf. California Fed.

Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 277 (1987) (de-scribing how Congress amended Title VII to specify that sex

discrimination included discrimination on the basis of preg-nancy). The reference to "on the basis of sex" in this provision must refer to Title VII's prohibition on discrimination"because of such individual's . . . sex," suggesting that Congress used the phrases interchangeably. $ 2000e-2(a)(1).
After all, Title VII's general prohibition against discrimina-tory employer practices does not use "[t]he terms `because

of sex' or `on the basis of sex.' " It uses only the phrase"because of such individual's . . . sex."

Ibid.
This Court has also consistently used the phrase "on the
basis of sex" as a shorthand for on the basis of the claimant's
sex. See, e. g., United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 239
(1992); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57,
64 (1986). Thus, for a disparate-treatment claim to be a
claim of discrimination on the basis of sex, the claimant's sex
must have "actually played a role in [the decisionmaking]
process and had a determinative influence on the outcome,"
Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993). Cf.
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 335, n. 15 (1977)
(" `Disparate treatment' . . . is the most easily understood
type of discrimination. The employer simply treats some
people less favorably than others because of their race, color,
religion, sex, or [other protected trait]").

Jackson's assertion that the Birmingham Board of Education (Board) retaliated against him fails to allege sex discrimination in this sense. Jackson does not claim that his own
sex played any role, let alone a decisive or predominant one,
in the decision to relieve him of his position. Instead, he
avers that he complained to his supervisor about sex discrimination against the girls' basketball team and that, sometime
subsequent to his complaints, he lost his coaching position.
App. 10-11. At best, then, he alleges discrimination "on the
basis of sex" founded on the attenuated connection between
the supposed adverse treatment and the sex of others. Be544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cause Jackson's claim for retaliation is not a claim that hissex played a role in his adverse treatment, the statute's plain

terms do not encompass it.Jackson's lawsuit therefore differs fundamentally from
other examples of sex discrimination, like sexual harassment.Ante, at 174-175. A victim of sexual harassment suffers
discrimination because of her own sex, not someone else's.Cases in which this Court has held that $ 901 reaches claims
of vicarious liability for sexual harassment are therefore in-apposite here. See,

e. g., Davis v. Monroe County Bd. ofEd., 526 U. S. 629, 641-649 (1999); Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 277 (1998); Franklin v.Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 75 (1992). In
fact, virtually every case in which this Court has addressedTitle IX concerned a claimant who sought to recover for discrimination because of her own sex. Davis, supra, at 633-635; National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S.
459, 462 (1999); Gebser, supra, at 277-279; Franklin, supra,at 63-64;

Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.718, 721 (1982); North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512,

517-518 (1982); Cannon, 441 U. S., at 680. Again, Jacksonmakes no such claim.

Moreover, Jackson's retaliation claim lacks the connectionto actual sex discrimination that the statute requires. Jackson claims that he suffered reprisal because he complainedabout sex discrimination, not that the sex discrimination underlying his complaint occurred. This feature of Jackson'scomplaint is not surprising, since a retaliation claimant need
not prove that the complained-of sex discrimination hap-pened. Although this Court has never addressed the question, no Court of Appeals requires a complainant to showmore than that he had a reasonable, good-faith belief that
discrimination occurred to prevail on a retaliation claim.1

Retaliation therefore cannot be said to be discrimination onthe basis of anyone's sex, because a retaliation claim may

succeed where no sex discrimination ever took place.The majority ignores these fundamental characteristics of
retaliation claims. Its sole justification for holding thatJackson has suffered sex discrimination is its statement that
"retaliation is discrimination `on the basis of sex' because itis an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an
allegation of sex discrimination." Ante, at 174.2 But thesex-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact
that the retaliation is not based on anyone's sex, much lessthe complainer's sex. For example, if a coach complains to
school officials about the dismantling of the men's swimmingteam, which he honestly and reasonably, but incorrectly, believes is occurring because of the sex of the team, and he isfired, he may prevail. Yet, he would not have been discrimiv. Dallas Morning News, Inc., 209 F. 3d 419, 428 (CA5 2000); Johnson v.

(2001) (per curiam) (where no reasonable person could have believed that
the incident constituted sex harassment violating Title VII, employee
could not prevail on her retaliation claim).

2 Tellingly, the Court does not adopt the rationale offered by petitioner

at oral argument. According to petitioner, "[b]ut for the discrimination
on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and . . . had he not
made a complaint about sex discrimination, he would [not] have lost his
[coaching] position." Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. This "but for" chain exposes
the faulty premise in the position that retaliation is on the basis of sex.
The first and necessary step in this chain of causation is that "discrimination on the basis of sex" occurred. Yet, retaliation claims require proving
no such thing. Thus, the "but for" link articulated by counsel between
"discrimination on the basis of sex" and the adverse employment action
does not exist.

nated against on the basis of his sex, for his own sex playedno role, and the men's swimming team over which he expressed concern also suffered no discrimination on the basisof sex. In short, no discrimination on the basis of sex has
occurred.At bottom, and petitioner as much as concedes, retaliation
is a claim that aids in enforcing another separate and distinctright. Brief for Petitioner 13 (noting the relationship retaliation bears to "primary discrimination"). In other contexts,this Court has recognized that protection from retaliation is
separate from direct protection of the primary right and
serves as a prophylactic measure to guard the primary right.See

Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 588, n. 10 (1998)
("The reason why such retaliation offends the Constitutionis that it threatens to inhibit [the] exercise of the protected

right").3 As we explained with regard to Title VII's retalia-tion prohibition, "a primary purpose of antiretaliation provisions" is "[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms." Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337,346 (1997). To describe retaliation as discrimination on the

basis of sex is to conflate the enforcement mechanism withthe right itself, something for which the statute's text provides no warrant.Moreover, that the text of Title IX does not mention retaliation is significant. By contrast to Title IX, Congressenacted a separate provision in Title VII to address retaliation, in addition to its general prohibition on discrimination.$ 2000e-3(a). Congress' failure to include similar text in
Title IX shows that it did not authorize private retaliationactions. This difference cannot be dismissed, as the major3 See also Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442 U. S.
366, 387 (1979) (White, J., dissenting) ("Clearly, respondent's right under

$ 704(a)--to be free from retaliation for efforts to aid others asserting Title
VII rights--is distinct from the Title VII right implicated in [this] claim
under $ 1985(3), which is the right of women employees not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sex").

ity suggests, on the ground that Title VII is a more specificstatute in which Congress proscribed particular practices, as

opposed to the general prohibition here. Ante, at 175. Thefact that Congress created those specific prohibitions in Title
VII is evidence that it intended to preclude courts from im-plying similar specific prohibitions in Title IX.

Even apart from Title VII, Congress expressly prohibited
retaliation in other discrimination statutes. See, e. g., 42U. S. C. $ 12203(a) (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990);

29 U. S. C. $ 623(d) (Age Discrimination in Employment Actof 1967). If a prohibition on "discrimination" plainly encompasses retaliation, the explicit reference to it in these statutes, as well as in Title VII, would be superfluous--a result
we eschew in statutory interpretation. The better explanation is that when Congress intends to include a prohibition
against retaliation in a statute, it does so. See Central
Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,
N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 176-177 (1994). Its failure to do so in

$ 901 is therefore telling.

II

The Court's holding is also inconsistent with two lines of
this Court's precedent: Our rule that Congress must speak
with a clear voice when it imposes liability on the States
through its spending power and our refusal to imply a cause
of action when Congress' intent to create a right or a remedy
is not evident.

As the majority acknowledges, Congress enacted Title IX
pursuant to its spending power. Ante, at 181 (citing Davis,

Davis, 526
U. S., at 641. Thus, "[i]n interpreting language in spendinglegislation, we . . . `insis[t] that Congress speak with a clear

voice,' " id., at 640 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17), and a
condition must be imposed "unambiguously," ibid.; Gonzaga
Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 280 (2002); Barnes, supra, at 186.

The Court's holding casts aside this principle. As I haveexplained,

supra, at 185-190, the statute's plain terms do not
authorize claims of retaliation. The same analysis showsthat, at the least, the statute does not clearly authorize retaliation claims. The majority points out that the statute doesnot say: " `[N]o person shall be subjected to discrimination
on the basis of such individual's sex.' " Ante, at 179 (em-phasis in original). But this reasoning puts the analysis
backwards. The question is not whether Congress clearlyexcluded retaliation claims under Title IX, but whether it
clearly included them. The majority's statement at best
points to ambiguity in the statute; yet ambiguity is resolvedin favor of the States, which must be aware when they accept federal funds of the obligations they thereby agree to
assume.

The majority asserts that "the Board should have been
put on notice by the fact that our cases since Cannon, such
as Gebser and Davis, have consistently interpreted Title IX's
private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms
of intentional sex discrimination." Ante, at 183. Gebser
and Davis did not hold or imply that Title IX prohibited
"diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination"; they held
that schools could be held vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by students or teachers. See Gebser,
supra, at 277; Davis, supra, at 633. There was no question
that the sexual harassment in those cases was sex discrimination. See Meritor Savings, 477 U. S., at 64 ("Without
question, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate

Thomas, J., dissenting
because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor `discriminate[s]' on the basis of sex"). These cases hardly gave notice
to the Board here that retaliation liability loomed.

More important, the Court's rationale untethers notice
from the statute. The Board, and other Title IX recipients,
must now assume that if conduct can be linked to sex
discrimination--no matter how attenuated that link--this
Court will impose liability under Title IX. That there is a
regulation proscribing retaliation in Title IX administrative
enforcement proceedings is no answer, ante, at 183, for it
says nothing about whether retaliation is discrimination on
the basis of sex, much less whether there is a private cause
of action for such conduct. Rather than requiring clarity
from Congress, the majority requires clairvoyance from
funding recipients.

B

Even apart from the clarity we consistently require of obligations imposed by spending power legislation, extending
the cause of action implied in Cannon to Jackson's claim contradicts the standard we have set for implying causes of action to enforce federal statutes. Whether a statute supplies
a cause of action is a matter of statutory interpretation.
See Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 568
(1979). We must examine whether the statute creates a
right. That right "must be phrased in terms of the person benefited." Gonzaga, supra, at 284 (internal quotation
marks omitted); see also Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1102, 1103 (1991). And our inquiry is
not merely whether the statute benefits some class of people,
but whether that class includes the plaintiff in the case before us. Our role, then, is not " `to provide such remedies as
are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose'
expressed by a statute," but to examine the text of what
Congress enacted into law. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532
U. S. 275, 287 (2001) (quoting J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S.

544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
426, 433 (1964)); Virginia Bankshares, supra, at 1102; Touche
Ross & Co., supra, at 578. If the statute evinces no intent
to create a right for the plaintiff in the case before us, weshould not imply a cause of action.

This Court has held that these principles apply equallywhen the Court has previously found that the statute in
question provides an implied right of action and a party attempts to expand the class of persons or the conduct to whichthe recognized action applies.

Virginia Bankshares, supra,
at 1102. More specifically, this Court has rejected the cre-ation of implied causes of action for ancillary claims like retaliation. In Central Bank, we concluded that $ 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended,
15 U. S. C. $ 78j, provided no civil action against those who
aid and abet individuals engaging in manipulative or deceptive practices, though the respondents urged that such a
claim was necessary to fulfill the statute's protection against
deceit in the securities marketplace. 511 U. S., at 177, 188.
We declined to do so even though this Court had implied a
cause of action for $ 10(b). See Borak, supra. In our view,
while the statute's language potentially reached the conduct
of some aiders and abettors, the full scope of liability for
aiding and abetting would have extended liability beyond the
conduct prohibited by the statute. Central Bank, 511 U. S.,
at 176. We surveyed other statutes and found that "Congress knew how to impose aiding and abetting liability when
it chose to do so." Id., at 176-177. Our view that the statute did not reach aiding and abetting was also confirmed by
the fact that an "element critical for recovery" in actions
against those engaging in fraudulent and manipulative acts
was not required in proving that someone had aided and
abetted such persons. Id., at 180.

The same reasons militate equally against extending the
implied cause of action under Title IX to retaliation claims.
As in Central Bank, imposing retaliation liability expands
the statute beyond discrimination "on the basis of sex" to

Thomas, J., dissenting
instances in which no discrimination on the basis of sex hasoccurred. Again, $ 901 protects individuals only from discrimination on the basis of their own sex. Supra, at 185-187. Thus, extending the implied cause of action under Title
IX to claims of retaliation expands the class of people thestatute protects beyond the specified beneficiaries. As with
the absence of aiding and abetting from the statute at issuein

Central Bank, I find it instructive that $ 901 does not ex-pressly prohibit retaliation, while other discrimination statutes do so explicitly. And like the aiding and abetting liabil-ity in Central Bank, prevailing on a claim of retaliation lacks
elements necessary to prevailing on a claim of discriminationon the basis of sex, for no sex discrimination need have
occurred.The majority's reliance on Sullivan v. Little Hunting
Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969), is wholly misplaced. Ante,at 176-177. Rather than holding that a general prohibition
against discrimination permitted a claim of retaliation, Sullivan held that a white lessor had standing to assert the rightof a black lessee to be free from racial discrimination pursuant to Rev. Stat. $ 1978, 42 U. S. C. $ 1982. 396 U. S., at 237("[T]here can be no question but that Sullivan has standing
to maintain this action" (citing Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S.249 (1953), a standing case)).

4 To make out his third-party

claim on behalf of the black lessee, the white lessor wouldnecessarily be required to demonstrate that the defendant

had discriminated against the black lessee on the basis ofrace. Jackson, by contrast, need not show that the sex discrimination forming the basis of his complaints actually oc-curred. Thus, by recognizing Jackson's claim, the majority
creates an entirely new cause of action for a secondary rightsholder, beyond the claim of the original rights holder, and

4 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1982 provides: "All citizens of the United States shall
have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white
citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and
personal property."

well beyond Sullivan. In any event, Sullivan involved

$ 1982, a statute enacted pursuant to Congress' Thirteenth
Amendment enforcement power, Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer
Co., 392 U. S. 409, 437-438 (1968), not its spending power.
Sullivan therefore says nothing about whether Title IX
clearly conditions States' receipt of federal funds on retaliation liability.

III

The Court establishes a prophylactic enforcement mechanism designed to encourage whistle-blowing about sex discrimination. The language of Title IX does not support this
holding. The majority also offers nothing to demonstrate
that its prophylactic rule is necessary to effectuate the statutory scheme. Nothing prevents students--or their parents--from complaining about inequality in facilities or
treatment. See, e. g., Franklin, 503 U. S., at 63 (student
brought suit); Davis, 526 U. S., at 633 (suit brought by minor's parent). Under the majority's reasoning, courts may
expand liability as they, rather than Congress, see fit. This
is no idle worry. The next step is to say that someone
closely associated with the complainer, who claims he suffered retaliation for those complaints, likewise has a retaliation claim under Title IX. See 2 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Compliance Manual $ 8-II, p. 8-10 (1998)
("[I]t would be unlawful for a respondent to retaliate against
an employee because his or her spouse, who is also an employee, filed an EEOC charge").

By crafting its own additional enforcement mechanism, the
majority returns this Court to the days in which it created
remedies out of whole cloth to effectuate its vision of congressional purpose. In doing so, the majority substitutes its
policy judgments for the bargains struck by Congress, as
reflected in the statute's text. The question before us is
only whether Title IX prohibits retaliation, not whether prohibiting it is good policy. Central Bank, supra, at 177. For

CITY OF SHERRILL, NEW YORK v. ONEIDA INDIAN

NATION OF NEW YORK et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 03-855. Argued January 11, 2005--Decided March 29, 2005
Respondent Oneida Indian Nation of New York (OIN or Tribe) is a direct

descendant of the Oneida Indian Nation (Oneida Nation), whose aboriginal homeland, at the Nation's birth, comprised some six million acres in
what is now central New York State. See, e. g., Oneida Indian Nation
of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 664 (Oneida I). In 1788,
the State and the Oneida Nation entered into a treaty whereby the
Oneidas ceded all their lands to the State, but retained a reservation of
about 300,000 acres for their own use. See County of Oneida v. Oneida
Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 231 (Oneida II). The Federal
Government initially pursued a policy protective of the New York Indians. In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade and Intercourse
Act (Nonintercourse Act), barring sales of tribal land without the Government's acquiescence. And in the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, the
United States "acknowledge[d]" the Oneidas' 300,000-acre reservation
and guaranteed their "free use and enjoyment" of the reserved territory.
Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44, 45, Art. III. Nevertheless, New York
continued to purchase reservation land from the Oneidas. Although the
Washington administration objected, later administrations made not
even a pretense of interfering with New York's purchases, and ultimately pursued a policy designed to open reservation lands to white
settlers and to remove tribes westward. Pressured by the removal policy, many Oneidas left the State. Those who stayed continued to diminish in number and, during the 1840's, sold most of their remaining lands
to New York. By 1920, the New York Oneidas retained only 32 acres
in the State.

Although early litigation over Oneida land claims trained on monetary
recompense from the United States for past deprivations, the Oneidas
ultimately shifted to suits against local governments. In 1970, they
filed a federal "test case" against two New York counties, alleging that
the cession of 100,000 acres to the State in 1795 violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas' right to possession.
They sought damages measured by the fair rental value, for the years
1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral land owned and occupied
by the two counties. The District Court, affirmed by the Court of Ap544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
peals, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim. This
Court reversed in Oneida I, 414 U. S., at 675, 682, holding that federal
jurisdiction was properly invoked. After the Oneidas prevailed in the
lower courts, this Court held, inter alia, that the Oneidas could maintain
their claim to be compensated "for violation of their possessory rights
based on federal common law," Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 236, but reserved
"[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief
available to the present day Oneida Indians," id., at 253, n. 27.

In 1997 and 1998, OIN purchased separate parcels of land in petitioner
city of Sherrill, New York. These properties, once contained within the
historic Oneida Reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a
tribal entity in 1805. In that year, the Oneida Nation transferred the
parcels to one of its members, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.
The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN reacquired them in open-market transactions. For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided
by the State and its county and municipal units. According to the 2000
census, over 99% of the area's present-day population is non-Indian.
Nevertheless, because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the
properties are tax exempt and accordingly refused to pay property
taxes assessed by Sherrill. Sherrill initiated state-court eviction proceedings, and OIN brought this federal-court suit. In contrast to
Oneida I and II, which involved demands for monetary compensation,
OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the
imposition of property taxes. The District Court concluded that the
parcels are not taxable, and the Second Circuit affirmed. In this Court,
OIN resists the payment of the property taxes on the ground that OIN's
acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land
revived the Oneidas' ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel, so
that regulatory authority over the newly purchased properties no longer
resides in Sherrill.

Held: Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central

New York and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority over the area
constantly exercised by the State and its counties and towns for 200
years, and the Oneidas' long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, standards of federal Indian law and
federal equity practice preclude the Tribe from unilaterally reviving its
ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue. The
Oneidas long ago relinquished governmental reins and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.

Syllabus
(a) The Court rejects the theory of OIN and the United States that,
because Oneida II recognized the Oneidas' aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels at issue in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal
title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels. The
Oneidas sought only money damages in Oneida II, see 470 U. S., at 229,
and the Court reserved the question whether "equitable considerations"
should limit the relief available to the present-day Oneidas, id., at 253,
n. 27. Substantive questions of rights and duties are very different
from remedial questions. Here, OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive
relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local
taxation on parcels the Tribe purchased in the open market, properties
that had been subject to state and local taxation for generations. The
appropriateness of such relief must be evaluated in light of the long
history of state sovereign control over the territory. From the early
1800's into the 1970's, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New York's governance of the land in question and the validity
vel non of the Oneidas' sales to the State. Moreover, the properties
here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold
them 200 years ago. The longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by
the State over an area that is predominantly non-Indian in population
and land use creates "justifiable expectations." E. g., Rosebud Sioux
Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 604-605. Similar justifiable expectations,
grounded in two centuries of New York's exercise of regulatory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit heavy weight here. The
wrongs of which OIN complains occurred during the early years of the
Republic, whereas, for the past two centuries, New York and its local
units have continuously governed the territory. The Oneidas did not
seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by court decree until
the 1970's. And not until the 1990's did OIN acquire the properties
in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for
exemption of the parcels from local taxation. This long lapse of time,
during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control
through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in
the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks. Pp. 213-217.

(b) The distance from 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas' long delay
in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, and developments in Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines
of laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, and render inequitable the
piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.
This Court has long recognized that the passage of time can preclude
relief. For example, the doctrine of laches focuses on one side's inaction

Syllabus
and the other's legitimate reliance to bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief. See, e. g., Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94. Moreover,
long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of States'
dominion and sovereignty over territory. E. g., Ohio v. Kentucky, 410
U. S. 641, 651. This Court's original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty
cases do not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful point of
reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to present and future
sovereign control over territory, longstanding observances and settled
expectations are prime considerations. It has been two centuries since
the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties here
or held them free from local taxation. Parcel-by-parcel revival of their
sovereign status, given the extraordinary passage of time, would dishonor "the historic wisdom in the value of repose." Oneida II, 470
U. S., at 262. Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability of
returning to Indian control land that generations earlier passed into
numerous private hands. See, e. g., Yankton Sioux Tribe v. United
States, 272 U. S. 351, 357. The unilateral reestablishment of present
and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the
market price, would have disruptive practical consequences similar to
those that led the Yankton Sioux Court to initiate the impossibility
doctrine: Sherrill and the surrounding area are today overwhelmingly
populated by non-Indians, and a checkerboard of state and tribal jurisdiction--created unilaterally at OIN's behest--would "seriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments" and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches. Hagen v.
Utah, 510 U. S. 399, 421. If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign
control and remove these parcels from the local tax rolls, little would
prevent it from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area. See Felix v. Patrick, 145 U. S. 317, 335. Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has provided, in 25 U. S. C. $ 465,
a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that
takes account of the interests of others with stakes in the area's governance and well-being. Section 465 provides the proper avenue for OIN
to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the Oneidas 200 years ago. Pp. 217-221.

(c) The question of damages for the Tribe's ancient dispossession, resolved in Oneida II, is not at issue here, and the Court leaves undisturbed its Oneida II holding. P. 221.

202 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns properties in the city of Sherrill, NewYork, purchased by the Oneida Indian Nation of New York

(OIN or Tribe) in 1997 and 1998. The separate parcels ofland in question, once contained within the Oneidas' 300,000-
acre reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as atribal entity in 1805. For two centuries, governance of the
area in which the properties are located has been providedby the State of New York and its county and municipal units.
In County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226 (1985)

(Oneida II), this Court held that the Oneidasstated a triable claim for damages against the County of

Oneida for wrongful possession of lands they conveyed toNew York State in 1795 in violation of federal law. In the
instant action, OIN resists the payment of property taxes toSherrill on the ground that OIN's acquisition of fee title to
discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Onei-das' ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel. Consequently, the Tribe maintains, regulatory authority overOIN's newly purchased properties no longer resides in
Sherrill.

Our 1985 decision recognized that the Oneidas could maintain a federal common-law claim for damages for ancientwrongdoing in which both national and state governments

were complicit. Today, we decline to project redress for theTribe into the present and future, thereby disrupting the
governance of central New York's counties and towns. Gen-erations have passed during which non-Indians have owned
and developed the area that once composed the Tribe's his-toric reservation. And at least since the middle years of the
19th century, most of the Oneidas have resided elsewhere.Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of
the area and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority con-stantly exercised by New York State and its counties and
towns, and the Oneidas' long delay in seeking judicial relief
against parties other than the United States, we hold that

The Federal Government initially pursued a policy protec-tive of the New York Indians, undertaking to secure the
Tribes' rights to reserved lands. See Oneida II, 470 U. S.,at 231-232;

Oneida I, 414 U. S., at 667; F. Cohen, Handbook
of Federal Indian Law 418-419 (1942 ed.); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 73-74 (1982 ed.) (hereinafterHandbook). In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade

and Intercourse Act, commonly known as the NonintercourseAct. Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137. Periodically
renewed, see Oneida I, 414 U. S., at 667-668, and n. 4, andremaining substantially in force today, see Rev. Stat. $ 2116,
25 U. S. C. $ 177, the Act bars sales of tribal land withoutthe acquiescence of the Federal Government.

2 In 1794, in

further pursuit of its protective policy, the United States en-tered into the Treaty of Canandaigua with the Six (Iroquois)

Nations. Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44. That treaty both
"acknowledge[d]" the Oneida Reservation as established by

through treaties it independently negotiated, without National Government participation. See Gunther, Governmental Power and New York
Indian Lands--A Reassessment of a Persistent Problem of Federal-State
Relations, 8 Buffalo L. Rev. 1, 4-6 (1958-1959) (hereinafter Gunther).

2 By its terms, the 1790 Nonintercourse Act governed Indian lands

within the boundaries of the original 13 States. The Act provided "[t]hat
no sale of lands made by any Indians, or any nation or tribe of Indians
within the United States, shall be valid to any person or persons, or to
any state, whether having the right of pre-emption to such lands or not,
unless the same shall be made and duly executed at some public treaty,
held under the authority of the United States." Act of July 22, 1790,
ch. 33, $ 4, 1 Stat. 138 (emphasis added). Our prior decisions state in this

The Federal Government's policy soon veered away from
protection of New York and other east coast reservations.
In lieu of the commitment made in the Treaty of Canandaigua, the United States pursued a policy designed to open
reservation lands to white settlers and to remove tribes
westward. D. Getches, C. Wilkinson, & R. Williams, Cases
and Materials on Federal Indian Law 94 (4th ed. 1998) (After
the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, federal policymakers "began
to debate the tactics of inducing [eastern Indians] to exchange their remaining ancestral lands for a permanent territory in the West."). As recounted by the Indian Claims
Commission in 1978, early 19th-century federal Indian
agents in New York State did not simply fail to check New
York's land purchases, they "took an active role . . . in encouraging the removal of the Oneidas . . . to the west."

Opinion of the Court
Oneida Nation of N. Y., 43 Ind. Cl. Comm'n, at 390; see id.,at 391 (noting that some federal agents were "deeply involved" in "plans . . . to bring about the removal of the [Onei-das]" and in the State's acquisition of Oneida land). Beginning in 1817, the Federal Government accelerated its effortsto remove Indian tribes from their east coast homelands.
Handbook 78-79, and n. 142.

Pressured by the removal policy to leave their ancestrallands in New York, some 150 Oneidas, by 1825, had moved

to Wisconsin. Horsman, The Wisconsin Oneidas in the Pre-allotment Years, in The Oneida Indian Experience,

supra, at
65, 67. In 1838, the Oneidas and the United States entered
into the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, which envisioned removal
of all remaining New York Indians, including the Oneidas, to
Kansas. Act of Jan. 15, 1838, 7 Stat. 550. By this time, the
Oneidas had sold all but 5,000 acres of their original reservation. 337 F. 3d 139, 149 (CA2 2003). Six hundred of their
members resided in Wisconsin, while 620 remained in New
York State. 7 Stat. 556 (Sched. A).

In Article 13 of the Buffalo Creek Treaty, the Oneidas
agreed to remove to the Kansas lands the United States had
set aside for them "as soon as they c[ould] make satisfactory
arrangements" for New York State's "purchase of their lands
at Oneida." Id., at 554. As a condition of the treaty's ratification, the Senate directed that a federal commissioner
"fully and fairly explai[n]" the terms to each signatory tribe
and band. New York Indians v. United States, 170 U. S. 1,
21-22 (1898). Commissioner Ransom H. Gillet, who had
originally negotiated the treaty terms with the Oneidas, met
with them again and assured them they would not be forced
to move but could remain on "their lands where they reside,"
i. e., they could "if they ch[ose] to do so remain where they
are forever." App. 146 (emphases added).

The Oneidas who stayed on in New York after the proclamation of the Buffalo Creek Treaty continued to diminish in
number and, during the 1840's, sold most of their remaining

lands to the State. New York Indians v. United States, 40Ct. Cl. 448, 458, 469-471 (1905). A few hundred Oneidas

moved to Canada in 1842, id., at 458, and "by the mid-1840s,only about 200 Oneidas remained in New York State," Introduction to Part I, The Oneida Indian Journey: From NewYork to Wisconsin, 1784-1860, pp. 9, 13 (L. Hauptman & L.
McLester eds. 1999). By 1843, the New York Oneidas re-tained less than 1,000 acres in the State. Campisi 61. That
acreage dwindled to 350 in 1890; ultimately, by 1920, only 32acres continued to be held by the Oneidas.

Ibid.The United States eventually abandoned its efforts to remove the New York Indians to Kansas. In 1860, the FederalGovernment restored the Kansas lands to the public domain,
and sold them thereafter. New York Indians, 170 U. S., at24, 28-29, 31.

B
Early litigation concerning the Oneidas' land claimstrained on monetary recompense from the United States for

past deprivations. In 1893, the United States agreed to besued for disposing of the Kansas lands to settlers, and the
Oneidas in New York shared in the resulting award of dam-ages. See

New York Indians, 170 U. S. 1; New York Indi-ans, 40 Ct. Cl. 448 (identifying the Tribes qualified to share

in the distribution of the sum recovered).Seeking further compensation from the United States a
half century later, the New York and Wisconsin Oneidas ini-tiated proceedings before the Indian Claims Commission in
1951. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida,622 F. 2d 624, 626 (CA2 1980). They sought redress for
lands New York had acquired through 25 treaties of cessionconcluded between 1795 and 1846. The Oneidas alleged, and
the Claims Commission agreed, that under the Noninter-course Act of 1790 and successor statutes, the Federal Government had a fiduciary duty to ensure that the Oneidas re-ceived from New York "conscionable consideration" for the
lands in question. Oneida Nation of N. Y. v. United States,

Opinion of the Court
26 Ind. Cl. Comm'n 138, 145 (1971). The Court of Claimsaffirmed the Commission's core determination, but held that

the United States' duty extended only to land transactionsof which the Government had knowledge.

United States v.
Oneida Nation of N. Y., 201 Ct. Cl. 546, 554, 477 F. 2d 939,944 (1973). Accordingly, the Court of Claims directed the

Commission to determine whether the Government actually
or constructively knew of the land transactions at issue. Id.,at 555, 477 F. 2d, at 945.

On remand, the Commission found that the Federal Gov-ernment had actual or constructive knowledge of all of the
treaties and would be liable if the Oneidas had not received
conscionable consideration. Oneida Nation of N. Y., 43 Ind.
Cl. Comm'n, at 375, 406-407. The Commission anticipated
further proceedings to determine the Federal Government's
ultimate liability, but the Oneidas had by then decided to
pursue a different course. On the Oneidas' request, the
Court of Claims dismissed the proceedings. See Oneida
Nation of N. Y. v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. 990, 991 (1982)
(per curiam).

In lieu of concentrating on recovery from the United
States, the Oneidas pursued suits against local governments.
In 1970, the Oneidas of New York and Wisconsin, asserting
federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 or

$ 1362, instituted a "test case" against the New York Counties of Oneida and Madison. They alleged that the cession
of 100,000 acres to New York State in 1795, see supra, at
205, violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas' right to possession under the applicable
federal treaties and statutes. In this initial endeavor to
gain compensation from governmental units other than the
United States, the Oneidas confined their demand for relief.
They sought only damages measured by the fair rental value,
for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral
land owned and occupied by the two counties. The District
Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed the Onei544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

das' complaint for failure to state a claim arising under fed-eral law. We reversed that determination, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked. Oneida I, 414 U. S.,at 675, 682.

In the next round, the Oneidas prevailed in the lowercourts. On review in

Oneida II, we rejected various defenses the counties presented that might have barred the
action for damages, 470 U. S., at 240-250, and held that theOneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated "for

violation of their possessory rights based on federal commonlaw,"

id., at 236. While upholding the judgment of the
Court of Appeals regarding the counties' liability under federal common law, we noted that "[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the
present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court
of Appeals or presented to this Court." Id., at 253, n. 27.
Accordingly, "we express[ed] no opinion as to whether other
considerations m[ight] be relevant to the final disposition of
this case." Ibid. On remand, the District Court entered a
final judgment which fixed the amount of damages payable
by the counties. Allowing setoffs for the counties' goodfaith improvements to the land, the court ordered recoveries
of $15,994 from Oneida County and $18,970 from Madison
County, plus prejudgment interest. Oneida Indian Nation
of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 217 F. Supp. 2d 292, 310
(NDNY 2002).

In 2000, litigation resumed in an action held in abeyance
during the pendency of the test case. In that revitalized
action, the Oneidas sought damages from Oneida and Madison Counties for a period spanning over 200 years. The
amended complaint alleged that, through a series of agreements concluded during the years 1795 to 1846, approximately 250,000 acres of the Oneidas' ancestral land had been
unlawfully conveyed to New York. Oneida Indian Nation

210 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.

Opinion of the Court
The Oneidas further sought to enlarge the action by demanding recovery of land they had not occupied since the
1795-1846 conveyances.3 They attempted to join as defendants, inter alia, approximately 20,000 private landowners,
and to obtain declaratory relief that would allow the Oneidas
to eject these landowners. Id., at 67-68.4 The District
Court refused permission to join the landowners so late in
the day, resting in part on the Oneidas' bad faith and undue
delay. Id., at 79-85. Further, the court found the proposed
amendment "futile." Id., at 94. In this regard, the court
emphasized the "sharp distinction between the existence of
a federal common law right to Indian homelands," a right
this Court recognized in Oneida II, "and how to vindicate
that right." 199 F. R. D., at 90. That distinction "must be
drawn," the court stated, ibid., for in the two centuries since
the alleged wrong, "development of every type imaginable

3 In contrast, United States v. Boylan, 265 F. 165 (CA2 1920), involved
land the Oneidas never left. Boylan concerned the 1885 conveyances by
individual Oneida Indians of a 32-acre tract of reservation land to nonIndians. Despite the conveyances, a band of Oneidas continued to live
on the land. After a non-Indian gained a state-court order ejecting the
remaining Oneidas, the United States brought suit on behalf of the Oneidas to reclaim the land. The Second Circuit observed that the Oneidas
were "actually in possession" of the 32 acres in question, id., at 167, and
had occupied the land continuously for over a century, id., at 171. Given
that occupation and the absence of Federal Government approval for the
individual Oneidas' conveyances, the Second Circuit upheld the District
Court's "decree restoring the ejected Indians to possession." Id., at
173-174.

4 In another lawsuit, commenced in 1978, the Oneidas sought from the

State of New York and others both damages and recovery of land New
York had purchased from the Oneidas in 1785 and 1788. Oneida Indian
Nation of N. Y., 860 F. 2d, at 1148. The Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of that action, holding that treaties between New
York and the Oneidas during the years in which the Articles of Confederation were operative did not require the assent of Congress. Id., at 1167;
see supra, at 203-204, n. 1.

has been ongoing," id., at 92. Referring to the "practical
concerns" that blocked restoration of Indians to their former
lands, the court found it high time "to transcend the theoretical." Ibid. Cases of this genre, the court observed,
"cr[ied] out for a pragmatic approach." Ibid. The District
Court therefore excluded the imposition of any liability
against private landowners. Id., at 93-95.

This brings us to the present case, which concerns parcels
of land in the city of Sherrill, located in Oneida County, New
York. According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the population in the area is non-Indian: American Indians represent
less than 1% of the city of Sherrill's population and less than
0.5% of Oneida County's population. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, 2000 Census of Population and Housing, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics: New
York, 2000 PHC-1-34, Table 3, p. 124 (July 2002), available
at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-34.pdf (as visited Mar. 24, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).
OIN owns approximately 17,000 acres of land scattered
throughout the Counties of Oneida and Madison, representing less than 1.5% of the counties' total area. OIN's predecessor, the Oneida Nation, had transferred the parcels at
issue to one of its members in 1805, who sold the land to a
non-Indian in 1807. The properties thereafter remained in
non-Indian hands until OIN's acquisitions in 1997 and 1998
in open-market transactions. See 337 F. 3d, at 144, n. 3.
OIN now operates commercial enterprises on these parcels:
a gasoline station, a convenience store, and a textile facility.
Id., at 144.

Because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained
that the properties are exempt from taxation, and accordingly refused to pay the assessed property taxes. The city
of Sherrill initiated eviction proceedings in state court, and
OIN sued Sherrill in federal court. In contrast to Oneida I

and II, which involved demands for monetary compensation,OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the

future, the imposition of property taxes. OIN also suedMadison County, seeking a declaration that the Tribe's properties in Madison are tax exempt. The litigation involveda welter of claims and counterclaims. Relevant here, the
District Court concluded that parcels of land owned by theTribe in Sherrill and Madison are not taxable. See 145
F. Supp. 2d 226, 254-259 (NDNY 2001).A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed. 337 F. 3d
139. Writing for the majority, Judge Parker ruled that theparcels qualify as "Indian country," as that term is defined
in 18 U. S. C. $ 1151,5 because they fall within the boundariesof a reservation set aside by the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty
for Indian use under federal supervision. 337 F. 3d, at 155-156; see

supra, at 204-205. The court further held that theBuffalo Creek Treaty did not demonstrate a clear congressional purpose to disestablish or diminish the Oneida Reser-vation. 337 F. 3d, at 161, 165; see

supra, at 206. Finally,the court found no legal requirement "that a federally recognized tribe demonstrate its continuous existence in order toassert a claim to its reservation land." 337 F. 3d, at 165.
In any case, the court held, the record demonstrated OIN'scontinuous tribal existence. Id., at 166-167. Judge Van
Graafeiland dissented as to the majority's primary holding.In his view, the record raised a substantial question whether
OIN had "forfeited" its aboriginal rights to the land becauseit abandoned "its tribal existence . . . for a discernable period
of time." Id., at 171.We granted the city of Sherrill's petition for a writ of certiorari, 542 U. S. 936 (2004), and now reverse the judgmentof the Court of Appeals.

214 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.

Opinion of the Court
OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing itspresent and future sovereign immunity from local taxation

on parcels of land the Tribe purchased in the open market,properties that had been subject to state and local taxation
for generations.7 We now reject the unification theory ofOIN and the United States and hold that "standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice" preclude theTribe from rekindling embers of sovereignty that long ago
grew cold.8The appropriateness of the relief OIN here seeks must be
evaluated in light of the long history of state sovereign con-trol over the territory. From the early 1800's into the
1970's, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferentto, New York's governance of the land in question and the
validity vel non of the Oneidas' sales to the State. See gen-erally Gunther 23-25 (attributing much of the confusion and
conflict in the history of New York Indian affairs to "Federalinattention and ambivalence"). In fact, the United States'
policy and practice through much of the early 19th centurywas designed to dislodge east coast lands from Indian pos7 The dissent suggests that, compatibly with today's decision, the Tribe
may assert tax immunity defensively in the eviction proceeding initiated
by Sherrill. Post, at 225. We disagree. The equitable cast of the relief
sought remains the same whether asserted affirmatively or defensively.

8 We resolve this case on considerations not discretely identified in the

parties' briefs. But the question of equitable considerations limiting the
relief available to OIN, which we reserved in Oneida II, is inextricably
linked to, and is thus "fairly included" within, the questions presented.
See this Court's Rule 14.1(a) ("The statement of any question presented
is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.");

session. See supra, at 205-207. Moreover, the properties
here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago. Notably, it was not until lately
that the Oneidas sought to regain ancient sovereignty over
land converted from wilderness to become part of cities like
Sherrill. See supra, at 210-212; Oneida II, 470 U. S., at
264-265 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part).

This Court has observed in the different, but related, context of the diminishment of an Indian reservation that "[t]he
longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an
area that is over 90% non-Indian, both in population and in
land use," may create "justifiable expectations." Rosebud

expectations of the people living in the area" (internal quotation marks omitted)).9 Similar justifiable expectations,

York's governance remained undisturbed, and the present-day and future
disruption such relief would engender.

Opinion of the Court
tory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit
heavy weight here.10

The wrongs of which OIN complains in this action occurred during the early years of the Republic. For the past
two centuries, New York and its county and municipal units
have continuously governed the territory. The Oneidas did
not seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by
court decree until the 1970's. See supra, at 210, n. 4. And
not until the 1990's did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand
for exemption of the parcels from local taxation. 337 F. 3d,
at 144.11 This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas
did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the

the dissent notes that only Congress may revoke the tax-exempt status of
Indian reservation land. Post, at 224, and n. 3. Those cases, however,
concerned land the Indians had continuously occupied. See Brief for Respondents in Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, O. T. 1984, No. 83-2161, p. 3, and
n. 1 (noting Indians' occupation of reservation); Kansas Indians, 5 Wall.,
at 738-742 (concerning Indians removed to and residing on Kansas lands
before statehood); New York Indians, 5 Wall., at 768 (taxation by State
would "interfer[e] with the possession, and occupation, and exercise of
authority" by the Indians residing on the reservation). The Oneidas last
occupied the parcels here at issue in 1805. See supra, at 211. The dissent additionally refers to Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa
Indians, 524 U. S. 103 (1998). Post, at 224, n. 3. But in that case, the
Court held that an Indian tribe could not revive the tax-exempt status of
its former reservation lands--which Congress had expressly removed
from federal protection--by reacquiring the lands in the open market.
524 U. S., at 113-114.

11 The fact that OIN brought this action promptly after acquiring the

properties does not overcome the Oneidas' failure to reclaim ancient prerogatives earlier or lessen the problems associated with upsetting New
York's long-exercised sovereignty over the area. OIN's claim concerns
grave, but ancient, wrongs, and the relief available must be commensurate
with that historical reality.

Opinion of the Court
character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining thedisruptive remedy it now seeks.

The principle that the passage of time can preclude reliefhas deep roots in our law, and this Court has recognized this
prescription in various guises. It is well established thatlaches, a doctrine focused on one side's inaction and the other's legitimate reliance, may bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief. See, e. g., Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94(1865) ("[C]ourts of equity act upon their own inherent doctrine of discouraging, for the peace of society, antiquated de-mands, refuse to interfere where there has been gross laches
in prosecuting the claim, or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights." (internal quotation marks omitted));
Wagner v. Baird, 7 How. 234, 258 (1849) (same); Bowman v.
Wathen, 1 How. 189, 194 (1843) ("[The] doctrine of an equitable bar by lapse of time, so distinctly announced by the chancellors of England and Ireland, . . . should now be regarded
as settled law in this court.").

This Court applied the doctrine of laches in Felix v. Patrick, 145 U. S. 317 (1892), to bar the heirs of an Indian from
establishing a constructive trust over land their Indian ancestor had conveyed in violation of a statutory restriction.
In the nearly three decades between the conveyance and the
lawsuit, "[a] large part of the tract ha[d] been platted and
recorded as an addition to the city of Omaha, and . . . sold to
purchasers." Id., at 326. "[A]s the case stands at present,"
the Court observed, "justice requires only what the law . . .
would demand--the repayment of the value of the [illegally
conveyed] scrip." Id., at 334. The Court also recognized
the disproportion between the value of the scrip issued to
the Indian ($150) and the value of the property the heirs
sought to acquire (over $1 million). Id., at 333. The sort of
changes to the value and character of the land noted by the
Felix Court are present in even greater magnitude in this
suit. Cf. Galliher v. Cadwell, 145 U. S. 368, 373 (1892)

a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be en-forced--an inequity founded upon some change in the condition or relations of the property or the parties.").As between States, long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of dominion and sovereignty overterritory. Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 651 (1973) ("The
rule, long-settled and never doubted by this court, is thatlong acquiescence by one state in the possession of territory
by another and in the exercise of sovereignty and dominionover it is conclusive of the latter's title and rightful authority." (quoting Michigan v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 295, 308(1926)));

Massachusetts v. New York, 271 U. S. 65, 95 (1926)("Long acquiescence in the possession of territory and the

exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it may have a con-trolling effect in the determination of a disputed boundary.").
The acquiescence doctrine does not depend on the originalvalidity of a boundary line; rather, it attaches legal consequences to acquiescence in the observance of the boundary.
California v. Nevada, 447 U. S. 125, 131 (1980) (No relation-ship need exist "between the origins of a boundary and the

legal consequences of acquiescence in that boundary. . . .Longstanding acquiescence by California and Nevada can
give [the boundary lines] the force of law whether or notfederal authorities had the power to draw them.").

This Court's original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty casesdo not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful point
of reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to pres-ent and future sovereign control over territory,

12 longstanding observances and settled expectations are prime consider-ations. There is no dispute that it has been two centuries

since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over theproperties here or held them free from local taxation.

12 It bears repetition that for generations, the Oneidas dominantly complained, not against New York or its local units, but about "[mis]treatment
at the hands of the United States Government." Oneida II, 470 U. S., at
269 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part); see supra, at 207-208.

Opinion of the Court
Parcel-by-parcel revival of their sovereign status, given theextraordinary passage of time, would dishonor "the historic

wisdom in the value of repose." Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 262(

Stevens, J., dissenting in part).

Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability ofreturning to Indian control land that generations earlier

passed into numerous private hands. See Yankton Sioux
Tribe v. United States, 272 U. S. 351, 357 (1926) ("It is impos-sible . . . to rescind the cession and restore the Indians to

their former rights because the lands have been opened tosettlement and large portions of them are now in the possession of innumerable innocent purchasers . . . ."); Felix, 145
U. S., at 334 (observing, in declining to award equitable relief, "[t]hat which was wild land thirty years ago is now intersected by streets, subdivided into blocks and lots, and largely
occupied by persons who have bought upon the strength of
Patrick's title, and have erected buildings of a permanent
character"). The District Court, in the litigation dormant
during the pendency of Oneida II, see supra, at 209-211,
rightly found these pragmatic concerns about restoring Indian sovereign control over land "magnified exponentially
here, where development of every type imaginable has been
ongoing for more than two centuries." Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 199 F. R. D., at 92.

In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the "impossibility" doctrine had no application because OIN acquired the land in the open market and does not seek to
uproot current property owners. 337 F. 3d, at 157. But the
unilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price,
would have disruptive practical consequences similar to
those that led this Court in Yankton Sioux to initiate the
impossibility doctrine. The city of Sherrill and Oneida
County are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians.

at OIN's behest--would "seriously burde[n] the administra-tion of state and local governments" and would adversely

affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches. Hagen,510 U. S., at 421 (quoting Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463,
471-472, n. 12 (1984)). If OIN may unilaterally reassert sov-ereign control and remove these parcels from the local tax
rolls, little would prevent the Tribe from initiating a newgeneration of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning
or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners inthe area. See

Felix, 145 U. S., at 335 ("decree prayed for inthis case, if granted, would offer a distinct encouragement to

. . . similar claims"); cf. Brendale v. Confederated Tribes andBands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 433-437 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (discussing tribal land-use controls); post,at 226, n. 6 (

Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that "the balanceof interests" supports continued state zoning jurisdiction).

13

Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has pro-vided a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that takes account of the interests of others withstakes in the area's governance and well-being. Title 25
U. S. C. $ 465 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to ac-quire land in trust for Indians and provides that the land
"shall be exempt from State and local taxation." See CassCounty v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 524 U. S.
103, 114-115 (1998). The regulations implementing $ 465 aresensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that
arise when a tribe seeks to regain sovereign control over

13 Other tribal entities have already sought to free historic reservation lands purchased in the open market from local regulatory controls.
See Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Okla. v. Aurelius, New York, No. 5:03-

territory. Before approving an acquisition, the Secretarymust consider, among other things, the tribe's need for additional land; "[t]he purposes for which the land will be used";"the impact on the State and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls"; and"[ j]urisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land use
which may arise." 25 CFR $ 151.10(f ) (2004). Section 465provides the proper avenue for OIN to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the Oneidas 200years ago.

In sum, the question of damages for the Tribe's ancientdispossession is not at issue in this case, and we therefore do
not disturb our holding in Oneida II. However, the distancefrom 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas' long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, anddevelopments in the city of Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, andimpossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in
governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.14

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
14 Justice Stevens, after vigorously urging the application of laches to
block further proceedings in Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 255, now faults the
Court for rejecting the claim presented here, post, at 223-224. The majority indicated in Oneida II that application of a nonstatutory time limitation in an action for damages would be "novel." 470 U. S., at 244, n. 16;
cf. id., at 261-262 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part) (acknowledging "the
application of a traditional equitable defense in an action at law is something of a novelty"). No similar novelty exists when the specific relief
OIN now seeks would project redress for the Tribe into the present and
future. The claim to a sovereign's prerogative asserted by OIN, we hold,
does "not survive eternally," id., at 272 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part);
rather, it is a claim "best left in repose," id., at 273 (same).

222 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court with one qualification thatgoes to the appropriateness of considering the long dormancy of any claim to tribal authority over the parcels inquestion, as a basis to hold that the Oneida Indian Nation is
not now immune from the taxing authority of local govern-ment. The Tribe's claim, whether affirmative or defensive,
see ante, at 214, n. 7, is one of territorial sovereign statusentitled to recognition by the territorial state sovereign and
its subdivisions. The claim of present sovereign statusturns not only on background law and the provisions of treaties, but also on the Tribe's behavior over a long period oftime: the absence of the Tribe and tribal members from the
particular lots of land, and the Tribe's failure to assert sover-eignty over them. The Tribe's inaction cannot, therefore,
be ignored here as affecting only a remedy to be consideredlater; it is, rather, central to the very claims of right made
by the contending parties. Since the subject of inaction wasnot expressly raised as a separate question presented for review, see ante, at 214, n. 8, there is some question whetherwe should order reargument before dealing with it. I think
that is unnecessary; the issue was addressed by each side inthe argument prior to submission of the case, notwithstanding the terms of the questions on which review was granted.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
This case involves an Indian tribe's claim to tax immunityon its own property located within its reservation. It does

not implicate the tribe's immunity from other forms of statejurisdiction, nor does it concern the tribe's regulatory authority over property owned by non-Indians within thereservation.

For the purposes of its decision the Court assumes thatthe District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly resolved the major issues of fact and law that the parties debated in those courts and that the city of Sherrill (City) pre544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sented to us in its petition for certiorari. Thus, we acceptthose courts' conclusions that the Oneida Indian Nation of

New York (Tribe) is a federally recognized Indian Tribe; thatit is the successor-in-interest to the original Oneida Nation;
that in 1788 the Treaty of Fort Schuyler created a 300,000-acre reservation for the Oneida; that in 1794 the Treaty of
Canandaigua established that tract as a federally protectedreservation; and that the reservation was not disestablished
or diminished by the Treaty of Buffalo Creek in 1838. It isundisputed that the City seeks to collect property taxes on
parcels of land that are owned by the Tribe and locatedwithin the historic boundaries of its reservation.

Since the outset of this litigation it has been commonground that if the Tribe's properties are "Indian Country,"
the City has no jurisdiction to tax them without express con-gressional consent.

1 For the reasons set forth at length in

the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals,it is abundantly clear that all of the land owned by the Tribe

within the boundaries of its reservation qualifies as Indiancountry. Without questioning the accuracy of that conclusion, the Court today nevertheless decides that the fact thatmost of the reservation has been occupied and governed by
non-Indians for a long period of time precludes the Tribe"from rekindling embers of sovereignty that long ago grew
cold." Ante, at 214. This is a novel holding, and in myjudgment even more unwise than the Court's holding in
County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226 (1985), that the Tribe may recover damages for the
alleged illegal conveyance of its lands that occurred in 1795.In that case, I argued that the "remedy for the ancient wrong
established at trial should be provided by Congress, not byjudges seeking to rewrite history at this late date,"

id., at270 (opinion dissenting in part). In the present case, the

finding be made that the properties in question are Indian Country, they
are nonetheless taxable." 145 F. Supp. 2d 226, 241, n. 7 (NDNY 2001).

Tribe is not attempting to collect damages or eject landown-ers as a remedy for a wrong that occurred centuries ago;

rather, it is invoking an ancient immunity against a city'spresent-day attempts to tax its reservation lands.

Without the benefit of relevant briefing from the parties,the Court has ventured into legal territory that belongs to
Congress. Its decision today is at war with at least twobedrock principles of Indian law. First, only Congress has
the power to diminish or disestablish a tribe's reservation.2Second, as a core incident of tribal sovereignty, a tribe enjoys immunity from state and local taxation of its reservationlands, until that immunity is explicitly revoked by Congress.

3

Far from revoking this immunity, Congress has specificallyreconfirmed it with respect to the reservation lands of the

New York Indians.4 Ignoring these principles, the Court

2 See South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U. S. 329, 343 (1998)
("Congress possesses plenary power over Indian affairs, including the
power to modify or eliminate tribal rights. Accordingly, only Congress
can alter the terms of an Indian treaty by diminishing a reservation, and
its intent to do so must be `clear and plain' " (citations omitted)); Solem v.
Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463, 470 (1984) ("Once a block of land is set aside for an
Indian reservation and no matter what happens to the title of individual
plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservation status until
Congress explicitly indicates otherwise").

3 See Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 764-765 (1985) (noting

that the Court has "never wavered" from the view that a State's attempt
to tax Indian reservation land is illegal and inconsistent with Indian title
(citing The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737 (1867), and The New York Indians,
5 Wall. 761 (1867))); Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 524 U. S. 103, 110 (1998) ("We have consistently declined to find that
Congress has authorized such taxation unless it has ` "made its intention
to do so unmistakably clear" ' ").

4 In providing New York state courts with jurisdiction over civil actions

between Indians, Congress emphasized that the statute was not to be
"construed as subjecting the lands within any Indian reservation in the
State of New York to taxation for State or local purposes." 25 U. S. C.

has done what only Congress may do--it has effectively pro-claimed a diminishment of the Tribe's reservation and an abrogation of its elemental right to tax immunity. Under ourprecedents, whether it is wise policy to honor the Tribe's tax
immunity is a question for Congress, not this Court, todecide.

As a justification for its lawmaking decision, the Court relies heavily on the fact that the Tribe is seeking equitablerelief in the form of an injunction. The distinction between

law and equity is unpersuasive because the outcome of thecase turns on a narrow legal issue that could just as easily,
if not most naturally, be raised by a tribe as a defense againsta state collection proceeding. In fact, that scenario actually
occurred in this case: The City brought an eviction proceed-ing against the Tribe based on its refusal to pay property
taxes; that proceeding was removed to federal court and con-solidated with the present action; the District Court granted
summary judgment for the Tribe; and the Court of Appeals
affirmed on the basis of tribal tax immunity.5 Either this

date the exercise of state power over tribal Indians and, most significantly,
that New York cannot unilaterally deprive Indians of their tribal lands or
authorize such deprivations. The civil jurisdiction law, to make assurance
doubly sure, contains a proviso that explicitly exempts reservations from
state and local taxation . . . . Moreover, both federal and state officials
agreed that the bills would retain ultimate federal power over the Indians
and that federal guardianship, particularly with respect to property
rights, would continue' " (quoting Gunther, Governmental Power and New
York Indian Lands--A Reassessment of a Persistent Problem of FederalState Relations, 8 Buffalo L. Rev. 1, 16 (1958-1959))).

5 See 337 F. 3d 139, 167 (CA2 2003). Additionally, to the extent that we

are dealing with genuine equitable defenses, these defenses are subject to
waiver. Here, the City sought to add the defense of laches to its answer;
the District Court refused on the ground of futility, 145 F. Supp. 2d, at
259; the Court of Appeals upheld this determination, 337 F. 3d, at 168-169;
and the City failed to preserve this point in its petition for certiorari or
brief on the merits. The City similarly failed to preserve its impossibility
defense in its submissions to this Court, and there is no indication that
the City ever raised an acquiescence defense in the proceedings below.

defensive use of tax immunity should still be available to theTribe on remand, but see ante, at 214, n. 7, or the Court's

reliance on the distinctions between law and equity and be-tween substantive rights and remedies, see ante, at 213-214,
is indefensible.In any event, as a matter of equity I believe that the "principle that the passage of time can preclude relief," ante, at217, should be applied sensibly and with an even hand. It
seems perverse to hold that the reliance interests of non-Indian New Yorkers that are predicated on almost two centuries of inaction by the Tribe do not foreclose the Tribe'senforcement of judicially created damages remedies for ancient wrongs, but do somehow mandate a forfeiture of atribal immunity that has been consistently and uniformly
protected throughout our history. In this case, the Tribe
reacquired reservation land in a peaceful and lawful mannerthat fully respected the interests of innocent landowners--it

purchased the land on the open market. To now deny theTribe its right to tax immunity--at once the most fundamental of tribal rights and the least disruptive to other sovereigns--is not only inequitable, but also irreconcilable withthe principle that only Congress may abrogate or extinguish

tribal sovereignty. I would not decide this case on the basisof speculation about what may happen in future litigation
over other regulatory issues.6 For the answer to the ques6 It is not necessary to engage in any speculation to recognize that the
majority's fear of opening a Pandora's box of tribal powers is greatly exaggerated. Given the State's strong interest in zoning its land without exception for a small number of Indian-held properties arranged in checkerboard fashion, the balance of interests obviously supports the retention of
state jurisdiction in this sphere. See California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 215 (1987) (" `[I]n exceptional circumstances a
State may assert jurisdiction over the on-reservation activities of tribal
members' "). Nor, as the Tribe acknowledges, Brief for Respondents 19,
n. 4, could it credibly assert the right to tax or exercise other regulatory
authority over reservation land owned by non-Indians. See Atkinson
Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U. S. 645 (2001); Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 03-1160. Argued November 3, 2004--Decided March 30, 2005
In revising its employee pay plan, respondent City granted raises to all

police officers and police dispatchers in an attempt to bring their starting salaries up to the regional average. Officers with less than five
years' service received proportionately greater raises than those with
more seniority, and most officers over 40 had more than five years of
service. Petitioners, a group of older officers, filed suit under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), claiming, inter
alia, that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age.
The District Court granted the City summary judgment. Affirming,
the Fifth Circuit ruled that disparate-impact claims are categorically
unavailable under the ADEA, but it assumed that the facts alleged by
petitioners would entitle them to relief under Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,
401 U. S. 424, which announced a disparate-impact theory of recovery for
cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
351 F. 3d 183, affirmed.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and IV, concluding:

1. The ADEA authorizes recovery in disparate-impact cases comparable to Griggs. Except for the substitution of "age" for "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin," the language of ADEA $ 4(a)(2) and Title
VII $ 703(a)(2) is identical. Unlike Title VII, however, ADEA $ 4(f)(1)
significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any "otherwise prohibited" action "where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors
other than age" (hereinafter RFOA provision). Pp. 232-233.

2. Petitioners have not set forth a valid disparate-impact claim. Two
textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make clear that
the disparate-impact theory's scope is narrower under the ADEA than
under Title VII. One is the RFOA provision. The other is the amendment to Title VII in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which modified this
Court's Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, holding that
narrowly construed the scope of liability on a disparate-impact theory.
Because the relevant 1991 amendments expanded Title VII's coverage

Syllabus
but did not amend the ADEA or speak to age discrimination, Wards
Cove's pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains
applicable to the ADEA. Congress' decision to limit the ADEA's coverage by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that
age, unlike Title VII's protected classifications, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual's capacity to engage in certain types of employment. Here, petitioners have done little more than point out that the
pay plan is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger
ones. They have not, as required by Wards Cove, identified any specific
test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse
impact on older workers. Further, the record makes clear that the
City's plan was based on reasonable factors other than age. The City's
explanation for the differential between older and younger workers was
its perceived need to make junior officers' salaries competitive with comparable positions in the market. Thus, the disparate impact was attributable to the City's decision to give raises based on seniority and position. Reliance on these factors is unquestionably reasonable given the
City's goal. Pp. 240-243.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded in Part III that the ADEA's text, the
RFOA provision, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) regulations all support the conclusion that a disparate-impact
theory is cognizable under the ADEA. Pp. 233-240.

Justice Scalia concluded that the reasoning in Part III of Justice
Stevens' opinion is a basis for deferring, pursuant to Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, to the
EEOC's reasonable view that the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact
claims. Pp. 243-247.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice
Thomas, concluded that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground
that disparate impact claims are not cognizable under the ADEA.
Pp. 247-268.

Petitioners, police and public safety officers employed bythe city of Jackson, Mississippi (hereinafter City), contend

that salary increases received in 1999 violated the Age Dis-crimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) because
they were less generous to officers over the age of 40 thanto younger officers. Their suit raises the question whether
the "disparate-impact" theory of recovery announced inGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971), for cases
brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, iscognizable under the ADEA. Despite the age of the ADEA,
it is a question that we have not yet addressed. See Hazen

Rehnquist, J., dissenting fromdenial of certiorari).

I
On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan grantingraises to all City employees. The stated purpose of the plan

was to "attract and retain qualified people, provide incentivefor performance, maintain competitiveness with other public
sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all em-ployees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability."

1 On

May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, atleast in part, by the City's desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, grantedraises to all police officers and police dispatchers. Those
who had less than five years of tenure received proportion-ately greater raises when compared to their former pay than
those with more seniority. Although some officers over theage of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older
officers had more.Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit
under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberatelydiscriminated against them because of their age (the
"disparate-treatment" claim) and that they were "adverselyaffected" by the plan because of their age (the "disparateimpact" claim). The District Court granted summary judg-ment to the City on both claims. The Court of Appeals held
that the ruling on the former claim was premature becausepetitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of
intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impactclaim. 351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judge's dissent,
the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are cate-gorically unavailable under the ADEA. Both the majority
and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitionerswould entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

Opinion of the Court
We granted the officers' petition for certiorari, 541 U. S.958 (2004), and now hold that the ADEA does authorize recovery in "disparate-impact" cases comparable to Griggs.Because, however, we conclude that petitioners have not set
forth a valid disparate-impact claim, we affirm.

II
During the deliberations that preceded the enactment ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress considered and rejected proposed amendments that would have included olderworkers among the classes protected from employment discrimination.2 General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 587 (2004). Congress did, however, request the Secretary of Labor to "make a full and completestudy of the factors which might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the consequencesof such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected." $ 715, 78 Stat. 265. The Secretary's report, sub-mitted in response to Congress' request, noted that there
was little discrimination arising from dislike or intoleranceof older people, but that "arbitrary" discrimination did result
from certain age limits. Report of the Secretary of Labor,The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment 5 (June 1965), reprinted in U. S. Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission, Legislative History of the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (1981), Doc. No. 5 (here-inafter Wirtz Report). Moreover, the report observed that
discriminatory effects resulted from "[i]nstitutional arrange-ments that indirectly restrict the employment of older workers." Id., at 15.In response to that report Congress directed the Secretary
to propose remedial legislation, see Fair Labor StandardsAmendments of 1966, Pub. L. 89-601, $ 606, 80 Stat. 845, and

2 See 110 Cong. Rec. 2596-2599 (1964) (amendment offered by Rep.

then acted favorably on his proposal. As enacted in 1967,$ 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, now codified as 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(2),

provided that it shall be unlawful for an employer "to limit,segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would
deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment op-portunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's age . . . ." 81 Stat. 603.Except for substitution of the word "age" for the words
"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin," the languageof that provision in the ADEA is identical to that found in

$ 703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). Otherprovisions of the ADEA also parallel the earlier statute.

3

Unlike Title VII, however, $ 4(f )(1) of the ADEA, 81 Stat.603, contains language that significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any "otherwise prohibited" action "wherethe differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than
age" (hereinafter RFOA provision).

III
In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin with the premise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similarpurposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the
other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intendedthat text to have the same meaning in both statutes.

North-cross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412 U. S.

427, 428 (1973) (per curiam). We have consistently applied

ADEA provides an affirmative defense to liability where age is "a bona

Rights Act of 1964, $ 703(e), 78 Stat. 256 ("Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, . . . it shall not be [unlawful to perform any of the
prohibited activities in $$ 703(a)-(d)] on the basis of his religion, sex, or
national origin in those certain instances where religion, sex, or national
origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the
normal operation of that particular business or enterprise . . . ").

that presumption to language in the ADEA that was "de-rived

in haec verba from Title VII." Lorillard v. Pons, 434
U. S. 575, 584 (1978).4 Our unanimous interpretation of$ 703(a)(2) of Title VII in

Griggs is therefore a precedent of
compelling importance.In

Griggs, a case decided four years after the enactment
of the ADEA, we considered whether $ 703 of Title VII prohibited an employer "from requiring a high school educationor passing of a standardized general intelligence test as

a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when(a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to
successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate todisqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white
applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had beenfilled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites." 401 U. S., at 425-426.Accepting the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith "does
not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms
that operate as `built-in headwinds' for minority groups and
are unrelated to measuring job capability." Id., at 432.

We explained that Congress had "directed the thrust of
the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not
simply the motivation." Ibid. We relied on the fact that
history is "filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional
badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas,
or degrees. Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but

And we noted that the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission (EEOC), which had enforcement responsibility,
had issued guidelines that accorded with our view. Id., at433-434. We thus squarely held that $ 703(a)(2) of Title VII
did not require a showing of discriminatory intent.5While our opinion in

Griggs relied primarily on the pur-poses of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had

endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted thatour holding represented the better reading of the statutory
text as well. See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487U. S. 977, 991 (1988). Neither $ 703(a)(2) nor the comparable
language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that "limit,segregate, or classify" persons; rather the language prohibits
such actions that "deprive any individual of employmentopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an
employee, because of such individual's" race or age. Ibid.(explaining that in disparate-impact cases, "the employer's
practices may be said to `adversely affect [an individual's sta-tus] as an employee' " (alteration in original) (quoting 42

5 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report. Just as
the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a
problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.
Wirtz Report 6. And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair
impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified
the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers. "Any formal
employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma
will obviously work against the employment of many older workers--unfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older worker's years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education."
Wirtz Report 3. Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a
remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs
and those present in the Wirtz Report.

U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(2))). Thus the text focuses on the ef-fects of the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer.6Griggs, which interpreted the identical text at issue here,
thus strongly suggests that a disparate-impact theory shouldbe cognizable under the ADEA.

7 Indeed, for over two dec6 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice O'Connor ignores key textual differences between $ 4(a)(1), which does not encompass disparateimpact liability, and $ 4(a)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an
employer "to fail or refuse to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such
individual's age." (Emphasis added.) The focus of the paragraph is on
the employer's actions with respect to the targeted individual. Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer "to limit . . . his
employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee, because of such individual's age." (Emphasis
added.) Unlike in paragraph (a)(1), there is thus an incongruity between
the employer's actions--which are focused on his employees generally--
and the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions. Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to
age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee's age--the
very definition of disparate impact. Justice O'Connor is therefore quite
wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs
are unimportant.

7 Justice O'Connor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of

the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute. As
we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.
Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impacttype situations through "noncoercive measures" in part, there is nothing
to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect
on older workers. Finally, we agree that the differences between age and
the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might
well have intended to treat the two differently. See post, at 253 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it
sought to prohibit. While those differences, coupled with a difference in
the text of the statute such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at

ades after our decision in Griggs, the Courts of Appeals uniformly interpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a
"disparate-impact" theory in appropriate cases.8 It was
only after our decision in Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507
U. S. 604 (1993), that some of those courts concluded that
the ADEA did not authorize a disparate-impact theory of
liability.9 Our opinion in Hazen Paper, however, did not address or comment on the issue we decide today. In that
case, we held that an employee's allegation that he was discharged shortly before his pension would have vested did
not state a cause of action under a disparate-treatment theory. The motivating factor was not, we held, the employee's
age, but rather his years of service, a factor that the ADEA
did not prohibit an employer from considering when termi240-241, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled
interpretation of that text.

nating an employee. Id., at 612.10 While we noted that dis-parate treatment "captures the essence of what Congress

sought to prohibit in the ADEA," id., at 610, we were carefulto explain that we were not deciding "whether a disparate
impact theory of liability is available under the ADEA . . . ,"ibid. In sum, there is nothing in our opinion in Hazen Paper
that precludes an interpretation of the ADEA that parallelsour holding in

Griggs.The Court of Appeals' categorical rejection of disparateimpact liability, like Justice O'Connor's, rested primarilyon the RFOA provision and the majority's analysis of legislative history. As we have already explained, we think thehistory of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-Hazen Paper con-sensus concerning disparate-impact liability. And Hazen
Paper itself contains the response to the concern over theRFOA provision.

The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawfulfor an employer "to take any action otherwise prohibited
under subsectio[n] (a) . . . where the differentiation is basedon reasonable factors other than age [discrimination] . . . ."
81 Stat. 603. In most disparate-treatment cases, if an em-ployer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action
would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the firstplace. See

Hazen Paper, 507 U. S., at 609 ("[T]here is nodisparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employ-ee's age"). In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in
Hazen Paper itself, the RFOA provision is simply unneces-sary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no
prohibited action in the first place. The RFOA provisionis not, as

Justice O'Connor suggests, a "safe harbor fromliability," post, at 252 (emphasis deleted), since there would

be no liability under $ 4(a). See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981) (noting, in
a Title VII case, that an employer can defeat liability byshowing that the employee was rejected for "a legitimate,

nondiscriminatory reason" without reference to an RFOAprovision).

In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly "otherwise prohibited" activity is not based on age. Ib id.("[C]laims that stress `disparate impact' [by contrast] involve

employment practices that are facially neutral in their treat-ment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly
on one group than another . . . " (quoting Teamsters v. United
States, 431 U. S. 324, 335-336, n. 15 (1977))). It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that theRFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factorthat was "reasonable." Rather than support an argument
that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the
RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.11

Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which
initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the
agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 29 U. S. C. $ 628, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact
theory. The initial regulations, while not mentioning disparate impact by name, nevertheless permitted such claims
if the employer relied on a factor that was not related to age.
29 CFR $ 860.103(f )(1)(i) (1970) (barring physical fitness requirements that were not "reasonably necessary for the spe11 We note that if Congress intended to prohibit all disparate-impact
claims, it certainly could have done so. For instance, in the Equal Pay
Act of 1963, 29 U. S. C. $ 206(d)(1), Congress barred recovery if a pay differential was based "on any other factor"--reasonable or unreasonable--
"other than sex." The fact that Congress provided that employers could
use only reasonable factors in defending a suit under the ADEA is therefore instructive.

cific work to be performed"). See also $ 1625.7 (2004) (set-ting forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim).

The text of the statute, as interpreted in Griggs, theRFOA provision, and the EEOC regulations all support petitioners' view. We therefore conclude that it was error forthe Court of Appeals to hold that the disparate-impact theory of liability is categorically unavailable under the ADEA.

IV
Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VIImake it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title
VII. The first is the RFOA provision, which we have al-ready identified. The second is the amendment to Title VII
contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071.One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the
Court's holding in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490U. S. 642 (1989), a case in which we narrowly construed the
employer's exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.See Civil Rights Act of 1991, $ 2, 105 Stat. 1071. While the
relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of TitleVII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject
of age discrimination. Hence, Wards Cove's pre-1991 inter-pretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable
to the ADEA.Congress' decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by
including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact thatage, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title
VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual's capac-ity to engage in certain types of employment. To be sure,
Congress recognized that this is not always the case, andthat society may perceive those differences to be larger or
more consequential than they are in fact. However, as Sec-retary Wirtz noted in his report, "certain circumstances . . .
unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a

Opinion of the Court
group, than they do younger workers." Wirtz Report 11.Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria

that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their ad-verse impact on older workers as a group. Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred atthe same levels as discrimination against those protected by
Title VII. While the ADEA reflects Congress' intent to
give older workers employment opportunities whenever pos-sible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.

Turning to the case before us, we initially note that peti-tioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan
at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to
younger workers. They have not identified any specific test,
requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers. As we held in Wards Cove,
it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate
impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads
to such an impact. Rather, the employee is " `responsible
for isolating and identifying the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.' " 490 U. S., at 656 (quoting Watson, 487
U. S., at 994; emphasis added). Petitioners have failed to
do so. Their failure to identify the specific practice being
challenged is the sort of omission that could "result in employers being potentially liable for `the myriad of innocent
causes that may lead to statistical imbalances . . . .' " 490
U. S., at 657. In this case not only did petitioners thus err
by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear
from the record that the City's plan was based on reasonable
factors other than age.

The plan divided each of five basic positions--police officer,
master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and
deputy police chief--into a series of steps and half-steps.
The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast. Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corres544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
242 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

Opinion of the Court
ponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual
a 2% raise. Most of the officers were in the three lowest
ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age
40 and officers over 40. In none did their age affect their
compensation. The few officers in the two highest ranks are
all over 40. Their raises, though higher in dollar amount
than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller
percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than
the salaries paid to their juniors. They are members of the
class complaining of the "disparate impact" of the award.

Petitioners' evidence established two principal facts: First,
almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received
raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those
over 40 did.12 Second, the average percentage increase for
the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure
was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with
more seniority.13 Because older officers tended to occupy
more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary. The
basic explanation for the differential was the City's perceived
need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them
competitive with comparable positions in the market.

Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the City's decision to give raises based on seniority and position. Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable
given the City's goal of raising employees' salaries to match
those in surrounding communities. In sum, we hold that the
City's decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that
of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a "reasonable facto[r] other than age" that responded to the City's
legitimate goal of retaining police officers. Cf. MacPherson
v. University of Montevallo, 922 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA11 1991).

Opinion of Scalia, J.
While there may have been other reasonable ways for theCity to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable. Unlike the business necessity test, which askswhether there are other ways for the employer to achieve
its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a pro-tected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such
requirement.Accordingly, while we do not agree with the Court of Appeals' holding that the disparate-impact theory of recoveryis never available under the ADEA, we affirm its judgment.

It is so ordered.
The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of thiscase.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.
I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join all exceptPart III of its opinion. As to that Part, I agree with all
of the Court's reasoning, but would find it a basis, not forindependent determination of the disparate-impact question,
but for deferral to the reasonable views of the Equal Em-ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission)
pursuant to Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). See General Dy-namics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 601-602

(2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency
interpretation. The Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., confers upon
the EEOC authority to issue "such rules and regulations asit may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out"
the ADEA. $ 628. Pursuant to this authority, the EEOCpromulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46
Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads asfollows:

244 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

Opinion of Scalia, J.
"When an employment practice, including a test, isclaimed as a basis for different treatment of employees

or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a`factor other than' age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected agegroup, it can only be justified as a business necessity."
29 CFR $ 1625.7(d) (2004).
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication
of the agency's final interpretation of the ADEA said thefollowing regarding this regulati on: "Paragraph (d) of

$ 1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employmentcriteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protectedage group must be justified as a business necessity.

had been the longstanding position of the Department ofLabor, the agency that previously administered the ADEA,
see ante, at 239; 29 CFR $ 860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970). And finally, the Commission has appeared in numerous cases in the
lower courts, both as a party and as amicus curiae, to defend
the position that the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact
claims.1 Even under the unduly constrained standards of

Opinion of Scalia, J.
U. S. 218 (2001), the EEOC's reasonable view that the ADEA
authorizes disparate-impact claims is deserving of deference.
Id., at 229-231, and n. 12. A fortiori, it is entitled to deference under the pre-Mead formulation of Chevron, to which I
continue to adhere. See 533 U. S., at 256-257 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting).

Justice O'Connor both denies that the EEOC has taken
a position on the existence of disparate-impact claims and
asserts that, even if it has, its position does not deserve deference. See post, at 264-267 (opinion concurring in judgment). The first claim cannot be squared with the text of
the EEOC's regulation, quoted above. This cannot possibly
be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the
aged. It provides that such practices "can only be justified
as a business necessity," compelling the conclusion that, absent a "business necessity," such practices are prohibited.2

Justice O'Connor would not defer to the EEOC regulation, even if it read as it does, because, she says, the regulation "does not purport to interpret the language of $ 4(a) at
all," but is rather limited to an interpretation of the "reasonable factors other than age" (RFOA) clause of $ 4(f )(1) of the
ADEA, which she says is not at issue. Post, at 265. This
argument assumes, however, that the RFOA clause operates
independently of the remainder of the ADEA. It does not.
Section 4(f )(1) provides, in relevant part:

2 Perhaps Justice O'Connor adopts the narrower position that, while
the EEOC has taken the view that the ADEA prohibits actions that have
a disparate impact, it has stopped short of recognizing "disparate impact
claims." Post, at 265 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).
If so, this position is equally misguided. The EEOC need not take the
extra step of recognizing that individuals harmed by prohibited actions
have a right to sue; the ADEA itself makes that automatic. 29 U. S. C.

$ 626(c)(1) ("Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of
competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate
the purposes of this chapter . . . ").

246 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

Opinion of Scalia, J.
"It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment
agency, or labor organization . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of
this section . . . where the differentiation is based on
reasonable factors other than age . . . ." 29 U. S. C.

$ 623(f)(1) (emphasis added).

As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant only
as a response to employer actions "otherwise prohibited" by
the ADEA. Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions
that have an "adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group." 29 CFR $ 1625.7(d) (2004). And, of
course, the only provision of the ADEA that could conceivably be interpreted to effect such a prohibition is $ 4(a)(2)--
the provision that Justice O'Connor maintains the EEOC
"does not purport to interpret . . . at all." Post, at 265.3

3 Justice O'Connor argues that the regulation does not necessarily
construe $ 4(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addresses--viz., "an
adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group," 29 CFR

$ 1625.7(d) (2004). See post, at 265-266. That is true enough. But the
question here is not whether disparate-treatment claims (when they have
a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether
disparate-impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to
avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agency's actions over
the years) that they are. That is also a complete response to Justice
O'Connor's point that the regulation could not refer to $ 4(a)(2) because
it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under

$ 4(a)(1). Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as
Justice O'Connor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agency's attempt to sweep employment applications
into the disparate-impact prohibition is mistaken. But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to
contend that the regulation does not cover actions that "limit, segregate,
or classify" employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those
within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation
that those actions are prohibited is $ 4(a)(2).

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Lastly, Justice O'Connor argues that the EEOC's inter-pretation of what is "otherwise prohibited" by the ADEA is

not entitled to deference because the Court concludes thatthe same regulation's interpretation of

another term--the
term "reasonable factors other than age," which the regula-tion takes to include only "business necessity"--is unreasonable. Post, at 266. Her logic seems to be that, because the
two interpretations appear in the same paragraph, theyshould stand or fall together. She cites no case for this

proposition, and it makes little sense. If the two simultane-ously adopted interpretations were contained in

distinct
paragraphs, the invalidation of one would not, of course, ren-der the other infirm. (

Justice O'Connor does not mean to
imply, I assume, that our rejection of the EEOC's application
of the phrase " `reasonable factors other than age' " to
disparate-impact claims in paragraph (d) of $ 1625.7 relieves
the lower courts of the obligation to defer to the EEOC's
other applications of the same phrase in paragraph (c) or (e).)
I can conceive no basis for a different rule simply because
the two simultaneously adopted interpretations appear in
the same paragraph.

The EEOC has express authority to promulgate rules and
regulations interpreting the ADEA. It has exercised that
authority to recognize disparate-impact claims. And, for
the reasons given by the plurality opinion, its position is eminently reasonable. In my view, that is sufficient to resolve
this case.

Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993). In the nearly fourdecades since the ADEA's enactment, however, we have

never read the statute to impose liability upon an employerwithout proof of discriminatory intent. See ibid.; Markham
v. Geller, 451 U. S. 945 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting fromdenial of certiorari). I decline to join the Court in doing
so today.I would instead affirm the judgment below on the ground
that disparate impact claims are not cognizable under theADEA. The ADEA's text, legislative history, and purposes
together make clear that Congress did not intend the statuteto authorize such claims. Moreover, the significant differences between the ADEA and Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964 counsel against transposing to the former our
construction of the latter in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401U. S. 424 (1971). Finally, the agencies charged with administering the ADEA have never authoritatively construed thestatute's prohibitory language to impose disparate impact liability. Thus, on the precise question of statutory interpre-tation now before us, there is no reasoned agency reading of
the text to which we might defer.

I
A
Our starting point is the statute's text. Section 4(a) ofthe ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:

"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-vidual or otherwise discriminate against any individual
with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, orprivileges of employment, because of such individual's
age; [or]

"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees inany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any

individual of employment opportunities or otherwise ad-versely affect his status as an employee, because of such
individual's age . . . ." 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a).

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Neither petitioners nor the plurality contend that the firstparagraph, $ 4(a)(1), authorizes disparate impact claims, and

I think it obvious that it does not. That provision plainlyrequires discriminatory intent, for to take an action against
an individual "because of such individual's age" is to do so"by reason of " or "on account of " her age. See Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 194 (1961); see also
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 335-336, n. 15(1977) (" `Disparate treatment' . . . is the most easily understood type of discrimination. The employer simply treatssome people less favorably than others

because of their [protected characteristic]. Proof of discriminatory motive is
critical" (emphasis added)).

Petitioners look instead to the second paragraph, $ 4(a)(2),
as the basis for their disparate impact claim. But petitioners' argument founders on the plain language of the statute,
the natural reading of which requires proof of discriminatory
intent. Section 4(a)(2) uses the phrase "because of . . . age"
in precisely the same manner as does the preceding paragraph--to make plain that an employer is liable only if its
adverse action against an individual is motivated by the
individual's age.

Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) do differ in one informative respect. The employer actions targeted by paragraph
(a)(1)--i. e., refusing to hire, discharging, or discriminating
against--are inherently harmful to the targeted individual.
The actions referred to in paragraph (a)(2), on the other
hand--i. e., limiting, segregating, or classifying--are facially
neutral. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(2) includes additional
language which clarifies that, to give rise to liability, the employer's action must actually injure someone: The decision to
limit, segregate, or classify employees must "deprive or tend
to deprive [an] individual of employment opportunities or
otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee." That
distinction aside, the structures of paragraphs (a)(1) and
(a)(2) are otherwise identical. Each paragraph prohibits an

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
employer from taking specified adverse actions against anindividual "because of such individual's age."

The plurality instead reads paragraph (a)(2) to prohibitemployer actions that "adversely affect [an individual's] status as an employe[e] because of such individual's age."Under this reading, "because of . . . age" refers to the

cause
of the adverse effect rather than the motive for the employer's action. See ante, at 235-236. This reading is unper-suasive for two reasons. First, it ignores the obvious parallel between paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) by giving the phrase"because of such individual's age" a different meaning in each
of the two paragraphs. And second, it ignores the drafters'
use of a comma separating the "because of . . . age" clause
from the preceding language. That comma makes plain that
the "because of . . . age" clause should not be read, as the
plurality would have it, to modify only the "adversely affect"
phrase. See, e. g., United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,
Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989) (interpreting statute in light
of the drafters' use of a comma to set aside a particular
phrase from the following language); see also B. Garner, A
Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 101 (2d ed. 1995) ("Generally, the word because should not follow a comma"). Rather,
the "because of . . . age" clause is set aside to make clear
that it modifies the entirety of the preceding paragraph: An
employer may not, because of an individual's age, limit, segregate, or classify his employees in a way that harms that
individual.

The plurality also argues that its reading is supported by
the supposed "incongruity" between paragraph (a)(2)'s use
of the plural in referring to the employer's actions ("limit,
segregate, or classify his employees") and its use of the
singular in the "because of such individual's age" clause.
(Emphases added.) Ante, at 236, n. 6. Not so. For the
reasons just stated, the "because of . . . age" clause modifies
all of the preceding language of paragraph (a)(2). That preceding language is phrased in both the plural (insofar as it

544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
refers to the employer's actions relating to employees) and
the singular (insofar as it requires that such action actually
harm an individual). The use of the singular in the "because of . . . age" clause simply makes clear that paragraph
(a)(2) forbids an employer to limit, segregate, or classify his
employees if that decision is taken because of even one employee's age and that individual (alone or together with others) is harmed.

B

While $ 4(a)(2) of the ADEA makes it unlawful to intentionally discriminate because of age, $ 4(f )(1) clarifies that
"[i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to take any
action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or
(e) of this section . . . where the differentiation is based
on reasonable factors other than age . . . ." 29 U. S. C.

$ 623(f )(1). This "reasonable factors other than age"
(RFOA) provision "insure[s] that employers [are] permitted
to use neutral criteria" other than age, EEOC v. Wyoming,
460 U. S. 226, 232-233 (1983), even if this results in a disparate adverse impact on older workers. The provision therefore expresses Congress' clear intention that employers not
be subject to liability absent proof of intentional age-based
discrimination. That policy, in my view, cannot easily be
reconciled with the plurality's expansive reading of $ 4(a)(2).

The plurality, however, reasons that the RFOA provision's
language instead confirms that $ 4(a) authorizes disparate impact claims. If $ 4(a) prohibited only intentional discrimination, the argument goes, then the RFOA provision would
have no effect because any action based on a factor other
than age would not be " `otherwise prohibited' " under $ 4(a).
See ante, at 238-239. Moreover, the plurality says, the
RFOA provision applies only to employer actions based on
reasonable factors other than age--so employers may still be
held liable for actions based on unreasonable nonage factors.
See ante, at 239.

252 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
This argument misconstrues the purpose and effect of theRFOA provision. Discriminatory intent

is required under

$ 4(a), for the reasons discussed above. The role of theRFOA provision is to afford employers an independent

safe
harbor from liability. It provides that, where a plaintiff hasmade out a prima facie case of intentional age discrimination under $ 4(a)--thus "creat[ing] a presumption that the
employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee,"
Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248,
254 (1981)--the employer can rebut this case by producingevidence that its action was based on a reasonable nonage

factor. Thus, the RFOA provision codifies a safe harbor
analogous to the "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason"
(LNR) justification later recognized in Title VII suits.
Ibid.; McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802
(1973).

Assuming the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to
ADEA suits, see O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers
Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996), this "rebuttal" function of the
RFOA provision is arguably redundant with the judicially
established LNR justification. See ante, at 238-239. But,
at most, that merely demonstrates Congress' abundance of
caution in codifying an express statutory exemption from
liability in the absence of discriminatory intent. See Fort
Stewart Schools v. FLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990) (provisions that, although "technically unnecessary," are sometimes "inserted out of an abundance of caution--a drafting
imprecision venerable enough to have left its mark on legal
Latin (ex abundanti cautela)"). It is noteworthy that even
after McDonnell Douglas was decided, lower courts continued to rely on the RFOA exemption, in lieu of the LNR
justification, as the basis for rebutting a prima facie case of
age discrimination. See, e. g., Krieg v. Paul Revere Life Ins.
Co., 718 F. 2d 998, 999 (CA11 1983) (per curiam); Schwager
v. Sun Oil Co. of Pa., 591 F. 2d 58, 61 (CA10 1979); Bittar v.
Air Canada, 512 F. 2d 582, 582-583 (CA5 1975) (per curiam).

253Cite as: 544 U. S. 228 (2005)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
In any event, the RFOA provision also plays a distinct(and clearly nonredundant) role in "mixed-motive" cases. In

such cases, an adverse action taken in substantial part be-cause of an employee's age may be "otherwise prohibited" by

$ 4(a). See Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 93(2003); Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 262-266
(1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The RFOAexemption makes clear that such conduct is nevertheless
lawful so long as it is "based on" a reasonable factor otherthan age.

Finally, the RFOA provision's reference to "reasonable"factors serves only to prevent the employer from gaining the
benefit of the statutory safe harbor by offering an irrationaljustification. Reliance on an unreasonable nonage factor
would indicate that the employer's explanation is, in fact,no more than a pretext for

intentional discrimination. SeeReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133,

147 (2000); see also Hazen Paper, 507 U. S., at 613-614.

II
The legislative history of the ADEA confirms what its textplainly indicates--that Congress never intended the statute

to authorize disparate impact claims. The drafters of theADEA and the Congress that enacted it understood that age
discrimination was qualitatively different from the kinds ofdiscrimination addressed by Title VII, and that many legitimate employment practices would have a disparate impacton older workers. Accordingly, Congress determined that
the disparate impact problem would best be addressedthrough noncoercive measures, and that the ADEA's prohibitory provisions should be reserved for combating intentionalage-based discrimination.

EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 229. In response, Secretary Willard Wirtz submitted the report that
provided the blueprint for the ADEA. See Report of theSecretary of Labor, The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment (June 1965), reprinted in U. S.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Legislative
History of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
(1981), Doc. No. 5 (hereinafter Wirtz Report or Report).
Because the ADEA was modeled on the Wirtz Report's findings and recommendations, the Report provides critical insights into the statute's meaning. See generally Blumrosen,
Interpreting the ADEA: Intent or Impact 14-20, in Age Discrimination in Employment Act: A Compliance and Litigation Manual for Lawyers and Personnel Practitioners 83-89
(M. Lake ed. 1982); see also General Dynamics, supra, at
587-590 (relying on the Wirtz Report to interpret the
ADEA); EEOC v. Wyoming, supra, at 230-231 (discussing
the Report's role in the drafting of the ADEA).

The Wirtz Report reached two conclusions of central relevance to the question presented by this case. First, the Report emphasized that age discrimination is qualitatively different from the types of discrimination prohibited by Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (i. e., race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination). Most importantly--in stark contrast to the types of discrimination addressed by Title VII--the Report found no evidence that age
discrimination resulted from intolerance or animus toward
older workers. Rather, age discrimination was based primarily upon unfounded assumptions about the relationship
between an individual's age and her ability to perform a job.
Wirtz Report 2. In addition, whereas ability is nearly al544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
ways completely unrelated to the characteristics protectedby Title VII, the Report found that, in some cases, "there is

in fact a relationship between [an individual's] age and hisability to perform the job." Ibid. (emphasis deleted).

Second, the Wirtz Report drew a sharp distinction be-tween " `arbitrary discrimination' " (which the Report clearly
equates with disparate treatment) and circumstances orpractices having a disparate impact on older workers. See
id., at 2, 21-22. The Report defined "arbitrary" discrimina-tion as adverse treatment of older workers "because of assumptions about the effect of age on their ability to do a job
when there is in fact no basis for these assumptions." Id.,at 2 (emphasis in original). While the "most obvious kind"

of arbitrary discrimination is the setting of unjustified maxi-mum age limits for employment, id., at 6, naturally the Report's definition encompasses a broad range of disparatetreatment.

The Report distinguished such "arbitrary" (i. e., inten-tional and unfounded) discrimination from two other phenomena. One involves differentiation of employees based ona genuine relationship between age and ability to perform a
job. See id., at 2. In this connection, the Report examined"circumstances which unquestionably affect older workers
more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers,"including questions of health, educational attainment, and
technological change. Id., at 11-14.1 In addition, the Re1 It is in this connection that the Report refers to formal employment
standards requiring a high school diploma. See Wirtz Report 3. The
Wirtz Report did say that such a requirement would be "unfair" if an
older worker's years of experience had given him an equivalent education.
Ibid. But the plurality is mistaken to find in this statement a congressional "goal" of eliminating job requirements with a disparate impact on
older workers. See ante, at 235, n. 5. Rather, the Wirtz Report discussed the diploma requirement in the context of a broader discussion of
the effects of "wholly impersonal forces--most of them part of what is
properly, if sometimes too casually, called `progress.' " Wirtz Report 3.
These forces included "the pace of changing technology, changing jobs,

port assessed "institutional arrangements"--such as senior-ity rules, workers' compensation laws, and pension plans--

which, though intended to benefit older workers, might actu-ally make employers less likely to hire or retain them. Id.,
at 2, 15-17.The Report specifically recommended legislative action to
prohibit "arbitrary discrimination," i. e., disparate treat-ment.

Id., at 21-22. In sharp contrast, it recommendedthat the other two types of "discrimination"--both involving

factors or practices having a disparate impact on older work-ers--be addressed through noncoercive measures: programs
to increase the availability of employment; continuing educa-tion; and adjustment of pension systems, workers' compensation, and other institutional arrangements. Id., at 22-25.These recommendations found direct expression in the
ADEA, which was drafted at Congress' command that theSecretary of Labor make "specific legislative recommendations for implementing the [Wirtz Report's] conclusions,"Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, $ 606, 80 Stat.
845. See also General Dynamics, supra, at 589 ("[T]heADEA . . . begins with statements of purpose and findings
that mirror the Wirtz Report").

B
The ADEA's structure confirms Congress' determinationto prohibit only "arbitrary" discrimination (i. e., disparate

treatment based on unfounded assumptions), while address-ing practices with a disparate adverse impact on older workchanging educational requirements, and changing personnel practices,"
which "increase[d] the need for special efforts if older workers' employment prospects are to improve significantly." Ibid. (emphasis added); see
also id., at 11-15 (discussing the educational attainments of older workers,
together with health and technological change, in a section entitled "The
Necessary Recognition of Forces of Circumstance"). The Report recommended that such forces be addressed through noncoercive instead of prohibitory measures, and it specifically focused on the need for educational
opportunities for older workers. See id., at 23-25.

ers through noncoercive measures. Section 2--which setsforth the findings and purposes of the statute--draws a clear

distinction between "the setting of arbitrary age limits re-gardless of potential for job performance" and "certain otherwise desirable practices [that] may work to the disadvan-tage of older persons." 29 U. S. C. $ 621(a)(2). In response
to these problems, $ 2 identifies three purposes of the ADEA:
"[1] to promote employment of older persons based on theirability rather than age; [2] to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and 3] to help employers and workersfind ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of
age on employment." $ 621(b).

Each of these three purposes corresponds to one of the
three substantive statutory sections that follow. Section 3
seeks to "promote employment of older persons" by directing
the Secretary of Labor to undertake a program of research
and education related to "the needs and abilities of older
workers, and their potentials for continued employment and
contribution to the economy." $ 622(a). Section 4, which
contains the ADEA's core prohibitions, corresponds to the
second purpose: to "prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in
employment." Finally, $ 5 addresses the third statutory
purpose by requiring the Secretary of Labor to undertake a
study of "institutional and other arrangements giving rise to
involuntary retirement" and to submit any resulting findings
and legislative recommendations to Congress. $ 624(a)(1).

Section 4--including $ 4(a)(2)--must be read in light of the
express statutory purpose the provision was intended to
effect: the prohibition of "arbitrary age discrimination in
employment." $ 621(b). As the legislative history makes
plain, "arbitrary" age discrimination had a very specific
meaning for the ADEA's drafters. It meant disparate treatment of older workers, predominantly because of unfounded
assumptions about the relationship between age and ability.
See supra, at 255-256. Again, such intentional discrimination was clearly distinguished from circumstances and prac544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tices merely having a disparate impact on older workers,which--as ADEA $$ 2, 3, and 5 make clear--Congress intended to address through research, education, and possiblefuture legislative action.

C
In addition to this affirmative evidence of congressionalintent, I find it telling that the legislative history is devoid

of any discussion of disparate impact claims or of the compli-cated issues such claims raise in the ADEA context. See
Gold, Disparate Impact Under the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967, 25 Berkeley J. Emp. & Lab. L. 1,
40 (2004). At the time the ADEA was enacted, the predomi-nant focus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrimination; the concept of disparate impact liability, by con-trast, was quite novel. See, e. g., Gold, Griggs' Folly: An
Essay on the Theory, Problems, and Origin of the AdverseImpact Definition of Employment Discrimination and a Recommendation for Reform, 7 Indus. Rel. L. J. 429, 518-520(1985); Blumrosen, Strangers in Paradise: Griggs v. Duke
Power Co. and the Concept of Employment Discrimination,71 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 69-71 (1972-1973). Had Congress intended to inaugurate disparate impact liability in the ADEA,one would expect to find some indication of that intent in the
text and the legislative history. There is none.

D
Congress' decision not to authorize disparate impactclaims is understandable in light of the questionable utility

of such claims in the age-discrimination context. No onewould argue that older workers have suffered disadvantages
as a result of entrenched historical patterns of discrimina-tion, like racial minorities have. See Massachusetts Bd. of
Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307, 313-314 (1976) (per cu-riam); see also Wirtz Report 5-6. Accordingly, disparate
impact liability under the ADEA cannot be justified, and isnot necessary, as a means of redressing the cumulative re544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

259Cite as: 544 U. S. 228 (2005)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
sults of past discrimination. Cf. Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430(reasoning that disparate impact liability is necessary under

Title VII to prevent perpetuation of the results of past ra-cial discrimination).

Moreover, the Wirtz Report correctly concluded that--un-like the classifications protected by Title VII--there often is
a correlation between an individual's age and her ability toperform a job. Wirtz Report 2, 11-15. That is to be expected, for "physical ability generally declines with age,"
Murgia, supra, at 315, and in some cases, so does mentalcapacity, see Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 472 (1991).

Perhaps more importantly, advances in technology and in-creasing access to formal education often leave older workers at a competitive disadvantage vis-a` -vis younger workers.Wirtz Report 11-15. Beyond these performance-affecting
factors, there is also the fact that many employment benefits,such as salary, vacation time, and so forth, increase as an
employee gains experience and seniority. See, e. g., Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967 F. 2d 1161, 1164(CA7 1992) ("[V]irtually all elements of a standard compensation package are positively correlated with age"). Accord-ingly, many employer decisions that are intended to cut costs
or respond to market forces will likely have a disproportion-ate effect on older workers. Given the myriad ways in
which legitimate business practices can have a disparate im-pact on older workers, it is hardly surprising that Congress
declined to subject employers to civil liability based solelyon such effects.

III
The plurality and Justice Scalia offer two principal ar-guments in favor of their reading of the statute: that the

relevant provision of the ADEA should be read in pari materia with the parallel provision of Title VII, and that weshould give interpretive weight or deference to agency statements relating to disparate impact liability. I find neitherargument persuasive.

260 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment

A
The language of the ADEA's prohibitory provisions wasmodeled on, and is nearly identical to, parallel provisions in

Title VII. See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing
Co., 513 U. S. 352, 357 (1995); Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.575, 584 (1978). Because Griggs, supra, held that Title VII's

$ 703(a)(2) permits disparate impact claims, the plurality con-cludes that we should read $ 4(a)(2) of the ADEA similarly.
Ante, at 233-238.Obviously, this argument would be a great deal more convincing had Griggs been decided before the ADEA wasenacted. In that case, we could safely assume that Congress
had notice (and therefore intended) that the language atissue here would be read to authorize disparate impact
claims. See, e. g., Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S.607, 626 (1992);

Holmes v. Securities Investor ProtectionCorporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992). But Griggs was decided four years after the ADEA's enactment, and there isno reason to suppose that Congress in 1967 could have foreseen the interpretation of Title VII that was to come. SeeFogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 523, n. 9 (1994); see
also supra, at 258 (discussing novelty of disparate impacttheory at the time of the ADEA's enactment).

To be sure, where two statutes use similar language wegenerally take this as "a strong indication that [they] should
be interpreted pari passu." Northcross v. Board of Ed. of
Memphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per cu-riam). But this is not a rigid or absolute rule, and it

" `readily yields' " to other indicia of congressional intent.General Dynamics, 540 U. S., at 595 (quoting Atlantic
Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433(1932)). Indeed, " `the meaning [of the same words] well
may vary to meet the purposes of the law.' " United Statesv. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001)
(quoting Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, supra, at 433; altera-tion in original). Accordingly, we have not hesitated to give

544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

261Cite as: 544 U. S. 228 (2005)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
a different reading to the same language--whether appear-ing in separate statutes or in separate provisions of the same

statute--if there is strong evidence that Congress did notintend the language to be used uniformly. See,

e. g., General
Dynamics, supra, at 595-597 ("age" has different meaningwhere used in different parts of the ADEA);

Cleveland Indians, supra, at 213 ("wages paid" has different meanings in
different provisions of Title 26 U. S. C.); Robinson v. Shell
Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 343-344 (1997) ("employee" has different meanings in different parts of Title VII); Fogerty, supra,at 522-525 (Copyright Act's attorney's fees provision has different meaning than the analogous provision in Title VII,
despite their "virtually identical language"). Such is the
case here.

First, there are significant textual differences between
Title VII and the ADEA that indicate differences in congressional intent. Most importantly, whereas the ADEA's
RFOA provision protects employers from liability for any
actions not motivated by age, see supra, at 251-253, Title
VII lacks any similar provision. In addition, the ADEA's
structure demonstrates Congress' intent to combat intentional discrimination through $ 4's prohibitions while addressing employment practices having a disparate impact on
older workers through independent noncoercive mechanisms.
See supra, at 256-258. There is no analogy in the structure
of Title VII. Furthermore, as the Congresses that adopted
both Title VII and the ADEA clearly recognized, the two
statutes were intended to address qualitatively different
kinds of discrimination. See supra, at 253-255. Disparate
impact liability may have a legitimate role in combating the
types of discrimination addressed by Title VII, but the nature of aging and of age discrimination makes such liability
inappropriate for the ADEA. See supra, at 258-259.

Finally, nothing in the Court's decision in Griggs itself provides any reason to extend its holding to the ADEA. As
the plurality tacitly acknowledges, ante, at 235, the decision

544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
262 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
in Griggs was not based on any analysis of Title VII's actuallanguage. Rather, the ratio decidendi was the statute's perceived purpose, i. e.,

"to achieve equality of employment opportunities andremove barriers that have operated in the past to favor

an identifiable group of white employees over other em-ployees. Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests
neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent,cannot be maintained if they operate to `freeze' the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices."401 U. S., at 429-430.

In other words, the Court in Griggs reasoned that disparateimpact liability was necessary to achieve Title VII's ostensible goal of eliminating the cumulative effects of historicalracial discrimination. However, that rationale finds no parallel in the ADEA context, see Murgia, 427 U. S., at 313-314,and it therefore should not control our decision here.

Even venerable canons of construction must bow, in an ap-propriate case, to compelling evidence of congressional intent. In my judgment, the significant differences betweenTitle VII and the ADEA are more than sufficient to overcome the default presumption that similar language is to beread similarly. See Fogerty, supra, at 523-524 (concluding
that the "normal indication" that similar language should beread similarly is "overborne" by differences between the legislative history and purposes of two statutes).

B
The plurality asserts that the agencies charged with theADEA's administration "have consistently interpreted the

[statute] to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory."
Ante, at 239. In support of this claim, the plurality de-scribes a 1968 interpretive bulletin issued by the Department of Labor as "permitt[ing]" disparate impact claims.
Ibid. (citing 29 CFR $ 860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970)). And the plu544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rality cites, without comment, an Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission (EEOC) policy statement construing the

RFOA provision. Ante, at 240 (citing 29 CFR $ 1625.7(2004))

. It is unclear what interpretive value the plurality
means to assign to these agency statements. But Justice
Scalia, at least, thinks that the EEOC statement is entitled
to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), and that"that is sufficient to resolve this case."

Ante, at 247 (opinion
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I disagreeand, for the reasons that follow, would give no weight to the

statements in question.

The 1968 Labor Department bulletin to which the plurality
alludes was intended to "provide `a practical guide to employers and employees as to how the office representing the
public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it.' " 29
CFR $ 860.1 (1970) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U. S. 134, 138 (1944)). In discussing the RFOA provision,
the bulletin states that "physical fitness requirements" and
"[e]valuation factors such as quantity or quality of production, or educational level" can qualify as reasonable nonage
factors, so long as they have a valid relationship to job qualifications and are uniformly applied. $$ 860.103(f)(1), (2).
But the bulletin does not construe the ADEA's prohibitory
provisions, nor does it state or imply that $ 4(a) authorizes
disparate impact claims. Rather, it establishes "a nonexclusive objective test for employers to use in determining
whether they could be certain of qualifying for the" RFOA
exemption. Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio
v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158, 172 (1989) (discussing 1968 bulletin's
interpretation of the $ 4(f)(2) exemption). Moreover, the
very same bulletin states unequivocally that "[t]he clear purpose [of the ADEA] is to insure that age, within the limits
prescribed by the Act, is not a determining factor in making
any decision regarding the hiring, dismissal, promotion or
any other term, condition or privilege of employment of an

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
individual." $ 860.103(c) (emphasis added). That languageis all about discriminatory intent.

The EEOC statement cited by the plurality and reliedupon by

Justice Scalia is equally unhelpful. This "interpretative rule or policy statement," promulgated in 1981, su-perseded the 1968 Labor Department bulletin after responsibility for enforcing the ADEA was transferred from Labor
to the EEOC. See 46 Fed. Reg. 47724 (1981). It states, inrelevant part:

"[W]hen an employment practice, including a test, is
claimed as a basis for different treatment of employeesor applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a

`factor other than' age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected agegroup, it can only be justified as a business necessity."

29 CFR $ 1625.7(d) (2004).
Like the 1968 bulletin it replaces, this statement merelyspells out the agency's view, for purposes of its enforcement

policy, of what an employer must do to be certain of gainingthe safety of the RFOA haven. It says nothing about
whether disparate impact claims are authorized by the
ADEA.For

Justice Scalia, "[t]his is an absolutely classic case for
deference to agency interpretation." Ante, at 243 (opinionconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). I disagree.

Under Chevron, we will defer to a reasonable agency inter-pretation of ambiguous statutory language, see 467 U. S., at
843-844, provided that the interpretation has the requisite"force of law,"

Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576,
587 (2000). The rationale for such deference is that Congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated to the agency responsible for administering a statute the authority to choose
among permissible constructions of ambiguous statutory
text. See Chevron, supra, at 844. The question now before
us is not what it takes to qualify for the RFOA exemption,

544US1 Unit: $U35 [11-07-07 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

265Cite as: 544 U. S. 228 (2005)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
but rather whether $ 4(a)(2) of the ADEA authorizes dispar-ate impact claims. But the EEOC statement does not purport to interpret the language of $ 4(a) at all. Quite simply,the agency has not actually exercised its delegated authority
to resolve any ambiguity in the relevant provision's text,much less done so in a reasonable or persuasive manner. As
to the specific question presented, therefore, the regulationis not entitled to any deference. See

John Hancock Mut.Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, 510 U. S. 86,

106-109, and n. 17 (1993); see also SEC v. Sloan, 436 U. S.103, 117-118 (1978); Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States,
434 U. S. 275, 287-289, and n. 5 (1978).2

Justice Scalia's attempt to link the EEOC's RFOA reg-ulation to $ 4(a)(2) is premised on a dubious chain of inferences that, in my view, highlights the hazards of his ap-proach. Because the RFOA provision is "relevant

only as aresponse to employer actions `otherwise prohibited' by the

ADEA," he reasons, the "unavoidable meaning" of theEEOC statement is that the agency interprets the ADEA to
prohibit "employer actions that have an `adverse impact onindividuals within the protected age group.' "

Ante, at 246(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment)

(quoting 29 CFR $ 1625.7(d) (2004)). But, of course, dispar-ate treatment clearly has an "adverse impact on individuals
within the protected age group," ibid., and Justice Scalia'sreading of the EEOC's rule is hardly "unavoidable." The
regulation says only that if an employer wants to rely ona practice--say, a physical fitness test--as the basis for an
exemption from liability, and that test adversely affects olderworkers, the employer can be sure of qualifying for the exemption only if the test is sufficiently job related. Such a

2 Because the EEOC regulation does not actually interpret the text at
issue, we need not address the degree of deference to which the regulation
would otherwise be entitled. Cf. General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.
v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 600 (2004) (declining to address whether EEOC's
regulations interpreting the ADEA are entitled to Chevron deference).

266 SMITH v. CITY OF JACKSON

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
limitation makes sense in disparate treatment cases. A testthat harms older workers and is unrelated to the job may be

a pretext for--or even a means of effectuating--intentionaldiscrimination. See

supra, at 253. Justice Scalia completes his analytical chain by inferring that the EEOC regu-lation

must be read to interpret $ 4(a)(2) to allow disparate
impact claims because that is the only provision of the
ADEA that could "conceivably" be so interpreted. Ante, at246. But the support for that inference is doubtful, to say

the least. The regulation specifically refers to employmentpractices claimed as a basis for "different treatment of employees or applicants for employment," 29 CFR $ 1625.7(d)
(2004) (emphasis added). Section 4(a)(2), of course, does not
apply to "applicants for employment" at all--it is only

$ 4(a)(1) that protects this group. See 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a).
That suggests that the EEOC must have read the RFOA
to provide a defense against claims under $ 4(a)(1)--which
unquestionably permits only disparate treatment claims, see
supra, at 249.

This discussion serves to illustrate why it makes little
sense to attribute to the agency a construction of the relevant statutory text that the agency itself has not actually
articulated so that we can then "defer" to that reading.
Such an approach is particularly troubling where applied to
a question as weighty as whether a statute does or does not
subject employers to liability absent discriminatory intent.
This is not, in my view, what Chevron contemplated.

As an interpretation of the RFOA provision, moreover,
the EEOC regulation is both unreasonable on its face and
directly at odds with the Court's holding in today's case. It
says that the RFOA exemption is available only if the employer's practice is justified by a "business necessity." But
the Court has rejected that reading of the RFOA provision,
and rightly so: There may be many "reasonable" means by
which an employer can advance its goals, and a given nonage
factor can certainly be "reasonable" without being necessary.

Ante, at 243; see also Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472U. S. 400, 419 (1985) (distinguishing " `reasonable necessity' "

standard from "reasonableness"). Of course, it is elemen-tary that "no deference is due to agency interpretations at
odds with the plain language of the statute itself." Betts,492 U. S., at 171. The agency clearly misread the RFOA
provision it was attempting to construe. That error is notnecessarily dispositive of the disparate impact question.
But I think it highlights the improvidence of giving weight(let alone deferring) to the regulation's

purported assump-tion that an entirely different provision of the statute, which

is not even the subject of the regulation, authorizes disparateimpact claims. In my view, we should simply acknowledge
that this regulation is of no help in answering the questionpresented.

IV
Although I would not read the ADEA to authorize dispar-ate impact claims, I agree with the Court that, if such claims

are allowed, they are strictly circumscribed by the RFOAexemption. See

ante, at 241-242. That exemption requiresonly that the challenged employment practice be based on

a "reasonable" nonage factor--that is, one that is rationallyrelated to some legitimate business objective. I also agree

the standards set forth in our decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989). That means, as theCourt holds, ante, at 241, that "a plaintiff must demonstrate

attack," Wards Cove, supra, at 657 (emphasis added); see alsoWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 994 (1988)

RHINES v. WEBER, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 03-9046. Argued January 12, 2005--Decided March 30, 2005
After petitioner Rhines' state conviction for first-degree murder and burglary became final and his state habeas petition was denied, he filed a
federal habeas petition. Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA) was tolled while his state petition was pending, see 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(d)(2), he had more than 11 months before the limitations period
expired. However, by the time the District Court ruled that eight of
his claims had not been exhausted in state court, the limitations period
had run. If the court had dismissed his "mixed" petition, Rhines would
have been unable to refile after exhausting his claims, so the court decided to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he presented his
unexhausted claims in state court, provided that he commenced the
state proceedings within 60 days and returned to the District Court
within 60 days of completing the exhaustion. The Eighth Circuit,
which had previously held that a district court has no authority to hold
mixed petitions in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances, vacated the stay and remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims.

Held: A district court has discretion to stay a mixed petition to allow a

petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state court in the
first instance and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition. Pp. 273-279.

(a) Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, this Court held
that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions but must
give state courts the first opportunity to decide a petitioner's claims;
imposed a "total exhaustion" requirement; and directed federal courts
to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without
prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court. Rose
v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 518-519. At the time, there was no statute
of limitations on federal habeas petitions. But that changed with
AEDPA, which preserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement while
imposing a 1-year limitations period, which is tolled during the pendency of a state, but not a federal, habeas petition. As a result, petitioners such as Rhines run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for
federal review of their unexhausted claims. Even a petitioner who files

Syllabus
early cannot control when a district court will resolve the exhaustion
question. The gravity and difficulty of this problem has led some
district courts to adopt the "stay-and-abeyance" procedure at issue.
Pp. 273-276.

(b) AEDPA does not deprive district courts of the authority to issue
stays that are a proper exercise of their discretion, but it does circumscribe that discretion. Any solution to this problem therefore must be
compatible with AEDPA's purposes. Staying a federal habeas petition
frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouraging finality of state court
judgments by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal
proceedings, and it undermines AEDPA's goal of streamlining federal
habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioner's incentive to exhaust all
his claims in state court before filing his federal petition. Thus, stay
and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances. Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present
his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate
when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims. Even if good cause existed, the
district court would abuse its discretion if it granted a stay when the
unexhausted claims are plainly meritless. Where stay and abeyance is
appropriate, the district court's discretion is still limited by AEDPA's
timeliness concerns. If a district court does not place reasonable time
limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back, petitioners, especially capital petitioners, could frustrate AEDPA's finality goal by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review. And if a petitioner
engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district
court should not grant a stay at all. On the other hand, it likely would
be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and dismiss
a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is
no indication that he engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics.
Such a petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims
outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of
federal petitions. For the same reason, if the court determines that
stay and abeyance is inappropriate, it should allow the petitioner to
delete the unexhausted claims and proceed with the exhausted ones if
dismissing the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief. Pp. 276-279.

Opinion of the Court
court in the first instance, and then to return to federal courtfor review of his perfected petition.

I
Petitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in SouthDakota state court of first-degree murder and third-degree

burglary and sentenced to death. His conviction becamefinal on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petition
for certiorari. Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U. S. 1013. OnDecember 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeas
corpus. App. 32. The state court denied his petition, andthe Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed on February 9,
2000, Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608 N. W. 2d 303. Rhinesfiled his

pro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuantto 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States District Court for

the District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000. App.3. Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996(AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was pending, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2), he still hadmore than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period.With the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhines
filed an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and state-ment of exhaustion on November 20, 2000, asserting 35
claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sen-tence. App. 39-60. The State challenged 12 of those claims
as unexhausted. Id., at 72-79. On July 3, 2002, approxi-mately 18 months after Rhines had filed his amended federal
habeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 ofthe 35 claims had not been exhausted. At this time, the
AEDPA 1-year statute of limitations had run. See Duncanv.

Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 181-182 (2001) (holding that thestatute of limitations is not tolled during the pendancy of

a federal petition). As a result, if the District Court haddismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would

Opinion of the Court
have been unable to refile in federal court after exhaustingthe unexhausted claims. Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas petition in abeyancewhile he presented his unexhausted claims to the South
Dakota courts. On July 3, 2002, the District Court grantedthe motion and issued a stay "conditioned upon petitioner
commencing state court exhaustion proceedings within sixtydays of this order and returning to this court within sixty
days of completing such exhaustion." App. 136. In compli-ance with that order, Rhines filed his second state habeas
corpus petition on August 22, 2002.The State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines'
mixed petition to the United States Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit. Relying on its decision in

Akins v. Kenney,341 F. 3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that "a district court has

no authority to hold a habeas petition containing unex-hausted claims in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances" (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court ofAppeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed bydeleting unexhausted claims from his petition. 346 F. 3d 799
(2003). We granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Cir-cuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's "stayand-abeyance" procedure. 542 U. S. 936 (2004). Compare,
e. g., Crews v. Horn, 360 F. 3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); andZarvela v. Artuz, 254 F. 3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with 346

F. 3d 799 (2003) (case below).

II
Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, we heldin

Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), that federal districtcourts may not adjudicate mixed petitions for habeas corpus,

that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhaustedclaims. We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that state courts must have the first opportu-nity to decide a petitioner's claims.

Id., at 518-519. We

274 RHINES v. WEBER

Opinion of the Court
noted that "[b]ecause `it would be unseemly in our dual sys-tem of government for a federal district court to upset a

state court conviction without an opportunity to the statecourts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courts
apply the doctrine of comity." Id., at 518 (quoting Darr v.
Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950)). That doctrine " `teaches
that one court should defer action on causes properly within
its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty withconcurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation,

have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.' " 455U. S., at 518.

Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of "total exhaustion" and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and
allowing petitioners to return to state court to present the
unexhausted claims to that court in the first instance. Id.,
at 522. When we decided Lundy, there was no statute of
limitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.
As a result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously unexhausted claims could come back
to federal court to present their perfected petitions with relative ease. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000)
(dismissal without prejudice under Lundy "contemplated
that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion").

The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically altered
the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions. AEDPA
preserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A) ("An application for a writ of habeas
corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the
applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts
of the State"), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of limitations on the filing of federal petitions, $ 2244(d). Although
the limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a
"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other
collateral review," $ 2244(d)(2), the filing of a petition for ha544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

275Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
beas corpus in federal court does not toll the statute of limitations, Duncan, 533 U. S., at 181-182.

As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal court with "mixed" petitions run
the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal
review of their unexhausted claims. If a petitioner files a
timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the
district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations
period has expired, this will likely mean the termination of
any federal review. For example, if the District Court in
this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations
would have barred Rhines from returning to federal court
after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in state
court. Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner's
chances of exhausting his claims in state court and refiling
his petition in federal court before the limitations period
runs are slim. The problem is not limited to petitioners who
file close to the AEDPA deadline. Even a petitioner who
files early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the question of exhaustion. Thus,
whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his
claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his
case.

We recognize the gravity of this problem and the difficulty
it has posed for petitioners and federal district courts alike.
In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts have
adopted a version of the "stay-and-abeyance" procedure employed by the District Court below. Under this procedure,
rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to Lundy, a
district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance
while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his
previously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner ex544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
276 RHINES v. WEBER

Opinion of the Court
hausts his state remedies, the district court will lift the stayand allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court.

District courts do ordinarily have authority to issue stays,see

Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936),
where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion,see

Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 706 (1997). AEDPA
does not deprive district courts of that authority, cf. 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A) ("An application for a writ of habeascorpus . . . shall not be

granted unless it appears that . . . the
applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courtsof the State" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribe

their discretion. Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with AEDPA's purposes.

One of the statute's purposes is to "reduce delays in the
execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases." Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202,
206 (2003). See also Duncan, 533 U. S., at 179. AEDPA's
1-year limitations period "quite plainly serves the wellrecognized interest in the finality of state court judgments."
Ibid. It "reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal
habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review." Ibid.

Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdrop
of Lundy's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in $ 2244(d)(2) "balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period" "by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas
relief while state remedies are being pursued." Duncan,
supra, at 179. AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seek
relief from state courts in the first instance by tolling the
1-year limitations period while a "properly filed application
for State post-conviction or other collateral review" is pending. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2). This scheme reinforces the
importance of Lundy's "simple and clear instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal court,

544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

277Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
be sure that you first have taken each one to state court."455 U. S., at 520.

Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the po-tential to undermine these twin purposes. Staying a federal
habeas petition frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouragingfinality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the
federal proceedings. It also undermines AEDPA's goal of
streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing apetitioner's incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court

prior to filing his federal petition. Cf. Duncan, supra, at180 ("[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in
state court would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeal
litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to
reduce").

For these reasons, stay and abeyance should be available
only in limited circumstances. Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claims
first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good
cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first
in state court. Moreover, even if a petitioner had good
cause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him a stay when his unexhausted
claims are plainly meritless. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) ("An
application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the
merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State").

Even where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district
court's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by the
timeliness concerns reflected in AEDPA. A mixed petition
should not be stayed indefinitely. Though, generally, a prisoner's "principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federal
relief on his claims," Lundy, supra, at 520 (plurality opinion),
not all petitioners have an incentive to obtain federal relief
as quickly as possible. In particular, capital petitioners
might deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong their

544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
278 RHINES v. WEBER

Opinion of the Court
incarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA's

goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal ha-beas review. Thus, district courts should place reasonable
time limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back.See,

e. g., Zarvela, 254 F. 3d, at 381 ("[District courts] should
explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing state
court remedies within a brief interval, normally 30 days,after the stay is entered and returning to federal court

within a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days after statecourt exhaustion is completed"). And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the
district court should not grant him a stay at all. See id.,
at 380-381.

On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion
for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed
petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to
exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged
in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss,
the mixed petition. See Lundy, 455 U. S., at 522 (the total
exhaustion requirement was not intended to "unreasonably
impair the prisoner's right to relief "). In such a case, the
petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims
outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions. For the same reason, if a petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and the
court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate,
the court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if
dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair
the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief. See id., at 520
(plurality opinion) ("[A petitioner] can always amend the
petition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims").

Opinion of Souter, J.
The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded thatstay and abeyance is always impermissible. We therefore

vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand thecase for that court to determine, consistent with this opinion,
whether the District Court's grant of a stay in this case con-stituted an abuse of discretion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

While I join the Court's opinion, I do so on the understand-ing that its reference to "good cause" for failing to exhaust

state remedies more promptly, ante, at 277, is not intendedto impose the sort of strict and inflexible requirement that
would " `trap the unwary pro se prisoner.' " Rose v. Lundy,455 U. S. 509, 520 (1982); see also

Slack v. McDaniel, 529U. S. 473, 487 (2000).

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I join the Court's opinion with one reservation, notdoctrinal but practical. Instead of conditioning stay-andabeyance on "good cause" for delay, ante, at 277, I wouldsimply hold the order unavailable on a demonstration of "intentionally dilatory litigation tactics," ante, at 278. Thetrickiness of some exhaustion determinations promises to infect issues of good cause when a court finds a failure to ex-haust;

pro se petitioners (as most habeas petitioners are) donot come well trained to address such matters. I fear that

threshold enquiries into good cause will give the districtcourts too much trouble to be worth the time; far better to
wait for the alarm to sound when there is some indicationthat a petitioner is gaming the system.

INDUSTRIES CORP.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 03-1696. Argued February 23, 2005--Decided March 30, 2005
The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, at issue in this case, has been applied by

this Court only twice, in Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, and
in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462.
In Rooker, plaintiffs previously defeated in state court filed suit in a
Federal District Court alleging that the adverse state-court judgment
was unconstitutional and asking that it be declared "null and void." 263
U. S., at 414-415. Noting preliminarily that the state court had acted
within its jurisdiction, this Court explained that if the state-court decision was wrong, "that did not make the judgment void, but merely left
it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate
proceeding." Id., at 415. Federal district courts, Rooker recognized,
are empowered to exercise only original, not appellate, jurisdictions.
Id., at 416. Because Congress has empowered this Court alone to exercise appellate authority "to reverse or modify" a state-court judgment,
ibid., the Court affirmed a decree dismissing the federal suit for lack of
jurisdiction, id., at 415, 417. In Feldman, two plaintiffs brought
federal-court actions after the District of Columbia's highest court denied their petitions to waive a court Rule requiring D. C. bar applicants
to have graduated from an accredited law school. Recalling Rooker,
this Court observed that the District Court lacked authority to review
a final judicial determination of the D. C. high court because such review
"can be obtained only in this Court." 460 U. S., at 476. Concluding
that the D. C. court's proceedings applying the accreditation Rule to the
plaintiffs were "judicial in nature," id., at 479-482, this Court ruled that
the Federal District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, id., at 482.
However, concluding also that, in promulgating the bar admission Rule,
the D. C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially, id., at 485-486, this
Court held that 28 U. S. C. $ 1257 did not bar the District Court from
addressing the validity of the Rule itself, so long as the plaintiffs did
not seek review of the Rule's application in a particular case, 460 U. S.,
at 486. Since Feldman, this Court has never applied Rooker-Feldman
to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction. However, the lower federal courts have variously interpreted the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to
extend far beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases, over544US1 Unit: $U37 [02-01-06 12:48:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

riding Congress' conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with
jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law under 28 U. S. C. $ 1738.

In this case, two subsidiaries of petitioner Exxon Mobil Corporation
formed joint ventures with respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
(SABIC) to produce polyethylene in Saudi Arabia. When a dispute
arose over royalties that SABIC had charged the joint ventures, SABIC
preemptively sued the two subsidiaries in a Delaware state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalties were proper. ExxonMobil and the subsidiaries then countersued in the Federal District
Court, alleging that SABIC overcharged them. Before the state-court
trial, which ultimately yielded a jury verdict of over $400 million for the
ExxonMobil subsidiaries, the District Court denied SABIC's motion to
dismiss the federal suit. On interlocutory appeal, over eight months
after the state-court jury verdict, the Third Circuit, on its own motion,
raised the question whether subject-matter jurisdiction over the federal
suit failed under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because ExxonMobil's
claims had already been litigated in state court. The court did not
question the District Court's subject-matter jurisdiction at the suit's
outset, but held that federal jurisdiction terminated when the Delaware
court entered judgment on the jury verdict.

Held: The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from

which it acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the
federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court
review and rejection of those judgments. Rooker-Feldman does not
otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines allowing federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions. Pp. 291-294.

(a) Rooker and Feldman exhibit the limited circumstances in which
this Court's appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, $ 1257,
precludes a federal district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate
under a congressional grant of authority. In both cases, the plaintiffs,
alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon the District Court to
overturn an injurious state-court judgment. Because $ 1257, as long
interpreted, vests authority to review a state-court judgment solely in
this Court, e. g., Feldman, 460 U. S., at 476, the District Courts lacked
subject-matter jurisdiction, see, e. g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 644, n. 3. When there is parallel state
and federal litigation, Rooker-Feldman is not triggered simply by the
entry of judgment in state court. See, e. g., McClellan v. Carland, 217

Syllabus
U. S. 268, 282. Comity or abstention doctrines may, in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the state-court litigation. See, e. g., Colorado
River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800. But
neither Rooker nor Feldman supports the notion that properly invoked
concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on
the same or a related question while the case remains sub judice in a
federal court. Disposition of the federal action, once the state-court
adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law. Under
28 U. S. C. $ 1738, federal courts must "give the same preclusive effect
to a state-court judgment as another court of that State would give."
Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, 474 U. S. 518, 523. Preclusion is not a jurisdictional matter. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). In
parallel litigation, a federal court may be bound to recognize the claimand issue-preclusive effects of a state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate automatically on the entry of
judgment in the state court. Nor does $ 1257 stop a district court from
exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts
to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.
If a federal plaintiff presents an independent claim, even one that denies
a state court's legal conclusion in a case to which the plaintiff was a
party, there is jurisdiction, and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under preclusion principles. Pp. 291-293.

(b) The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not preclude the federal court
from proceeding in this case. ExxonMobil has not repaired to federal
court to undo the Delaware judgment in its favor, but appears to have
filed its federal-court suit (only two weeks after SABIC filed in Delaware and well before any judgment in state court) to protect itself in
the event it lost in state court on grounds (such as the state statute
of limitations) that might not preclude relief in the federal venue.
Rooker-Feldman did not prevent the District Court from exercising
jurisdiction when ExxonMobil filed the federal action, and it did not
emerge to vanquish jurisdiction after ExxonMobil prevailed in the Delaware courts. The Third Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by Rooker-Feldman, and consequently erred in ordering the federal action dismissed. Pp. 293-294.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns what has come to be known as the
Rooker-Feldman doctrine, applied by this Court only twice,first in

Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),then, 60 years later, in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Variously inter-preted in the lower courts, the doctrine has sometimes been
construed to extend far beyond the contours of the Rookerand Feldman cases, overriding Congress' conferral of
federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exer-cised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1738. See,e. g., Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., 95
F. 3d 195, 199-200 (CA2 1996).

Rooker was a suit commenced in Federal District Court tohave a judgment of a state court, adverse to the federal court

plaintiffs, "declared null and void." 263 U. S., at 414. InFeldman, parties unsuccessful in the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals (the District's highest court) commenced afederal-court action against the very court that had rejected
their applications. Holding the federal suits impermissible,we emphasized that appellate jurisdiction to reverse or modify a state-court judgment is lodged, initially by $ 25 of theJudiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, and now by 28 U. S. C.

$ 1257, exclusively in this Court. Federal district courts, wenoted, are empowered to exercise original, not appellate, jurisdiction. Plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman had litigatedand lost in state court. Their federal complaints, we observed, essentially invited federal courts of first instance toreview and reverse unfavorable state-court judgments. We

Opinion of the Court
declared such suits out of bounds, i. e., properly dismissed
for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, we hold today, is confined
to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its
name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the
district court proceedings commenced and inviting district
court review and rejection of those judgments. RookerFeldman does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion
doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow
federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to
state-court actions.

In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by
Rooker-Feldman, and consequently erred in ordering the
federal action dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We therefore reverse the Third Circuit's judgment.

I
In Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, the parties
defeated in state court turned to a Federal District Court
for relief. Alleging that the adverse state-court judgment
was rendered in contravention of the Constitution, they
asked the federal court to declare it "null and void." Id.,
at 414-415. This Court noted preliminarily that the state
court had acted within its jurisdiction. Id., at 415. If the
state-court decision was wrong, the Court explained, "that
did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to
reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding." Ibid. Federal district courts, the Rooker
Court recognized, lacked the requisite appellate authority,
for their jurisdiction was "strictly original." Id., at 416.
Among federal courts, the Rooker Court clarified, Congress
had empowered only this Court to exercise appellate authority "to reverse or modify" a state-court judgment. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
Accordingly, the Court affirmed a decree dismissing the suitfor lack of jurisdiction.

Id., at 415, 417.
Sixty years later, the Court decided District of Columbia
Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462. The two plaintiffs in that case, Hickey and Feldman, neither of whom hadgraduated from an accredited law school, petitioned the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to waive a court Rule
that required D. C. bar applicants to have graduated froma law school approved by the American Bar Association.

After the D. C. court denied their waiver requests, Hickeyand Feldman filed suits in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia. Id., at 465-473. The District
Court and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit disagreed on the question whether the federal suit
could be maintained, and we granted certiorari. Id., at
474-475.

Recalling Rooker, this Court's opinion in Feldman observed first that the District Court lacked authority to
review a final judicial determination of the D. C. high court.
"Review of such determinations," the Feldman opinion reiterated, "can be obtained only in this Court." 460 U. S., at
476. The "crucial question," the Court next stated, was
whether the proceedings in the D. C. court were "judicial in
nature." Ibid. Addressing that question, the Court concluded that the D. C. court had acted both judicially and
legislatively.

In applying the accreditation Rule to the Hickey and Feldman waiver petitions, this Court determined, the D. C. court
had acted judicially. Id., at 479-482. As to that adjudication, Feldman held, this Court alone among federal courts
had review authority. Hence, "to the extent that Hickey
and Feldman sought review in the District Court of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' denial of their petitions
for waiver, the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their complaints." Id., at 482. But that determination did not dispose of the entire case, for in promulgating

286 EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. SAUDI BASIC INDUSTRIES CORP.

Opinion of the Court
the bar admission rule, this Court said, the D. C. court hadacted legislatively, not judicially. Id., at 485-486. "Challenges to the constitutionality of state bar rules," the Courtelaborated, "do not necessarily require a United States district court to review a final state-court judgment in a judi-cial proceeding." Id., at 486. Thus, the Court reasoned,
28 U. S. C. $ 1257 did not bar District Court proceedingsaddressed to the validity of the accreditation Rule itself.
Feldman, 460 U. S., at 486. The Rule could be contested infederal court, this Court held, so long as plaintiffs did not
seek review of the Rule's application in a particular case.
Ibid.The Court endeavored to separate elements of the Hickey

and Feldman complaints that failed the jurisdictional thresh-old from those that survived jurisdictional inspection.
Plaintiffs had urged that the District of Columbia Court ofAppeals acted arbitrarily in denying the waiver petitions of
Hickey and Feldman, given that court's "former policy ofgranting waivers to graduates of unaccredited law schools."
Ibid. That charge, the Court held, could not be pursued, for
it was "inextricably intertwined with the District of Colum-bia Court of Appeals' decisions, in judicial proceedings, to

deny [plaintiffs'] petitions." Id., at 486-487.1On the other hand, the Court said, plaintiffs could maintain
"claims that the [bar admission] rule is unconstitutional be-cause it creates an irrebuttable presumption that only graduates of accredited law schools are fit to practice law, discrimi-nates against those who have obtained equivalent legal
training by other means, and impermissibly delegates theDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals' power to regulate the

1 Earlier in the opinion the Court had used the same expression. In
a footnote, the Court explained that a district court could not entertain
constitutional claims attacking a state-court judgment, even if the state
court had not passed directly on those claims, when the constitutional
attack was "inextricably intertwined" with the state court's judgment.

Opinion of the Court
bar to the American Bar Association," for those claims "donot require review of a judicial decision in a particular case."

Id., at 487. The Court left open the question whether thedoctrine of res judicata foreclosed litigation of the elements
of the complaints spared from dismissal for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Id., at 487-488.

Since Feldman, this Court has never applied RookerFeldman to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction. Thefew decisions that have mentioned Rooker and Feldman

have done so only in passing or to explain why those casesdid not dictate dismissal. See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public
Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 644, n. 3 (2002) (Rooker-Feldman does not apply to a suit seeking review of state
agency action); Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1005-1006 (1994) (Rooker-Feldman bars a losing party in state
court "from seeking what in substance would be appellatereview of the state judgment in a United States district
court, based on the losing party's claim that the state judg-ment itself violates the loser's federal rights," but the doctrine has no application to a federal suit brought by a non-party to the state suit.);

Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356,369-370, n. 16 (1990) (citing Rooker and Feldman for "the

rule that a federal district court cannot entertain an originalaction alleging that a state court violated the Constitution
by giving effect to an unconstitutional state statute");ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 622-623 (1989) (If,
instead of seeking review of an adverse state supreme courtdecision in the Supreme Court, petitioners sued in federal

would "represent a partial inroad on Rooker-Feldman's con-struction of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257.");

Stevens, J., dissenting) (it would beanomalous to allow courts to sit in review of judgments entered by courts of equal, or greater, authority (citing Rookerand

ASARCO, the petitioners (defendants below in the state-court action)
sought review in this Court of the Arizona Supreme Court's invalidation
of a state statute governing mineral leases on state lands. 490 U. S., at
610. This Court dismissed the suggestion of the United States that the
petitioners should have pursued their claim as a new action in federal
district court. Such an action, we said, "in essence, would be an attempt
to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the
lower federal courts" in contravention of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257. 490 U. S., at
622-623. The injury of which the petitioners (the losing parties in state
court) could have complained in the hypothetical federal suit would have
been caused by the state court's invalidation of their mineral leases, and
the relief they would have sought would have been to undo the state
court's invalidation of the statute. The hypothetical suit in ASARCO,
therefore, shares the characteristics of the suits in Rooker and Feldman,
i. e., loser in state court invites federal district court to overturn statecourt judgment.

3 Between 1923, when the Court decided Rooker, and 1983, when it decided Feldman, the Court cited Rooker in one opinion, Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S. 275, 283 (1946), in reference to the
finality of prior judgments. See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S.

judgment] would be an effective and conclusive adjudication."). Rooker's

II
In 1980, two subsidiaries of petitioner Exxon Mobil Corpo-ration (then the separate companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil

Corp.) formed joint ventures with respondent Saudi BasicIndustries Corp. (SABIC) to produce polyethylene in Saudi
Arabia. 194 F. Supp. 2d 378, 384 (NJ 2002). Two decadeslater, the parties began to dispute royalties that SABIC had
charged the joint ventures for sublicenses to a polyethylenemanufacturing method. 364 F. 3d 102, 103 (CA3 2004).

SABIC preemptively sued the two ExxonMobil subsidiar-ies in Delaware Superior Court in July 2000 seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalty charges were proper underthe joint venture agreements. 194 F. Supp. 2d, at 385-386.
About two weeks later, ExxonMobil and its subsidiariescountersued SABIC in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey, alleging that SABIC overchargedthe joint ventures for the sublicenses. Id., at 385; App. 3.
ExxonMobil invoked subject-matter jurisdiction in the NewJersey action under 28 U. S. C. $ 1330, which authorizes district courts to adjudicate actions against foreign states. 194F. Supp. 2d, at 401.

4

In January 2002, the ExxonMobil subsidiaries answeredSABIC's state-court complaint, asserting as counterclaims

the same claims ExxonMobil had made in the federal suit inNew Jersey. 364 F. 3d, at 103. The state suit went to trial
in March 2003, and the jury returned a verdict of over $400million in favor of the ExxonMobil subsidiaries.

Co., 866 A. 2d 1, 11 (Del. 2005). SABIC appealed the judg-ment entered on the verdict to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Opinion of the Court
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq.
(2000 ed. and Supp. II). The Federal District Court denied
SABIC's motion to dismiss. 194 F. Supp. 2d, at 401-407,
416-417. SABIC took an interlocutory appeal, and the
Court of Appeals heard argument in December 2003, over
eight months after the state-court jury verdict. 364 F. 3d,
at 103-104.5

The Court of Appeals, on its own motion, raised the question whether "subject matter jurisdiction over this case fails
under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because ExxonMobil's
claims have already been litigated in state court." Id., at
104.6 The court did not question the District Court's possession of subject-matter jurisdiction at the outset of the suit,
but held that federal jurisdiction terminated when the Delaware Superior Court entered judgment on the jury verdict.
Id., at 104-105. The court rejected ExxonMobil's argument
that Rooker-Feldman could not apply because ExxonMobil
filed its federal complaint well before the state-court judgment. The only relevant consideration, the court stated, "is
whether the state judgment precedes a federal judgment on
the same claims." 364 F. 3d, at 105. If Rooker-Feldman
did not apply to federal actions filed prior to a state-court
judgment, the Court of Appeals worried, "we would be encouraging parties to maintain federal actions as `insurance
policies' while their state court claims were pending." 364
F. 3d, at 105. Once ExxonMobil's claims had been litigated
to a judgment in state court, the Court of Appeals held,

Delaware Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, on SABIC's motion, lifted
the stay and set the appeal for argument. Id., at 11-13.

6 One day before argument, the Court of Appeals directed the parties to

be prepared to address whether the Rooker-Feldman doctrine deprived
the District Court of jurisdiction over the case. App. 17.

from proceeding." 364 F. 3d, at 104 (internal quotationmarks omitted).

ExxonMobil, at that point prevailing in Delaware, was notseeking to overturn the state-court judgment. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals hypothesized that, if SABIC wonon appeal in Delaware, ExxonMobil would be endeavoring in
the federal action to "invalidate" the state-court judgment,"the very situation," the court concluded, "contemplated by
Rooker-Feldman's `inextricably intertwined' bar." Id., at106.

We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. 924 (2004), to resolve con-flict among the Courts of Appeals over the scope of the
Rooker-Feldman doctrine. We now reverse the judgmentof the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Rooker and Feldman exhibit the limited circumstances inwhich this Court's appellate jurisdiction over state-court

judgments, 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, precludes a United States dis-trict court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an
action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate undera congressional grant of authority, e. g., $ 1330 (suits against
foreign states), $ 1331 (federal question), and $ 1332 (diver-sity). In both cases, the losing party in state court filed suit
in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complain-ing of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and
seeking review and rejection of that judgment. Plaintiffs inboth cases, alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon

Court has affirmed the trial-court judgment in favor of ExxonMobil, Saudi

Opinion of the Court
the District Court to overturn an injurious state-court judgment. Because $ 1257, as long interpreted, vests authority
to review a state court's judgment solely in this Court, e. g.,
Feldman, 460 U. S., at 476; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v.
Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 286 (1970); Rooker, 263
U. S., at 416, the District Courts in Rooker and Feldman
lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. See Verizon Md. Inc.,
535 U. S., at 644, n. 3 ("The Rooker-Feldman doctrine merely
recognizes that 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 is a grant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts to exercise
appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which
Congress has reserved to this Court, see $ 1257(a).").8

When there is parallel state and federal litigation,
Rooker-Feldman is not triggered simply by the entry of
judgment in state court. This Court has repeatedly held
that "the pendency of an action in the state court is no bar
to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal
court having jurisdiction." McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S.
268, 282 (1910); accord Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S.
922, 928 (1975); Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 398 U. S., at 295.
Comity or abstention doctrines may, in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the state-court litigation.
See, e. g., Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v.
United States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976); Younger v. Harris, 401
U. S. 37 (1971); Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315 (1943);
Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496
(1941). But neither Rooker nor Feldman supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes
if a state court reaches judgment on the same or related
question while the case remains sub judice in a federal court.

8 Congress, if so minded, may explicitly empower district courts to oversee certain state-court judgments and has done so, most notably, in authorizing federal habeas review of state prisoners' petitions. 28 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court
Disposition of the federal action, once the state-court adju-dication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law.

The Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1738, originallyenacted in 1790, ch. 11, 1 Stat. 122, requires the federal court
to "give the same preclusive effect to a state-court judgmentas another court of that State would give."

Parsons Steel,
Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, 474 U. S. 518, 523 (1986); accord
Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367,373 (1996);

Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 380-381 (1985). Preclusion, ofcourse, is not a jurisdictional matter. See Fed. Rule Civ.

Proc. 8(c) (listing res judicata as an affirmative defense). In
parallel litigation, a federal court may be bound to recognize
the claim- and issue-preclusive effects of a state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate automatically on the entry of judgment in the state
court.

Nor does $ 1257 stop a district court from exercising
subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts
to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in
state court. If a federal plaintiff "present[s] some independent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that
a state court has reached in a case to which he was a
party . . . , then there is jurisdiction and state law determines
whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion." GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont, 995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7
1993); accord Noel v. Hall, 341 F. 3d 1148, 1163-1164 (CA9
2003).

This case surely is not the "paradigm situation in which
Rooker-Feldman precludes a federal district court from proceeding." 364 F. 3d, at 104 (quoting E. B. v. Verniero, 119
F. 3d 1077, 1090-1091 (CA3 1997)). ExxonMobil plainly has
not repaired to federal court to undo the Delaware judgment
in its favor. Rather, it appears ExxonMobil filed suit in Federal District Court (only two weeks after SABIC filed in
Delaware and well before any judgment in state court) to

from exercising jurisdiction when ExxonMobil filed the fed-eral action, and it did not emerge to vanquish jurisdiction

suit as an "insurance policy" against an adverse result in state court. 364
F. 3d 102, 105-106 (CA3 2004). There is nothing necessarily inappropriate, however, about filing a protective action. See, e. g., Rhines v. Weber,

claims in state court); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Department of Revenue of
Ore., 920 F. 2d 581, 584, and n. 9 (CA9 1990) (noting that the railroad
company had filed protective actions in state court to prevent expiration
of the state statute of limitations); Government of Virgin Islands v.

by plaintiffs "to protect themselves" in the event that personal jurisdiction
over the defendants failed in the United States District Court for the
Virgin Islands); see also England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners,

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 03-9685. Argued January 18, 2005--Decided April 4, 2005
Following petitioner Johnson's 1994 guilty plea on a federal drug charge,

the District Court gave him an enhanced sentence as a career offender
under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on two prior Georgia
drug convictions. On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he
should not have received an enhanced sentence because one of the predicate Georgia convictions was invalid, but the Eleventh Circuit affirmed
his sentence and this Court denied certiorari. Two days later, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) went into
effect, imposing, among other things, a 1-year statute of limitations on
motions by prisoners seeking to modify their federal sentences. The
1-year period runs from the latest of four alternative dates, the last of
which is "the date on which the facts supporting the claim . . . could
have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence," 28 U. S. C.

$ 2255, || 6(4). A fifth option supplied by the Courts of Appeals gave
prisoners whose convictions became final before AEDPA a 1-year grace
period running from that statute's effective date. On April 25, 1997,
one year and three days after his pre-AEDPA federal conviction became
final and just after the 1-year grace period expired, Johnson pro se filed
a motion in the District Court for an extension of time to attack his
federal sentence under $ 2255. Finding the AEDPA period expired, the
court denied the motion, but without prejudice to Johnson's right to file
a $ 2255 motion claiming any alternative limitation period under the
statute. On February 6, 1998, Johnson filed a habeas petition in a Georgia state court, claiming the constitutional invalidity of his guilty pleas
in seven cases, one of which was the basis for one of the convictions on
which his federal sentence enhancement rested. Some three months
after the state court entered an order of vacatur reversing all seven
convictions, Johnson filed pro se a $ 2255 motion to vacate his enhanced
federal sentence in light of the state-court vacatur. He claimed, in effect, that his motion was timely because the order vacating the state
judgment constituted previously undiscoverable "facts supporting the
claim" that triggered a renewed limitation period under $ 2255, || 6(4).
Although Johnson asserted that lack of education excused him from acting more promptly, and that he had filed the state petition as soon as
he could get help from an inmate law clerk, the District Court denied

296 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
the motion as untimely. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that
the state-court vacatur order was not a "fact" discovered by Johnson
under the fourth paragraph of the $ 2255 limitation rule, but was more
properly classified as a legal proposition or a court action obtained at
Johnson's behest.

Held: In a case in which a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since been vacated, $ 2255, || 6(4)'s 1-year limitation period
begins to run when the petitioner receives notice of the order vacating
the prior conviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligence
in state court after entry of judgment in the federal case in which the
sentence was enhanced. Pp. 302-311.

(a) This Court agrees with Johnson that the state-court order vacating his prior conviction is a matter of "fact" supporting his $ 2255 claim,
discovery of which triggers the refreshed 1-year limitation period under
the fourth paragraph. By pegging that period to notice of the state
order eliminating the predicate required for enhancement, which is almost always necessary and always sufficient for relief, Johnson's argument improves on the Government's proposal that the relevant "facts"
are those on which Johnson based his challenge to the validity of his
state convictions. Moreover, Johnson's argument is not vulnerable to
the Eleventh Circuit's point that an order vacating a conviction is legally
expressive or operative language that may not be treated as a matter
of fact within the statute's meaning. This Court commonly speaks of
the "fact of a prior conviction," e. g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S.
466, 490, and an order vacating a predicate conviction is spoken of as a
fact just as sensibly as the order entering it. In either case, a claim of
such a fact is subject to proof or disproof like any other factual issue.
Nevertheless, Johnson's take on the statute does carry anomalies, one
minor, one more serious. It is strange to say that an order vacating a
conviction has been "discovered," the term used by paragraph four, and
stranger still to speak about the date on which it could have been discovered with due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of a
proceeding in which the $ 2255 petitioner was the moving party. The
more serious problem is Johnson's position that his $ 2255 petition is
timely under paragraph four as long as he brings it within a year of
learning he succeeded in attacking the prior conviction, no matter how
long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding.
Neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to justify rejecting Johnson's basic argument. The Court's job here is to find a sensible way to
apply paragraph four when AEDPA's drafters probably never thought
about the present situation. The answer to the question of how to im544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

plement the statutory mandate that a petitioner act with "due diligence"
in discovering the crucial fact of a vacatur order that he himself seeks
is that he take prompt action as soon as he is in a position to realize
that he has an interest in challenging the prior conviction with its potential to enhance the later sentence. The particular time when the course
of the later federal prosecution clearly shows that diligence is in order
is the date of judgment. After the entry of judgment, the $ 2255 claim's
subject has come into being, the significance of inaction is clear, and
very little litigation would be wasted, since most challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained. Thus, from the date the District Court
entered judgment in his federal case, Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.
Had he done so, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the
date he received notice of that vacatur. Pp. 302-310.

(b) However, Johnson did not show due diligence in seeking the
state-court order vacating his predicate conviction. Although he knew
the conviction subjected him to the enhancement, he failed to attack it
by filing his state habeas petition until more than three years after
entry of judgment in the federal case. Indeed, even if this Court moved
the burden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federal conviction or to AEDPA's effective date two days later, Johnson would still
have delayed unreasonably, having waited over 21 months. Johnson
has offered no explanation for this delay, beyond that he was acting
pro se and lacked the sophistication to understand the procedures. But
the Court has never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural
ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statute's clear
policy calls for promptness. On this record, Johnson fell far short of
reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction. Since there is
every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced a state
vacatur order well over a year before he filed his $ 2255 petition, the
fourth paragraph of $ 2255 is unavailable, and Johnson does not suggest
that his motion was timely under any other provision. P. 311.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question here is when the 1-year statute of limitations
in 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, || 6(4), begins to run in a case of a prison-er's collateral attack on his federal sentence on the ground

that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence hassince been vacated. We hold that the period begins when
a petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the priorconviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligence
in state court, after entry of judgment in the federal casewith the enhanced sentence.

I
In 1994, petitioner Robert Johnson, Jr., was indicted fordistributing cocaine base and related conspiracy. Following

his guilty plea to a single count of distribution in violationof 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1) and 18 U. S. C. $ 2, the presentence
investigation report recommended that Johnson receive anenhanced sentence as a career offender under $ 4B1.1 of the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines, owing to his two 1989 convic-tions by the State of Georgia for distributing cocaine. Without elaboration, Johnson filed an objection to the recommendation, which he withdrew at the sentencing hearing. TheDistrict Court imposed the enhancement and entered judgment on November 29, 1994.

On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he should
not have been sentenced as a career offender because one of

his Georgia convictions was invalid.1 The Court of Appealsfor the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the sentence, finding that

in the trial court Johnson had raised no objection to thevalidity of his prior convictions and that the judge's career
offender findings were not clearly erroneous. United Statesv. Johnson, No. 94-9402 (Dec. 22, 1995) (per curiam), App.

We denied certiorari. Johnson v. United States, 517 U. S.1162 (1996).

Two days later, the Antiterrorism and Effective DeathPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) went into effect, imposing,
among other things, a 1-year period of limitations on motionsby prisoners seeking to modify their federal sentences:

added that denial was without prejudice to Johnson's right tofile a $ 2255 motion claiming any alternative limitation period
under the statute.On February 6, 1998, Johnson petitioned for writ of habeas
corpus in the Superior Court of Wayne County, Georgia,claiming the invalidity of his guilty pleas in seven cases between 1983 and 1993 because he had not knowingly, intelli-gently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. One of

Opinion of the Court
the 1989 convictions on which the District Court had restedthe career offender enhancement of Johnson's federal sentence.3 The State of Georgia denied Johnson's allegations,but filed no hearing transcripts. The Superior Court found
that the records did "not show an affirmative waiver of[Johnson's] right to an attorney" in any of the cases, App. 10,
and entered an order of vacatur, that all seven convictionsbe reversed,

ibid.Just over three months later, Johnson was back in the Federal District Court pro se with a motion under $ 2255 to va-cate the enhanced federal sentence following the vacatur of
one of its predicate state convictions. He claimed his motionwas timely because the order vacating the state judgment
was "new evidence" not previously discoverable, and so thetrigger of a renewed limitation period. The Magistrate
Judge took Johnson to be relying on the discovery of "factssupporting the claim" addressed in $ 2255, || 6(4), but still recommended denial of the motion for failure on Johnson's partto exercise the "due diligence" required by that provision.
Id., at 15-17. Although Johnson objected that lack of educa-tion excused him from acting more promptly, and that he had
filed the state petition as soon as he could get help from aninmate law clerk, the District Court denied the $ 2255 motion
as untimely. In the court's view, the applicable limitationwas the 1-year grace period that was over in April 1997,
which Johnson had done nothing to toll in the 21 months hewaited after his conviction became final before filing his state
habeas petition. Id., at 19.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 340

without having first resorted to state court. See infra, at 304.

Opinion of the Court
a " `fact' " under the fourth paragraph of the $ 2255 limita-tion rule. Id., at 1223. In the majority's view, the statecourt order was properly classified as a "legal proposition"or a "court action obtained at the behest of a federal prisoner, not `discovered' by him." Ibid. Because the fourthparagraph of the limitation rule was therefore of no avail to
Johnson, the Court of Appeals majority agreed with the Dis-trict Court that the time for filing expired in 1997, at the end
of the 1-year grace period. Id., at 1226. The majority alsoagreed that Johnson had no equitable claim to toll the running of the 1-year period because he had waited too longbefore going back to the state court.

Id., at 1226-1228.Judge Roney dissented, arguing that the state court's order

was a "fact" supporting Johnson's $ 2255 motion, a fact notdiscoverable prior to the order's issuance. Id., at 1228-1229.
Over one dissent, rehearing en banc was denied. 353 F. 3d1328 (2003).

We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 965 (2004), to resolve adisagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether
vacatur of a prior state conviction used to enhance a federalsentence can start the 1-year limitation period under the
fourth alternative of the $ 2255 rule. Compare 340 F. 3d1219 (case below) (vacatur not a trigger);

Brackett v. UnitedStates, 270 F. 3d 60 (CA1 2001) (same), with United States v.

Gadsen, 332 F. 3d 224 (CA4 2003) (vacatur a fact not pre-viously discoverable giving rise to a new 1-year period).

We agree with Johnson that the state-court vacatur is amatter of fact for purposes of the limitation rule in the fourth
paragraph. But we also hold that the statute allows the factof the state-court order to set the 1-year period running only
if the petitioner has shown due diligence in seeking theorder. Applying that qualification, we affirm.

Opinion of the Court
federal resentencing now that the State has vacated one ofthe judgments supporting his enhanced sentence. Neither

the enhancement provision of the Sentencing Guidelines ap-plied here, nor the mandatory enhancement under the
Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e), hasbeen read to mean that the validity of a prior conviction supporting an enhanced federal sentence is beyond challenge.
Cf. Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980) (validity ofprior conviction irrelevant under federal statute prohibiting

possession of a firearm by a felon). Our cases applyingthese provisions assume the contrary, that a defendant given
a sentence enhanced for a prior conviction is entitled to a
reduction if the earlier conviction is vacated. Custis v.
United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994); Daniels v. United States,
532 U. S. 374 (2001).

Such was the premise in Custis v. United States, supra,
even though we held that the ACCA generally created no
opportunity to attack a prior state conviction collaterally at
a federal sentencing proceeding, 511 U. S., at 490, and that
the Constitution demands no more, id., at 496-497. We
thought that Congress had not meant to make it so easy to
challenge final judgments that every occasion to enhance a
sentence for recidivism would turn a federal sentencing
court into a forum for difficult and time-consuming reexaminations of stale state proceedings. Ibid. We recognized
only one exception to this rule that collateral attacks were
off-limits, and that was for challenges to state convictions
allegedly obtained in violation of the right to appointed counsel, an exception we thought necessary to avoid undermining
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). Custis v.
United States, 511 U. S., at 494-496. As to challenges falling outside of that exception, we pointed out that a defendant
who successfully attacked his state conviction in state court
or on federal habeas review could then "apply for reopening
of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences."
Id., at 497.

304 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Daniels v. United States, supra, extended Custis to hold,subject to the same exception for

Gideon claims, that a
federal prisoner may not attack a predicate state convictionthrough a $ 2255 motion challenging an enhanced federal

sentence, 532 U. S., at 376, and again we stressed considera-tions of administration and finality,

id., at 378-380. Again,
too, we acknowledged that a prisoner could proceed under

$ 2255 after successful review of the prior state convictionon federal habeas under $ 2254 or favorable resort to any

postconviction process available under state law, id., at 381.We simply added that if the prior conviction was no longer
open to direct or collateral attack in its own right, the federalprisoner could do nothing more about his sentence enhancement. Id., at 382.4This case presents the distinct issue of how soon a prisoner, successful in his state proceeding, must challenge thefederal sentence under $ 2255. The resolution turns on understanding what "facts" affecting an enhanced sentence
could most sensibly fall within that term as used in the
fourth paragraph of the $ 2255 limitation provision, under
which the one year runs from "the date on which the facts
supporting the claim or claims presented could have been
discovered through the exercise of due diligence." Johnson
says that the order vacating his prior conviction is the factual matter supporting his $ 2255 claim, discovery of which
triggers the refreshed 1-year period. The Court of Appeals
majority said no because it understood a legally operative
order of vacatur to be a mandate of law or a consequence of
applying law, and therefore distinct from a matter of " `fact' "

4 The Daniels Court allowed that "there may be rare cases in which no
channel of review was actually available to a defendant with respect to a
prior conviction, due to no fault of his own," in which case a prisoner might
be able to use a motion under $ 2255 to challenge the prior conviction as
well as the federal sentence based on it. 532 U. S., at 383-384. As in
Daniels, the circumstances of this case do not call for further exploration
of that possibility.

Opinion of the Court
as Congress used the term in $ 2255. 340 F. 3d, at 1223.The United States does not endorse that law-fact distinction,

but argues that the facts supporting Johnson's $ 2255 claim,for purposes of the fourth paragraph, are the facts on which
he based his challenge to the validity of his state convictions.We think none of these positions is sound, at least in its
entirety. As for the Government's proposed reading, certainly it is true that the circumstances rendering the under-lying predicate conviction invalid are ultimate subjects of

fact supporting the $ 2255 claim, in the sense that proof ofthose facts (or the government's failure to negate them) is
necessary to vacate the prior state conviction and eliminate
the ground for the federal enhancement. But this is not
enough to fit the Government's position comfortably into
paragraph four. The text of $ 2255, || 6(4), clearly links the
running of the limitation period to the discovery of the "facts
supporting the claim or claims presented," but on the Government's view, the statute of limitations may begin to run
(and may even expire) before the $ 2255 claim and its necessary predicate even exist. Prior to the federal conviction, a
petitioner has no $ 2255 claim because he has no enhanced
federal sentence to challenge; and prior to the state vacatur,
which Daniels makes a necessary condition for relief in most
cases, a petitioner cannot obtain relief under $ 2255. Cf. Bay
Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.
Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 195 (1997) (statutes of
limitations ordinarily do not begin to run until a plaintiff 's
complete cause of action has accrued). Hence, it is highly
doubtful that in $ 2255 challenges to enhanced sentences
Congress would have meant to start the period running
under paragraph four on the discoverability date of facts that
may have no significance under federal law for years to come
and that cannot by themselves be the basis of a $ 2255 claim,
Daniels v. United States, supra, at 376.

There are further reasons against applying the fourth
paragraph as the Government would. Congress does not

306 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
appear to have adopted a policy of enhancing federal sen-tences regardless of the validity of state convictions relied

on for the enhancement. Custis and Daniels were decidedon just the contrary, and unchallenged, understanding; it
would certainly push the limits of coherence for the Courtnow to apply the fourth paragraph in a way that would practically close the door to relief that each of those cases spe-cifically left open.

5 Nor is there any reason to think Congress meant the limitation period to run earlier for the sakeof preserving finality of state convictions; States are capable

of providing their own limitations periods (and most of themwould have barred Johnson's challenge).

6

Johnson's argument improves on the Government's pro-posal by pegging the limitation period to notice of the state

order eliminating the predicate required for enhancement,which is almost always necessary and always sufficient for
relief. We do not find his proposal vulnerable to the pointmade by the majority of the Court of Appeals, that an order
vacating a conviction is legally expressive or operative lan-guage that may not be treated as a matter of fact within the
meaning of the statute. We commonly speak of the "fact of

5 It is also doubtful that Congress meant the federal limitation period to
begin running, let alone expire, at a time when a typical state convict
will have no inducement under federal law to act. On the Government's
reading, in fact, a defendant could be obligated to act at a time when he
had no real incentive for questioning the state conviction. Many of those
convictions that in time become predicates for enhancing later sentences
are, like the one here, the consequences of guilty pleas entered on terms
defendants are willing to accept. Thus, a federal limitation rule obligating a defendant to turn around and attack a state guilty plea he has just
entered would in practice place most predicate convictions beyond challenge as a matter of federal law.

6 At the time Johnson filed his state habeas petition, Georgia law would

have permitted him to wait indefinitely before seeking reversal of his 1989
convictions. The Georgia Legislature amended the state habeas statute
in 2004 to create a 4-year statute of limitations for petitions for writs of
habeas corpus. Ga. Code Ann. $ 9-14-42 (Lexis Supp. 2004).

Opinion of the Court
a prior conviction," e. g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S.
466, 490 (2000), and an order vacating a predicate conviction
is spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order entering
it. In either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proof
or disproof like any other factual issue.

But Johnson's take on the statute carries anomalies of its
own, one minor, one more serious. It is strange to say that
an order vacating a conviction has been "discovered," the
term used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speak
about the date on which it could have been discovered with
due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of a
proceeding in which the $ 2255 petitioner was the moving
party. By bringing that proceeding, the petitioner causes
the factual event to occur, after all, and unless his mail goes
astray his prompt discovery of the crucial fact is virtually
guaranteed through official notice.

A more serious problem is Johnson's position that his

$ 2255 petition is timely under paragraph four as long as he
brings it within a year of learning he succeeded in attacking
the prior conviction, no matter how long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding. If Johnson
were right about this, a petitioner might wait a long time
before raising any question about a predicate conviction, as
this very case demonstrates. Of course it may well be that
Johnson took his time because his basic sentence had years
to run before the period of enhancement began. But letting
a petitioner wait for as long as the enhancement makes no
difference to his actual imprisonment, while the predicate
conviction grows increasingly stale and the federal outcome
is subject to question, is certainly at odds with the provision
in paragraph four that the one year starts running when the
operative fact "could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence." And by maximizing the time that
judgments are open to question, a rule allowing that kind
of delay would thwart one of AEDPA's principal purposes,

308 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S., at 179; Woodford v. Garceau,538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003), a purpose that was also central to

our decisions in Custis and Daniels, see supra, at 303-304.We think neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to
justify rejecting Johnson's basic argument that notice of theorder vacating the predicate conviction is the event that
starts the one year running. Our job here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when the truth is that with
Daniels not yet on the books AEDPA's drafters probably
never thought about the situation we face here. Of courseit is peculiar to speak of "discovering" the fact of the very

eventuality the petitioner himself has brought about, but
when that fact is necessary to the $ 2255 claim, and treating
notice of it as the trigger produces a more reasonable scheme
than the alternatives, the scheme should be reconciled with
the statutory language if it can be. And here the fit is painless, if short on style.

While it sounds odd to speak of discovering a fact one has
generated, a petitioner does not generate the fact of vacatur
all by himself. He does, after all, have to learn of the court's
response in the state proceeding, and receiving notice of success can surely qualify as a kind of discovery falling within
the statutory language.

That leaves us with the question of how to implement the
statutory mandate that a petitioner act with due diligence in
discovering the crucial fact of the vacatur order that he himself seeks. The answer is that diligence can be shown by
prompt action on the part of the petitioner as soon as he is
in a position to realize that he has an interest in challenging
the prior conviction with its potential to enhance the later
sentence. The important thing is to identify a particular
time when the course of the later federal prosecution clearly
shows that diligence is in order. That might be the date the
federal indictment is disclosed, the date of judgment, or the
date of finality after direct appeal. Picking the first date
would require the quickest response and serve finality best,

Opinion of the Court
but it would produce some collateral litigation that federalacquittals would prove to have been needless, and it shares

the same disconnection from the existence of a $ 2255 claimas the Government's view of the relevant "facts," see supra,
at 305-306. If we picked the third date, collateral litigationwould be minimized, but finality would come late. This
shapes up as a case for choosing the bowl of porridge be-tween the one too hot and the one too cold, and settling on
the date of judgment as the moment to activate due diligenceseems best to reflect the statutory text and its underlying
concerns. After the entry of judgment, the subject of the

$ 2255 claim has come into being, the significance of inactionis clear, and very little litigation would be wasted, since most

challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.The dissent, like Johnson, would dispense with any due
diligence requirement in seeking the state vacatur orderitself, on the ground that the States can impose their own
limitations periods on state collateral attacks, as most Statesdo,

post, at 316 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). But the United
States has an interest in the finality of sentences imposed by
its own courts; $ 2255 is, after all, concerned directly withfederal cases. As to those federal cases, due diligence is not

a "requirement of [our] own design," post, at 312, but an ex-plicit demand in the text of $ 2255, || 6(4), one that reflects
AEDPA's core purposes, supra, at 307-308. The require-ment of due diligence must therefore demand something
more than the dissent's willingness to accept no diligence atall, if the predicate conviction occurred in a State that itself imposes no limit of time for collaterally attacking itsconvictions.

7

7 Certainly, as the dissent notes, post, at 318-319, "due diligence" is an
inexact measure of how much delay is too much. But the imprecision here
is no greater than elsewhere in the law when diligence must be shown, and
the statute's use of an imprecise standard is no justification for depriving
the statutory language of any meaning independent of corresponding state
law, as the dissent would have us do. Post, at 319.

310 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The dissent suggests that due diligence is satisfied byprompt discovery of the existence of the order vacating the

state conviction. Post, at 314. Where one "discovers" afact that one has helped to generate, however, supra, at 308-
309, whether it be the result of a court proceeding or of someother process begun at the petitioner's behest, it does not
strain logic to treat required diligence in the "discovery" ofthat fact as entailing diligence in the steps necessary for the
existence of that fact. To see why this is so, one need onlyconsider a more commonplace use of the paragraph four limitation rule. When a petitioner bases his $ 2255 claim on theresult of a DNA test, it is the result of the test that is
the "fac[t] supporting the claim" in the $ 2255 motion, and the1-year limitation period therefore begins to run from the
date the test result is "discovered." Yet unless it is to beread out of the statute, the due diligence requirement would
say that the test result only triggers a new 1-year periodif the petitioner began the testing process with reasonable
promptness once the DNA sample and testing technologywere available. Under the dissent's view, however, the petitioner could wait untold years (perhaps until the death of akey prosecution witness) before calling for the DNA test, yet
once he "discovered" the result of that test, he would get thebenefit of a rejuvenated 1-year period regardless of his
lengthy delay. Such a result simply cannot be squared withthe statute's plain text and purpose.

We accordingly apply the fourth paragraph in the situationbefore us by holding that from November 29, 1994, the date
the District Court entered judgment in his federal case,Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the statecourt order vacating his predicate conviction. Had he doneso, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the date
he received notice of that vacatur.8

8 Once a petitioner diligently has initiated state-court proceedings, any
delay in those proceedings that is not attributable to the petitioner will
not impair the availability of the paragraph four limitation rule, once those

Opinion of the Court

III
Although Johnson knew that his conviction subjected him
to the career offender enhancement, he failed to attack the
predicate for enhancement by filing his state habeas petition
until February 1998, more than three years after entry of
judgment in the federal case. Indeed, even if we moved the
burden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federal
conviction or to AEDPA's effective date two days later, Johnson would still have delayed unreasonably, having waited
over 21 months. Johnson has offered no explanation for this
delay, beyond observing that he was acting pro se and lacked
the sophistication to understand the procedures. But we
have never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when
a statute's clear policy calls for promptness, and on this record we think Johnson fell far short of reasonable diligence in
challenging the state conviction. Since there is every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced a
state vacatur order well over a year before he filed his $ 2255
petition, the fourth paragraph of $ 2255 is unavailable, and
Johnson does not suggest that his motion was timely under
any other provision.

We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

It is so ordered.

proceedings finally conclude. We further recognize that the facts underlying the challenge to the state-court conviction might themselves not be
discoverable through the exercise of due diligence until after the date of
the federal judgment. In such circumstances, once the facts become discoverable and the prisoner proceeds diligently to state court, the limitation period will run from the date of notice of the eventual state-court
vacatur. Finally, we note that a petitioner who has been inadequately
diligent can still avail himself of paragraph four if he can show that he
filed the $ 2255 motion within a year of the date he would have received
notice of vacatur if he had acted promptly, though this may be a difficult
showing.

312 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court took this case to determine whether a vacatur
is a "fact," as that term is used in 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, || 6(4),
thus commencing the statute's 1-year limitations period.
The question divides the Courts of Appeals. Today the
Court holds that the order of vacatur is the fact that begins
the limitations period. On that point, I agree. Surprisingly, however, the Court proceeds to announce a second requirement of its own design: In order to obtain relief under

$ 2255, || 6(4), petitioner must show he used due diligence in
seeking the vacatur itself. On this point, I disagree.

In my view the Court's new rule of prevacatur diligence is
inconsistent with the statutory language; is unnecessary
since States are quite capable of protecting themselves
against undue delay in commencing state proceedings to vacate prior judgments; introduces an imprecise and incongruous deadline into the federal criminal process; is of sufficient
uncertainty that it will require further litigation before its
operation is understood; and, last but not least, drains scarce
defense resources away from the prisoner's federal criminal
case in some of its most critical stages. For these reasons,
I submit my respectful dissent.

I
The question on which we granted certiorari is this:
"When a federal court bases an enhanced sentence on a vacated state conviction, is the vacatur of the state conviction
a `fact' supporting a prisoner's 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 claim requiring reduction of the prisoner's sentence?" Pet. for Cert. i.
In a change from the position it took in the Court of Appeals,
the Government in its brief to this Court and again at oral
argument all but conceded that the vacatur is a fact supporting a claim. See Brief for United States 33; Tr. of Oral Arg.
13. Seeking a new rationale to imprison petitioner for an

Kennedy, J., dissenting
additional eight years on the basis of a prior Georgia convic-tion all of us know to be void, the Government defends the

Court of Appeals' judgment on an alternative ground: Fed-eral law requires diligence on the part of the defendant not
only in bringing the vacatur to the attention of the federalcourt but also in commencing state proceedings to obtain
the vacatur in the first place. According to the Government,
petitioner's diligence should be measured from the time apetitioner could have obtained a vacatur,

i. e., as soon as the
legal basis for vacatur existed. See Brief for United States32-34. Although the Court adopts the Government's argument in part, it comes up with a date of its own choosing
from which to measure a petitioner's diligence.

The Court is quite correct, in my view, to hold that the
state-court order of vacatur itself is the critical fact which
begins the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996's 1-year limitations period. $ 101, 110 Stat. 1217.
Ante, at 309. It is an accepted use of the law's vocabulary
to say that the entry or the setting aside of a judgment is a
fact. Ante, at 307. An order vacating a judgment is a
definite and significant fact of litigation history. So the
Court is on firm ground to say a state judgment of vacatur
begins the 1-year limitations period. Even aside from the
textual support for petitioner's position, our opinions in Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994), and Daniels v.
United States, 532 U. S. 374 (2001), were decided on the understanding that Congress did not expect federal sentences
to be enhanced irrespective of the validity of the state conviction relied upon for the enhancement. Ante, at 305-306.
Those cases suggest that the proper procedure for reducing
a federal sentence enhanced on the basis of an invalid state
conviction is to seek a vacatur of a state conviction, and then
proceed through federal habeas.

The Court is correct, too, to say that the whole problem of
vacating state-court judgments fits rather awkwardly into
the language of $ 2255, || 6(4). Ante, at 308. That is be544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cause || 6(4) is designed to address myriad claims, includingpost-trial factual discoveries such as violations of Brady v.

Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), witness recantations, new ex-culpatory evidence, and the like. Having gone this far, the
Court in my view should simply accept that $ 2255, || 6(4), isnot a particularly good fit with the vacatur problem.

The Court, however, does not accept the consequence ofits own correct determination. Instead it finds a need to
make the words "discovery" and "due diligence" more appli-cable to the instance of vacatur. Hence it adopts the second
requirement: "[W]e also hold that the statute allows the factof the state-court order to set the 1-year period running only
if the petitioner has shown due diligence in seeking theorder."

Ante, at 302. This added condition cannot be foundin the statute's design or in its text. It creates, furthermore, its own set of problems. Section 2255, || 6(4), neitherrequires nor accommodates the Court's federal rule of diligence respecting state-court proceedings.

II
The 1-year period begins from "the date on which the factssupporting the claim or claims presented could have been

discovered through the exercise of due diligence. " 28U. S. C. $ 2255, || 6(4). As the Court agrees that vacatur is
the fact which begins the 1-year period, it would seem tofollow that the diligence requirement pertains to presenting
the fact of vacatur to the federal court. A petitioner cannotdiscover the vacatur until it issues. If the State has allowed
the vacatur subject to its own rules respecting timely mo-tions or applications and if petitioner has acted diligently in
discovering entry of that vacatur, the proper conclusion isthat he may bring a $ 2255 petition within one year of obtaining the vacatur, or one year of reasonably discovering it.The only way the majority's construction can fit the statute is if the controlling fact is the circumstance giving riseto the vacatur, not the vacatur itself. Yet the majority re544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

315Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
sists that proposition, for it measures the 1-year period fromthe date the vacatur is ordered.

Ante, at 309.
The majority rejects petitioner's proposed construction ofthe "discovered through the exercise of due diligence" language, which I would adopt, for two reasons. First, theCourt observes it is "strange to say that an order vacating a
conviction has been `discovered,' . . . and stranger still to
speak about the date on which it could have been discoveredwith due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome

of a proceeding in which the $ 2255 petitioner was the movingparty."

Ante, at 307. By bringing vacatur proceedings,
petitioner himself causes the factual event to occur, and his
discovery of it is "virtually guaranteed." Ibid. The Court
is concerned that the due diligence language does barely any
work under petitioner's interpretation because the language
is too easily satisfied.

Though I agree it is a bit awkward, in my view it is well
within the realm of reasonable statutory construction to
apply the term "discover" to an order vacating a conviction.
The ordinary meaning of the term "discovery," after all, is
"the act, process, or an instance of gaining knowledge of or
ascertaining the existence of something previously unknown
or unrecognized." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 647 (1993). See also Black's Law Dictionary 465
(6th ed. 1990) ("[t]o get first sight or knowledge of "). There
may be instances when there is a mistake in recording or
entering the vacatur, or when it is not clear that the order
in fact includes that relief, or when a prisoner's transfer or
extradition reasonably causes the prisoner to learn of the
order in some uncommon way. In these instances, admittedly infrequent, the word "discover" makes perfect sense.
True, the due diligence language does not do much work
when a petitioner receives prompt notice in the ordinary
course. As explained, however, $ 2255, || 6(4), is designed to
cover various circumstances, and many other types of claims.
Ante, at 310.

544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
316 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
To bolster its prevacatur diligence requirement, the Courtelects to resolve a case not before it,

i. e., a hypothetical involving DNA testing. Ibid. Quite apart from the impro-priety of deciding an important question not remotely presented in the case, the Court's resolution of its hypotheticalis, in my view, far from self-evident. It has little to do,
moreover, with the question of vacatur of a state-court judgment. We have a special obligation to the federal systemto respect state-court judgments. Rather than imposing a

federal rule of diligence on top of existing state-court rulesfor determining when a vacatur motion should be made,
I would treat the critical fact as the date on which the state
court orders vacatur. That, after all, is the time when the
grounds for the claim to be made in federal court (the claim
that an enhancement was improper) have become established
under conventional principles commanding respect for state
judgments, or allowing them to be set aside.

The second reason the majority rejects Johnson's position
is because it is troubled by the prospect that a petitioner
"might wait a long time before raising any question about a
predicate conviction . . . ." Ante, at 307. Even if this concern were a sufficient basis for adding the majority's prevacatur diligence requirement to the statute and creating a
two-tier diligence structure, the concern is overstated. In
most instances, States can, and do, impose diligence by limiting the time for requesting a vacatur of a prior state conviction. It was represented at oral argument that all but about
six States impose a limitation by statute or laches. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 10. Even in those six States, furthermore, it is
not clear that equitable defenses would not apply. Id., at
17-18.

Any States that do not impose time limitations are free to
do so if deemed necessary to protect the integrity of their
own judgments, so a federal time limit is not required. This
is illustrated by the instant case. When Johnson sought
state relief, Georgia imposed no limitation on a petitioner's

544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

317Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
ability to obtain a vacatur. Ante, at 306, n. 5. Since then,however, Georgia has enacted a 4-year limitations period for

proceeding to obtain a vacatur. The majority's apparentconcern that, absent its interpretation of $ 2255, || 6(4), petitioners have some incentive to delay proceedings to vacate aconviction seems quite unfounded.

The majority's construction, furthermore, can allow for the
same delay it seeks to avoid. After all, the Court holds thatthe due diligence requirement is triggered only by a federal

judgment. Consider a simple hypothetical. Suppose that apetitioner suffers a state conviction in 1980, and, despite
learning in 1985 that his conviction is constitutionally infirm,
does nothing. Suppose further he is sentenced for a federal
crime in 2000. Under the majority's view, the petitioner's
obligation to question his state conviction is not triggered
until 2000, a full 15 years after he knew the basis for vacatur.
Despite the adaptation it makes to $ 2255, || 6(4), the majority has failed to create an incentive for petitioner to act
promptly in instituting state proceedings. The incentive exists under state law, and the Court does not need to supplement it.

The error of the majority's position is further revealed by
its selection of what I consider to be an incorrect date for
triggering the prevacatur diligence requirement. It holds
that the triggering event is set at the date of petitioner's
federal judgment. Ante, at 310 (setting November 29, 1994,
the date of judgment, as the date triggering the diligence
requirement).

This rule of the Court's own contrivance is adopted, in my
respectful submission, without full appreciation for the dynamic of the criminal process and its demands on counsel.
Assuming for the moment that some event in the federal
court should start the time period for pursuing state relief,
surely the entry of judgment is ill chosen. This means the
judgment is a mandatory beginning point for collateral proceedings to correct a judgment and sentence not yet final.

318 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
If the Court wants to invent its own rule and use an eventin the federal criminal proceeding to commence a limitations

period (and I disagree with both propositions), the date thejudgment becomes final, not the date of judgment in the trial
court, is the proper point of beginning.The law, and the decisions of this Court, put extraordinary
demands on defense counsel. Immediately after a judgment, defense counsel must concentrate on ensuring thatevidence of trial misconduct does not disappear and that

grounds for appeal are preserved and presented. Today theCourt says defense counsel must divert scarce resources
from these heavy responsibilities to commence collateral proceedings to attack state convictions.

In this case seven different convictions in Georgia may
have been relevant. In other cases convictions that might
enhance have been entered in different States. See, e. g.,
Custis, 511 U. S., at 487. It is most troubling for a Court
that insists on high standards of performance for defense
counsel now to instruct that collateral proceedings must be
commenced in one or more States during the critical time
immediately after judgment and before appeal.

If the Court is to insist upon its own second tier of diligence, the dynamics of the criminal system and ordinary
rules for determining when collateral proceedings become
necessary should instruct us that, for federal purposes, this
tier begins when the federal conviction becomes final. This
also ensures that the federal court does not make demands
on counsel and on state courts that are pointless if the federal conviction is overturned. Perhaps the Court rejects
the date of final judgment as triggering its requirement because it adds little to the state requirements of diligence. If
this surmise is correct, of course, it demonstrates that the
Court should not adopt its interpretation in the first place.

Aside from diverting resources from a petitioner's federal
case, the majority's approach creates new uncertainty, giving
rise to future litigation. It leaves unsaid what standard will

Kennedy, J., dissenting
be used for measuring whether a petitioner acted promptly,forcing litigants and lawyers to scramble to state court in

the hopes they satisfy the Court's vague prevacatur diligencerequirement. The Court tells us nothing about what to
make of existing state standards regarding diligence. As-sume a State has a 4-year limitations period for bringing a
vacatur action and a petitioner acts within two years of hisstate conviction. Do we look to state law as a benchmark
for what should be presumed to be diligent? The murkinessof the Court's new rule will set in motion satellite litigation
on this and related points.In lieu of adopting an interpretation that creates more
problems than it avoids, I would hold that the order vacatinga prior state conviction is the fact supporting a $ 2255 claim,
and the statute is satisfied if the $ 2255 proceeding is com-menced within one year of its entry, unless the petitioner
shows it was not reasonably discovered until later in whichcase that date will control when the statute begins to run.
For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.

320 OCTOBER TERM, 2004

Syllabus

ROUSEY et ux. v. JACOWAY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 03-1407. Argued December 1, 2004--Decided April 4, 2005
Several years after petitioners deposited distributions from their pension

plans into Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), they filed a joint petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. They sought to shield
portions of their IRAs from their creditors by claiming them as exempt
from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E), which provides, inter alia, that a debtor may withdraw from the estate his "right
to receive . . . a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing,
annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of . . . age." Respondent
Jacoway, the Bankruptcy Trustee, objected to the Rouseys' exemption
and moved for turnover of the IRAs to her. The Bankruptcy Court
sustained her objection and granted her motion, and the Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel agreed. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that,
even if the Rouseys' IRAs were "similar plans or contracts" to the plans
specified in $ 522(d)(10)(E), their IRAs gave them no right to receive
payment "on account of age," but were instead savings accounts readily
accessible at any time for any purpose.

Held: The Rouseys can exempt IRA assets from the bankruptcy estate

because the IRAs fulfill both of the $ 522(d)(10)(E) requirements at issue
here--they confer a right to receive payment on account of age and they
are similar plans or contracts to those enumerated in $ 522(d)(10)(E).
Pp. 325-335.

(a) The Court reaffirms its suggestion in Patterson v. Shumate, 504
U. S. 753, 762-763, that IRAs like the Rouseys' can be exempted from
the bankruptcy estate pursuant to $ 522(d)(10)(E). Pp. 325-326.

(b) The Rouseys' IRAs provide a right to payment "on account of . . .
age" within $ 522(d)(10)(E)'s meaning. The quoted phrase requires that
the right to receive payment be "because of" age. Bank of America
Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526
U. S. 434, 450-451. This meaning comports with the common, dictionary understanding of "on account of," and $ 522(d)(10)(E)'s context does
not suggest another meaning. The statutes governing IRAs persuade
the Court that Jacoway is mistaken in arguing that there is no causal
connection between that right and age or any other factor because the
Rouseys' IRAs provide a right to payment on demand. Their right to
receive payment of the entire balance is not in dispute. Because their
accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S. C. $ 408(a), they have a nonfor544US1 Unit: $U39 [11-07-07 19:21:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
feitable right to the balance held in those accounts, $ 408(a)(4). That
right is restricted by a 10-percent tax penalty on any withdrawal
made before age 591/2, $ 72(t). Contrary to Jacoway's contention, this
10-percent penalty is substantial. It applies proportionally to any
amounts withdrawn and prevents access to the 10 percent that the
Rouseys would forfeit should they withdraw early. It therefore effectively prevents access to the entire balance in their IRAs and limits
their right to "payment" of the balance. And because this condition is
removed when the accountholder turns age 591/2, the Rouseys' right to
the balance of their IRAs is a right to payment "on account of" age.
Pp. 326-329.

(c) The Rouseys' IRAs are "similar plan[s] or contract[s]" to the
"stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, [or] annuity . . . plan[s]" listed in

$ 522(d)(10)(E). To be "similar," an IRA must be like, though not identical to, the listed plans or contracts, and consequently must share characteristics common to them. Because the Bankruptcy Code does not define the listed plans, the Court looks to their ordinary meaning. E. g.,
United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 757. Dictionary definitions
reveal that, although the listed plans are dissimilar to each other in
some respects, their common feature is that they provide income that
substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation. That
the income the Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income
that substitutes for wages lost upon retirement is demonstrated by the
facts that (1) regulations require distribution to begin no later than the
calendar year after the year the accountholder turns 701/2; (2) taxation
of IRA money is deferred until the year in which it is distributed;
(3) withdrawals before age 591/2 are subject to the 10-percent penalty;
and (4) failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a
50-percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.
The Court rejects Jacoway's argument that IRAs cannot be similar
plans or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.
This argument is premised on her view that the 10-percent penalty is
modest, a premise with which the Court does not agree. The Court
also rejects Jacoway's contention that the availability of IRA withdrawals exempt from the early withdrawal penalty renders the Rouseys'
IRAs more like savings accounts. Sections 522(d)(10)(E)(i) through
(iii)--which preclude the debtor from using the $ 522(d)(10)(E) exemption if an insider established his plan or contract; the right to receive
payment is on account of age or length of service; and the plan does not
qualify under specified Internal Revenue Code sections, including the
section governing IRAs--not only suggest generally that the Rouseys'
IRAs are exempt, but also support the Court's conclusion that they are
"similar plan[s] or contract[s]" under $ 522(d)(10)(E). Pp. 329-335.

322 ROUSEY v. JACOWAY

Opinion of the Court
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Pamela S. Karlan argued the cause for petitioners. Withher on the briefs were

Thomas C. Goldstein, Amy Howe,
Claude R. Jones, and G. Eric Brunstad, Jr.

Colli C. McKiever argued the cause for respondent. With
her on the brief were Jill R. Jacoway, pro se, Seth P. Waxman, Craig Goldblatt, and Jorian Rose.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Bankruptcy Code permits debtors to exempt certain
property from the bankruptcy estate, allowing them to re-tain those assets rather than divide them among their creditors. 11 U. S. C. $ 522. The question in this case is whetherdebtors can exempt assets in their Individual Retirement
Accounts (IRAs) from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to$ 522(d)(10)(E). We hold that IRAs can be so exempted.

I
Petitioners Richard and Betty Jo Rousey were formerlyemployed at Northrup Grumman Corp. At the termination

of their employment, Northrup Grumman required them totake lump-sum distributions from their employer-sponsored
pension plans. In re Rousey, 283 B. R. 265, 268 (Bkrtcy.
App. Panel CA8 2002); Brief for Petitioners 2. The Rouseys
deposited the lump sums into two IRAs, one in each of their
names. 283 B. R., at 268.

The Rouseys' accounts qualify as IRAs under a number of
requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Each
account is "a trust created or organized in the United States
for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries." 26 U. S. C. $ 408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II). The In*Patricia J. Kaeding, Brady C. Williamson, Elizabeth Warren, Jean
Constantine-Davis, Nina F. Simon, and Michael R. Schuster filed a brief
for AARP as amicus curiae urging reversal.

Opinion of the Court
ternal Revenue Code limits the types of assets in whichIRA-holders may invest their accounts, $$ 408(a)(3), (a)(5),

and provides that the balance in IRAs is nonforfeitable,$ 408(a)(4). It also caps yearly contributions to IRAs.

$ 408(o)(2). Withdrawals made before the accountholderturns 59

1/2 are, with limited exceptions, subject to a 10-

percent tax penalty. $ 72(t).

IRA contributions receive favorable tax treatment. Inparticular, the Internal Revenue Code generally defers taxation of the money placed in IRAs and the income earnedfrom those sums until the assets are withdrawn. See

$ 219(a) (contributions to IRAs are tax deductible); $ 408(e)(1)
(IRA is tax exempt). Moreover, within a certain timeframe
accountholders can, as the Rouseys did here, roll over distributions received from other retirement plans. $ 408(a)(1).
The Internal Revenue Code encourages such rollovers by
making them nontaxable. $$ 408(d)(3), 402(c)(1), 403(b)(8),
and 457(e)(16).

The Rouseys' IRA agreements, as well as relevant regulations, provide that their "entire interest in the custodial account must be, or begin to be, distributed by" April 1 following the calendar yearend in which they reach age 701/2.
In re Rousey, 275 B. R. 307, 310 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Ark. 2002).
The IRA agreements permit withdrawal prior to age 591/2,
but note the federal tax penalties applicable to such distributions. Id., at 311.

Several years after establishing their IRAs, the Rouseys
filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Arkansas. In the schedules and statements accompanying their
petition, the Rouseys sought to shield portions of their IRAs
from their creditors by claiming them as exempt from the
bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E).
This exemption provides that a debtor may withdraw from
the bankruptcy estate his "right to receive--. . . . .

Opinion of the Court
"(E) a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account
of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service, to
the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the
debtor and any dependent of the debtor . . . ."

The Bankruptcy Court appointed respondent Jill R. Jacoway
as the Chapter 7 Trustee. As Trustee, Jacoway is responsible for overseeing the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate
and the distribution of the proceeds. She objected to the
Rouseys' claim for the exemption of their IRAs and moved
for turnover of those sums to her. The Bankruptcy Court
sustained Jacoway's objection and granted her motion. 275
B. R., at 309.

The Rouseys appealed. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel
(BAP) agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that the Rouseys
could not exempt their IRAs under $ 522(d)(10)(E). It concluded that the IRAs were not " `similar plan[s] or contract[s]' " to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity
plans, because, by contrast to the limited access permitted
in such plans, the Rouseys had "unlimited access" to the
funds held in their IRAs. 283 B. R., at 272. That access
also meant, the BAP reasoned, that the Rouseys had complete control over the funds in their IRAs, "subject only to
a ten percent tax penalty." Id., at 273. Because they had
such control, the payments from the IRAs were not "on
account of any factor listed in 11 U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E)."
Ibid.

The Rouseys again appealed, and the Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals concluded that, even if the Rouseys' IRAs were " `similar plans
or contracts' " to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans, their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment
" `on account of age.' " In re Rousey, 347 F. 3d 689, 693
(2003). Like the BAP, the Court of Appeals reasoned that

325Cite as: 544 U. S. 320 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
the Rouseys' right to payment was conditioned neither onage nor on any of the other statutory factors. Their IRAs

were instead "readily accessible savings accounts of whichthe debtors may easily avail themselves (albeit with some
discouraging tax consequences) at any time for any purpose."Ibid. The Court of Appeals recognized that several of its
sister Circuits had reached a contrary result. Ibid. See
In re Brucher, 243 F. 3d 242, 243-244 (CA6 2001); In re Mc-Kown, 203 F. 3d 1188, 1190 (CA9 2000); In re Dubroff, 119

F. 3d 75, 78 (CA2 1997); In re Carmichael, 100 F. 3d 375, 378(CA5 1996).

We granted certiorari to resolve this division among theCourts of Appeals regarding whether debtors can exempt
IRAs from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U. S. C.$ 522(d)(10)(E). 541 U. S. 1085 (2004).

II
As a general matter, upon the filing of a petition for bank-ruptcy, "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property" become the property of the bankruptcy estate and willbe distributed to the debtor's creditors. $ 541(a)(1). To
help the debtor obtain a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Codepermits him to withdraw from the estate certain interests in
property, such as his car or home, up to certain values. See,
e. g., $ 522(d); United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459U. S. 70, 72, n. 1 (1982). In this case, the Rouseys claimed

their IRAs as exempt under $ 522(d)(10)(E). Under theterms of the statute, see supra, at 323-324, the Rouseys'
right to receive payment under their IRAs must meet threerequirements to be exempted under this provision: (1) The
right to receive payment must be from "a stock bonus, pen-sion, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract";
(2) the right to receive payment must be "on account of ill-ness, disability, death, age, or length of service"; and (3) even
then, the right to receive payment may be exempted only

326 ROUSEY v. JACOWAY

Opinion of the Court
"to the extent" that it is "reasonably necessary [to] support"the accountholder or his dependents. $ 522(d)(10)(E).

The dispute in this case is whether the Rouseys' IRAsfulfill the first and second requirements. This Court implied
that IRAs like the Rouseys' satisfy both elements in Patter-son v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753 (1992). There, in construing
another section of the Bankruptcy Code, this Court statedthat IRAs could be exempted pursuant to $ 522(d)(10)(E).
Id., at 762-763 ("Although a debtor's interest [in an IRA]could not be excluded under $ 541(c)(2) . . . , that interest
nevertheless could be exempted under $ 522(d)(10)(E)" (foot-note omitted)). We now reaffirm that statement and conclude that IRAs can be exempted from the bankruptcyestate pursuant to $ 522(d)(10)(E).

A
We turn first to the requirement that the payment be "onaccount of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service."

Ibid. We have interpreted the phrase "on account of " else-where within the Bankruptcy Code to mean "because of,"
thereby requiring a causal connection between the term thatthe phrase "on account of " modifies and the factor specified
in the statute at issue. Bank of America Nat. Trust and
Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U. S.434, 450-451 (1999). In reaching that conclusion, we noted

that "because of " was "certainly the usage meant for thephrase at other places in the [bankruptcy] statute," including
the provision at issue here--$ 522(d)(10)(E). Ibid. Thismeaning comports with the common understanding of "on
account of." See, e. g., Random House Dictionary of theEnglish Language 13 (2d ed. 1987) (listing as definitions "by
reason of," "because of "); Webster's Third New Interna-tional Dictionary 13 (1981) (hereinafter Webster's 3d) (same).
The context of this provision does not suggest that Congressdeviated from the term's ordinary meaning. Thus, "on account of " in $ 522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right to receive

544US1 Unit: $U39 [11-07-07 19:21:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
payment be "because of " illness, disability, death, age, orlength of service.

Jacoway argues that the Rouseys' right to receive pay-ment from their IRAs is not "because of " these listed factors.
In particular, she asserts that the Rouseys can withdrawfunds from their IRAs for any reason at all, so long as they
are willing to pay a 10-percent penalty. Thus, Jacowaymaintains that there is no causal connection between the
Rouseys' right to payment and age (or any other factor), be-cause their IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.

We disagree. The statutes governing IRAs persuade usthat the Rouseys' right to payment from IRAs is causally
connected to their age. Their right to receive payment ofthe entire balance is not in dispute. Because their accounts
qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S. C. $ 408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp.
II), the Rouseys have a nonforfeitable right to the balanceheld in those accounts, $ 408(a)(4). That right is restricted

by a 10-percent tax penalty that applies to withdrawals fromIRAs made before the accountholder turns 59

1/2. Contrary

to Jacoway's contention, this tax penalty is substantial. The
deterrent to early withdrawal it creates suggests that Con-gress designed it to preclude early access to IRAs. The low

rates of early withdrawals are consistent with the notionthat this penalty substantially deters early withdrawals from
such accounts.1 Because the 10-percent penalty applies pro1 See Amromin & Smith, What Explains Early Withdrawals from Retirement Accounts? Evidence From a Panel of Taxpayers, 56 Nat. Tax J.
595, 602 (Sept. 2003) (Table 1) (3.4 percent of IRA-holders took penalized
withdrawals in 1996); In re Cilek, 115 B. R. 974, 988, n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
WD Wis. 1990) ("[O]f the $6,457,306,674 deposited in IRAs in the nation's
credit unions, only 1.2% was withdrawn early and suffered a tax penalty
during 1987, and only 1.27% was withdrawn during 1988"); see also Sabelhaus, Projecting IRA Balances and Withdrawals, 20 Employee Benefit Research Institute Notes 1, 3 (May 1999) (finding that "[t]he pattern in both
[1993 and 1996] suggests infrequent withdrawals from IRAs" by those
under 591/2 and noting the consistency of this pattern with the view that
the penalty "has a big impact on withdrawal behavior").

328 ROUSEY v. JACOWAY

Opinion of the Court
portionally to any amounts withdrawn, it prevents access tothe 10 percent that the Rouseys would forfeit should they

withdraw early, and thus it effectively prevents access tothe entire balance in their IRAs.

2 It therefore limits the

Rouseys' right to "payment" of the balance of their IRAs.And because this condition is removed when the accountholder turns age 591/2, the Rouseys' right to the balance oftheir IRAs is a right to payment "on account of " age.

3 The

Rouseys no more have an unrestricted right to payment ofthe balance in their IRAs than a contracting party has an

unrestricted right to breach a contract simply because theprice of doing so is the payment of damages.

4 Accordingly,

2 We need not and do not reach the question whether penalties of less
than 10 percent or of a fixed amount would also be a sufficient barrier to
early withdrawal.

3 The Rouseys are entitled to penalty-free distributions because of

factors apart from age in certain circumstances. See 26 U. S. C.

$$ 72(t)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv) (permitting penalty-free distributions due to the
death of or disability of the IRA-holder, or as substantially equal periodic
payments for the life expectancy of the accountholder); $ 72(t)(2)(B) (medical expenses); $$ 72(t)(2)(D)-(F) (health insurance premiums, certain
higher education expenses, and first-time home purchase). But these circumstances are confined to specific and narrow uses. See infra, at 332-
334. Thus, that there are other circumstances in which the Rouseys can
receive payment does not change our conclusion that they have a right to
payment on account of age, for these exceptions do not undermine the fact
that they cannot obtain unrestricted use of their funds until age 591/2.
Moreover, $ 522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right to payment be on account
of age--not that it be solely on account of this factor.

4 O'Gilvie v. United States, 519 U. S. 79 (1996), and Commissioner v.

Schleier, 515 U. S. 323 (1995), upon which Jacoway relies, Brief for Respondent 17-19, are consistent with our conclusion that petitioners' IRAs
satisfy the statute's "on account of" requirement. Those cases involved
the meaning of the phrase "on account of" in a tax provision that permitted the exclusion from income of damages received " `on account' of personal injuries." O'Gilvie, supra, at 81 (emphasis deleted); Schleier,
supra, at 329. In both cases, we rejected the claim that damages that
were punitive in nature were on account of personal injuries, since such
damages did not compensate for the personal injuries. O'Gilvie, supra,
at 83-84; Schleier, supra, at 331-332. In so holding in O'Gilvie, we ex544US1 Unit: $U39 [11-07-07 19:21:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
we conclude that the Rouseys' IRAs provide a right to pay-ment on account of age.

B
In addition to requiring that the IRAs provide a right to
payment "on account of " age or one of the other factors listedin the statute, 11 U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E) also requires the

Rouseys' IRAs to be "stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, an-nuity, or similar plan[s] or contract[s]." No party contends
that the Rouseys' IRAs are stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plans or contracts. The issue, then, is
whether the Rouseys' IRAs are "similar plan[s] or con-tract[s]" within the meaning of $ 522(d)(10)(E). To be "similar," an IRA must be like, though not identical to, the specific
plans or contracts listed in $ 522(d)(10)(E), and consequentlymust share characteristics common to the listed plans or contracts. See American Heritage Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage 1206 (1981) (hereinafter Am. Hert.); Webster's 3d
2120.The Rouseys contend that IRAs are "similar" to stock
bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans or contracts,in that they have the same "primary purpose," namely, "enabl[ing] Americans to save for their retirement." ReplyBrief for Petitioners 13. Jacoway counters that IRAs are
unlike the listed plans because those plans provide "deferred
compensation," Brief for Respondent 22, whereas IRAsallow complete access to deposited funds and are therefore

not deferred at all, id., at 22-24. We agree with theRouseys that IRAs are similar to the plans specified in the
statute. Those plans, like the Rouseys' IRAs, provide a sub-stitute for wages (by wages, for present purposes, we mean
compensation earned as hourly or salary income), and arenot mere savings accounts. The Rouseys' IRAs are therepressly rejected a "but for" causation reading of the statute. See 519
U. S., at 82-83. We instead concluded, as we have here, that the phrase
"on account of" means " `by reason of[, or] because of.' " Id., at 83.

Opinion of the Court
fore "similar plan[s] or contract[s]" within the meaning of$ 522(d)(10)(E).

We turn first to the characteristics the specific plans andcontracts listed in $ 522(d)(10)(E) share. The Bankruptcy
Code does not define the terms "profitsharing," "stockbonus," "pension," or "annuity." Accordingly, we look to
the ordinary meaning of these terms. United States v.
LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 757 (1997); Perrin v. United States,444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979). A "profitsharing" plan, of course, is

"[a] system by which employees receive a share of the profitsof a business enterprise." Am. Hert. 1045.

5 Profitsharing

plans may provide deferred compensation, but they may alsobe "cash plans" in which a predetermined percentage of the

profits is distributed to employees at set intervals. J. Lang-bein & B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 48 (3d
ed. 2000). A stock bonus plan is like a profitsharing plan,except that it distributes company stock rather than cash
from profits. Id., at 49.6 A pension is defined as "a fixed
sum . . . paid under given conditions to a person followinghis retirement from service (as due to age or disability) or to

the surviving dependents of a person entitled to such a pen-sion." Webster's 3d 1671.

7 Finally, an annuity is "an

amount payable yearly or at other regular intervals . . . fora certain or uncertain period (as for years, for life, or in perpetuity)." Id., at 88.8

5 See also 12 Oxford English Dictionary 580 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) ("[T]he
sharing of profits, spec. between employer and employed"); Webster's 3d

profits of an industrial or commercial enterprise").

benefit or by way of patronage").

Opinion of the Court
The common feature of all of these plans is that they pro-vide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or

hourly compensation. This understanding of the plans' simi-larities comports with the other types of payments that a
debtor may exempt under $ 522(d)(10)--all of which concernincome that substitutes for wages. See, e. g., $ 522(d)(10)(A)
("social security benefit, unemployment compensation, or alocal public assistance benefit"); $ 522(d)(10)(B) ("a veterans'
benefit"); $ 522(d)(10)(C) ("disability, illness, or unemploy-ment benefit"); $ 522(d)(10)(D) ("alimony, support, or separate
maintenance"). But the plans are dissimilar in other re-spects: Employers establish and contribute to stock bonus,
profitsharing, and pension plans or contracts, whereas an in-dividual can establish and contribute to an annuity on terms
and conditions he selects. Moreover, pension plans and an-nuities provide deferred payment, whereas profitsharing or
stock bonus plans may or may not provide deferred payment.And while a pension provides retirement income, none of
these other plans necessarily provides retirement income.What all of these plans have in common is that they provide
income that substitutes for wages.Several considerations convince us that the income the
Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income thatsubstitutes for wages. First, the minimum distribution requirements, as discussed above, require distribution to beginat the latest in the calendar year after the year in which the
accountholder turns 701/2. Thus, accountholders must beginto withdraw funds when they are likely to be retired and
lack wage income. Second, the Internal Revenue Code de-fers taxation of money held in accounts qualifying as IRAs
under 26 U. S. C. $ 408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) until theyear in which it is distributed, treating it as income only in
such years. $$ 219, 408(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II). This taxtreatment further encourages accountholders to wait until

annual payments, which, except in the case of perpetual annuities, includes
the ultimate return of both principal and interest").

332 ROUSEY v. JACOWAY

Opinion of the Court
retirement to withdraw the funds: The later withdrawal oc-curs, the longer the taxes on the amounts are deferred.

Third, absent the applicability of other exceptions discussedabove, withdrawals before age 59

1/2 are subject to a tax penalty, restricting preretirement access to the funds. Finally,to ensure that the beneficiary uses the IRA in his retirement

years, an accountholder's failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a 50-percent tax penalty onfunds improperly remaining in the account. $ 4974(a). All

of these features show that IRA income substitutes forwages lost upon retirement and distinguish IRAs from typical savings accounts.

We find unpersuasive Jacoway's contention that the IRAs
cannot be similar plans or contracts because the Rouseys
have complete access to them. At bottom, this contention
rests, as did her "on account of " argument, on the premise
that the tax penalty imposed for early withdrawal is modest
and hence not a true limit on the withdrawal of funds. As
explained above, however, that penalty erects a substantial
barrier to early withdrawal. Supra, at 327-328. Funds in
a typical savings account, by contrast, can be withdrawn
without age-based penalty.

We also reject Jacoway's argument that the availability of
IRA withdrawals exempt from the 10-percent penalty renders the Rouseys' IRAs more like savings accounts. While
Jacoway is correct that the Internal Revenue Code permits
penalty-free early withdrawals in certain limited circumstances, 26 U. S. C. $ 72(t)(2), these exceptions do not reduce
the IRAs to savings accounts.

The exceptions are narrow. For example, penalty-free
early distributions for health insurance premiums are limited
to unemployed individuals who have received unemployment
compensation for at least 12 consecutive weeks and have
taken those distributions during the same year in which the
unemployment compensation is made. $ 72(t)(2)(D). These
payments are further limited to the actual amount paid for

These exceptions are limited in amount and scope. Evenwith these carveouts, an early withdrawal without penalty

accountholder uses this exception, he must use only this form of early
withdrawal, lest he pay the penalty, taxes, and interest. The statute permits penalty-free withdrawals for medical expenses, which is likewise limited. $ 72(t)(2)(B). The amount that can be withdrawn is capped by the
amount that can be deducted in a given year. Ibid.

the time the debtor's rights under such plan or con-tract arose;

"(ii) such payment is on account of age or length ofservice; and
"(iii) such plan or contract does not qualify under sec-tion 401(a), 403(a), 403(b) or 408 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986."
Thus, clauses (i)-(iii) preclude the debtor from using this ex-emption if an insider established his plan or contract; the

right to receive payment is on account of age or length ofservice; and the plan does not qualify under the specified
Internal Revenue Code sections, including the section thatgoverns IRAs, 26 U. S. C. $ 408 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).

As a general matter, it makes little sense to exclude fromthe exemption plans that fail to qualify under $ 408, unless
all plans that do qualify under $ 408, including IRAs, are gen-erally within the exemption. If IRAs were not within 11
U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E), Congress would not have referred tothem in its exception. McKown, 203 F. 3d, at 1190. More
specifically, clause (iii) suggests that plans qualifying under26 U. S. C. $ 408 (2000 ed. and Supp. II), including IRAs, are
similar plans or contracts. The other sections of the Inter-nal Revenue Code cited in clause (iii)--$$ 401(a), 403(a), and
403(b)--all establish requirements for tax-qualified retire-ment plans that take the form of, among other things, annuities, profitsharing plans, and stock bonus plans. By group-ing $ 408 with these other plans that are of the specific types
listed in subparagraph (E), clause (iii) suggests that IRAsare similar to them. Thus, the text of these clauses not only
suggests generally that the Rouseys' IRAs are exempt, butalso supports our conclusion that they are "similar plan[s] or
contract[s]" under 11 U. S. C. $ 522(d)(10)(E).

DURA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., et al. v. BROUDO

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-932. Argued January 12, 2005--Decided April 19, 2005
Respondents filed a securities fraud class action, alleging that petitioners,

Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and some of its managers and directors
(hereinafter Dura), made, inter alia, misrepresentations about future
Food and Drug Administration approval of a new asthmatic spray
device, leading respondents to purchase Dura securities at an artificially
inflated price. In dismissing, the District Court found that the complaint failed adequately to allege "loss causation"--i. e., a causal connection between the spray device misrepresentation and the economic loss,
15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(4). The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that a
plaintiff can satisfy the loss causation requirement simply by alleging
that a security's price at the time of purchase was inflated because of
the misrepresentation.

Held:

1. An inflated purchase price will not by itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss needed to allege and prove "loss
causation." The basic elements of a private securities fraud action--
which resembles a common-law tort action for deceit and misrepresentation--include, as relevant here, economic loss and "loss causation." The
Ninth Circuit erred in following an inflated purchase price approach to
showing causation and loss. First, as a matter of pure logic, the
moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss
because the inflated purchase price is offset by ownership of a share
that possesses equivalent value at that instant. And the logical link
between the inflated purchase price and any later economic loss is not
invariably strong, since other factors may affect the price. Thus, the
most logic alone permits this Court to say is that the inflated purchase
price suggests that misrepresentation "touches upon" a later economic
loss, as the Ninth Circuit found. However, to touch upon a loss is not
to cause a loss, as 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(4) requires. The Ninth Circuit's
holding also is not supported by precedent. The common-law deceit
and misrepresentation actions that private securities fraud actions resemble require a plaintiff to show not only that had he known the truth
he would not have acted, but also that he suffered actual economic loss.
Nor can the holding below be reconciled with the views of other Courts

Syllabus
of Appeals, which have rejected the inflated purchase price approach to
showing loss causation. Finally, the Ninth Circuit's approach is inconsistent with an important securities law objective. The securities laws
make clear Congress' intent to permit private securities fraud actions
only where plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of cause and loss, but the Ninth Circuit's approach would allow
recovery where a misrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price,
but does not proximately cause any economic loss. Pp. 341-346.

2. Respondents' complaint was legally insufficient in respect to its
allegation of "loss causation." While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
8(a)(2) requires only a "short and plain statement of the claim showing
that the pleader is entitled to relief," and while the Court assumes that
neither the Rules nor the securities statutes place any further requirement in respect to the pleading, the "short and plain statement" must
give the defendant "fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the
grounds upon which it rests," Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47. The
complaint here contains only respondents' allegation that their loss consisted of artificially inflated purchase prices. However, as this Court
has concluded here, such a price is not itself a relevant economic loss.
And the complaint nowhere else provides Dura with notice of what the
relevant loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation. Ordinary pleading rules
are not meant to impose a great burden on a plaintiff, but it should not
prove burdensome for a plaintiff suffering economic loss to provide a
defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection
that the plaintiff has in mind. Allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any
indication of the economic loss and proximate cause would bring about
the very sort of harm the securities statutes seek to avoid, namely, the
abusive practice of filing lawsuits with only a faint hope that discovery
might lead to some plausible cause of action. Pp. 346-348.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
A private plaintiff who claims securities fraud must prove
that the defendant's fraud caused an economic loss. 109
Stat. 747, 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(4). We consider a Ninth Circuit holding that a plaintiff can satisfy this requirement--
a requirement that courts call "loss causation"--simply by
alleging in the complaint and subsequently establishing that
"the price" of the security "on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation." 339 F. 3d 933, 938
(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). In our view, the
Ninth Circuit is wrong, both in respect to what a plaintiff
must prove and in respect to what the plaintiffs' complaint
here must allege.

Opinion of the Court

I
Respondents are individuals who bought stock in DuraPharmaceuticals, Inc., on the public securities market between April 15, 1997, and February 24, 1998. They havebrought this securities fraud class action against Dura and
some of its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura) in fed-eral court. In respect to the question before us, their detailed amended (181 paragraph) complaint makes substan-tially the following allegations:

(1) Before and during the purchase period, Dura (or itsofficials) made false statements concerning both Dura's
drug profits and future Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approval of a new asthmatic spray device. See,
e. g., App. 45a, 55a, 89a.
(2) In respect to drug profits, Dura falsely claimed thatit expected that its drug sales would prove profitable.

See, e. g., id., at 66a-69a.
(3) In respect to the asthmatic spray device, Durafalsely claimed that it expected the FDA would soon

grant its approval. See, e. g., id., at 89a-90a, 103a-104a.
(4) On the last day of the purchase period, February 24,1998, Dura announced that its earnings would be lower

than expected, principally due to slow drug sales. Id.,at 51a.
(5) The next day Dura's shares lost almost half theirvalue (falling from about $39 per share to about $21).
Ibid.
(6) About eight months later (in November 1998), Duraannounced that the FDA would not approve Dura's new

asthmatic spray device. Id., at 110a.
(7) The next day Dura's share price temporarily fell butalmost fully recovered within one week.

Id., at 156a.

Most importantly, the complaint says the following (andnothing sig nificantly more than the following) about

Opinion of the Court
economic losses attributable to the spray device misstatement: "In reliance on the integrity of the market, [the plaintiffs] . . . paid artificially inflated prices for Dura securities" and the plaintiffs suffered "damage[s]" thereby. Id.,
at 139a (emphasis added).

The District Court dismissed the complaint. In respect
to the plaintiffs' drug-profitability claim, it held that the complaint failed adequately to allege an appropriate state of
mind, i. e., that defendants had acted knowingly, or the like.
In respect to the plaintiffs' spray device claim, it held that
the complaint failed adequately to allege "loss causation."

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. In
the portion of the court's decision now before us--the portion
that concerns the spray device claim--the Circuit held that
the complaint adequately alleged "loss causation." The Circuit wrote that "plaintiffs establish loss causation if they
have shown that the price on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation." 339 F. 3d, at 938
(emphasis in original; internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). It added that "the injury occurs at the time of the
transaction." Ibid. Since the complaint pleaded "that the
price at the time of purchase was overstated," and it sufficiently identified the cause, its allegations were legally sufficient. Ibid.

Because the Ninth Circuit's views about loss causation differ from those of other Circuits that have considered this
issue, we granted Dura's petition for certiorari. Compare
ibid. with, e. g., Emergent Capital Investment Management,
LLC v. Stonepath Group, Inc., 343 F. 3d 189, 198 (CA2 2003);
Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., 223 F. 3d 165, 185 (CA3 2000);
Robbins v. Koger Properties, Inc., 116 F. 3d 1441, 1447-1448
(CA11 1997); cf. Bastian v. Petren Resources Corp., 892 F. 2d
680, 685 (CA7 1990). We now reverse.

Opinion of the Court

II
Private federal securities fraud actions are based uponfederal securities statutes and their implementing regulations. Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934forbids (1) the "use or employ[ment] . . . of any . . . deceptive device," (2) "in connection with the purchase or sale ofany security," and (3) "in contravention of " Securities and
Exchange Commission "rules and regulations." 15 U. S. C.$ 78j(b). Commission Rule 10b- 5 forbids, among other

things, the making of any "untrue statement of a materialfact" or the omission of any material fact "necessary in order
to make the statements made . . . not misleading." 17 CFR$ 240.10b-5 (2004).

The courts have implied from these statutes and Rule aprivate damages action, which resembles, but is not identical
to, common-law tort actions for deceit and misrepresenta-tion. See,

e. g., Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,
421 U. S. 723, 730, 744 (1975); Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,425 U. S. 185, 196 (1976). And Congress has imposed statutory requirements on that private action. E. g., 15 U. S. C.$ 78u-4(b)(4).

In cases involving publicly traded securities and purchasesor sales in public securities markets, the action's basic elements include:

(1) a material misrepresentation (or omission), see
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 231-232 (1988);

(2) scienter, i. e., a wrongful state of mind, see Ernst &
Ernst, supra, at 197, 199;

(3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security,
see Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 730-731;

(4) reliance, often referred to in cases involving public securities markets (fraud-on-the-market cases) as"transaction causation," see

Basic, supra, at 248-249
(nonconclusively presuming that the price of a publicly

traded share reflects a material misrepresentation andthat plaintiffs have relied upon that misrepresentation

as long as they would not have bought the share in itsabsence);
(5) economic loss, 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(4); and
(6) "loss causation," i. e., a causal connection betweenthe material misrepresentation and the loss,

ibid.; cf. T.Hazen, Law of Securities Regulation $$ 12.11[1], [3] (5th

ed. 2005).
Dura argues that the complaint's allegations are inadequatein respect to these last two elements.

A
We begin with the Ninth Circuit's basic reason for findingthe complaint adequate, namely, that at the end of the day

plaintiffs need only "establish," i. e., prove, that "the price
on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepre-sentation." 339 F. 3d, at 938 (internal quotation marks and

citation omitted). In our view, this statement of the law iswrong. Normally, in cases such as this one (i. e., fraud-onthe-market cases), an inflated purchase price will not itselfconstitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss.

For one thing, as a matter of pure logic, at the momentthe transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss;
the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership ofa share that

at that instant possesses equivalent value.Moreover, the logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariablystrong. Shares are normally purchased with an eye toward
a later sale. But if, say, the purchaser sells the sharesquickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out, the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss. If thepurchaser sells later after the truth makes its way into the
marketplace, an initially inflated purchase price might meana later loss. But that is far from inevitably so. When the

544US2 Unit: $U40 [11-04-07 11:37:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

343Cite as: 544 U. S. 336 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
purchaser subsequently resells such shares, even at a lowerprice, that lower price may reflect, not the earlier misrepresentation, but changed economic circumstances, changed in-vestor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific
facts, conditions, or other events, which taken separately ortogether account for some or all of that lower price. (The
same is true in respect to a claim that a share's higher price
is lower than it would otherwise have been--a claim we donot consider here.) Other things being equal, the longer the

time between purchase and sale, the more likely that this isso,

i. e., the more likely that other factors caused the loss.
Given the tangle of factors affecting price, the most logic
alone permits us to say is that the higher purchase price will
sometimes play a role in bringing about a future loss. It
may prove to be a necessary condition of any such loss, and
in that sense one might say that the inflated purchase price
suggests that the misrepresentation (using language the
Ninth Circuit used) "touches upon" a later economic loss.
Ibid. But, even if that is so, it is insufficient. To "touch
upon" a loss is not to cause a loss, and it is the latter that
the law requires. 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(4).

For another thing, the Ninth Circuit's holding lacks support in precedent. Judicially implied private securities
fraud actions resemble in many (but not all) respects
common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions. See
Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 744; see also L. Loss & J. Seligman, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 910-918 (5th ed.
2004) (describing relationship to common-law deceit). The
common law of deceit subjects a person who "fraudulently"
makes a "misrepresentation" to liability "for pecuniary loss
caused" to one who justifiably relies upon that misrepresentation. Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 525, p. 55 (1976)
(hereinafter Restatement of Torts); see also Southern Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U. S. 247, 250 (1888) (setting forth
elements of fraudulent misrepresentation). And the common law has long insisted that a plaintiff in such a case show

344 DURA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. v. BROUDO

Opinion of the Court
not only that had he known the truth he would not haveacted but also that he suffered actual economic loss. See,

e. g., Pasley v. Freeman, 3 T. R. 51, 65, 100 Eng. Rep. 450,457 (1789) (if "no injury is occasioned by the lie, it is not
actionable: but if it be attended with a damage, it then be-comes the subject of an action");

Freeman v. Venner, 120
Mass. 424, 426 (1876) (a mortgagee cannot bring a tort action
for damages stemming from a fraudulent note that a misrep-resentation led him to execute unless and until the note has

to be paid); see also M. Bigelow, Law of Torts 101 (8th ed.1907) (damage "must already have been suffered before the
bringing of the suit"); 2 T. Cooley, Law of Torts $ 348, p. 551
(4th ed. 1932) (plaintiff must show that he "suffered damage"
and that the "damage followed proximately the deception");
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts $ 110, p. 765 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (plaintiff "must have suffered substantial damage," not simply nominal damages, before "the
cause of action can arise").

Given the common-law roots of the securities fraud action
(and the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show actual damages), it is not surprising that other Courts of Appeals have rejected the Ninth Circuit's "inflated purchase
price" approach to proving causation and loss. See, e. g.,
Emergent Capital, 343 F. 3d, at 198 (inflation of purchase
price alone cannot satisfy loss causation); Semerenko, 223
F. 3d, at 185 (same); Robbins, 116 F. 3d, at 1448 (same);
cf. Bastian, 892 F. 2d, at 685. Indeed, the Restatement of
Torts, in setting forth the judicial consensus, says that a person who "misrepresents the financial condition of a corporation in order to sell its stock" becomes liable to a relying
purchaser "for the loss" the purchaser sustains "when the
facts . . . become generally known" and "as a result" share
value "depreciate[s]." $ 548A, Comment b, at 107. Treatise
writers, too, have emphasized the need to prove proximate
causation. Prosser and Keeton $ 110, at 767 (losses do "not

544US2 Unit: $U40 [11-04-07 11:37:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
afford any basis for recovery" if "brought about by businessconditions or other factors").

We cannot reconcile the Ninth Circuit's "inflated purchaseprice" approach with these views of other courts. And the
uniqueness of its perspective argues against the validity ofits approach in a case like this one where we consider the
contours of a judicially implied cause of action with roots in
the common law.Finally, the Ninth Circuit's approach overlooks an important securities law objective. The securities statutes seekto maintain public confidence in the marketplace. See
United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 658 (1997). They
do so by deterring fraud, in part, through the availability of
private securities fraud actions. Randall v. Loftsgaarden,
478 U. S. 647, 664 (1986). But the statutes make these latter
actions available, not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those
economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause. Cf.
Basic, 485 U. S., at 252 (White, J., joined by O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[A]llowing recovery in the face of affirmative evidence of nonreliance--would
effectively convert Rule 10b-5 into a scheme of investor's
insurance. There is no support in the Securities Exchange
Act, the Rule, or our cases for such a result" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

The statutory provision at issue here and the paragraphs
that precede it emphasize this last mentioned objective.
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat.
737. The statute insists that securities fraud complaints
"specify" each misleading statement; that they set forth the
facts "on which [a] belief " that a statement is misleading was
"formed"; and that they "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with
the required state of mind." 15 U. S. C. $$ 78u-4(b)(1),
(2). And the statute expressly imposes on plaintiffs "the
burden of proving" that the defendant's misrepresentations

544US2 Unit: $U40 [11-04-07 11:37:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
346 DURA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. v. BROUDO

Opinion of the Court
"caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover."$ 78u-4(b)(4).

The statute thereby makes clear Congress' intent to per-mit private securities fraud actions for recovery where, but
only where, plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the tradi-tional elements of causation and loss. By way of contrast,
the Ninth Circuit's approach would allow recovery where amisrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price but
nonetheless does not proximately cause any economic loss.That is to say, it would permit recovery where these two
traditional elements in fact are missing.In sum, we find the Ninth Circuit's approach inconsistent
with the law's requirement that a plaintiff prove that thedefendant's misrepresentation (or other fraudulent conduct)
proximately caused the plaintiff 's economic loss. We neednot, and do not, consider other proximate cause or lossrelated questions. B

Our holding about plaintiffs' need to prove proximate cau-sation and economic loss leads us also to conclude that the
plaintiffs' complaint here failed adequately to allege theserequirements. We concede that the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure require only "a short and plain statement of theclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2). And we assume, at least for argu-ment's sake, that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes impose any special further requirement in respect tothe pleading of proximate causation or economic loss. But,
even so, the "short and plain statement" must provide thedefendant with "fair notice of what the plaintiff 's claim is and
the grounds upon which it rests." Conley v. Gibson, 355U. S. 41, 47 (1957). The complaint before us fails this simple test.As we have pointed out, the plaintiffs' lengthy complaint
contains only one statement that we can fairly read as de-scribing the loss caused by the defendants' "spray device"

Opinion of the Court
misrepresentations. That statement says that the plaintiffs"paid artificially inflated prices for Dura['s] securities" and

suffered "damage[s]." App. 139a. The statement impliesthat the plaintiffs' loss consisted of the "artificially inflated"
purchase "prices." The complaint's failure to claim thatDura's share price fell significantly after the truth became
known suggests that the plaintiffs considered the allegation
of purchase price inflation alone sufficient. The complaintcontains nothing that suggests otherwise.

For reasons set forth in Part II-A, supra, however, the"artificially inflated purchase price" is not itself a relevant
economic loss. And the complaint nowhere else provides
the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic
loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation concerning Dura's
"spray device."

We concede that ordinary pleading rules are not meant
to impose a great burden upon a plaintiff. Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 513-515 (2002). But it should
not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered an
economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of
the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in
mind. At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving
any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that
the plaintiff has in mind would bring about harm of the very
sort the statutes seek to avoid. Cf. H. R. Conf. Rep. No.
104-369, p. 31 (1995) (criticizing "abusive" practices including
"the routine filing of lawsuits . . . with only [a] faint hope
that the discovery process might lead eventually to some
plausible cause of action"). It would permit a plaintiff "with
a largely groundless claim to simply take up the time of a
number of other people, with the right to do so representing
an in terrorem increment of the settlement value, rather
than a reasonably founded hope that the [discovery] process
will reveal relevant evidence." Blue Chip Stamps, 421
U. S., at 741. Such a rule would tend to transform a private

U. S., at 252 (White, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part).

For these reasons, we find the plaintiffs' complaint legallyinsufficient. We reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit,

349OCTOBER TERM, 2004
Syllabus

PASQUANTINO et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 03-725. Argued November 9, 2004--Decided April 26, 2005
Petitioners carried out a scheme to smuggle large quantities of liquor into

Canada from the United States to evade Canada's heavy alcohol import
taxes. They were convicted of violating the federal wire fraud statute,
18 U. S. C. $ 1343, for doing so. That statute prohibits the use of interstate wires to effect "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses." The
Fourth Circuit affirmed their convictions, rejecting petitioners' argument that their prosecution contravened the common-law revenue rule,
which bars courts from enforcing foreign sovereigns' tax laws. The
Fourth Circuit also held that Canada's right to receive tax revenue was
"money or property" within $ 1343's meaning.

Held: A plot to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the

federal wire fraud statute. Pp. 355-372.

(a) Section 1343's plain terms criminalize a scheme such as petitioners'. Their smuggling operation satisfies both of the $ 1343 elements
that are in dispute here. First, Canada's right to uncollected excise
taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into Canada is "property"
within the statute's meaning. That right is an entitlement to collect
money from petitioners, the possession of which is "something of value"
to the Canadian Government. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350,
358. Such valuable entitlements are "property" as that term ordinarily
is employed. Second, petitioners' plot was a "scheme or artifice to defraud" Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax revenue, because petitioners routinely concealed imported liquor from Canadian officials and
failed to declare those goods on customs forms. See Durland v. United
States, 161 U. S. 306, 313. Pp. 355-359.

(b) The foregoing construction of $ 1343 does not derogate from the
common-law revenue rule. Pp. 359-372.

(1) Relying on the canon of construction that " `[s]tatutes which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a presumption favoring
the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a
statutory purpose to the contrary is evident,' " United States v. Texas,
507 U. S. 529, 534, petitioners argue that, to avoid reading $ 1343
to derogate from the revenue rule, the Court should construe the
otherwise-applicable statutory language to except frauds directed at

350 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
evading foreign taxes. Whether $ 1343 derogates from the revenue
rule depends on whether reading the statute to reach this prosecution
conflicts with a well-established revenue rule principle. See United
States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 276. Thus, before concluding that Congress intended to exempt the present prosecution from $ 1343's broad
reach, the Court must find that the revenue rule clearly barred such a
prosecution as of 1952, the year Congress enacted the wire fraud statute. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 22-23. Pp. 359-360.

(2) No common-law case decided as of 1952 clearly established that
the revenue rule barred the United States from prosecuting a fraudulent
scheme to evade foreign taxes. Pp. 360-368.

(i) The revenue rule has long been treated as a corollary of the
rule that "[t]he Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another."
The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66, 123. It was first treated as such in cases
prohibiting the enforcement of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the
courts of another sovereign, such as suits to enforce tax judgments.
The revenue rule's grounding in these cases shows that, at its core, it
prohibited the collection of tax obligations of foreign nations. The present prosecution is unlike these classic examples of actions traditionally
barred by the revenue rule. It is not a suit that recovers a foreign tax
liability, but is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States to
punish domestic criminal conduct. Pp. 360-362.

(ii) Cases applying the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement
of foreign revenue laws, in contrast to the direct collection of a tax
obligation, cannot bear the weight petitioners place on them. Many of
them were decided after Congress passed the wire fraud statute.
Others come from foreign courts. And, significantly, none involved a
domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a criminal
statute to enforce the sovereign's own penal law. Moreover, none of
petitioners' cases barred an action that had as its primary object the
deterrence and punishment of fraudulent conduct--a substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax enforcement.
The main object of the action in each of them was the collection of
money that would pay foreign tax claims. The absence of such an object here means that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax
collection is incidental and attenuated at best. Thus, it cannot be said
whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution
within the revenue rule. Petitioners answer unpersuasively that the
recovery of taxes is indeed the object of this suit because restitution of
Canada's lost tax revenue is required under the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996. Whether restitution is mandatory is irrelevant here because $ 1343 advances the Government's independent
interest in punishing fraudulent domestic criminal conduct. In any

Syllabus
event, if awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contrary to the
revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the later
enacted restitution statute not to allow such awards, rather than to assume that it impliedly repealed $ 1343 as applied to this prosecution.
Pp. 362-365.

(iii) Also unavailing is petitioners' argument that early English
common-law cases holding unenforceable contracts executed to evade
other nations' revenue laws demonstrate that "indirect" enforcement of
such laws is at the very core of the revenue rule, rather than at its
margins. Those early cases were driven by an interest in lessening the
commercial disruption caused by high tariffs. By the mid-20th century,
however, that rationale was supplanted, and courts began to apply the
revenue rule to tax obligations on the strength of the analogy between
a country's revenue laws and its penal ones. Because the early English
cases rested on a far different foundation from that on which the revenue rule came to rest, they say little about whether the wire fraud
statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th-century form.
Pp. 365-366.

(iv) Petitioners' criminal prosecution "enforces" Canadian revenue law in an attenuated sense, but not in a sense that clearly would
contravene the revenue rule. That rule never proscribed all enforcement of foreign revenue law. For example, at the same time they were
enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of violating foreign
revenue law, English courts also considered void foreign contracts that
lacked tax stamps required under foreign revenue law. The line the
revenue rule draws between impermissible and permissible "enforcement" of foreign revenue law has therefore always been unclear. The
uncertainty persisted in American cases, which demonstrate that the
extent to which the revenue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign
revenue laws was unsettled as of 1952. Pp. 366-368.

(3) The traditional rationales for the revenue rule do not plainly
suggest that it barred this prosecution. First, this prosecution poses
little risk of causing the principal evil against which the revenue rule
was traditionally thought to guard: judicial evaluation of the revenue
policies of foreign sovereigns. This action was brought by the Executive, "the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations," United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299
U. S. 304, 320. Although a prosecution like this one requires a court to
recognize foreign law to determine whether the defendant violated U. S.
law, it may be assumed that by electing to prosecute, the Executive
has assessed this prosecution's impact on this Nation's relationship with
Canada, and concluded that it poses little danger of causing international
friction. Petitioners' broader argument that the revenue rule avoids

352 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy
decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws worries the Court little.
The present prosecution, if authorized by the wire fraud statute, embodies the policy choice of the two political branches of Government--Congress and the Executive--to free the interstate wires from fraudulent
use, irrespective of the object of the fraud. Such a reading of $ 1343
gives effect to that considered policy choice and therefore poses no risk
of advancing Canadian policies illegitimately. Finally, petitioners' assertion that courts lack the competence to examine the validity of unfamiliar foreign tax schemes is not persuasive here. Foreign law posed
no unmanageable complexity in this case, and Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 26.1 gives federal courts sufficient means to resolve any incidental foreign law issues that may arise in wire fraud prosecutions.
Pp. 368-370.

(4) The Court's interpretation does not give $ 1343 extraterritorial
effect. Petitioners' offense was complete the moment they executed
their scheme intending to defraud Canada of tax revenue inside the
United States. See Durland, 161 U. S., at 313. Therefore, only domestic conduct is at issue here. In any event, because $ 1343 punishes
frauds executed "in interstate or foreign commerce," it is not a statute
that involves only domestic concerns. Pp. 371-372.

Opinion of the Court
question presented in this case is whether a plot to defrauda foreign government of tax revenue violates the federal

wire fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II).Because the plain terms of $ 1343 criminalize such a scheme,
and because this construction of the wire fraud statute doesnot derogate from the common-law revenue rule, we hold
that it does. I

Petitioners Carl J. Pasquantino, David B. Pasquantino, andArthur Hilts were indicted for and convicted of federal wire
fraud for carrying out a scheme to smuggle large quantitiesof liquor into Canada from the United States. According to
the evidence presented at trial, the Pasquantinos, while inNew York, ordered liquor over the telephone from discount
package stores in Maryland. See 336 F. 3d 321, 325 (CA42003) (en banc). They employed Hilts and others to drive
the liquor over the Canadian border, without paying therequired excise taxes. Ibid. The drivers avoided paying
taxes by hiding the liquor in their vehicles and failing todeclare the goods to Canadian customs officials. Id., at 333.
During the time of petitioners' smuggling operation, be-tween 1996 and 2000, Canada heavily taxed the importation
of alcoholic beverages. See 1997 S. C., ch. 36, $$ 21.1(1),21.2(1); Excise Act Schedule 1.(1), R. S. C., ch. E-14 (1985);
Excise Act 2001, Schedule 4, ch. 22, 2002 S. C. 239. Uncon-tested evidence at trial showed that Canadian taxes then due
on alcohol purchased in the United States and transportedto Canada were approximately double the liquor's purchase
price. App. 65-66.Before trial, petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment
on the ground that it stated no wire fraud offense. The wirefraud statute prohibits the use of interstate wires to effect
"any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money orproperty by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." 18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp.II). Petitioners contended that the Government lacked a

Opinion of the Court
sufficient interest in enforcing the revenue laws of Canada,
and therefore that they had not committed wire fraud. App.
48-57. The District Court denied the motion, and the case
went to trial. The jury convicted petitioners of wire fraud.

Petitioners appealed their convictions to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, again urging that
the indictment failed to state a wire fraud offense. They
argued that their prosecution contravened the common-law
revenue rule, because it required the court to take cognizance of the revenue laws of Canada. Over Judge Hamilton's dissent, the panel agreed and reversed the convictions.
305 F. 3d 291, 295 (2002). Petitioners also argued that Canada's right to collect taxes from them was not "money or property" within the meaning of the wire fraud statute, but the
panel unanimously rejected that argument. Id., at 294-295;
id., at 299 (Hamilton, J., dissenting).

The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc, vacated
the panel's decision, and affirmed petitioners' convictions.
336 F. 3d 321 (CA4 2003). It concluded that the common-law
revenue rule, rather than barring any recognition of foreign
revenue law, simply allowed courts to refuse to enforce the
tax judgments of foreign nations, and therefore did not preclude the Government from prosecuting petitioners. Id., at
327-329. The Court of Appeals held as well that Canada's
right to receive tax revenue was "money or property" within
the meaning of the wire fraud statute. Id., at 331-332.

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts of
Appeals over whether a scheme to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the wire fraud statute. 541
U. S. 972 (2004). Compare United States v. Boots, 80 F. 3d
580, 587 (CA1 1996) (holding that a scheme to defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue does not violate the wire fraud
statute), with United States v. Trapilo, 130 F. 3d 547, 552-

nation of tax revenue violates the wire fraud statute). We

II
We first consider whether petitioners' conduct falls withinthe literal terms of the wire fraud statute. The statute prohibits using interstate wires to effect "any scheme or artificeto defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II). Two elements of this
crime, and the only two that petitioners dispute here, arethat the defendant engage in a "scheme or artifice to defraud," ibid., and that the "object of the fraud . . . be `[moneyor] property' in the victim's hands," Cleveland v. United
States, 531 U. S. 12, 26 (2000).2 Petitioners' smuggling oper-ation satisfies both elements.

Taking the latter element first, Canada's right to uncol-lected excise taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into
Canada is "property" in its hands. This right is an entitle-ment to collect money from petitioners, the possession of
which is "something of value" to the Government of Canada.McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358 (1987) (internal

1 We express no view on the related question whether a foreign government, based on wire or mail fraud predicate offenses, may bring a civil
action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) for a scheme to defraud it of taxes. See Attorney General of
Canada v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., 268 F. 3d 103, 106 (CA2
2001) (holding that the Government of Canada cannot bring a civil RICO
suit to recover for a scheme to defraud it of taxes); Republic of Honduras
v. Philip Morris Cos., 341 F. 3d 1253, 1255 (CA11 2003) (same with respect
to other foreign governments).

2 Although Cleveland interpreted the term "property" in the mail fraud

statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. II), we have construed identical
language in the wire and mail fraud statutes in pari materia. See Neder
v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 20 (1999) (" `scheme or artifice to defraud' ");
Carpenter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19, 25, and n. 6 (1987) ("scheme or
artifice to defraud"; "money or property").

356 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
quotation marks omitted). Valuable entitlements like these
are "property" as that term ordinarily is employed. See
Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004) ("When interpreting
a statute, we must give words their ordinary or natural
meaning" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Black's Law
Dictionary 1382 (4th ed. 1951) (defining "property" as "extend[ing] to every species of valuable right and interest").
Had petitioners complied with this legal obligation, they
would have paid money to Canada. Petitioners' tax evasion
deprived Canada of that money, inflicting an economic injury
no less than had they embezzled funds from the Canadian
treasury. The object of petitioners' scheme was to deprive
Canada of money legally due, and their scheme thereby had
as its object the deprivation of Canada's "property."

The common law of fraud confirms this characterization of
Canada's right to excise taxes. The right to be paid money
has long been thought to be a species of property. See 3
W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153-
155 (1768) (classifying a right to sue on a debt as personal
property); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *351
(same). Consistent with that understanding, fraud at common law included a scheme to deprive a victim of his entitlement to money. For instance, a debtor who concealed his
assets when settling debts with his creditors thereby committed common-law fraud. 1 J. Story, Equity Jurisprudence

$ 378 (I. Redfield 10th rev. ed. 1870); Chesterfield v. Janssen,
28 Eng. Rep. 82, 2 Ves. Sen. 125 (ch. 1750); 1 S. Rapalje & R.
Lawrence, A Dictionary of American and English Law 546
(1883). That made sense given the economic equivalence between money in hand and money legally due. The fact that
the victim of the fraud happens to be the government, rather
than a private party, does not lessen the injury.

Our conclusion that the right to tax revenue is property in
Canada's hands, contrary to petitioners' contentions, is consistent with Cleveland, supra. In that case, the defendant,

544US2 Unit: $U41 [02-25-08 10:17:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

357Cite as: 544 U. S. 349 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
Cleveland, had obtained a video poker license by making
false statements on his license application. Id., at 16-17.
We held that a State's interest in an unissued video poker
license was not "property," because the interest in choosing
particular licensees was " `purely regulatory' " and "[could
not] be economic." Id., at 22-23. We also noted that "the
Government nowhere allege[d] that Cleveland defrauded the
State of any money to which the State was entitled by
law." Ibid.

Cleveland is different from this case. Unlike a State's interest in allocating a video poker license to particular applicants, Canada's entitlement to tax revenue is a straightforward "economic" interest. There was no suggestion in
Cleveland that the defendant aimed at depriving the State
of any money due under the license; quite the opposite, there
was "no dispute that [the defendant's partnership] paid the
State of Louisiana its proper share of revenue" due. Id.,
at 22. Here, by contrast, the Government alleged and
proved that petitioners' scheme aimed at depriving Canada
of money to which it was entitled by law. Canada could
hardly have a more "economic" interest than in the receipt
of tax revenue. Cleveland is therefore consistent with our
conclusion that Canada's entitlement is "property" as that
word is used in the wire fraud statute.

Turning to the second element at issue here, petitioners'
plot was a "scheme or artifice to defraud" Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax revenue. The evidence showed that
petitioners routinely concealed imported liquor from Canadian officials and failed to declare those goods on customs
forms. See 336 F. 3d, at 333. By this conduct, they represented to Canadian customs officials that their drivers had
no goods to declare. This, then, was a scheme "designed to
defraud by representations," Durland v. United States, 161
U. S. 306, 313 (1896), and therefore a "scheme or artifice to
defraud" Canada of taxes due on the smuggled goods.

358 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Neither the antismuggling statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 546,3 norU. S. tax treaties, see Attorney General of Canada v. R. J.

Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., 268 F. 3d 103, 115-119(CA2 2001), convince us that petitioners' scheme falls outside
the terms of the wire fraud statute.4 Unlike the treatiesand the antismuggling statute, the wire fraud statute punishes fraudulent use of domestic wires, whether or not suchconduct constitutes smuggling, occurs aboard a vessel, or
evades foreign taxes. See post, at 380, n. 9 (Ginsburg, J.,dissenting) (noting that the antismuggling statute does not
apply to this prosecution). Petitioners would be equally lia-ble if they had used interstate wires to defraud Canada not
of taxes due, but of money from the Canadian treasury. Thewire fraud statute "applies without differentiation" to these
two categories of fraud. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371,378 (2005). "To give these same words a different meaning

3 Section 546 provides:
"Any person owning in whole or in part any vessel of the United States
who employs, or participates in, or allows the employment of, such vessel
for the purpose of smuggling, or attempting to smuggle, or assisting in
smuggling, any merchandise into the territory of any foreign government
in violation of the laws there in force, if under the laws of such foreign
government any penalty or forfeiture is provided for violation of the laws
of the United States respecting the customs revenue, and any citizen of,
or person domiciled in, or any corporation incorporated in, the United
States, controlling or substantially participating in the control of any such
vessel, directly or indirectly, whether through ownership of corporate
shares or otherwise, and allowing the employment of said vessel for any
such purpose, and any person found, or discovered to have been, on board
of any such vessel so employed and participating or assisting in any such
purpose, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two
years, or both."

4 Any overlap between the antismuggling statute and the wire fraud

statute is beside the point. The Federal Criminal Code is replete with
provisions that criminalize overlapping conduct. See Stuntz, The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law, 100 Mich. L. Rev. 505, 518, and n. 62
(2002); United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 505-509, and nn. 8-10 (1997)
(Stevens, J., dissenting). The mere fact that two federal criminal statutes criminalize similar conduct says little about the scope of either.

Opinion of the Court
for each category would be to invent a statute rather than
interpret one." Ibid. We therefore decline to "interpret
[this] criminal statute more narrowly than it is written."
Brogan v. United States, 522 U. S. 398, 406 (1998).

III
We next consider petitioners' revenue rule argument.
Petitioners argue that, to avoid reading $ 1343 to derogate
from the common-law revenue rule, we should construe the
otherwise-applicable language of the wire fraud statute to
except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes. Their argument relies on the canon of construction that "[s]tatutes
which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a
presumption favoring the retention of long-established and
familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the
contrary is evident." United States v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529,
534 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). This presumption is, however, no bar to a construction that conflicts
with a common-law rule if the statute " `speak[s] directly' to
the question addressed by the common law." Ibid.

Whether the wire fraud statute derogates from the
common-law revenue rule depends, in turn, on whether reading $ 1343 to reach this prosecution conflicts with a wellestablished revenue rule principle. We clarified this constraint on the application of the nonderogation canon in
United States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274 (2002). The issue in

Craft was whether the property interest of a tenant by the
entirety was exempt from a federal tax lien. Id., at 276.
We construed the federal tax lien statute to reach such a
property interest, despite the tension between that construction and the common-law rule that entireties property enjoys
immunity from liens, because this "common-law rule was not

360 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Id., at 288.5 So too here, before we may conclude that Congress intended to exempt the present prosecution from the
broad reach of the wire fraud statute, we must find that the
common-law revenue rule clearly barred such a prosecution.
We examine the state of the common law as of 1952, the
year Congress enacted the wire fraud statute. See Neder v.
United States, 527 U. S. 1, 22-23 (1999).6

The wire fraud statute derogates from no well-established
revenue rule principle. We are aware of no common-law
revenue rule case decided as of 1952 that held or clearly implied that the revenue rule barred the United States from
prosecuting a fraudulent scheme to evade foreign taxes.
The traditional rationales for the revenue rule, moreover, do
not plainly suggest that it swept so broadly. We consider
these two points in turn.

A

We first consider common-law revenue rule jurisprudence
as it existed in 1952, the year Congress enacted $ 1343.
Since the late 19th and early 20th century, courts have
treated the common-law revenue rule as a corollary of the

5 See also United States v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534 (1993) (requiring the
statute to " `speak directly' to the question addressed by the common
law"); Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108
(1991) (stating that this presumption is applicable "where a common-law
principle is well established"); United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411
(1957) (declining to interpret the term " `stolen' " in a federal criminal statute according to the common law because the term had "no accepted
common-law meaning").

6 These principles convince us that much more than the summary conclusion that it is "unavoidably obvious . . . that this prosecution directly implicates the revenue rule" and that this prosecution is " `primarily about enforcing Canadian law,' " post, at 377, 382 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), is
required to demonstrate that a revenue rule principle firmly established
as of 1952 bars this prosecution. That task requires inquiry into
common-law revenue rule jurisprudence--an inquiry the dissent does not
undertake.

Opinion of the Court
rule that, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, "[t]he Courts ofno country execute the penal laws of another." The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66, 123 (1825). The rule against the enforce-ment of foreign penal statutes, in turn, tracked the commonlaw principle that crimes could only be prosecuted in thecountry in which they were committed. See,

e. g., J. Story,Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws $ 620, p. 840 (M. Bigelow ed. 8th ed. 1883). The basis for inferring the revenuerule from the rule against foreign penal enforcement was an
analogy between foreign revenue laws and penal laws. SeeWisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., 127 U. S. 265, 290 (1888);
Leflar, Extrastate Enforcement of Penal and GovernmentalClaims, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 219 (1932) (hereinafter Leflar).

Courts first drew that inference in a line of cases prohibit-ing the enforcement of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the
courts of another sovereign, such as a suit to enforce a taxjudgment.

7 The revenue rule's grounding in these cases

shows that, at its core, it prohibited the collection of tax obli-gations of foreign nations. Unsurprisingly, then, the revenue rule is often stated as prohibiting the collection of for-eign tax claims. See Brief for Petitioners 16 (noting that
"[t]he most straightforward application of the revenue rulearises when a foreign sovereign attempts to sue directly in
its own right to enforce a tax judgment in the courts of an-other nation").

362 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The present prosecution is unlike these classic examples ofactions traditionally barred by the revenue rule. It is not a

suit that recovers a foreign tax liability, like a suit to enforcea judgment. This is a criminal prosecution brought by the
United States in its sovereign capacity to punish domes-tic criminal conduct. Petitioners nevertheless argue that
common-law revenue rule jurisprudence as of 1952 prohib-ited such prosecutions. Revenue rule cases, however, do not
establish that proposition, much less clearly so.

1
Petitioners first analogize the present action to severalcases that have applied the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in contrast to the directcollection of a tax obligation. They cite, for example, a decision of an Irish trial court holding that a private liquidatorcould not recover assets unlawfully distributed and moved
to Ireland by a corporate director, because the recoverywould go to satisfy the company's Scottish tax obligations.

foreign public authority"); Leflar 219 (stating the revenue rule as a prohibition on "extrastate actions for revenue collection"); Moore, supra, at 603
(L. Hand, J., concurring) (characterizing the revenue rule as an exception
to the rule that a "liability arising under the law of a foreign state will be
recognized by the courts of another"); Harbeck, supra, at 85, 133 N. E., at
360 (stating that the revenue rule "precludes one state from acting as a
collector of taxes for a sister state"); cf. Restatement (Third) of Foreign
Relations Law of the United States $ 483 (1986) (stating that the rule does
not require, but allows, courts to refuse enforcement of foreign tax
judgments).

Opinion of the Court
The court found that "the sole object of the liquidation pro-ceedings in Scotland was to collect a revenue debt," because

if the liquidator won, "every penny recovered after payingcertain costs . . . could be claimed by the Scottish Revenue."
Id., at 530. According to the Buchanan court, "[i]n everycase the substance of the claim must be scrutinized, and if it
then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purposeof collecting the debts of a foreign revenue it must be rejected." Id., at 529.

Buchanan and the other cases on which petitioners relycannot bear the weight petitioners place on them. Many of

them were decided after 1952, too late for the Congress thatpassed the wire fraud statute to have relied on them. Others come from foreign courts. Drawing sure inferences re-garding Congress' intent from such foreign citations is perilous, as several of petitioners' cases illustrate.10

suit by instrumentality of Brazil to recover for a conspiracy to circumvent
its foreign exchange regulations); United States v. Harden, [1963] 44
W. W. R. 630, 633, S. C. R. 366, 370-371 (Sup. Ct. Can.) (holding that a
stipulated judgment to pay U. S. taxes was not enforceable in Canadian
courts); Attorney-General for Canada v. Schulze, [1901] 9 Scots Law
Times 4, 4-5 (refusing to enforce judgment for court costs, where costs
were incurred by a foreign state in defending the legality of its forfeiture
of the defendant's goods as penalty for infraction of revenue laws); Indian

K. B. 539, 550 (holding that a private debtor was not entitled to deduct
U. S. income tax from its interest payments on loan due in England).

10 For example, in Government of India v. Taylor, 1955 A. C. 491 (H. L.),

on which petitioners rely heavily, the court's application of the revenue
rule rested in part on a ground peculiar to English law, namely, that an Act
of Parliament had excluded tax judgments from a statute that provided for
the enforcement of foreign judgments. That Act thus demonstrated that
the revenue rule "appear[ed] to have been recognized by Parliament."
Id., at 506; see also Borax, supra, at 549 (holding that a private debtor
was not entitled to deduct U. S. income tax from its interest payments on
a loan, in part because "there [was] an express Act of Parliament which

364 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
More important, none of these cases clearly establishesthat the revenue rule barred this prosecution. None involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authorityconferred by a criminal statute. The difference is significant. An action by a domestic sovereign enforces the sover-eign's own penal law. A prohibition on the enforcement of
foreign penal law does not plainly prevent the Governmentfrom enforcing a

domestic criminal law. Such an extension,to our knowledge, is unprecedented in the long history of

either the revenue rule or the rule against enforcement ofpenal laws.

Moreover, none of petitioners' cases (with the arguable ex-ception of

Banco Do Brasil, S. A. v. A. C. Israel CommodityCo., 12 N. Y. 2d 371, 190 N. E. 2d 235 (App. 1963)) barred

an action that had as its primary object the deterrence andpunishment of fraudulent conduct--a substantial domestic
regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax en-forcement. The main object of the action in each of those
cases was the collection of money that would pay foreign taxclaims. The absence of such an object in this action means
that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax collec-tion is incidental and attenuated at best, making it not
plainly one in which "the whole object of the suit is to collecttax for a foreign revenue."

Buchanan, supra, at 529.Even those courts that as of 1952 had extended the revenue

rule beyond its core prohibition had not faced a case closely
permits payment to the English Income Tax authorities to be a discharge
pro tanto of the debt which a person owes in respect of yearly interest to
another" while "[t]here [was] no Act of Parliament which allows payment
of income tax to another country to be reckoned as discharge"); Schulze,
supra, at 5 (holding that a foreign state could not recover court costs
incurred in defending the legality of a tax forfeiture, in part because "in
our [i. e., Scottish] law, the expenses of an action have always been regarded as a mere accessory or incident of the principal claim"). In addition, as we explain below, features peculiar to the American system of
separation of powers cast doubt on the notion that the revenue rule bars
this prosecution. See infra, at 369-370.

Opinion of the Court
analogous to this one--and thus we cannot say with any rea-sonable certainty whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule.Petitioners answer that the recovery of taxes is indeed the
object of this suit, because restitution of the lost tax revenueto Canada is required under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U. S. C. $$ 3663A-3664 (2000 ed. andSupp. II).

11 We do not think it matters whether the provision of restitution is mandatory in this prosecution. Re-gardless, the wire fraud statute advances the Federal Government's independent interest in punishing fraudulentdomestic criminal conduct, a significant feature absent from
all of petitioners' revenue rule cases. The purpose ofawarding restitution in this action is not to collect a foreign
tax, but to mete out appropriate criminal punishment forthat conduct.

In any event, any conflict between mandatory restitutionand the revenue rule would not change our holding today.
If awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contraryto the revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act not to allowsuch awards, rather than to assume that the later enacted
restitution statute impliedly repealed $ 1343 as applied tofrauds against foreign sovereigns.

2
We are no more persuaded by a second line of cases onwhich petitioners rely. Petitioners analogize the present

case to early English common-law cases from which the reve-nue rule originally derived. Those early cases involved contract law, and they held that contracts executed with thepurpose of evading the revenue laws of other nations were
enforceable, notwithstanding the rule against enforcing con11 See 18 U. S. C. $ 3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii) ("This section shall apply in all sentencing proceedings for convictions of . . . an offense against property
under this title . . . including any offense committed by fraud or deceit").

tracts with illegal purposes. See Boucher v. Lawson, Cas.T. Hard. 85, 89-90, 95 Eng. Rep. 53, 55-56 (K. B. 1734);

Planche v. Fletcher, 1 Dougl. 251, 99 Eng. Rep. 164 (K. B.1779). Petitioners argue that these cases demonstrate that
"indirect" enforcement of revenue laws is at the very core ofthe common-law revenue rule, rather than at its margins.

The argument is unavailing. By the mid-20th century, therevenue rule had developed into a doctrine very different
from its original form. Early revenue rule cases weredriven by the interest in lessening the commercial disruption
caused by the high tariffs of the day. As Lord Hardwickeexplained, if contracts that aimed at circumventing foreign
revenue laws were unenforceable, "it would cut off all benefitof such trade from this kingdom, which would be of very bad
consequence to the principal and most beneficial branches ofour trade." Boucher, supra, at 89, 95 Eng. Rep., at 56. By
the 20th century, however, that rationale for the revenuerule had been supplanted. By then, as we have explained,
courts had begun to apply the revenue rule to tax obligationson the strength of the analogy between a country's revenue
laws and its penal ones, see supra, at 360-361, supersedingthe original promotion-of-commerce rationale for the rule.
Dodge, Breaking the Public Law Taboo, 43 Harv. Int'l L. J.161, 178 (2002);

Buchanan, 1955 A. C., at 522-524, 528-529.The early English cases rest on a far different foundation

from that on which the revenue rule came to rest. Theythus say little about whether the wire fraud statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th-century form.

3
Granted, this criminal prosecution "enforces" Canadianrevenue law in an attenuated sense, but not in a sense that

clearly would contravene the revenue rule. From its earli-est days, the revenue rule never proscribed all enforcement
of foreign revenue law. For example, at the same time theywere enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of

Opinion of the Court
violating foreign revenue law, English courts also consideredvoid foreign contracts that lacked tax stamps required under

foreign revenue law. See Alves v. Hodgson, 7 T. R. 241, 243,101 Eng. Rep. 953, 955 (K. B. 1797); Clegg v. Levy, 3 Camp.
166, 167, 170 Eng. Rep. 1343 (N. P. 1812). Like the presentprosecution, cases voiding foreign contracts under foreign
law no doubt "enforced" foreign revenue law in the sensethat they encouraged the payment of foreign taxes; yet they
fell outside the revenue rule's scope. The line the revenuerule draws between impermissible and permissible "enforcement" of foreign revenue law has therefore always beenunclear.

The uncertainty persisted in American courts that recog-nized the revenue rule. In one of the earliest appearances
of the revenue rule in America, the Supreme Court of NewHampshire entertained an action that required extensive
recognition of a sister State's revenue laws. Henry v. Sar-geant, 13 N. H. 321 (1843). There, the plaintiff sought damages, alleging that a Vermont selectman had imposed an ille-gal tax on him. Id., at 331. The court found that the
revenue rule did not bar the action, id., at 331-332, thoughthe suit required the court to enforce the revenue laws of
Vermont, see id., at 335-338.Likewise, in

In re Hollins, 79 Misc. 200, 139 N. Y. S. 713(Sur. Ct.), aff 'd, 160 App. Div. 886, 144 N. Y. S. 1121 (1913),

aff 'd, 212 N. Y. 567, 106 N. E. 1034 (App. 1914) (per curiam),the court held that an estate executor could satisfy foreign
taxes due on a decedent's estate out of property of the estate,notwithstanding a legatee's argument that the revenue rule
barred authorizing such payments. 79 Misc., at 207-208, 139N. Y. S., at 716-717. The court explained:

"While it is doubtless true that this court will not aid aforeign country in the enforcement of its revenue laws,
it will not refuse to direct a just and equitable admin-istration of that part of an estate within its jurisdiction merely because such direction would result in the

Opinion of the Court
enforcement of such revenue laws." Id., at 208, 139N. Y. S., at 717.

These cases demonstrate that the extent to which the rev-enue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign revenue laws
was unsettled as of 1952. Following the reasoning of In reHollins, for instance, Congress might well have thought that
courts would enforce the wire fraud statute, even if doingso might incidentally recognize Canadian revenue law. The
uncertainty highlights that "[i]ndirect enforcement is . . .easier to describe than to define," and "it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between an issue involving merely rec-ognition of a foreign law and indirect enforcement of it." 1
A. Dicey & J. Morris, Conflict of Laws 90 (L. Collins gen. ed.13th ed. 2000). Even if the present prosecution is analogous
to the indirect enforcement cases on which petitioners rely,those cases do not yield a rule sufficiently well established
to narrow the wire fraud statute in the context of this crimi-nal prosecution.

B
Having concluded that revenue rule jurisprudence is noclear bar to this prosecution, we next turn to whether the

purposes of the revenue rule, as articulated in the relevantauthorities, suggest differently. They do not.

First, this prosecution poses little risk of causing the prin-cipal evil against which the revenue rule was traditionally
thought to guard: judicial evaluation of the policy-laden en-actments of other sovereigns. See,

e. g., Moore v. Mitchell,30 F. 2d 600, 604 (CA2 1929) (L. Hand, J., concurring). As

Judge Hand put it, allowing courts to enforce another coun-try's revenue laws was thought to be a delicate inquiry

"when it concerns the relations between the foreignstate and its own citizens . . . . To pass upon the provisions for the public order of another state is, or at anyrate should be, beyond the powers of a court; it involves

369Cite as: 544 U. S. 349 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
the relations between the states themselves, with whichcourts are incompetent to deal, and which are intrusted

to other authorities." Ibid.
The present prosecution creates little risk of causing inter-national friction through judicial evaluation of the policies of

foreign sovereigns. This action was brought by the Execu-tive to enforce a statute passed by Congress. In our system
of government, the Executive is "the sole organ of the fed-eral government in the field of international relations,"
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304,320 (1936), and has ample authority and competence to manage "the relations between the foreign state and its own citi-zens" and to avoid "embarass[ing] its neighbor[s]," Moore,
supra, at 604 (L. Hand, J., concurring); see also Chicago &Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S.
103, 111 (1948). True, a prosecution like this one requiresa court to recognize foreign law to determine whether the
defendant violated U. S. law. But we may assume that byelecting to bring this prosecution, the Executive has assessed this prosecution's impact on this Nation's relationshipwith Canada, and concluded that it poses little danger of
causing international friction. We know of no common-lawcourt that has applied the revenue rule to bar an action accompanied by such a safeguard, and neither petitioners northe dissent directs us to any. The greater danger, in fact,
would lie in our judging this prosecution barred based on theforeign policy concerns animating the revenue rule, concerns
that we have "neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility"to evaluate. Ibid.

More broadly, petitioners argue that the revenue ruleavoids giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws,regardless of whether courts need pass judgment on such
laws. See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S.398, 448 (1964) (White, J., dissenting) ("[C]ourts customarily

544US2 Unit: $U41 [02-25-08 10:17:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
370 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign
state, since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign"). This worries
us little here. The present prosecution, if authorized by the
wire fraud statute, embodies the policy choice of the two political branches of our Government--Congress and the Executive--to free the interstate wires from fraudulent use, irrespective of the object of the fraud. Such a reading of the
wire fraud statute gives effect to that considered policy
choice. It therefore poses no risk of advancing the policies
of Canada illegitimately.

Still a final revenue rule rationale petitioners urge is the
concern that courts lack the competence to examine the validity of unfamiliar foreign tax schemes. See, e. g., Leflar
218. Foreign law, of course, posed no unmanageable complexity in this case. The District Court had before it uncontroverted testimony of a Government witness that petitioners' scheme aimed at violating Canadian tax law. See App.
65-66.

Nevertheless, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1 addresses petitioners' concern by setting forth a procedure for
interpreting foreign law that improves on those available at
common law. Specifically, it permits a court, in deciding issues of foreign law, to consider "any relevant material or
source--including testimony--without regard to the Federal
Rules of Evidence." By contrast, common-law procedures
for dealing with foreign law--those available to the courts
that formulated the revenue rule--were more cumbersome.
See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
26.1, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1606 (noting that the rule improves
on common-law procedures for proving foreign law). Rule
26.1 gives federal courts sufficient means to resolve the incidental foreign law issues they may encounter in wire fraud
prosecutions.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Finally, our interpretation of the wire fraud statute doesnot give it "extraterritorial effect."

12 Post, at 378 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Petitioners used U. S. interstatewires to execute a scheme to defraud a foreign sovereign of

tax revenue. Their offense was complete the moment theyexecuted the scheme inside the United States; "[t]he wire
fraud statute punishes the scheme, not its success." UnitedStates v. Pierce, 224 F. 3d 158, 166 (CA2 2000) (internal quotation marks and brackets in original omitted); see Durland,161 U. S., at 313 ("The significant fact is the intent and purpose"). This domestic element of petitioners' conduct iswhat the Government is punishing in this prosecution, no
less than when it prosecutes a scheme to defraud a foreignindividual or corporation, or a foreign government acting as
a market participant. See post, at 379, n. 8 (Ginsburg, J.,dissenting) (noting that such prosecutions of foreign individuals, corporations, and governments are domestic applica-tions of the wire fraud statute).

13 In any event, the wire

fraud statute punishes frauds executed "in interstate or for12 As some indication of the novelty of the dissent's "extraterritoriality"
argument, we note that this argument was not pressed or passed upon
below and was raised only as an afterthought in petitioners' reply brief,
depriving the Government of a chance to respond. Reply Brief for Petitioners 17-18.

13 The dissent says that a scheme to defraud a foreign corporation or

individual "does not necessarily depend on any determination of foreign
law" and therefore "is of a different order." Post, at 379, n. 8 (opinion of
Ginsburg, J.). That is not so. Many such schemes will necessarily require interpretation of foreign law. Without proof of foreign law, it is
impossible to tell whether the scheme had the purpose of depriving the
foreign corporation or individual of valuable property interests as defined
by foreign law. See supra, at 355-356; United States v. Pierce, 224 F. 3d
158, 165-168 (CA2 2000). The fact that a prosecution might involve foreign revenue law, rather than any other type of foreign law, is relevant to
whether such a prosecution is in derogation of the revenue rule, see supra,
at 359-370, not to whether it is "extraterritorial."

eign commerce," 18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II), so this
is surely not a statute in which Congress had only "domestic
concerns in mind." Small v. United States, post, at 388.

* * *
It may seem an odd use of the Federal Government's resources to prosecute a U. S. citizen for smuggling cheap liquor into Canada. But the broad language of the wire fraud
statute authorizes it to do so, and no canon of statutory construction permits us to read the statute more narrowly.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.14

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
and with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Souter join
as to Parts II and III, dissenting.

This case concerns extension of the "wire fraud" statute,
18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II), to a scenario extraterritorial in significant part: The Government invoked the statute to reach a scheme to smuggle liquor from the United

tional wires. A relevant background norm, known as thecommon-law revenue rule, bars suit in one country to enforce

another country's tax laws.The scheme at issue involves liquor purchased from discount sellers in Maryland, trucked to New York, then smug-gled into Canada to evade Canada's hefty tax on imported
alcohol.1 Defendants below, petitioners here, were indictedunder $ 1343 for devising a scheme "to defraud the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario of excise dutiesand tax revenues relating to the importation and sale of liquor." App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a. Each of the six counts inquestion was based on telephone calls between New York
and Maryland. Id., at 60a-64a.The Court today reads the wire fraud statute to draw into
our courts, at the prosecutor's option, charges that anothernation's revenue laws have been evaded. The common-law
revenue rule does not stand in the way, the Court instructs,for that rule has no application to criminal prosecutions
under the wire fraud statute.As I see it, and as petitioners urged, Reply Brief 17-19,
the Court has ascribed an exorbitant scope to the wire fraudstatute, in disregard of our repeated recognition that "Congress legislates against the backdrop of the presumptionagainst extraterritoriality." See

EEOC v. Arabian Ameri-can Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (ARAMCO); Small v.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 700-701 (2004))).2 Notably, when
Congress explicitly addressed international smuggling, see
18 U. S. C. $ 546, it provided for criminal enforcement of the
customs laws of a foreign nation only when that nation has
a reciprocal law criminalizing smuggling into the United
States. Currently, Canada has no such reciprocal law.

Of overriding importance in this regard, tax collection internationally is an area in which treaties hold sway. See
Attorney General of Canada v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., 268 F. 3d 103, 115-119 (CA2 2001) (referencing tax
treaties to which the United States is a party). There is a
treaty between the United States and Canada regarding the
collection of taxes, but that accord requires certification by
the taxing nation that the taxes owed have been "finally determined." See Protocol Amending the Convention with
Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, Sept. 26, 1980,
S. Treaty Doc. No. 104-4, 2030 U. N. T. S. 236, 245, Art. 15,
|| 2 (entered into force Nov. 9, 1995) (hereinafter Protocol).
Moreover, the treaty is inapplicable to persons, like petitioners in this case, who are United States citizens at the time
that the tax liability is incurred. Id., at 246, Art. 15, || 8.

2 Petitioners' reliance on the presumption against extraterritorial application of laws enacted with domestic concerns in mind was no mere afterthought. See ante, at 371, n. 12. The presumption was explicitly featured in petitioners' reply brief. See Reply Brief 17-19, and n. 23
(observing, inter alia, that the presumption against extraterritoriality "is
especially true when criminal liability is at stake"); see also Brief for Petitioners 40, n. 46. Both parties ask us to determine the scope of $ 1343,
and the presumption against extraterritoriality is a guide to interpretation
of the kind courts ordinarily bring to bear in endeavoring to discern the
meaning of a legislative text. Moreover, the Government's responses to
petitioners' revenue rule arguments coincide with the Government's position on the presumption against extraterritoriality. Compare Brief for
United States 22-26 with Tr. of Oral Arg. 35, 46-47 (responding to the
Court's questions about extraterritoriality, counsel for the Government
asserted that Congress left to executive discretion the determination
whether "enforcement of [foreign] tax systems" is appropriate).

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Today's novel decision is all the more troubling for its fail-ure to take account of Canada's primary interest in the matter at stake. United States citizens who have committedcriminal violations of Canadian tax law can be extradited to
stand trial in Canada.3 Canadian courts are best positionedto decide "whether, and to what extent, the defendants have
defrauded the governments of Canada and Ontario out of
tax revenues owed pursuant to their own, sovereign, exciselaws." 336 F. 3d 321, 343 (CA4 2003) (en banc) (Gregory,

J., dissenting). I

The Government's prosecution of David Pasquantino, Carl
Pasquantino, and Arthur Hilts for wire fraud was grounded
in Canadian customs and tax laws. The wire fraud statute,
18 U. S. C. $ 1343, required the Government to allege and
prove that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud a
victim--here, the Canadian Government--of money or property. See ante, at 356 (describing Canada as the "victim" of
a scheme having "as its object the deprivation of Canada's
`property' "). To establish the fraudulent nature of the defendants' scheme and the Canadian Government's entitlement to the money withheld by the defendants, the United
States offered proof at trial that Canada imposes import duties on liquor, and that the defendants intended to evade
those duties. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a; App. 65-74.
The defendants' convictions for wire fraud therefore resulted
from, and could not have been obtained without proof of,
their intent to violate Canadian revenue laws. See United
States v. Pierce, 224 F. 3d 158, 166-168 (CA2 2000) ("If no
Canadian duty or tax actually existed, the [defendants] were
no more guilty of wire fraud than they would have been had

report excise taxes and possession of unlawfully imported spirits, 336 F. 3d
321, 343 (CA4 2003) (en banc) (Gregory, J., dissenting), but Canada has not
requested their extradition, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13, 30.

they used the wires" to smuggle liquor into New York City,
"in the sincere but mistaken belief that New York City imposes a duty on such . . . shipments.").

The United States Government's reliance on Canadian customs and tax laws continued at sentencing. The United
States Sentencing Guidelines mandated that the defendants
be sentenced on the basis of, among other things, the amount
by which the defendants defrauded the Canadian Government. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2F1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 2000). Accordingly, the District Court calculated the number of cases of liquor smuggled
into Canada and the aggregate amount of import duties
evaded by the defendants. The court concluded that the
Pasquantinos avoided over $2.5 million in Canadian duties,
and Hilts, over $1.1 million. See App. 97-101, 104-105.4

The resulting offense-level increases yielded significantly

4 The casual manner in which the Government and the District Court
reached these totals detracts from the Court's assertion that "[f]oreign
law, of course, posed no unmanageable complexity in this case." Ante,
at 370. In making its sentencing recommendation to the court, the Government did not proffer evidence of the precise rate at which Canada taxes
liquor imports, or reference any provisions of Canadian law. Rather, it
relied on the trial testimony of an intelligence officer with Canadian Customs, who surmised, based on her experience in working at the border,
that Canadian taxes on a $56 case of liquor would be approximately $100.
See App. 104. The customs officer was not offered as an expert witness
and "[t]he [D]istrict [C]ourt never determined whether [her] calculations
were accurate as a matter of Canadian law." 336 F. 3d, at 343 (Gregory,
J., dissenting). Thus, if foreign law posed no complexity in this case, it is
not because the parties and the court were easily able to interpret and
apply Canadian law, but rather because the Government and the court
made no serious attempt to do so. That no such effort was made here, in
derogation of the Government's and the court's shared obligation to ensure
that the calculations potentially affecting a defendant's sentence are as
accurate as possible, is "deeply troubling," ibid., and suggests that the
Government was unprepared to grapple with the details of foreign revenue laws.

longer sentences for the defendants.5 As Judge Gregorystated in dissent below, the fact that "the bulk of the defendants' sentences were related, not to the American crime ofwire fraud, but to the Canadian crime of tax evasion," shows
that "this case was primarily about enforcing Canadian law."336 F. 3d, at 342-343.

Expansively interpreting the text of the wire fraud stat-ute, which prohibits "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or
for obtaining money or property by means of . . . fraudulentpretenses," the Court today upholds the Government's deployment of $ 1343 essentially to enforce foreign tax law.This Court has several times observed that the wire fraud
statute has a long arm, extending to "everything designedto defraud by representations as to the past or present, or
suggestions and promises as to the future." Durland v.United States, 161 U. S. 306, 313 (1896). But the Court has
also recognized that incautious reading of the statute coulddramatically expand the reach of federal criminal law, and
we have refused to apply the proscription exorbitantly. SeeMcNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360 (1987) (refusing

5 I note that petitioners' sentences were enhanced on the basis of judicial
factfindings, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. See United States v.
Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 230-234 (2005) (Stevens, J., for the Court); see
also Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004). Despite the Court's
affirmance of their convictions, therefore, petitioners may be entitled to
resentencing. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 268 (Breyer, J., for the Court).
The Court declines to address the defendants' plea for resentencing, stating that "[p]etitioners did not raise this claim before the Court of Appeals
or in their petition for certiorari." See ante, at 372, n. 14. This omission
was no fault of the defendants, however, as the petition in this case was
filed and granted well before the Court decided Blakely. Petitioners thus
raised Blakely at the earliest possible point: in their merits briefing. The
rule that we do not consider issues not raised in the petition is prudential,
not jurisdictional, see Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S.
Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 32-33 (1993) (per curiam), and a remand on
the Blakely-Booker question would neither prejudice the Government nor
require this Court to delve into complex issues not passed on below.

than it has."); see also Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S.12, 24-25 (2000) (holding that $ 1341 does not reach schemes
to make false statements on a state license application, inpart based on reluctance to "approve a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction in the absence of a clearstatement by Congress").

6

Construing $ 1343 to encompass violations of foreign reve-nue laws, the Court ignores the absence of anything signaling Congress' intent to give the statute such an extraordi-nary extraterritorial effect.

7 "It is a longstanding principle

of American law," ARAMCO, 499 U. S., at 248, that Con-gress, in most of its legislative endeavors, "is primarily concerned with domestic conditions," ibid. (quoting Foley Bros.,Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). See also Small,
post, at 388 (interpreting the phrase "convicted in anycourt," 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), in light of the "commonsense
notion" that Congress ordinarily intends statutes to haveonly domestic application (quoting Smith v. United States,
507 U. S. 197, 204, n. 5 (1993))). Absent a clear statement of"the affirmative intention of the Congress," Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957), thisCourt ordinarily does not read statutes to reach conduct that
is "the primary concern of a foreign country," Foley Bros.,336 U. S., at 286; cf.

F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran

6 I note that, on the Court's interpretation, federal prosecutors could
resort to the wire and mail fraud statutes to reach schemes to evade not
only foreign taxes, but state and local taxes as well.

7 I do not read into $ 1343's coverage of frauds executed "in interstate

or foreign commerce," ante, at 371-372, congressional intent to give $ 1343
extraterritorial effect. A statute's express application to acts committed
in foreign commerce, the Court has repeatedly held, does not in itself indicate a congressional design to give the statute extraterritorial effect. See
ARAMCO, 499 U. S. 244, 250-253 (1991).

S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004) (referring to presumption that"legislators take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American laws").Section 1343, which contains no reference to foreign law
as an element of the domestic crime of wire fraud, contrastswith federal criminal statutes that chart the courts' course
in this regard. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 1956(c)(1) (defendantmust know that transaction involved the proceeds of activity
"that constitutes a felony under State, Federal, or foreignlaw"); 16 U. S. C. $ 3372(a)(2)(A) (banning importation of
wildlife that has been "taken, possessed, transported, or soldin violation of any . . . foreign law"). These statutes indicate
that Congress, which has the sole authority to determine theextraterritorial reach of domestic laws, is fully capable of
conveying its policy choice to the Executive and the courts.I would not assume from legislative silence that Congress
left the matter to executive discretion.8The presumption against extraterritoriality, which guides
courts in the absence of congressional direction, providesample cause to conclude that $ 1343 does not extend to the
instant scheme. Moreover, as to foreign customs and taxlaws, there is scant room for doubt about Congress' general

8 The application of 18 U. S. C. $ 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II) to schemes to
defraud a foreign individual or corporation, or even a foreign governmental entity acting as a market participant, is of a different order, and does
not necessarily depend on any determination of foreign law. As the Court
of Appeals observed in United States v. Boots, 80 F. 3d 580, 587 (CA1
1996), upholding a defendant's wire fraud conviction in a case like the one
here presented "would amount functionally to penal enforcement of Canadian customs and tax laws." See also ibid. (noting that courts "will enforce foreign non-tax civil judgments unless due process, jurisdictional, or
fundamental public policy considerations interfere" (citing Restatement
(Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States $ 483, and Reporters' Notes, n. 1 (1986)), but "[o]ur courts customarily refuse to enforce the
revenue and penal laws of a foreign state, since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign" (quoting

perspective: Congress has actively indicated, through both
domestic legislation and treaties, that it intends "strictly [to]
limit the parameters of any assistance given" to foreign nations. Attorney General of Canada v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., 268 F. 3d, at 119; see also United States
v. Boots, 80 F. 3d 580, 588 (CA1 1996) ("National [foreign]
policy judgments . . . could be undermined if federal courts
were to give general effect to wire fraud prosecutions for . . .
violating the revenue laws of any country.").

First, Congress has enacted a specific statute criminalizing
offenses of the genre committed by the defendants here: 18
U. S. C. $ 546 prohibits transporting goods "into the territory
of any foreign government in violation of the laws there in
force." Section 546's application, however, is expressly conditioned on the foreign government's enactment of reciprocal
legislation prohibiting smuggling into the United States.
See ibid. (prohibition applies "if under the laws of such foreign government any penalty or forfeiture is provided for
violation of the laws of the United States respecting the customs revenue"). The reciprocity limitation reflects a legislative determination that this country should not provide other
nations with greater enforcement assistance than they give
to the United States. The limitation also cabins the Government's discretion as to which nation's customs laws to enforce, thereby avoiding the appearance of prosecutorial overreaching. See 305 F. 3d 291, 297, n. 9 (CA4 2002) (Gregory,
J.) ("Where do we draw the line as to which countries' laws
we will help enforce?"), vacated and reh'g en banc granted,
2003 U. S. App. LEXIS 585, *1 (CA4, Jan. 14, 2003). Significantly, Canada has no statute criminalizing smuggling
into the United States, rendering $ 546 inapplicable to
schemes resembling the one at issue here.9

9 Section 546's requirement that a vessel have been used to transport
the goods to the foreign country would render $ 546 inapplicable to these
defendants' conduct in any event.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Second, the United States and Canada have negotiated,and the Senate has ratified, a comprehensive tax treaty, in

which both nations have committed to providing collectionassistance with respect to each other's tax claims. See Protocol Art. 15. Significantly, the Protocol does not call uponeither nation to interpret or calculate liability under the other's tax statutes; it applies only to tax claims that have beenfully and finally adjudicated under the law of the requesting
nation. Further, the Protocol bars assistance in collectingany claim against a citizen or corporation of "the requested
State." Id., at 246, Art. 15, || 8(a). These provisions wouldpreclude Canada from obtaining United States assistance
in enforcing its claims against the Pasquantinos and Hilts.I would not assume that Congress understood $ 1343 to provide the assistance that the United States, in the consideredforeign policy judgment of both political branches, has specifically declined to promise.

II
Complementing the principle that courts ordinarily shouldawait congressional instruction before giving our laws extraterritorial thrust, the common-law revenue rule holds thatone nation generally does not enforce another's tax laws.
See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 448(1964) (White, J., dissenting) (noting that "our courts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a for-eign state"); cf. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., 296
U. S. 268, 275-276 (1935). The Government argues, and theCourt accepts, that domestic wire fraud prosecutions premised on violations of foreign tax law do not implicate therevenue rule because the court, while it must "recognize foreign [revenue] law to determine whether the defendant vio-lated U. S. law,"

ante, at 369, need only "enforce" foreign law"in an attenuated sense." See ante, at 366; Brief for United

States 17-19. As discussed above, however, the defendants'conduct arguably fell within the scope of $ 1343 only because

544US2 Unit: $U41 [02-25-08 10:17:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
382 PASQUANTINO v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
of their purpose to evade Canadian customs and tax laws;shorn of that purpose, no other aspect of their conduct was

criminal in this country. See supra, at 375-377; Boots, 80F. 3d, at 587 ("[U]pholding defendants' section 1343 conviction would amount . . . to penal enforcement of Canadiancustoms and tax laws."). It seems to me unavoidably obvious, therefore, that this prosecution directly implicates the
revenue rule. It is equally plain that Congress did not en-deavor, by enacting $ 1343, to displace that rule.

The application of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Actof 1996, 18 U. S. C. $ 3663A, to wire fraud offenses is corroborative. Section 3663A applies to all "offense[s] against property," $ 3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii), and directs that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law . . . the court shall order . . .
that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the
offense," $ 3663A(a)(1) (emphasis added). The Government
acknowledges, however, that it "did not urge the district
court to order restitution in this case on the theory that it
was not `appropriate . . . since the victim is a foreign government and the loss derives from tax laws of the foreign government.' " Brief for United States 19-20 (quoting Letter
from United States Attorney S. Schenning to United States
District Chief Judge J. Motz, Feb. 16, 2001, App. 106). The
Government now disavows this concession. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 36 (While "the prosecutor did concede below that restitution was not appropriately ordered," it is in fact "[t]he position of the United States . . . that restitution under the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not infringe
the revenue rule."). Nevertheless, the very fact that the
Government effectively invited the District Court to overlook the mandatory restitution statute out of concern for
the revenue rule is revealing. It further demonstrates that
the Government's expansive reading of $ 1343 warrants this
Court's disapprobation.

Any tension between $ 3663A and the wire fraud statute,
the Government suggests and the Court accepts, would be

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
relieved if this Court construed $ 3663A to exclude restitu-tion that might encounter a revenue rule shoal. See ante,

at 365; Brief for United States 21. Congress, however, hasexpressed with notable clarity a policy of mandatory restitution in all wire fraud prosecutions. In contrast, Congresswas "quite ambiguous" concerning $ 1343's coverage of
schemes to evade foreign taxes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. TheMandatory Victims Restitution Act, in my view, is an additional indicator that "Congress . . . [did not] envision foreigntaxes to be the object of [a] scheme to defraud,"

id., at 35-36,and I would construe $ 1343 accordingly.

III
Finally, the rule of lenity counsels against adopting theCourt's interpretation of $ 1343. It is a "close question" whether the wire fraud statute's prohibition of "anyscheme . . . to defraud" includes schemes directed solely at
defrauding foreign governments of tax revenues. See id.,at 33. We have long held that, when confronted with "two
rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than theother, we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has
spoken in clear and definite language." McNally, 483 U. S.,at 359-360; see

United States v. Universal C. I. T. CreditCorp., 344 U. S. 218, 221-222 (1952).

This interpretive guide is particularly appropriate here.Wire fraud is a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C.$ 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II), and the money laundering
statute, $ 1956(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed.). See Cleveland, 531 U. S.,at 25. A finding that particular conduct constitutes wire
fraud therefore exposes certain defendants to the severecriminal penalties and forfeitures provided in both RICO,
see $ 1963 (2000 ed.), and the money laundering statute,$ 1956(a), (b) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).

385OCTOBER TERM, 2004
Syllabus

SMALL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 03-750. Argued November 3, 2004--Decided April 26, 2005
Petitioner Small was convicted in a Japanese court of trying to smuggle

firearms and ammunition into that country. He served five years in
prison and then returned to the United States, where he bought a gun.
Federal authorities subsequently charged Small under 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(g)(1), which forbids "any person . . . convicted in any court of,
a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . .
to . . . possess . . . any firearm." (Emphasis added.) Small pleaded
guilty while reserving the right to challenge his conviction on the
ground that his earlier conviction, being foreign, fell outside $ 922(g)(1)'s
scope. The Federal District Court and the Third Circuit rejected this
argument.

Held: Section 922(g)(1)'s phrase "convicted in any court" encompasses only

domestic, not foreign, convictions. Pp. 388-394.

(a) In considering the scope of the phrase "convicted in any court" it
is appropriate to assume that Congress had domestic concerns in mind.
This assumption is similar to the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application, see, e. g., Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285. The
phrase "convicted in any court" describes one necessary portion of the
"gun possession" activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.
Moreover, because foreign convictions may include convictions for conduct that domestic laws would permit, e. g., for engaging in economic
conduct that our society might encourage, convictions from a legal system that are inconsistent with American understanding of fairness, and
convictions for conduct that domestic law punishes far less severely, the
key statutory phrase "convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year" somewhat less reliably
identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue. In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors
to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at
issue. To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that
meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statute's language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish;
and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say, of

Syllabus
economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations. These considerations provide a convincing basis for applying the ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here. Thus, the
Court assumes a congressional intent that the phrase "convicted in any
court" applies domestically, not extraterritorially, unless the statutory
language, context, history, or purpose shows the contrary. Pp. 388-391.

(b) There is no convincing indication to the contrary here. The statute's language suggests no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.
To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statute's language creates anomalies. For example, in creating an exception allowing gun possession despite a conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime, $ 921(a)(20)(A) speaks of "Federal or State" antitrust or
regulatory offenses. If the phrase "convicted in any court" generally
refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.
But if the phrase includes foreign convictions, the words "Federal or
State" prevent the exception from applying where a foreign antitrust
or regulatory conviction is at issue. Such illustrative examples suggest
that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase "convicted
in any court" applies to foreign convictions. Moreover, the statute's
legislative history indicates no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions. Although the statutory purpose of keeping guns from those
likely to become a threat to society does offer some support for reading

$ 922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions, the likelihood that Congress,
at best, paid no attention to the matter is reinforced by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have
been fewer than a dozen instances in which such a foreign conviction has served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The United States Criminal Code makes it

"unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted inany court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a

term exceeding one year . . . to . . . possess . . . anyfirearm." 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1) (emphasis added).

The question before us focuses upon the words "convicted inany court." Does this phrase apply only to convictions entered in any domestic court or to foreign convictions as well?We hold that the phrase encompasses only domestic, not foreign, convictions. I

In 1994 petitioner, Gary Small, was convicted in a Japa-nese court of having tried to smuggle several pistols, a rifle,
and ammunition into Japan. Small was sentenced to fiveyears' imprisonment. 183 F. Supp. 2d 755, 757, n. 3 (WD Pa.
2002). After his release, Small returned to the UnitedStates, where he bought a gun from a Pennsylvania gun
dealer. Federal authorities subsequently charged Smallunder the "unlawful gun possession" statute here at issue.
333 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA3 2003). Small pleaded guilty whilereserving the right to challenge his conviction on the ground
that his earlier conviction, being a foreign conviction, felloutside the scope of the illegal gun possession statute. The
Federal District Court rejected Small's argument, as did theCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 183 F. Supp. 2d, at
759; 333 F. 3d, at 427, n. 2. Because the Circuits disagreeabout the matter, we granted certiorari. Compare

UnitedStates v. Atkins, 872 F. 2d 94, 96 (CA4 1989) ("convicted in

any court" includes foreign convictions); United States v.Winson, 793 F. 2d 754, 757-759 (CA6 1986) (same), with

Opinion of the Court

II

A

The question before us is whether the statutory reference
"convicted in any court" includes a conviction entered in a
foreign court. The word "any" considered alone cannot answer this question. In ordinary life, a speaker who says,
"I'll see any film," may or may not mean to include films
shown in another city. In law, a legislature that uses the
statutory phrase " `any person' " may or may not mean to
include " `persons' " outside "the jurisdiction of the state."
See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818)
(Marshall, C. J.) ("[G]eneral words," such as the word
" `any,' " must "be limited" in their application "to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them");
Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132
(2004) (" `any' " means "different things depending upon the
setting"); United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350,
357 (1994) ("[R]espondent errs in placing dispositive weight
on the broad statutory reference to `any' law enforcement
officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute"); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National
Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1981) (it is doubtful
that the phrase " `any statute' " includes the very statute in
which the words appear); Flora v. United States, 362 U. S.
145, 149 (1960) (" `[A]ny sum,' " while a "catchall" phrase,
does not "define what it catches"). Thus, even though the
word "any" demands a broad interpretation, see, e. g., United
States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997), we must look beyond
that word itself.

In determining the scope of the statutory phrase we find
help in the "commonsense notion that Congress generally
legislates with domestic concerns in mind. " Smi th v.
United States, 507 U. S. 197, 204, n. 5 (1993). This notion has
led the Court to adopt the legal presumption that Congress
ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extrater544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

389Cite as: 544 U. S. 385 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
ritorial, application. See Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336U. S. 281, 285 (1949); see also

Palmer, supra, at 631 ("The
words `any person or persons,' are broad enough to compre-hend every human being" but are "limited to cases within

the jurisdiction of the state"); EEOC v. Arabian American
Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 249-251 (1991). That presumption
would apply, for example, were we to consider whether this
statute prohibits unlawful gun possession abroad as well asdomestically. And, although the presumption against extraterritorial application does not apply directly to this case, webelieve a similar assumption is appropriate when we consider
the scope of the phrase "convicted in any court" here.

For one thing, the phrase describes one necessary portion
of the "gun possession" activity that is prohibited as a matter
of domestic law. For another, considered as a group, foreign
convictions differ from domestic convictions in important
ways. Past foreign convictions for crimes punishable by
more than one year's imprisonment may include a conviction
for conduct that domestic laws would permit, for example,
for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage. See, e. g., Art. 153 of the Criminal Code of the
Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, in Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure 171 (H. Berman & J. Spindler
transls. 2d ed. 1972) (criminalizing "Private Entrepreneurial
Activity"); Art. 153, id., at 172 (criminalizing "Speculation,"
which is defined as "the buying up and reselling of goods or
any other articles for the purpose of making a profit"); cf.,
e. g., Gaceta Oficial de la Republica de Cuba, ch. II, Art. 103,
p. 68 (Dec. 30, 1987) (forbidding propaganda that incites
against the social order, international solidarity, or the Communist state). They would include a conviction from a legal
system that is inconsistent with an American understanding
of fairness. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of State, Country Reports
on Human Rights Practices for 2003, Submitted to the House
Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 702-705,

390 SMALL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
1853, 2023 (Joint Comm. Print 2004) (describing failures of"due process" and citing examples in which "the testimony

of one man equals that of two women"). And they wouldinclude a conviction for conduct that domestic law punishes
far less severely. See, e. g., Singapore Vandalism Act,ch. 108, $$ 2, 3, III Statutes of Republic of Singapore,
pp. 257-258 (imprisonment for up to three years for an act
of vandalism). Thus, the key statutory phrase "convicted inany court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term

exceeding one year" somewhat less reliably identifies dan-gerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at
issue.

In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking
judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions
where foreign convictions are at issue. To somehow weed
out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory
definition is not consistent with the statute's language; it is
not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish;
and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign
court (say, of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal
obligations. Cf. 1 United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $ 4A1.2(h) (Nov. 2004) ("[S]entences resulting from foreign convictions are not counted" as a "prior
sentence" for criminal history purposes).

These considerations, suggesting significant differences
between foreign and domestic convictions, do not dictate our
ultimate conclusion. Nor do they create a "clear statement"
rule, imposing upon Congress a special burden of specificity.
See post, at 399 (Thomas, J., dissenting). They simply convince us that we should apply an ordinary assumption about
the reach of domestically oriented statutes here--an assumption that helps us determine Congress' intent where Congress likely did not consider the matter and where other indicia of intent are in approximate balance. Cf. ibid. We
consequently assume a congressional intent that the phrase

544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

391Cite as: 544 U. S. 385 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
"convicted in any court" applies domestically, not extraterri-torially. But, at the same time, we stand ready to revise

this assumption should statutory language, context, history,or purpose show the contrary.

B
We have found no convincing indication to the contraryhere. The statute's language does not suggest any intent to

reach beyond domestic convictions. Neither does it mentionforeign convictions nor is its subject matter special, say, immigration or terrorism, where one could argue that foreignconvictions would seem especially relevant. To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statute's lan-guage creates anomalies.

For example, the statute creates an exception that allowsgun possession despite a prior conviction for an antitrust or
business regulatory crime. 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20)(A). Indoing so, the exception speaks of "Federal or State" antitrust
or regulatory offenses. Ibid. If the phrase "convicted inany court" generally refers only to domestic convictions, this
language causes no problem. But if "convicted in any court"includes foreign convictions, the words "Federal or State"
prevent the exception from applying where a foreign anti-trust or regulatory conviction is at issue. An individual convicted of, say, a Canadian antitrust offense could not lawfullypossess a gun, Combines Investigation Act, 2 R. S. C. 1985,
ch. C-34, $$ 61(6), (9), but a similar individual convicted of,say, a New York antitrust offense, could lawfully possess
a gun.For example, the statute specifies that predicate crimes
include "a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence." 18U. S. C. $ 922(g)(9). Again, the language specifies that these
predicate crimes include only crimes that are "misdemean-or[s] under Federal or State law." $ 921(a)(33)(A). If "convicted in any court" refers only to domestic convictions, thislanguage creates no problem. If the phrase also refers to

544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
392 SMALL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
foreign convictions, the language creates an apparently
senseless distinction between (covered) domestic relations
misdemeanors committed within the United States and
(uncovered) domestic relations misdemeanors committed
abroad.

For example, the statute provides an enhanced penalty
where unlawful gun possession rests upon three predicate
convictions for a "serious drug offense." $ 924(e)(1) (2000
ed., Supp. II). Again the statute defines the relevant drug
crimes through reference to specific federal crimes and with
the words "offense under State law." $$ 924(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii)
(2000 ed.). If "convicted in any court" refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem. But
if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language
creates an apparently senseless distinction between drug
offenses committed within the United States (potentially
producing enhanced punishments) and similar offenses committed abroad (not producing enhanced punishments).

For example, the statute provides that offenses that are
punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to two years,
and characterized under state law as misdemeanors, are not
predicate crimes. $ 921(20). This exception is presumably
based on the determination that such state crimes are not
sufficiently serious or dangerous so as to preclude an individual from possessing a firearm. If "convicted in any court"
refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no
problem. But if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates another apparently senseless distinction between less serious crimes (misdemeanors punishable by more than one year's imprisonment) committed
within the United States (not predicate crimes) and similar
offenses committed abroad (predicate crimes). These illustrative examples taken together suggest that Congress did
not consider whether the generic phrase "convicted in any
court" applies to domestic as well as foreign convictions.

Opinion of the Court
The statute's lengthy legislative history confirms the factthat Congress did not consider whether foreign convictions

should or should not serve as a predicate to liability underthe provision here at issue. Congress did consider a Senate
bill containing language that would have restricted predicateoffenses to domestic offenses. See S. Rep. No. 1501, 90th
Cong., 2d Sess., 31 (1968) (defining predicate crimes in terms
of "Federal" crimes "punishable by a term of imprisonmentexceeding one year" and crimes "determined by the laws of

the State to be a felony"). And the Conference Committeeultimately rejected this version in favor of language that
speaks of those "convicted in any court of, a crime punishable
by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year," $ 928(g)(1).
See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 28-29
(1968). But the history does not suggest that this language
change reflected a congressional view on the matter before
us. Rather, the enacted version is simpler and it avoids
potential difficulties arising out of the fact that States may
define the term "felony" differently. And as far as the legislative history is concerned, these latter virtues of the new
language fully explain the change. Thus, those who use
legislative history to help discern congressional intent will
see the history here as silent, hence a neutral factor, that
simply confirms the obvious, namely, that Congress did not
consider the issue. Others will not be tempted to use or
to discuss the history at all. But cf. post, at 406 (Thomas,
J., dissenting).

The statute's purpose does offer some support for a reading of the phrase that includes foreign convictions. As the
Government points out, Congress sought to " `keep guns out
of the hands of those who have demonstrated that they may
not be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a
threat to society.' " Brief for United States 16 (quoting
Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103, 112
(1983)); see also Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55, 60-62,
66 (1980); Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 824

Thomas, J., dissenting
(1974). And, as the dissent properly notes, post, at 402-403,one convicted of a serious crime abroad may well be as dangerous as one convicted of a similar crime in the UnitedStates.

The force of this argument is weakened significantly, how-ever, by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have probably been no more than "10to a dozen" instances in which such a foreign conviction has
served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. This empirical fact reinforces the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter.

C
In sum, we have no reason to believe that Congress consid-ered the added enforcement advantages flowing from inclusion of foreign crimes, weighing them against, say, the po-tential unfairness of preventing those with inapt foreign
convictions from possessing guns. See supra, at 389. Thestatute itself and its history offer only congressional silence.
Given the reasons for disfavoring an inference of extraterri-torial coverage from a statute's total silence and our initial
assumption against such coverage, see supra, at 390-391, weconclude that the phrase "convicted in any court" refers only
to domestic courts, not to foreign courts. Congress, ofcourse, remains free to change this conclusion through statutory amendment.For these reasons, the judgment of the Third Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

country, bought a gun in the United States. This violated
18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person "who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year" to possess a firearm in or affecting commerce. Yet the majority
decides that Small's gun possession did not violate the statute, because his prior convictions occurred in a Japanese
court rather than an American court. In concluding that
"any" means not what it says, but rather "a subset of any,"
the Court distorts the plain meaning of the statute and departs from established principles of statutory construction.
I respectfully dissent.

I

In December 1992, Small shipped a 19-gallon electric
water heater from the United States to Okinawa, Japan, ostensibly as a present for someone in Okinawa. App. to Brief
for Appellant in No. 02-2785 (CA3), pp. 507a-510a, 530a-
531a, 534a, 598a (hereinafter Appellant's App.). Small had
sent two other water heaters to Japan that same year. Id.,
at 523a-527a. Thinking it unusual for a person to ship a
water tank from overseas as a present, id., at 599a, Japanese
customs officials searched the heater and discovered 2 rifles,
8 semiautomatic pistols, and 410 rounds of ammunition, id.,
at 603a-604a; id., at 262a, 267a, 277a.

The Japanese Government indicted Small on multiple
counts of violating Japan's weapons-control and customs
laws. Id., at 261a-262a. Each offense was punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 333 F. 3d 425,
426 (CA3 2003). Small was tried before a three-judge court
in Naha, Japan, Appellant's App. 554a, convicted on all
counts on April 14, 1994, 333 F. 3d, at 426, and sentenced to
5 years' imprisonment with credit for 320 days served, id.,
at 426, n. 1; Government's Brief in Support of Detention in
Crim. No. 00-160 (WD Pa.), pp. 3-4. He was paroled on
November 22, 1996, and his parole terminated on May 26,
1998. 333 F. 3d, at 426, n. 1.

A week after completing parole for his Japanese convic-tions, on June 2, 1998, Small purchased a 9-millimeter SWD

residence, business premises, and automobile revealed a.380-caliber Browning pistol and more than 300 rounds of

II
The plain terms of $ 922(g)(1) prohibit Small--a person"convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"--from possessing afirearm in the United States. "Read naturally, the word
`any' has an expansive meaning, that is, `one or some indis-criminately of whatever kind.' " United States v. Gonzales,
520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New Interna-tional Dictionary 97 (1976) (hereinafter Webster's 3d)); see
also Department of Housing and Urban Development v.Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 130-131 (2002) (statute making "any"
drug-related criminal activity cause for termination of publichousing lease precludes requirement that tenant know of the

jurisdiction of a federal agency allows no exception for themere denial of wrongdoing);

United States v. AlvarezSanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 356, 358 (1994) (statute referring to
"any" law enforcement officer includes all law enforcementofficers--federal, state, or local--capable of arresting for a

federal crime). No exceptions appear on the face of thestatute; "[n]o modifier is present, and nothing suggests any

imprisonment' "). The broad phrase "any court" unambiguously includes all judicial bodies 1 with jurisdiction to impose
the requisite conviction--a conviction for a crime punishable
by imprisonment for a term of more than a year. Indisputably, Small was convicted in a Japanese court of crimes punishable by a prison term exceeding one year. The clear
terms of the statute prohibit him from possessing a gun in
the United States.

Of course, the phrase "any court," like all other statutory
language, must be read in context. E. g., Deal v. United
States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993). The context of $ 922(g)(1),
however, suggests that there is no geographic limit on the
scope of "any court." 2 By contrast to other parts of the
firearms-control law that expressly mention only state or
federal law, "any court" is not qualified by jurisdiction. See
18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20) (excluding certain "Federal or State
offenses" from the definition of "crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"); $ 921(a)(33)(A)(i)
(defining a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" by

1 See, e. g., The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 335
(1966) (defining "court" as "a place where justice is administered,"
"a judicial tribunal duly constituted for the hearing and determination of
cases," "a session of a judicial assembly"); The Concise Oxford Dictionary
of Current English 282 (5th ed. 1964) (defining "court" as an "[a]ssembly
of judges or other persons acting as tribunal"); Webster's 3d 522 (1961)
(defining "court" as "the persons duly assembled under authority of law
for the administration of justice," "an official assembly legally met together for the transaction of judicial business," "a judge or judges sitting
for the hearing or trial of cases").

2 The Court's observation that "a speaker who says, `I'll see any film,'

may or may not mean to include films shown in another city," ante, at 388,
therefore adds nothing to the analysis. The context of that statement
implies that such a speaker, despite saying "any," often means only the
subset of films within an accessible distance. Unlike the context of the
film remark, the context of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1) implies no geographic
restriction.

reference to "Federal or State law").3 Congress' explicit useof "Federal" and "State" in other provisions shows that it

specifies such restrictions when it wants to do so.Counting foreign convictions, moreover, implicates no special federalism concerns or other clear statement rules thathave justified construing "any" narrowly in the past.

4 And

it is eminently practical to put foreign convictions to thesame use as domestic ones; foreign convictions indicate

dangerousness just as reliably as domestic convictions. SeePart III-B,

infra. The expansive phrase "convicted inany court" straightforwardly encompasses Small's Japanese

convictions. III

Faced with the inescapably broad text, the Court narrowsthe statute by assuming that the text applies only to domestic convictions, ante, at 388-389; criticizing the accuracyof foreign convictions as a proxy for dangerousness, ante,
at 389-390; finding that the broad, natural reading of thestatute "creates anomalies," ante, at 391; and suggesting
that Congress did not consider whether foreign convic-tions counted, ante, at 393. None of these arguments is
persuasive.

3 See also $ 921(a)(15) (defining a "fugitive from justice," who is banned
from possessing firearms under $ 922(g)(2), as "any person who has fled
from any State to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony"); $ 924(e)(2) (defining a "serious drug offense," which can trigger an
enhanced sentence, by reference to particular federal laws or "State law").

a federal statute authorizing pre-emption of state and local laws "prohibiting the ability of any entity" to provide telecommunications services. Id.,
at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that the statute did not provide the clear statement required for the Federal Government to limit the States' ability to restrict delivery of such services by

Thomas, J., dissenting

A
The Court first invents a canon of statutory interpreta-tion--what it terms "an ordinary assumption about the reach

of domestically oriented statutes," ante, at 390--to cabin thestatute's reach. This new "assumption" imposes a clear
statement rule on Congress: Absent a clear statement, astatute refers to nothing outside the United States. The
Court's denial that it has created a clear statement rule isimplausible.

Ibid. After today's ruling, the only way forCongress to ensure that courts will construe a law to refer to

foreign facts or entities is to describe those facts or entitiesspecifically as foreign. If this is not a "special burden of
specificity," ibid., I am not sure what is.The Court's innovation is baseless. The Court derives its
assumption from the entirely different, and well-recognized,canon against extraterritorial application of federal statutes:
"It is a longstanding principle of American law that legisla-tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant
to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the UnitedStates."

EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244,248 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the majority rightly concedes that the canon against extraterritori-ality itself "does not apply directly to this case."

Ante, at389. Though foreign as well as domestic convictions trigger $ 922(g)(1)'s prohibition, the statute criminalizes gun pos-session in this country, not abroad. In prosecuting Small,
the Government is enforcing a domestic criminal statute topunish domestic criminal conduct. Pasquantino v. United
States, ante, at 371-372 (federal wire fraud statute covers adomestic scheme aimed at defrauding a foreign government
of tax revenue).The extraterritoriality cases cited by the Court, ante, at
389, do not support its new assumption. They restrict fed-eral statutes from applying outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. See Smith v. United States, 507U. S. 197, 203-204 (1993) (Federal Tort Claims Act does not
apply to claims arising in Antarctica); Arabian American

of 1964 does not regulate the employment practices of American firms employing American citizens abroad); Foley Bros.,
Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285-286 (1949) (federal labor

States and a private contractor for construction work done
in a foreign country); United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610,
630-634 (1818) (statute punishing piracy on the high seas
does not apply to robbery committed on the high seas by a
noncitizen on board a ship belonging exclusively to subjects
of a foreign state). These straightforward applications of
the extraterritoriality canon, restricting federal statutes
from reaching conduct beyond U. S. borders, lend no support
to the Court's unprecedented rule restricting a federal statute from reaching conduct within U. S. borders.

We have, it is true, recognized that the presumption
against extraterritorial application of federal statutes is
rooted in part in the "commonsense notion that Congress
generally leg islates w ith domestic concer ns in mind. "
Smith, supra, at 204, n. 5. But my reading of $ 922(g)(1) is
entirely true to that notion: Gun possession in this country
is surely a "domestic concern." We have also consistently
grounded the canon in the risk that extraterritorially applicable U. S. laws could conflict with foreign laws, for example,
by subjecting individuals to conflicting obligations. Arabian American Oil Co., supra, at 248. That risk is completely absent in applying $ 922(g)(1) to Small's conduct.
Quite the opposite, $ 922(g)(1) takes foreign law as it finds it.
Aside from the extraterritoriality canon, which the Court
properly concedes does not apply, I know of no principle
of statutory construction justifying the result the Court
reaches. Its concession that the canon is inapposite should
therefore end this case.

Rather than stopping there, the Court introduces its new
"assumption about the reach of domestically oriented stat544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

utes" sua sponte, without briefing or argument on the point,5and without providing guidance on what constitutes a "domestically oriented statut[e]." Ante, at 390. The majoritysuggests that it means all statutes except those dealing with
subjects like "immigration or terrorism," ante, at 391, appar-ently reversing our previous rule that the extraterritoriality
canon "has special force" in statutes "that may involve for-eign and military affairs,"

Sale v. Haitian Centers Coun-cil, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 188 (1993) (provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply extraterritorially);cf. Palmer, supra (statute criminalizing piracy on the high
seas does not apply to robbery by noncitizen on ship belong-ing to foreign subjects). The Court's creation threatens to
wreak havoc with the established rules for applying thecanon against extraterritoriality.

In support of its narrow reading of the statute, the major-ity opines that the natural reading has inappropriate results.

It points to differences between foreign and domestic con-victions, primarily attacking the reliability of foreign convictions as a proxy for identifying dangerous individuals.
Ante, at 389-390. Citing various foreign laws, the Courtobserves that, if interpreted to include foreign convictions,

$ 922(g) would include convictions for business and speechactivities "that [United States] laws would permit," ante, at
389; convictions "from a legal system that is inconsistentwith an American understanding of fairness," ibid.; and con5 Neither party mentions the quasi-extraterritoriality principle that the
Court fashions. The briefs barely discuss the extraterritoriality canon
itself. The only reference to that canon is a footnote in the Government's
brief pointing out that it is inapposite. Brief for United States 44, n. 31.

6 The Court attempts to justify applying its new canon with the claim

that "other indicia of intent are in approximate balance." Ante, at 390.
This claim is false. Other indicia of intent are not in balance, so long as
text counts as an indicium of intent. As I have explained, Part II, supra,
the text of $ 922(g)(1) encompasses foreign convictions.

victions "for conduct that [United States] law punishes farless severely,"

ante, at 390. The Court therefore concludes
that foreign convictions cannot trigger $ 922(g)(1)'s prohibi-tion on firearm possession.

The Court's claim that foreign convictions punishable byimprisonment for more than a year "somewhat less reliably
identif[y] dangerous individuals" than domestic convictions,
ibid., is untenable. In compiling examples of foreign convic-tions that might trigger $ 922(g)(1),

ante, at 389-390, the
Court constructs a parade of horribles. Citing laws of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, Cuba, and Singapore, it cherry-picks a few egregious examples of convic-tions unlikely to correlate with dangerousness, inconsistent
with American intuitions of fairness, or punishable more se-verely than in this country.

Ibid. This ignores countless
other foreign convictions punishable by more than a yearthat serve as excellent proxies for dangerousness and culpability.7 Surely a "reasonable human being" drafting this
language would have considered whether foreign convictions
are, on average and as a whole, accurate at gauging dangerousness and culpability, not whether the worst-of-the-worst
are. Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 845, 854 (1992). The
Court also ignores the facts of this very case: A week after

completing his sentence for shipping two rifles, eight semiau-tomatic pistols, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition into

Japan, Small bought a gun in this country. It was eminentlyreasonable for Congress to use convictions punishable by imprisonment for more than a year--foreign no less than do-mestic--as a proxy for dangerousness.

Contrary to the majority's assertion, it makes sense to barpeople convicted overseas from possessing guns in the
United States. The Court casually dismisses this point withthe observation that only " `10 to a dozen' " prosecutions
under the statute have involved foreign convictions as predi-cate convictions.

Ante, at 394 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 32).The rarity of such prosecutions, however, only refutes the

Court's simultaneous claim, ante, at 389-390, that a paradeof horribles will result if foreign convictions count. Moreover, the Court does not claim that any of these few prosecu-tions has been based on a foreign conviction inconsistent
with American law. As far as anyone is aware, the handfulof prosecutions thus far rested on foreign convictions perfectly consonant with American law, like Small's convictionfor international gunrunning. The Court has no answer
for why including foreign convictions is unwise, let aloneirrational.

C
The majority worries that reading $ 922(g)(1) to includeforeig n convictions "creates anomalies" under other

firearms-control provisions. Ante, at 391-392. It is true,as the majority notes, that the natural reading of $ 922(g)(1)
affords domestic offenders more lenient treatment than for-eign ones in some respects: A domestic antitrust or business
regulatory offender could possess a gun, while a similar for-eign offender could not; the perpetrator of a state misdemeanor punishable by two years or less in prison could pos-sess a gun, while an analogous foreign offender could not.
Ibid. In other respects, domestic offenders would receiveharsher treatment than their foreign counterparts: One who

committed a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in theUnited States could not possess a gun, while a similar foreign offender could; and a domestic drug offender could re-ceive a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for unlawful
gun possession, while a foreign drug offender could not.
Ibid.

These outcomes cause the Court undue concern. They
certainly present no occasion to employ, nor does the Courtinvoke, the canon against absurdities. We should employ

that canon only "where the result of applying the plain lan-guage would be, in a genuine sense, absurd,

i. e., where it is
quite impossible that Congress could have intended the result . . . and where the alleged absurdity is so clear as to be
obvious to most anyone." Public Citizen v. Department of
Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 470-471 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541
U. S. 125, 141 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)
("avoidance of unhappy consequences" is inadequate basis for
interpreting a text); cf. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat.
122, 203 (1819) (before disregarding the plain meaning of a
constitutional provision, the case "must be one in which the
absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case,
would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application").

Here, the "anomalies" to which the Court points are not
absurd. They are, at most, odd; they may even be rational.
For example, it is not senseless to bar a Canadian antitrust
offender from possessing a gun in this country, while exempting a domestic antitrust offender from the ban. Congress might have decided to proceed incrementally and exempt only antitrust offenses with which it was familiar,
namely, domestic ones. In any event, the majority abandons
the statute's plain meaning based on results that are at most
incongruous and certainly not absurd. As with the extraterritoriality canon, the Court applies a mutant version of a
recognized canon when the recognized canon is itself inappo544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

site. Whatever the utility of canons as guides to congres-sional intent, they are useless when modified in ways that

Congress could never have imagined in enacting $ 922(g)(1).Even assuming that my reading of the statute generates
anomalies, the majority's reading creates ones even moredangerous. As explained above, the majority's interpretation permits those convicted overseas of murder, rape, as-sault, kidnaping, terrorism, and other dangerous crimes to
possess firearms freely in the United States. Supra, at 402-403, and n. 7. Meanwhile, a person convicted domestically
of tampering with a vehicle identification number, 18 U. S. C.$ 511(a)(1), is barred from possessing firearms. The majority's concern with anomalies provides no principled basis forchoosing its interpretation of the statute over mine.

D
The Court hypothesizes "that Congress did not considerwhether the generic phrase `convicted in any court' applies

to domestic as well as foreign convictions," ante, at 392, andtakes that as license to restrict the clear breadth of the text.
Whether the Court's empirical assumption is correct is any-one's guess. Regardless, we have properly rejected this
method of guesswork-as-interpretation. In Beecham v.
United States, 511 U. S. 368 (1994), we interpreted other pro-visions of the federal firearms laws to mean that a person

convicted of a federal crime is not relieved of the firearmsdisability unless his civil rights have been restored under
federal (as opposed to state) law. We acknowledged the pos-sibility "that the phrases on which our reading of the statute
turns . . . were accidents of statutory drafting," id., at 374;and we observed that some legislators might have read
the phrases differently from the Court's reading, "or, morelikely, . . . never considered the matter at all,"

ibid. Wenonetheless adhered to the unambiguous meaning of the

statute. Ibid.; cf. National Organization for Women, Inc.v.

Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 262 (1994) ("The fact that [the

Here, as in Beecham, "our task is not the hopeless one ofascertaining what the legislators who passed the law would
have decided had they reconvened to consider [this] particular cas[e]," 511 U. S., at 374, but the eminently more manage-able one of following the ordinary meaning of the text they

enacted. That meaning includes foreign convictions.The Court's reliance on the absence of any discussion of
foreign convictions in the legislative history is equally unconvincing. Ante, at 393. Reliance on explicit statements in
the history, if they existed, would be problematic enough.
Reliance on silence in the history is a new and even more
dangerous phenomenon. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.
v. Nigh, 543 U. S. 50, 73 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing the Court's novel "Canon of Canine Silence").

I do not even agree, moreover, that the legislative history is silent. As the Court describes, the Senate bill that
formed the basis for this legislation was amended in Conference, to change the predicate offenses from " `Federal'
crimes" punishable by more than one year's imprisonment

and "crimes `determined by the laws of a State to be a felony' " to conviction " `in any court of, a crime punishable by
a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.' " Ante, at 393.
The Court seeks to explain this change by saying that "the
enacted version is simpler and . . . avoids potential difficulties
arising out of the fact that States may define the term
`felony' differently." Ibid. But that does not explain why
all limiting reference to "Federal" and "State" was eliminated. The revised provision would have been just as simple, and would just as well have avoided the potential difficulties, if it read "convicted in any Federal or State court of
a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one
year." Surely that would have been the natural change if

Thomas, J., dissenting
expansion beyond federal and state convictions were not in-tended. The elimination of the limiting references suggests

that not only federal and state convictions were meant tobe covered.

Some, of course, do not believe that any statement or textthat has not been approved by both Houses of Congress and
the President (if he signed the bill) is an appropriate sourceof statutory interpretation. But for those who do, this
committee change ought to be strong confirmation of the factthat "any" means not "any Federal or State," but simply
"any." IV

The Court never convincingly explains its departure fromthe natural meaning of $ 922(g)(1). Instead, it institutes the
troubling rule that "any" does not really mean "any," butmay mean "some subset of `any,' " even if nothing in the context so indicates; it distorts the established canons againstextraterritoriality and absurdity; it faults without reason
Congress' use of foreign convictions to gauge dangerousnessand culpability; and it employs discredited methods of determining congressional intent. I respectfully dissent.

PACE v. DiGUGLIELMO, SUPERINTENDENT, STATECORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT GRATERFORD,

et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 03-9627. Argued February 28, 2005--Decided April 27, 2005
After the Pennsylvania Superior Court found petitioner's state postconviction petition untimely under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief
Act (PCRA) and the State Supreme Court denied review, petitioner
sought federal habeas. The District Court refused to dismiss the petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996's
(AEDPA) statute of limitations, finding that petitioner was entitled to
both statutory and equitable tolling while his PCRA petition was pending even though that petition was untimely under state law. Reversing,
the Third Circuit held, with regard to statutory tolling, that an untimely
PCRA petition is not "a properly filed application for State postconviction or other collateral review" that tolls AEDPA's limitations period under 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2), and that there were no extraordinary
circumstances justifying equitable tolling.

Held: Because petitioner filed his federal habeas petition beyond the deadline and is not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling for any of that
time period, his federal petition is barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations. Pp. 413-419.

(a) Petitioner is not entitled to statutory tolling. When this Court
held in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8, 11, that time limits on postconviction petitions are "condition[s] to filing," such that an untimely petition would not be deemed "properly filed," it reserved the question
"whether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered improperly
filed," id., at 8, n. 2. There are no grounds for treating the two differently. Under the common understanding of "properly filed" that guided
the Artuz Court, a petition filed after a time limit, which does not fit
within any exceptions to that limit, is no more "properly filed" than a
petition filed after a time limit permitting no exception. This commonsense reading is confirmed by the purpose of AEDPA's statute of limitations and is supported by Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214. Petitioner's
counterarguments--that "condition[s] to filing" are merely those conditions necessary to get a clerk to accept the petition, not conditions requiring judicial consideration; that a condition that must be applied on

Syllabus
a claim-by-claim basis cannot be a "condition to filing"; and that this
Court's interpretation is unfair to petitioners who try in good faith to
exhaust their state remedies--are rejected. Artuz does not require a
different result. There is an obvious distinction between time limits,
which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition, and the type of rule-of-decision procedural bars at
issue in Artuz, which go to the ability to obtain relief. Pp. 413-417.

(b) Because petitioner waited for years after his claims became available to file his PCRA petition and five more months once his PCRA
proceedings became final before seeking relief in federal court, he has
not established that he pursued his claims diligently. Thus, assuming
equitable tolling applies here, he is not entitled to equitable tolling.

410 PACE v. DiGUGLIELMO

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death PenaltyAct of 1996 (AEDPA) establishes a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas corpus petition. 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(d)(1). That limitations period is tolled, however,
while "a properly filed application for State post-convictionor other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending." $ 2244(d)(2). This case requiresus to decide whether a state postconviction petition rejected
by the state court as untimely nonetheless is "properly filed"within the meaning of $ 2244(d)(2). We conclude that it is
not, and hold that petitioner John Pace's federal petition istime barred.

In February 1986, petitioner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in a
Pennsylvania state court. He was sentenced to life in prisonwithout the possibility of parole. Petitioner did not file a
motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and he did not file a di-rect appeal. In August 1986, he filed a petition under the
Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa.Cons. Stat. $ 9541

et seq. (1988) (amended and renamed byAct No. 1988-47, $$ 3, 6, 1988 Pa. Laws pp. 337-342). These

proceedings concluded in September 1992, when the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court denied petitioner's untimely request
for discretionary review.Over four years later, on November 27, 1996, petitioner
filed another state postconviction petition, this time underthe Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.
Cons. Stat. $ 9541 et seq. (1998). The PCRA had replacedthe PCHA in 1988 and was amended in 1995 to include, for
the first time, a statute of limitations for state postconviction

petitions, with three exceptions.1 Although petitioner'sPCRA petition was filed after the date upon which the

new time limits became effective, the petition said nothingabout timeliness.

After reviewing petitioner's PCRA petition, appointedcounsel submitted a "no-merit" letter. On July 23, 1997, the
Court of Common Pleas dismissed the petition, without call-ing for a response from the Commonwealth. The court
noted that petitioner's claims previously had been litigatedand were meritless. Petitioner appealed. On May 6, 1998,
the Commonwealth filed a brief in response, asserting thatpetitioner's PCRA petition was untimely under the PCRA's
time bar, $ 9545(b), and citing as support Commonwealth v.
Alcorn, 703 A. 2d 1054 (Pa. Super. 1997). On May 28, 1998,petitioner responded by arguing that the time limit was

inapplicable to him. The Superior Court dismissed his peti-tion as untimely on December 3, 1998. The Superior Court
reasoned that petitioner's PCRA petition did not comewithin the statutory note following $ 9545(b), see

ibid., and
that petitioner had "neither alleged nor proven" that he
fell within any statutory exception, see $$ 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).App. 316-317. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review on July 29, 1999. Id., at 372.On December 24, 1999, petitioner filed a federal habeas

The District Court recognized that, without tolling, petitioner's petition was time barred.2 But itheld that petitioner was entitled to both statutory and equitable tolling for the time during which his PCRA petitionwas pending--November 27, 1996 to July 29, 1999. Beginning with statutory tolling, the District Court held that, even
though the state court rejected his PCRA petition as un-timely, that did not prevent the petition from being "properly

filed" within the meaning of $ 2244(d)(2). It reasoned thatbecause the PCRA set up judicially reviewable exceptions to
the time limit, the PCRA time limit was not a "conditionto filing" but a "condition to obtaining relief " as we described those distinct concepts in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S.4, 11 (2000). The District Court alternatively found extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.
Pace v. Vaughn, 71 Fed. Appx. 127 (2003) (not precedential).
With regard to statutory tolling, it relied on a line of ThirdCircuit cases to conclude that the PCRA time limit constitutes a "condition to filing" and that, when a state courtdeems a petition untimely, it is not "properly filed."

Id., at
128. With regard to equitable tolling, it held that therewere not extraordinary circumstances justifying that remedy. Id., at 129. Because Circuits have divided overwhether a state postconviction petition that the state court

statute of limitations on April 24, 1996 have until one year from the enactment of the habeas statute of limitations to file their petitions." App. 453,
503. Without tolling, therefore, petitioner's federal habeas petition was
filed well after the April 1997 deadline.

now affirm.In Artuz v. Bennett, supra, we held that time limits on

postconviction petitions are "condition[s] to filing," such thatan untimely petition would not be deemed "properly filed."
Id., at 8, 11 ("[A]n application is `properly filed' when itsdelivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings" including "time limitsupon its delivery"). However, we reserved the question we
face here: "whether the existence of certain exceptions to atimely filing requirement can prevent a late application from
being considered improperly filed." Id., at 8, n. 2. Havingnow considered the question, we see no grounds for treating
the two differently.As in

Artuz, we are guided by the "common usage" and"commo[n] underst[anding]" of the phrase "properly filed."

Id., at 8, 9. In common understanding, a petition filed aftera time limit, and which does not fit within any exceptions to
that limit, is no more "properly filed" than a petition filedafter a time limit that permits no exception. The purpose of
AEDPA's statute of limitations confirms this commonsensereading. On petitioner's theory, a state prisoner could toll
the statute of limitations at will simply by filing untimelystate postconviction petitions. This would turn $ 2244(d)(2)
into a de facto extension mechanism, quite contrary to thepurpose of AEDPA, and open the door to abusive delay.

Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214 (2002), points to the sameconclusion. In

Saffold, we considered whether $ 2244(d)(2)required tolling during the 4

1/2 months between the California appellate court's denial of Saffold's postconviction peti-tion and his further petition in the California Supreme

Court. The California Supreme Court denied the petition"on the merits and for lack of diligence," which raised the

question whether that court had dismissed for lack of merit,for untimeliness, or for both. Id., at 225 (internal quotation

marks omitted). Although we ultimately remanded, we ex-plained that, "[i]f the California Supreme Court had clearly
ruled that Saffold's 41/2-month delay was `unreasonable,' "i. e., untimely, "that would be the end of the matter, regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim, orwhether its timeliness ruling was `entangled' with the merits." Id., at 226 (emphasis added); see also id., at 236 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("If the California court held that all of[Saffold's] state habeas petitions were years overdue, then

they were not `properly filed' at all, and there would be notolling of the federal limitations period"). What we intimated in Saffold we now hold: When a postconviction peti-tion is untimely under state law, "that [is] the end of the
matter" for purposes of $ 2244(d)(2).Petitioner makes three principal arguments against this
reading. First, he asserts that "condition[s] to filing" aremerely those conditions necessary to get a clerk to accept the
petition, as opposed to conditions that require some judicial
consideration. Respondent David DiGuglielmo (hereinafterrespondent) characterizes petitioner's position, which the

dissent also appears to embrace, see post, at 426, as a juridi-cal game of "hot potato," in which a petition will be "properly
filed" so long as a petitioner is able to hand it to the clerkwithout the clerk tossing it back. Brief for Respondent 16.
Be that as it may, petitioner's theory is inconsistent with
Artuz, where we explained that jurisdictional matters and
fee payments, both of which often necessitate judicial scru-tiny, are "condition[s] to filing."

Opinion of the Court
fail to see how timeliness is any less a "filing" requirementthan the mechanical rules that are enforceable by clerks, if

such rules exist.5 For example, Pennsylvania Rule of Crimi-nal Procedure 901 (2005), which is entitled "Initiation of
Post-Conviction Collateral Proceedings," lists two manda-tory conditions: (A) the petition "shall" be filed within the
time limit, and (B) the proceedings "shall be initiated by fil-ing" a verified petition and "3 copies with the clerk of the
court in which the defendant was convicted and sentenced."The natural reading is that (A) is every bit as much of a
"condition to filing" as (B).Petitioner also argues that, because $ 2244(d)(2) refers to
a "properly filed application," then any condition that mustbe applied on a claim-by-claim basis, such as Pennsylvania's
time limit, cannot be a "condition to filing." (Emphasisadded.) Section 2244, however, refutes this position. Section 2244(b)(3)(C), for example, states that the court of apjudge shall order that the defendant be permitted to proceed in forma
pauperis").

5 Perhaps not unintentionally, petitioner fails to provide us any guidance

on exactly which Pennsylvania Rules are subject to a clerk's striking for
noncompliance. We doubt there are many such rules, both because few
truly mechanical rules exist and because the role of the clerk in refusing
petitions in most courts is quite limited. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 5(e) ("The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form
as required by these rules or any local rules or practices"); 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 Rule 3(b) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) ("The clerk must file the petition and
enter it on the docket"); see also Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas
Corpus Rule 3(b), 28 U. S. C., p. 42 (2000 ed., Supp. IV) ("Rule 3(b) requires
the clerk to file a petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply
with Rule 2. This rule . . . is not limited to those instances where the
petition is defective only in form; the clerk would also be required, for
example, to file the petition even though it lacked the requisite filing fee
or an in forma pauperis form"). Indeed, not even filing in the right court
would be a "condition to filing" under petitioner's limited theory. See 42
Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 5103(a) (2004) (instructing that, when a petition is filed
in the wrong court, it is not to be stricken but transferred to the proper
court). Under this theory, "filing" conditions may be an empty set.

the "requirements" of the subsection are not applicable tothe application as a whole; instead, they require inquiry into
specific "claim[s]." See $ 2244(b)(2)(A) ("claim" relies on a
new rule made retroactive); $ 2244(b)(2)(B) ("claim" with newfactual predicate).

6 In fact, petitioner's argument is inconsistent with $ 2244(d)(2) itself, which refers not just to a"properly filed application," but to a "properly filed application . . . with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim."(Emphasis added.)

Finally, petitioner challenges the fairness of our interpre-tation. He claims that a "petitioner trying in good faith to
exhaust state remedies may litigate in state court for yearsonly to find out at the end that he was never `properly filed,' "
and thus that his federal habeas petition is time barred.
Brief for Petitioner 30. A prisoner seeking state postconviction relief might avoid this predicament, however, by filing a "protective" petition in federal court and asking the
federal court to stay and abey the federal habeas proceedings until state remedies are exhausted. See Rhines v.
Weber, ante, at 278. A petitioner's reasonable confusion
about whether a state filing would be timely will ordinarily
constitute "good cause" for him to file in federal court. Ibid.

tentionally dilatory tactics," then the district court likely"should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition").

The dissent suggests that our conclusion in Artuz, thatstate procedural bars "prescrib[ing] a rule of decision for a
court" confronted with certain claims previously adjudicatedor not properly presented are not "filing" conditions, requires the conclusion that the time limit at issue here also isnot a "filing" condition.

Post, at 425-426; see Artuz v. Ben-nett, 531 U. S., at 10-11 (discussing N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law

$$ 440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994)). The dissent ig-nores the fact that Artuz itself distinguished between time
limits and procedural bars. 531 U. S., at 8-10. For pur-poses of determining what are "filing" conditions, there is an
obvious distinction between time limits, which go to the veryinitiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that
petition, and the type of "rule of decision" procedural barsat issue in Artuz, which go to the ability to obtain relief.

7

Far from requiring "verbal gymnastics," it must be the casethat a petition that cannot even be initiated or considered

due to the failure to include a timely claim is not "properlyfiled."

Id., at 10.For these reasons, we hold that time limits, no matter their

form, are "filing" conditions. Because the state court re-jected petitioner's PCRA petition as untimely, it was not
"properly filed," and he is not entitled to statutory tollingunder $ 2244(d)(2).

7 Compare, e. g., Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 901(A) (2005) (titled "Initiation of
Post-Conviction Collateral Proceedings" and listing compliance with the
time limit as one mandatory condition); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9545(b) (2002)
(titled "Jurisdiction and proceedings" and listing the time limit); Commonwealth v. Fahy, 558 Pa. 313, 328, 737 A. 2d 214, 222 (1999) (describing the

418 PACE v. DiGUGLIELMO

Opinion of the Court
We now turn to petitioner's argument that he is entitled
to equitable tolling for the time during which his untimely
PCRA petition was pending in the state courts.8 Generally,
a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights
diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance
stood in his way. See, e. g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans
Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96 (1990). Petitioner argues that he
has satisfied the extraordinary circumstance test. He reasons that Third Circuit law at the time he sought relief required him to exhaust his state remedies and thus seek
PCRA relief, even if it was unlikely the state court would
reach the merits of his claims, and that state law made it
appear as though he might gain relief, despite the petition's
untimeliness. Thus, he claims, "state law and Third Circuit
exhaustion law created a trap" on which he detrimentally
relied as his federal time limit slipped away. Brief for Petitioner 34. Even if we were to accept petitioner's theory, he
would not be entitled to relief because he has not established
the requisite diligence.

Petitioner's PCRA petition set forth three claims: that his
sentence was "illegal"; that his plea was invalid because he
did not understand his life sentence was without the possibility of parole; and that he received ineffective assistance of
counsel at "all levels of representation." App. 202, 220.
The first two of these claims were available to petitioner as
early as 1986. Indeed, petitioner asserted a version of his
invalid plea claim in his August 21, 1986, PCHA petition.
See id., at 144. The third claim--ineffective assistance of

8 We have never squarely addressed the question whether equitable tolling is applicable to AEDPA's statute of limitations. Cf. Pliler v. Ford,
542 U. S. 225 (2004). Because respondent assumes that equitable tolling
applies and because petitioner is not entitled to equitable tolling under
any standard, we assume without deciding its application for purposes of
this case.

Yet petitioner waited years, without any valid justification,to assert these claims in his November 27, 1996, PCRA petition.9 Had petitioner advanced his claims within a reason-able time of their availability, he would not now be facing
any time problem, state or federal.10 And not only did peti-tioner sit on his rights for years

before he filed his PCRApetition, but he also sat on them for five more months after

his PCRA proceedings became final before deciding to seekrelief in federal court. See id., at 372, 373. Under longestablished principles, petitioner's lack of diligence precludesequity's operation. See Irwin v. Department of Veterans
Affairs, supra, at 96; McQuiddy v. Ware, 20 Wall. 14, 19(1874) ("Equity always refuses to interfere where there has
been gross laches in the prosecution of rights").Because petitioner filed his federal habeas petition beyond
the deadline, and because he was not entitled to statutory orequitable tolling for any of that period, his federal petition
is barred by the statute of limitations. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

9 Petitioner's PCRA petition did cite allegedly "new" evidence to support his claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that
his plea was invalid because he did not understand his life sentence was
without the possibility of parole. However, this new evidence was not
new at all: It consisted of affidavits from petitioner's parents and brother
regarding a meeting they attended with petitioner's counsel and petitioner
in 1985 or 1986. App. 195-199.

window in which they may file a federal habeas corpuspetition. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1). The statute provides,

however, for tolling of the statute of limitations during thependency of any "properly filed application for State postconviction or other collateral review." $ 2244(d)(2). Underthe interpretation of that statutory provision adopted by the
Court today, a petition for state postconviction relief doesnot constitute a "properly filed application for . . . collateral
review," even if the application has been accepted, filed, andreviewed in full by the state court. The Court's chosen rule
means that a state application will not be deemed properlyfiled--no matter how long the state court has held the petition, how carefully it has reviewed the merits of the peti-tion's claims, or how it has justified its decision--if the court
ultimately determines that particular claims contained in theapplication fail to comply with the applicable state statute of
limitations. The Court's interpretation of $ 2244(d)(2) is notcompelled by the text of that provision and will most assuredly frustrate its purpose.1

I
The words "properly filed application for . . . collateral re-view" are not defined in AEDPA. We did, however, interpret those words in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), byconsidering their ordinary meaning in the context of the statutory scheme in which they appear. This Court has longunderstood that a "paper is filed when it is delivered to the
proper official and by him received and filed." United
States v. Lombardo, 241 U. S. 73, 76 (1916). In Artuz, weexpanded upon that understanding, explaining that an "application is `filed,' as that term is commonly understood,when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate
court officer for placement into the official record. And an

application is `properly filed' when its delivery and accept-ance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules

governing filings." 531 U. S., at 8 (citations omitted). Be-cause applications and claims are distinct, we held that a
petitioner's application for postconviction review is "prop-erly filed" even when his legal claims are procedurally
barred under state law.

Artuz left open the question presented here--whether astate statute of limitations that allows certain categories of

petitioners to file otherwise late applications is comparableto a general precondition to filing (such as the payment of a
filing fee) or is instead more akin to a procedural bar thatprevents a court from considering particular claims. Id., at
8-9, n. 2. If the state time bar at issue here is more likethe former, Pace's failure to comply with it would make his
application improperly filed under AEDPA. If, however,the state time bar is more like the procedural bar in Artuz,
Pace's failure to comply with it would not change the factthat his application was "properly filed." Before answering
that question, it is useful to explain why the state court ulti-mately found Pace's application to be untimely.

Pace filed the application in question--his second requestfor state postconviction review--

Stevens, J., dissenting
PCRA petition raised two claims that he alleged had notbeen presented during his first round of postconviction review: first, that his life-without-parole sentence was uncon-stitutional under state and federal law; and second, that his
guilty plea colloquy violated due process. Pace providednew evidence that he had not presented during his first
round of postconviction review, see App. 191, 195-201, and
explained to the court that his two new claims should not beprocedurally barred because they had not been "fully litigated or waived" under state law, id., at 191. Pace's justifi-cations for raising these two new claims make plain that he
was attempting to fit his application within the commonlyrecog nized judicial exceptions to Pennsylvania's thenapplicable state procedural bars.3At the time Pace filed his PCRA petition, no Pennsylvania
court had yet applied the PCRA statute of limitations to apetitioner whose conviction had become final prior to the effective date of the Act.4 Nor had the time in which Pace
had a right to file a federal habeas petition expired. Under

3 For instance, Pace argued that his failure to raise the claims below
should be excused because of ineffective assistance of counsel. See App.
191-194, 220-226. Pace also argued that a failure to consider the new
claim would constitute a "miscarriage of justice," id., at 192, 217-219, and
that his new claims challenged the legality of his sentence, id., at 189, 192.
To support each of these arguments, Pace cited state cases demonstrating
the existence of judicial exceptions to procedural default.

4 That time bar provides that "[a]ny petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of
the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the
petitioner proves that: (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the
result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the
claim . . . ; (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown
to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of
due diligence; or (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was
recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and
has been held by that court to apply retroactively." 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

date of the Act). Pace could not, however, obtain relief in afederal court without first exhausting his state remedies.
28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A). Thus, as far as Pace knew on No-vember 27, 1996, there was no state or federal statute of
limitations that precluded him from obtaining relief, but hewas required (1) by AEDPA to go to state court and (2) by
state law to demonstrate that his claim was not procedurallybarred. Unless Pace's PCRA petition tolled the federal
statute of limitations, his claims would be time barred infederal court on April 24, 1997.

Pace's petition was docketed and the court appointed coun-sel. On July 23, 1997, the state trial court denied relief on
the merits. Pace appealed. In May 1998, well after Pace'stime to file a federal habeas petition had expired, the Commonwealth filed a brief in the state appellate court, whichargued for the first time that Pace's petition was untimely
under the PCRA's statute of limitations. On December 3,1998, the state appellate court agreed, explaining that none
of Pace's several claims fell within the three statutory excep-tions to untimeliness contained in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9545(b)
(1998). The state appellate court's conclusion became finalon July 29, 1999. It is that determination that provides the
basis for this Court's ruling that, as a matter of federal law,the pleading that generated protracted litigation in the state
courts was never "properly filed" in the first place.

its of the applicant's claims. 531 U. S., at 8. To construe" `properly filed application' to mean `application raising

claims that are not mandatorily procedurally barred,' [wouldelide] the difference between an `application' and a `claim.'
Only individual claims, and not the application containingthose claims, can be procedurally defaulted under state
law . . . ." Id., at 9. Furthermore:

"Ignoring this distinction would require judges to engage in verbal gymnastics when an application containssome claims that are procedurally barred and some that

are not. Presumably a court would have to say that theapplication is `properly filed'

as to the nonbarred claims,
and not `properly filed' as to the rest. The statute,
however, . . . does not contain the peculiar suggestionthat a single application can be both `properly filed' and

not `properly filed.' Ordinary English would refer tocertain

claims as having been properly presented or
raised, irrespective of whether the application contain-ing those claims was properly filed."

Id., at 10.

The same reasoning applies with equal force to the PCRA
time bar, which in effect operates in the same manner as the
procedural bar in Artuz. Under the PCRA, the state courtmust determine not whether the entire application is time

barred, but rather whether individual claims are timebarred given the various exceptions enumerated in $ 9545(b).
See n. 3, supra. Imagine, for example, a Pennsylvania peti-tioner who states two claims in what is his second state habeas petition. The first claim asserts a violation of due proc-ess rights under

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), in
which the petitioner demonstrates that his failure to raise
the claim during his first round of state postconviction
review was "the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim" under 42 Pa. Cons.
Stat. $ 9545(b)(1)(i) (1998). The second claim asserts an
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based on the same evi544US2 Unit: $U43 [11-15-07 12:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dence raised in the petitioner's first PCRA application.
Under the rule announced by the Court today, a federal court
would be forced to conclude that the petitioner's first claim
was a "properly filed application for . . . collateral review"
for AEDPA purposes, while his second claim was improperly
filed. This is precisely the type of incoherent result that
Artuz sought to avoid.

Incoherent results will not be limited to petitions filed in
Pennsylvania. Many States provide exceptions from their
postconviction statutes of limitations that apply to applicants' individual claims. See, e. g., Alaska Stat. $ 12.72.020
(Lexis 2004) (exempting from the statute of limitations, inter
alia, any claims "based on newly discovered evidence"); Fla.
Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850 (2005 Supp. Pamphlet) (excepting
from the general time bar any claim based on newly discovered evidence, newly recognized rights, or neglect of counsel); Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 725, $ 5/122-1(c) (West Supp.
2004) (allowing for late filings when petitioner can show that
delay was not due to negligence and excepting entirely from
the limitations period any "claim of actual innocence"); Iowa
Code $ 822.3 (2003) (exception for any "ground of fact or law
that could not have been raised within the applicable time
period"); Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, $$ 1089(D)(4)-(8) (West
Supp. 2005) (requiring the reviewing court to examine each
claim and permitting late filing if any included claim could
not have previously been presented on account of legal or
factual unavailability). For all applications originating in
such States, federal district courts must now engage in the
very "verbal gymnastics" that Artuz condemned. See 531
U. S., at 10.

The Court's interpretation of "properly filed" in this context conflicts with the meaning we gave the phrase in Artuz.
Indeed, the Court's rule suggests that the phrase "properly
filed" takes on a different meaning when applied to time bars
than it does in the context of procedural bars. This Court

Stevens, J., dissenting
has generally declined to adopt rules that would give the
same statutory provision different meanings in different contexts, see, e. g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 386 (2005),
and I would decline to do so here.

It would be much wiser simply to apply Artuz's rule to
state time bars that, like the PCRA, operate like a procedural bar. In this case, the PCRA time bar's enumerated
exceptions, which require state courts to review the claims
elucidated in postconviction petitions and to determine
whether particular claims trigger the applicability of the
exceptions, plainly function like a procedural bar. Thus,
I would hold that Pace's petition was "properly filed"--it was
"delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer
for placement into the official record" and complied with the
"applicable laws and rules governing filings." Artuz, 531
U. S., at 8.

Application of the Artuz rule in this context is clearly consonant with the statutory text.5 A time bar is nothing more
than a species of the larger category of procedural bars that
may preclude consideration of the merits of the state petition, and may raise questions that are equally difficult to
decide. Indeed, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8,
the contention that a claim is untimely is an affirmative defense that can be waived. Because most state laws respecting untimely filings of postconviction petitions function in a
manner identical to the procedural bar at issue in Artuz,
there is no justification for giving special treatment to any
state rule based on untimeliness.

5 The majority claims that this interpretation of "properly filed" is inconsistent with the text of $ 2244(d)(2). See ante, at 416. But the rule I
favor relies on the same interpretation, of the same statutory text, that
we adopted in Artuz. See 531 U. S., at 10. Unless the Court means implicitly to overrule Artuz, its rule compels the conclusion that the singular
phrase "properly filed" takes on different meanings in different contexts.
That is the same interpretive exercise we unequivocally rejected in Clark
v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 386 (2005).

IV
A rule treating statutes of limitations equivalently to pro-cedural bars would accomplish the statutory purposes Congress sought to vindicate in AEDPA. Congress fashioned28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2) in order to provide a strong "incentive
for individuals to seek relief from the state courts beforefiling federal habeas petitions."

Duncan v. Walker, 533U. S. 167, 180 (2001). As we explained in Duncan:

"The tolling provision of $ 2244(d)(2) balances the inter-ests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period. Section 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaus-tion of state remedies by protecting a state prisoner's
ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while stateremedies are being pursued. At the same time, the provision limits the harm to the interest in finality by ac-cording tolling effect only to `properly filed application[s] . . . .' " Id., at 179-180.
In construing the words "properly filed," therefore, we mustconsider not only the "potential for delay in the adjudication

of federal law claims," but also the need to avoid overburden-ing district courts by encouraging "the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce."
Id., at 180. AEDPA, after all, was designed to "streamlineand simplify" the federal habeas system in order to reduce

the "interminable delays" and "shameful overloading" thathad resulted from "various aspects of this Court's habeas
corpus jurisprudence." Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S.236, 264-265 (1998) (

Scalia, J., dissenting). The Court'srule is unfaithful to these legislative goals.

The Court's principal justification for its rule is the fearthat allowing statutory tolling in this context would allow
prisoners to extend the federal statute of limitations indefi-nitely by repeatedly filing meritless state petitions. See
ante, at 413 ("[A] state prisoner could toll the statute of limi-tations at will simply by filing untimely state postconviction

544US2 Unit: $U43 [11-15-07 12:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
428 PACE v. DiGUGLIELMO

Stevens, J., dissenting
petitions"). That fear is misguided for two reasons. First,it ignores a basic fact that we have recognized repeatedly--

a "prisoner's principal interest, of course, is in obtainingspeedy federal relief on his claims." Rose v. Lundy, 455
U. S. 509, 520 (1982) (plurality opinion). Indeed, it is an un-derstatement to say that the vast majority of federal prisoners "have no incentive to delay adjudication of their claims,"
Duncan, 533 U. S., at 191 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Mostprisoners have precisely the opposite incentive because delaying the initiation of federal postconviction relief will al-most assuredly maximize their periods of incarceration.

Second, the Court's concern is premised on the incorrectassumption that the phrase "properly filed" has no meaningful content unless all untimely petitions are by definition im-proper. The reason that assumption is wrong is because any
claim that a state application has tolled the limitations periodwill always depend on the district court's finding that the
petition was "properly filed." In my view, it would be en-tirely appropriate, and consistent with the text and purposes
of AEDPA, to define "properly filed" as excluding any filingsdeemed by the district court to be repetitious or abusive. If
an application for postconviction review is not filed in goodfaith--filed, in other words, explicitly to prolong the federal
statute of limitations--it would be improper under AEDPA,and statutory tolling would not be appropriate. Federal and
state courts have considerable experience identifying andpreventing the kind of dilatory pleadings that concern the
Court today. See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,479-489 (1991). There is no reason that courts could not
engage in similar analyses to prevent state prisoners fromprolonging indefinitely the AEDPA statute of limitations.

6

6 Such an inquiry is consistent with Artuz, which distinguished between
properly filed applications and individual claims contained within those
applications. An application filed intentionally to prolong the federal
statute of limitations would be improper in its entirety. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how one particular claim in an application could be im544US2 Unit: $U43 [11-15-07 12:57:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

429Cite as: 544 U. S. 408 (2005)
Stevens, J., dissenting
Unfortunately, the most likely consequence of the Court'snew rule will be to increase, not reduce, delays in the federal

system. The inevitable result of today's decision will be aflood of protective filings in the federal district courts. As
the history of this case demonstrates, litigants, especiallythose proceeding pro se, cannot predict accurately whether
a state court will find their application timely filed. Becausea state court's timeliness ruling cannot be predicted with
certainty, prisoners who would otherwise run the risk ofhaving the federal statute of limitations expire while they
are exhausting their state remedies will have no choice butto file premature federal petitions accompanied by a request
to stay federal proceedings pending the exhaustion of theirstate remedies. Cf.

Rhines v. Weber, ante, at 278. TheCourt admits that this type of protective filing will result

from its holding. See ante, at 416. I fail to see any meritin a rule that knowingly and unnecessarily "add[s] to the
burdens on the district courts in a way that simple tolling. . . would not."

Duncan, 533 U. S., at 192 (Breyer, J.,dissenting).

Beyond increasing the burdens faced by district courts,the Court's tacit encouragement of countless new protective filings will diminish the "statutory incentives to proceedfirst in state court" and thereby "increase the risk of the
very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirementis designed to reduce." Id., at 180. Congress enacted

$ 2244(d)(2), along with $ 2254(b), to "encourage litigants firstto exhaust all state remedies and then to file their federal
habeas petitions as soon as possible." Id., at 181. TheCourt's rule turns that statutory goal on its head--in essence, encouraging all petitioners who have doubts re-garding the timeliness of their state petitions to file simultaneously for relief in federal and state court. Artuzappropriately prevented such a result with respect to proceproperly motivated to delay federal proceedings, while another claim was
"properly filed" under AEDPA.

BATES et al. v. DOW AGROSCIENCES LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 03-388. Argued January 10, 2005--Decided April 27, 2005
Petitioner Texas peanut farmers allege that their crops were severely

damaged by the application of respondent's (Dow) "Strongarm" pesticide, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered pursuant to its authority under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Petitioners gave Dow notice of their intent to
sue, claiming that Strongarm's label recommended its use in all peanutgrowing areas when Dow knew or should have known that it would
stunt the growth of peanuts in their soil, which had pH levels of at least
7.0. In response, Dow sought a declaratory judgment in the Federal
District Court, asserting that FIFRA pre-empted petitioners' claims.
Petitioners counterclaimed, raising several state-law claims sounding in
strict liability, negligence, fraud, and breach of express warranty. The
District Court rejected one claim on state-law grounds and found the
others barred by FIFRA's pre-emption provision, 7 U. S. C. $ 136v(b).
Affirming, the Fifth Circuit held that $ 136v(b) expressly pre-empted
the state-law claims because a judgment against Dow would induce it
to alter its product label.

Held:

1. Under FIFRA, which was comprehensively amended in 1972, a
manufacturer must obtain permission to market a pesticide by submitting a proposed label and supporting data to EPA, which will
register the pesticide if it is efficacious, it will not cause unreasonable
adverse effects on humans and the environment, and its label complies
with the statute's misbranding prohibition. A pesticide is "misbranded" if its label, for example, contains a statement that is "false or
misleading," $ 136(q)(1)(A), or lacks adequate instructions or warnings,

$$ 136(q)(1)(F), (G). A State may regulate the sale and use of federally
registered pesticides to the extent that regulation does not permit any
sales or uses prohibited by FIFRA, $ 136v(a), but "[s]uch State shall not
impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging
in addition to or different from those required under [FIFRA],"

$ 136v(b). Though tort litigation against pesticide manufacturers was a
common feature of the legal landscape in 1972, after this Court held in
Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, that the term "requirement" in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 included

432 BATES v. DOW AGROSCIENCES LLC

Syllabus
common-law duties, and therefore pre-empted certain tort claims
against cigarette companies, courts began holding that $ 136v(b) preempted claims such as petitioners'. Pp. 437-442.

2. FIFRA's pre-emption provision applies only to state-law "requirements for labeling or packaging." $ 136v(b). While the Fifth Circuit
was correct that "requirements" embraces both positive enactments and
common-law duties, it erred in supposing that petitioners' defective design, defective manufacture, negligent testing, and breach-of-express
warranty claims were premised on requirements for labeling or packaging. None of the common-law rules upon which these claims are based
requires that manufacturers label or package their products in any particular way. The Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion by reasoning that a finding of liability on these claims would induce Dow to alter
its label. This was error because the prohibitions of $ 136v(b) apply
only to "requirements." A requirement is a rule of law that must be
obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motives an optional
decision is not a requirement. The proper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of the common-law duty at issue, not for speculation
as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manufacturer to change its
label. Pp. 442-446.

3. Petitioners' fraud and negligent-failure-to-warn claims, by contrast,
are based on common-law rules that qualify as "requirements for labeling or packaging," since these rules set a standard for a product's labeling that Dow is alleged to have violated. While these common-law
rules are subject to $ 136v(b), it does not automatically follow that they
are pre-empted. Unlike the pre-emption clause in Cipollone, $ 136v(b)
prohibits only state-law labeling requirements that are "in addition to
or different from" FIFRA's labeling requirements. Thus, $ 136v(b)
pre-empts any statutory or common-law rule that would impose a labeling requirement that diverges from those set out in FIFRA and its
implementing regulations. It does not pre-empt a state-law requirement that is equivalent to, and fully consistent with, FIFRA's labeling
standards. This "parallel requirements" reading of $ 136v(b) finds
strong support in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470. Thus, although FIFRA does not provide a federal remedy to those injured as a
result of a manufacturer's violation of FIFRA's labeling requirements,
nothing in $ 136v(b) precludes States from providing such a remedy.
Dow's contrary reading of $ 136v(b) fails to make sense of the phrase "in
addition to or different from." Even if Dow offered a plausible alternative reading of $ 136v(b), this Court would have a duty to accept the
reading disfavoring pre-emption. See New York State Conference of
Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655.
The long history of tort litigation against manufacturers of poisonous
substances adds force to the presumption against pre-emption, for Con544US2 Unit: $U44 [11-04-07 13:27:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
gress surely would have expressed its intention more clearly if it had
meant to deprive injured parties of a long available form of compensation. Moreover, this history emphasizes the importance of providing
an incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care in distributing
inherently dangerous items. Finally, the policy objections raised
against this Court's reading of $ 136v(b) are unpersuasive. Pp. 446-452.

4. Under the "parallel requirements" reading of $ 136v(b), a state-law
labeling requirement must be equivalent to its federal counterpart to
avoid pre-emption. State law need not, however, explicitly incorporate
FIFRA's standards as an element of a cause of action. Because this
Court has not received sufficient briefing on whether the Texas law governing petitioners' fraud and failure-to-warn claims is equivalent to
FIFRA's misbranding standards and any relevant regulations, it is up to
the Fifth Circuit to resolve the issue in the first instance. Pp. 453-454.

Opinion of the Court
the United States. Dow obtained this registration in timeto market Strongarm to Texas farmers, who normally plant

their peanut crops around May 1. According to petition-ers--whose version of the facts we assume to be true at this
stage--Dow knew, or should have known, that Strongarmwould stunt the growth of peanuts in soils with pH levels of
7.0 or greater.2 Nevertheless, Strongarm's label stated,"Use of Strongarm is recommended in all areas where peanuts are grown," App. 108, and Dow's agents made equiva-lent representations in their sales pitches to petitioners.
When petitioners applied Strongarm on their farms--whosesoils have pH levels of 7.2 or higher, as is typical in western
Texas--the pesticide severely damaged their peanut cropswhile failing to control the growth of weeds. The farmers
reported these problems to Dow, which sent its experts toinspect the crops.

Meanwhile, Dow reregistered its Strongarm label withEPA prior to the 2001 growing season. EPA approved a
"supplemental" label that was for "[d]istribution and [u]se[o]nly in the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas,"
id., at 179, the three States in which peanut farmers experi-enced crop damage. This new label contained the following
warning: "Do not apply Strongarm to soils with a pH of 7.2or greater." Id., at 181.

After unsuccessful negotiations with Dow, petitionersgave Dow notice of their intent to bring suit as required by
the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer ProtectionAct

3 (hereinafter Texas DTPA). In response, Dow filed a

declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court, as-serting that petitioners' claims were expressly or impliedly

pre-empted by FIFRA. Petitioners, in turn, brought coun-terclaims, including tort claims sounding in strict liability
and negligence. They also alleged fraud, breach of war2 The term "pH," which stands for pondus hydrogenii, or "potential hydrogen," refers to the acidity of the soil.

Opinion of the Court
ranty, and violation of the Texas DTPA. The District Courtgranted Dow's motion for summary judgment, rejecting one

claim on state-law grounds and dismissing the remainder asexpressly pre-empted by 7 U. S. C. $ 136v(b), which provides
that States "shall not impose or continue in effect any re-quirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter."

The Court of Appeals affirmed. It read $ 136v(b) to pre-empt any state-law claim in which "a judgment against Dow

would induce it to alter its product label." 332 F. 3d 323,331 (CA5 2003). The court held that because petitioners'
fraud, warranty, and deceptive trade practices claims focusedon oral statements by Dow's agents that did not differ from
statements made on the product's label, success on thoseclaims would give Dow a "strong incentive" to change its
label. Those claims were thus pre-empted. Id., at 331-332.The court also found that petitioners' strict liability claim
alleging defective design was essentially a "disguised"failure-to-warn claim and therefore pre-empted.

Id., at 332.
It reasoned: "One cannot escape the heart of the farmers'
grievance: Strongarm is dangerous to peanut crops in soilwith a pH level over 7.0, and that was not disclosed to

them. . . . It is inescapable that success on this claim wouldagain necessarily induce Dow to alter the Strongarm label."
Id., at 332-333. The court employed similar reasoning tofind the negligent testing and negligent manufacture claims
pre-empted as well. Id., at 333.This decision was consistent with those of a majority of
the Courts of Appeals,4 as well of several state high courts,5
but conflicted with the decisions of other courts 6 and with

7 We granted

certiorari to resolve this conflict. 542 U. S. 936 (2004).

II
Prior to 1910 the States provided the primary and possiblythe exclusive source of regulatory control over the distribution of poisonous substances. Both the Federal Govern-ment's first effort at regulation in this area, the Insecticide
Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 331, and FIFRA as originally enactedin 1947, ch. 125, 61 Stat. 163, primarily dealt with licensing
and labeling. Under the original version of FIFRA, all pes-ticides sold in interstate commerce had to be registered with
the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary would registera pesticide if it complied with the statute's labeling standards
and was determined to be efficacious and safe.8 In 1970,EPA assumed responsibility for this registration process.

In 1972, spurred by growing environmental and safety con-cerns, Congress adopted the extensive amendments

9 that

"transformed FIFRA from a labeling law into a comprehen-sive regulatory statute."

Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467U. S. 986, 991 (1984). "As amended, FIFRA regulated the

use, as well as the sale and labeling, of pesticides; regulatedpesticides produced and sold in both intrastate and interstate
commerce; provided for review, cancellation, and suspensionof registration; and gave EPA greater enforcement authority." Id., at 991-992. The 1972 amendments also imposed

7 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Etcheverry v. Tri-Ag
Serv., Inc., No. S072524 (Cal. Sup. Ct.) (hereinafter Brief Amicus Curiae
for United States in Etcheverry). The Acting Solicitor General has since
adopted a contrary position. See Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 20.

8 If the Secretary declined registration, and the manufacturer refused

to make changes, the Secretary was required to register the pesticide

and required disappointed manufacturers to challenge a denial of registration through administrative review. 78 Stat. 190.

440 BATES v. DOW AGROSCIENCES LLC

Opinion of the Court
In 1978, Congress once again amended FIFRA, 92 Stat.
819, this time in response to EPA's concern that its evaluation of pesticide efficacy during the registration process diverted too many resources from its task of assessing the
environmental and health dangers posed by pesticides.
Congress addressed this problem by authorizing EPA to
waive data requirements pertaining to efficacy, thus permitting the agency to register a pesticide without confirming
the efficacy claims made on its label. $ 136a(c)(5). In 1979,
EPA invoked this grant of permission and issued a general
waiver of efficacy review, with only limited qualifications not
applicable here. See 44 Fed. Reg. 27932 (1979); 40 CFR

$ 158.640(b) (2004). In a notice published years later in 1996,
EPA confirmed that it had "stopped evaluating pesticide efficacy for routine label approvals almost two decades ago,"
Pesticide Registration Notice 96-4, p. 3 (June 3, 1996), available at http://www.epa.gov/opppmsd1/PR_Notices/pr96-4.html,
App. 232, and clarified that "EPA's approval of a pesticide
label does not reflect any determination on the part of EPA
that the pesticide will be efficacious or will not damage crops
or cause other property damage," id., at 5, App. 235. The
notice also referred to an earlier statement in which EPA
observed that " `pesticide producers are aware that they are
potentially subject to damage suits by the user community if
their products prove ineffective in actual use.' " Id., at 2,
App. 230 (quoting 47 Fed. Reg. 40661 (col. 2) (1982)). This
general waiver was in place at the time of Strongarm's registration; thus, EPA never passed on the accuracy of the statement in Strongarm's original label recommending the product's use "in all areas where peanuts are grown."

Although the modern version of FIFRA was enacted over
three decades ago, this Court has never addressed whether
that statute pre-empts tort and other common-law claims
arising under state law. Courts entertained tort litigation
against pesticide manufacturers since well before the pas544US2 Unit: $U44 [11-04-07 13:27:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sage of FIFRA in 1947,12 and such litigation was a commonfeature of the legal landscape at the time of the 1972 amendments.13 Indeed, for at least a decade after those amend-ments, arguments that such tort suits were pre-empted by

$ 136v(b) either were not advanced or were unsuccessful.See,

e. g., Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical Co., 736 F. 2d 1529
(CADC 1984). It was only after 1992 when we held in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, that the term"requirement or prohibition" in the Public Health Cigarette

Smoking Act of 1969 included common-law duties, and there-fore pre-empted certain tort claims against cigarette companies, that a groundswell of federal and state decisionsemerged holding that $ 136v(b) pre-empted claims like those
advanced in this litigation.This Court has addressed FIFRA pre-emption in a different context. In Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier,501 U. S. 597 (1991), we considered a claim that $ 136v(b)
pre-empted a small town's ordinance requiring a special permit for the aerial application of pesticides. Although the ordinance imposed restrictions not required by FIFRA or any
EPA regulation, we unanimously rejected the pre-emption
claim. In our opinion we noted that FIFRA was not
"a sufficiently comprehensive statute to justify an inference
that Congress had occupied the field to the exclusion of the

States." Id., at 607. "To the contrary, the statute leavesample room for States and localities to supplement federal

efforts even absent the express regulatory authorization of$ 136v(a)." Id., at 613.

As a part of their supplementary role, States have ampleauthority to review pesticide labels to ensure that they comply with both federal and state labeling requirements.14Nothing in the text of FIFRA would prevent a State from
making the violation of a federal labeling or packaging re-quirement a state offense, thereby imposing its own sanctions on pesticide manufacturers who violate federal law.The imposition of state sanctions for violating state rules
that merely duplicate federal requirements is equally con-sistent with the text of $ 136v.

III
Against this background, we consider whether petitioners'claims

15 are pre-empted by $ 136v(b), which, again, reads as

14 As EPA's Website explains, "Federal law requires that before selling
or distributing a pesticide in the United States, a person or company must
obtain registration, or license, from EPA. . . . Most states conduct a review
of the pesticide label to ensure that it complies with federal labeling requirements and any additional state restrictions of use." EPA, Pesticides: Regulating Pesticides, Evaluating Potential New Pesticides and
Uses, http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/index.htm (as visited Apr.
6, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). See also 4 F. Grad,
Treatise on Environmental Law $ 8.05, p. 8-140 (2004) ("All the state[s]
have some labeling requirements for pesticides, and these generally parallel [FIFRA] of 1947"); id., at 8-143 to 8-218 (reviewing the pesticide statutes of the 50 States).

15 The briefing and the record leave some confusion as to what precise

claims are at issue. In light of the posture of this case, we find it appropriate to address the following claims: breach of express warranty, fraud,
violation of the Texas DTPA, strict liability (including defective design
and defective manufacture), and negligent testing. We will also address
negligent failure to warn, since the Court of Appeals read petitioners'
allegations to support such a claim. But because petitioners do not press
such a claim here, we leave it to the court below to determine whether
they may proceed on such a claim on remand. Of course, we express no

544US2 Unit: $U44 [11-04-07 13:27:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
follows: "Such State shall not impose or continue in effectany requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or

different from those required under this subchapter."The introductory words of $ 136v(b)--"Such State"--appear to limit the coverage of that subsection to the Statesthat are described in the preceding subsection (a). Texas is
such a State because it regulates the sale and use of federallyregistered pesticides and does not permit any sales or uses
prohibited by FIFRA. It is therefore beyond dispute thatsubsection (b) is applicable to this case.

The prohibitions in $ 136v(b) apply only to "requirements."An occurrence that merely motivates an optional decision
does not qualify as a requirement. The Court of Appealswas therefore quite wrong when it assumed that any event,
such as a jury verdict, that might "induce" a pesticide manu-facturer to change its label should be viewed as a requirement. The Court of Appeals did, however, correctly holdthat the term "requirements" in $ 136v(b) reaches beyond
positive enactments, such as statutes and regulations, to em-brace common-law duties. Our decision in Cipollone supports this conclusion. See 505 U. S., at 521 (plurality opin-ion) ("The phrase `[n]o requirement or prohibition' sweeps
broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enact-ments and common law; to the contrary, those words easily
encompass obligations that take the form of common-lawrules"); see also id., at 548-549 (

Scalia, J., concurring injudgment in part and dissenting in part). While the use of

"requirements" in a pre-emption clause may not invariablycarry this meaning, we think this is the best reading of

$ 136v(b).That $ 136v(b) may pre-empt judge-made rules, as well as
statutes and regulations, says nothing about the scope of that
view as to whether any of these claims are viable as a matter of Texas
law. Nor do we, given the early stage of this litigation, opine on whether
petitioners can adduce sufficient evidence in support of their claims to
survive summary judgment.

Opinion of the Court
pre-emption. For a particular state rule to be pre-empted,it must satisfy two conditions. First, it must be a requirement "for labeling or packaging"; rules governing the de-sign of a product, for example, are not pre-empted. Second,
it must impose a labeling or packaging requirement that is"in addition to or different from those required under this
subchapter." A state regulation requiring the word "poi-son" to appear in red letters, for instance, would not be preempted if an EPA regulation imposed the same requirement.It is perfectly clear that many of the common-law rules
upon which petitioners rely do not satisfy the first condition.Rules that require manufacturers to design reasonably safe
products, to use due care in conducting appropriate testingof their products, to market products free of manufacturing
defects, and to honor their express warranties or other con-tractual commitments plainly do not qualify as requirements
for "labeling or packaging." None of these common-lawrules requires that manufacturers label or package their
products in any particular way. Thus, petitioners' claims fordefective design, defective manufacture, negligent testing,
and breach of express warranty are not pre-empted.To be sure, Dow's express warranty was located on
Strongarm's label.16 But a cause of action on an expresswarranty asks only that a manufacturer make good on the
contractual commitment that it voluntarily undertook byplacing that warranty on its product.

17 Because this

16 The label stated: "Dow AgroSciences warrants that this product conforms to the chemical description on the label and is reasonably fit for
the purposes stated on the label when used in strict accordance with the
directions, subject to the inherent risks set forth below." App. 111.

17 To the extent that petitioners' warranty and fraud claims are based

on oral representations made by Dow's agents, they fall outside the text
of $ 136v(b) for an independent reason. Because FIFRA defines labeling
as "all labels and all other written, printed, or graphic matter" that accompany a pesticide, $ 136(p)(2), any requirement that applied to a sales
agent's oral representations would not be a requirement for "labeling or
packaging."

Opinion of the Court
common-law rule does not require the manufacturer to make
an express warranty, or in the event that the manufacturer
elects to do so, to say anything in particular in that warranty,
the rule does not impose a requirement "for labeling or packaging." See id., at 525-526 (plurality opinion).18

In arriving at a different conclusion, the court below reasoned that a finding of liability on these claims would "induce
Dow to alter [its] label." 332 F. 3d, at 332.19 This effectsbased test finds no support in the text of $ 136v(b), which
speaks only of "requirements." A requirement is a rule of
law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict,
that merely motivates an optional decision is not a requirement. The proper inquiry calls for an examination of the
elements of the common-law duty at issue, see Cipollone, 505
U. S., at 524 (plurality opinion); it does not call for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manufacturer to take any particular action (a question, in any event,
that will depend on a variety of cost/ benefit calculations best
left to the manufacturer's accountants).

The inducement test is unquestionably overbroad because
it would impeach many "genuine" design defect claims that
Dow concedes are not pre-empted. A design defect claim,
if successful, would surely induce a manufacturer to alter its
label to reflect a change in the list of ingredients or a change
in the instructions for use necessitated by the improvement

18 The Court of Appeals held that petitioners' claim under the Texas
DTPA was pre-empted insofar as the Act provides a remedy for the breach
of an express warranty. 332 F. 3d 323, 332 (CA5 2003) (citing Texas law).
Because petitioners' warranty claim is not pre-empted, their claim under
the Act is not pre-empted to that extent.

19 Other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar approach. See, e. g.,

Netland, 284 F. 3d, at 900 ("Thus, our task is to determine whether Netland's claims are essentially a challenge to Bovinol's label or the overall
design of the pesticide. To guide our analysis, we must ask whether in
seeking to avoid liability for any error, would the manufacturer choose to
alter the label or the product").

Opinion of the Court
in the product's design. Moreover, the inducement test is
not entirely consistent with $ 136v(a), which confirms the
State's broad authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides.20 Under $ 136v(a), a state agency may ban the sale of
a pesticide if it finds, for instance, that one of the pesticide's
label-approved uses is unsafe. This ban might well induce
the manufacturer to change its label to warn against this
questioned use. Under the inducement test, however, such
a restriction would anomalously qualify as a "labeling" requirement. It is highly unlikely that Congress endeavored
to draw a line between the type of indirect pressure caused
by a State's power to impose sales and use restrictions and
the even more attenuated pressure exerted by common-law
suits. The inducement test is not supported by either the
text or the structure of the statute.

Unl i ke their other clai ms, petiti oners' fraud and
negligent-failure-to-warn claims are premised on commonlaw rules that qualify as "requirements for labeling or packaging." These rules set a standard for a product's labeling
that the Strongarm label is alleged to have violated by containing false statements and inadequate warnings. While
the courts of appeals have rightly found guidance in Cipollone's interpretation of "requirements," some of those courts
too quickly concluded that failure-to-warn claims were preempted under FIFRA, as they were in Cipollone, without
paying attention to the rather obvious textual differences
between the two pre-emption clauses.21

20 In Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597 (1991), we
noted that $ 136v(a) is merely declaratory of the authority that the States
retained after FIFRA; that provision did not "serve to hand back to the
States powers that the statute had impliedly usurped." Id., at 614.

21 See, e. g., Taylor AG Industries v. Pure-Gro, 54 F. 3d 555, 559 (CA9

1995) ("There is no notable difference between the language in the 1969
Cigarette Act and the language in FIFRA"); Shaw v. Dow Brands, Inc.,
994 F. 2d 364, 371 (CA7 1993) ("Not even the most dedicated hair-splitter
could distinguish these statements").

Opinion of the Court
Unlike the pre-emption clause at issue in Cipollone,22

$ 136v(b) prohibits only state-law labeling and packaging requirements that are "in addition to or different from" the
labeling and packaging requirements under FIFRA. Thus,
a state-law labeling requirement is not pre-empted by

$ 136v(b) if it is equivalent to, and fully consistent with,
FIFRA's misbranding provisions. Petitioners argue that
their claims based on fraud and failure to warn are not preempted because these common-law duties are equivalent to
FIFRA's requirements that a pesticide label not contain
"false or misleading" statements, $ 136(q)(1)(A), or inadequate instructions or warnings. $$ 136(q)(1)(F), (G). We
agree with petitioners insofar as we hold that state law need
not explicitly incorporate FIFRA's standards as an element
of a cause of action in order to survive pre-emption. As we
will discuss below, however, we leave it to the Court of Appeals to decide in the first instance whether these particular
common-law duties are equivalent to FIFRA's misbranding
standards.

The "parallel requirements" reading of $ 136v(b) that we
adopt today finds strong support in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,
518 U. S. 470 (1996). In addressing a similarly worded preemption provision in a statute regulating medical devices,
we found that "[n]othing in [21 U. S. C.] $ 360k denies Florida
the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of common-law duties when those duties parallel federal requirements." Id., at 495.23 As Justice O'Connor

22 "No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be
imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of
any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the
provisions of this [Act]." 15 U. S. C. $ 1334(b); Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 515.

23 We added: "Even if it may be necessary as a matter of Florida law to

prove that those violations were the result of negligent conduct, or that
they created an unreasonable hazard for users of the product, such additional elements of the state-law cause of action would make the state requirements narrower, not broader, than the federal requirement. While

Opinion of the Court
explained in her separate opinion, a state cause of action that
seeks to enforce a federal requirement "does not impose a
requirement that is `different from, or in addition to,' requirements under federal law. To be sure, the threat of a
damages remedy will give manufacturers an additional cause
to comply, but the requirements imposed on them under
state and federal law do not differ. Section 360k does not
preclude States from imposing different or additional remedies, but only different or additional requirements." Id., at
513 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Accordingly, although FIFRA does not provide a federal remedy to farmers and others who are injured as a result of a
manufacturer's violation of FIFRA's labeling requirements,
nothing in $ 136v(b) precludes States from providing such a
remedy.

Dow, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, argues
that the "parallel requirements" reading of $ 136v(b) would
"give juries in 50 States the authority to give content to
FIFRA's misbranding prohibition, establishing a crazy-quilt
of anti-misbranding requirements different from the one defined by FIFRA itself and intended by Congress to be interpreted authoritatively by EPA." Brief for Respondent 16;
see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-27.
In our view, however, the clear text of $ 136v(b) and the authority of Medtronic cannot be so easily avoided. Conspicuously absent from the submissions by Dow and the United
States is any plausible alternative interpretation of "in addition to or different from" that would give that phrase meaning. Instead, they appear to favor reading those words out
of the statute, which would leave the following: "Such State
shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for

such a narrower requirement might be `different from' the federal rules
in a literal sense, such a difference would surely provide a strange reason
for finding pre-emption of a state rule insofar as it duplicates the federal
rule." 518 U. S., at 495.

Opinion of the Court
labeling or packaging." This amputated version of $ 136v(b)
would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded the
pre-emption of all state requirements concerning labeling.
That Congress added the remainder of the provision is evidence of its intent to draw a distinction between state labeling requirements that are pre-empted and those that are not.

Even if Dow had offered us a plausible alternative reading
of $ 136v(b)--indeed, even if its alternative were just as plausible as our reading of that text--we would nevertheless
have a duty to accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.
"[B]ecause the States are independent sovereigns in our federal system, we have long presumed that Congress does not
cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action." Medtronic,
518 U. S., at 485. In areas of traditional state regulation,
we assume that a federal statute has not supplanted state
law unless Congress has made such an intention " `clear and
manifest.' " New York State Conference of Blue Cross &
Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655
(1995) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.
218, 230 (1947)); see also Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 485. Our
reading is at once the only one that makes sense of each
phrase in $ 136v(b) and the one favored by our canons of interpretation. The notion that FIFRA contains a nonambiguous command to pre-empt the types of tort claims that parallel FIFRA's misbranding requirements is particularly
dubious given that just five years ago the United States advocated the interpretation that we adopt today.24

The long history of tort litigation against manufacturers
of poisonous substances adds force to the basic presumption
against pre-emption. If Congress had intended to deprive
injured parties of a long available form of compensation, it
surely would have expressed that intent more clearly. See

24 Brief Amicus Curiae for United States in Etcheverry 33-35. See
also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (explaining its subsequent change in view).

Opinion of the Court
Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984).25Moreover, this history emphasizes the importance of providing an incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care inthe business of distributing inherently dangerous items.
See Mortier, 501 U. S., at 613 (stating that the 1972 amend-ments' goal was to "strengthen existing labeling requirements and ensure that these requirements were followedin practice"). Particularly given that Congress amended
FIFRA to allow EPA to waive efficacy review of newly reg-istered pesticides (and in the course of those amendments
made technical changes to $ 136v(b)), it seems unlikely that
Congress considered a relatively obscure provision like$ 136v(b) to give pesticide manufacturers virtual immunity

from certain forms of tort liability. Overenforcement ofFIFRA's misbranding prohibition creates a risk of imposing
unnecessary financial burdens on manufacturers; under-enforcement creates not only financial risks for consumers,
but risks that affect their safety and the environment as well.Finally, we find the policy objections raised against our
reading of $ 136v(b) to be unpersuasive. Dow and the
United States greatly overstate the degree of uniformity andcentralization that characterizes FIFRA. In fact, the statute authorizes a relatively decentralized scheme that pre-serves a broad role for state regulation. See

ibid. Most
significantly, States may ban or restrict the uses of pes-ticides that EPA has approved, $ 136v(a); they may also register, subject to certain restrictions, pesticides for uses be-yond those approved by EPA, $ 136v(c). See also $ 136w-1
(authorizing EPA to grant States primary enforcement re-sponsibility for use violations). A literal reading of $ 136v(b)

25 It is no answer that, even if all label-related claims are pre-empted
under Dow's reading, other non-label-related tort claims would remain intact. Given the inherently dangerous nature of pesticides, most safety
gains are achieved not through modifying a pesticide's design, but by improving the warnings and instructions contained on its label. See Brief
for American Chemistry Council as Amicus Curiae 3.

is fully consistent with the concurrent authority of the Fed-eral and State Governments in this sphere.

Private remedies that enforce federal misbranding re-quirements would seem to aid, rather than hinder, the functioning of FIFRA. Unlike the cigarette labeling law atissue in

Cipollone, which prescribed certain immutable
warning statements, FIFRA contemplates that pesticide labels will evolve over time, as manufacturers gain more infor-mation about their products' performance in diverse settings. As one court explained, tort suits can serve as acatalyst in this process:

"By encouraging plaintiffs to bring suit for injuries not
previously recognized as traceable to pesticides such as
[the pesticide there at issue], a state tort action of thekind under review may aid in the exposure of new dangers associated with pesticides. Successful actions ofthis sort may lead manufacturers to petition EPA to
allow more detailed labelling of their products; alterna-tively, EPA itself may decide that revised labels are required in light of the new information that has beenbrought to its attention through common law suits. In
addition, the specter of damage actions may providemanufacturers with added dynamic incentives to continue to keep abreast of all possible injuries stemming
from use of their product so as to forestall such actionsthrough product improvement."

Ferebee, 736 F. 2d, at
1541-1542.

Dow and the United States exaggerate the disruptive ef-fects of using common-law suits to enforce the prohibition on

misbranding. FIFRA has prohibited inaccurate representations and inadequate warnings since its enactment in 1947,
while tort suits alleging failure-to-warn claims were common
well before that date and continued beyond the 1972 amendments. We have been pointed to no evidence that such tort
suits led to a "crazy-quilt" of FIFRA standards or otherwise

Opinion of the Court
created any real hardship for manufacturers or for EPA.Indeed, for much of this period EPA appears to have welcomed these tort suits. While it is true that properly in-structed juries might on occasion reach contrary conclusions
on a similar issue of misbranding, there is no reason to thinksuch occurrences would be frequent or that they would result
in difficulties beyond those regularly experienced by manufacturers of other products that every day bear the riskof conflicting jury verdicts. Moreover, it bears noting that

lay juries are in no sense anathema to FIFRA's scheme:In criminal prosecutions for violation of FIFRA's provisions, see $ 136l(b), juries necessarily pass on allegations ofmisbranding.

In sum, under our interpretation, $ 136v(b) retains a nar-row, but still important, role. In the main, it pre-empts
competing state labeling standards--imagine 50 different la-beling regimes prescribing the color, font size, and wording
of warnings--that would create significant inefficiencies for
manufacturers.26 The provision also pre-empts any statutory or common-law rule that would impose a labeling requirement that diverges from those set out in FIFRA and
its implementing regulations. It does not, however, preempt any state rules that are fully consistent with federal
requirements.

26 The legislative history of the 1972 amendments suggests that Congress had conflicting state labeling regulations in mind when crafting

$ 136v(b). As one industry representative testified: "Some States might
want the word `flammable,' some `inflammable.' . . . Some States might
want red lettering; others orange, another yellow, and so forth. We ask
this committee, therefore, to recognize, as the Congress has in a number
of similar regulatory statutes, the industry's need for uniformity by providing for this in the act." Hearings on Federal Pesticide Control Act
of 1971 before the House Committee on Agriculture, 92d Cong., 1st
Sess., 281-283 (1971) (statement of Robert L. Ackerly). By contrast,
the lengthy legislative history is barren of any indication that Congress
meant to abrogate most of the common-law duties long owed by pesticide
manufacturers.

Opinion of the Court
Having settled on our interpretation of $ 136v(b), it still
remains to be decided whether that provision pre-empts
petitioners' fraud and failure-to-warn claims. Because we
have not received sufficient briefing on this issue,27 which
involves questions of Texas law, we remand it to the Court
of Appeals. We emphasize that a state-law labeling requirement must in fact be equivalent to a requirement under
FIFRA in order to survive pre-emption. For example, were
the Court of Appeals to determine that the element of falsity
in Texas' common-law definition of fraud imposed a broader
obligation than FIFRA's requirement that labels not contain
"false or misleading statements," that state-law cause of action would be pre-empted by $ 136v(b) to the extent of that
difference. State-law requirements must also be measured
against any relevant EPA regulations that give content to
FIFRA's misbranding standards. For example, a failureto-warn claim alleging that a given pesticide's label should
have stated "DANGER" instead of the more subdued
"CAUTION" would be pre-empted because it is inconsistent
with 40 CFR $ 156.64 (2004), which specifically assigns these
warnings to particular classes of pesticides based on their
toxicity.28

27 Dow does not seem to argue that, by their terms, Texas' fraud and
failure-to-warn causes of action are not equivalent to FIFRA's misbranding standards. Nor has Dow identified any EPA regulations that further
refine those general standards in any way that is relevant to petitioners'
allegations. Rather, Dow has chosen to mount a broader attack on the
"parallel requirements" interpretation, thus seeming to argue for the preemption of even a state-law cause of action that expressly incorporates
FIFRA's misbranding provisions. See Brief for Respondent 38, n. 25.
Since Dow did not have the benefit of our construction of $ 136v(b), Dow
should be allowed to address these matters on remand.

28 At present, there appear to be relatively few regulations that refine

or elaborate upon FIFRA's broadly phrased misbranding standards. To
the extent that EPA promulgates such regulations in the future, they will
necessarily affect the scope of pre-emption under $ 136v(b).

Breyer, J., concurring
In undertaking a pre-emption analysis at the pleadingsstage of a case, a court should bear in mind the concept of

equivalence. To survive pre-emption, the state-law require-ment need not be phrased in the

identical language as its
corresponding FIFRA requirement; indeed, it would be sur-prising if a common-law requirement used the same phraseology as FIFRA. If a case proceeds to trial, the court's jury
instructions must ensure that nominally equivalent labelingrequirements are

genuinely equivalent. If a defendant so
requests, a court should instruct the jury on the relevantFIFRA misbranding standards, as well as any regulations

that add content to those standards. For a manufacturershould not be held liable under a state labeling requirement
subject to $ 136v(b) unless the manufacturer is also liable for
misbranding as defined by FIFRA.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring.
I write separately to stress the practical importance of the
Court's statement that state-law requirements must "be
measured against" relevant Environmental Protecti on
Agency (EPA) regulations "that give content to [the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act's (FIFRA)] misbranding standards." Ante, at 453. In Medtronic, Inc. v.
Lohr, 518 U. S. 470 (1996), I pointed out that an administrative agency, there the Food and Drug Administration, had
the legal authority within ordinary administrative constraints to promulgate agency rules and to determine the
pre-emptive effect of those rules in light of the agency's special understanding of "whether (or the extent to which) state
requirements may interfere with federal objectives." Id., at
506 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
The EPA enjoys similar authority here. See 7 U. S. C.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

$ 136w(a)(1). As suggested by Med tronic, the federalagency charged with administering the statute is often better able than are courts to determine the extent to whichstate liability rules mirror or distort federal requirements.
Thus, the EPA may prove better able than are courts to de-termine whether general state tort liability rules simply help
to expose " `new dangers associated with pesticides,' " ante,
at 451 (quoting Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical Co., 736 F. 2d1529, 1541 (CADC 1984)), or instead bring about a counterproductive " `crazy-quilt of anti-misbranding requirements,' "
ante, at 448 (quoting Brief for Respondent 16). And, within
appropriate legal and administrative constraints, it can actaccordingly. Cf.

Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 721 (1985) (agencies can
monitor the dynamic between federal and local requirements
and promulgate regulations pre-empting local legislation
that interferes with federal goals). Emphasizing the importance of the agency's role in overseeing FIFRA's future implementation, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court that the term "requirements" in

$ 24(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), 7 U. S. C. $ 136v(b), includes common-law duties for labeling or packaging. Ante, at 443. I also agree
that state-law damages claims may not impose requirements
"in addition to or different from" FIFRA's. Ante, at 452-
454. While States are free to impose liability predicated on
a violation of the federal standards set forth in FIFRA and
in any accompanying regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, they may not impose liability
for labeling requirements predicated on distinct state standards of care. Section 136v(b) permits States to add remedies--not to alter or augment the substantive rules governing liability for labeling. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518

Opinion of Thomas, J.
U. S. 470, 513 (1996) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). Because the parties have not argued

that Dow violated FIFRA's labeling standards,* the majorityproperly remands for the District Court to consider whether
Texas law mirrors the federal standards.However, the majority omits a step in its reasoning that
should be made explicit: A state-law cause of action, even ifnot specific to labeling, nevertheless imposes a labeling requirement "in addition to or different from" FIFRA's whenit attaches liability to statements on the label that do not
produce liability under FIFRA. The state-law cause of ac-tion then adds some supplemental requirement of truthfulness to FIFRA's requirement that labeling statements notbe "false or misleading." 7 U. S. C. $ 136(q)(1)(A). That is
why the fraud claims here are properly remanded to deter-mine whether the state and federal standards for liabilityincurring statements are, in their application to this case, thesame. See

ante, at 453-454.Under that reasoning, the majority mistreats two sets of

petitioners' claims. First, petitioners' breach-of-warrantyclaims should be remanded for pre-emption analysis, contrary to the majority's disposition, see ante, at 444-445. Tothe extent that Texas' law of warranty imposes liability for
statements on the label where FIFRA would not, Texas' lawis pre-empted. See

Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505U. S. 504, 551 (1992) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment inpart and dissenting in part). Second, the majority holds

that petitioners' claim under the Texas Deceptive TradePractices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA) is not preempted to the extent it is a breach-of-warranty claim. Ante,at 445, n. 18. However, the DTPA claim is also (and, in fact,
perhaps exclusively) a claim for false or misleading represen-tations on the label. App. 185-186. Therefore, all aspects
of the DTPA claim should be remanded. The DTPA claim,

*Petitioners' counterclaim expressly disclaims that Dow violated any
provision of FIFRA. App. 192 (First Amended Counterclaim).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
like petitioners' fraud claims, should be pre-empted insofaras it imposes liability for label content where FIFRA

would not.I also note that, despite the majority's reference to a
failure-to-warn claim, ante, at 442-443, n. 15, petitionershave not advanced an actual failure-to-warn claim. Instead,
the Court of Appeals treated petitioners' claims for negligent
testing and defective design and manufacture as "disguisedclaim[s] for failure to warn." 332 F. 3d 323, 332-333 (CA5

2003). If petitioners offer no evidence on remand that Dowerred in the testing, design, or manufacture of Strongarm,
these claims will fail on the merits. On that point, I take
the majority to agree. Ante, at 442-443, n. 15.

We need go no further to resolve this case. The ordinary
meaning of $ 136v(b)'s terms makes plain that some of petitioners' state-law causes of action may be pre-empted. Yet
the majority advances several arguments designed to tip the
scales in favor of the States and against the Federal Government. These arguments, in addition to being unnecessary,
are unpersuasive. For instance, the majority states that the
presumption against pre-emption requires choosing the interpretation of $ 136v(b) that disfavors pre-emption. Ante,
at 449. That presumption does not apply, however, when
Congress has included within a statute an express preemption provision. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,
supra, at 545-546 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part); Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev.
225, 291-292, 298-303 (2000). Section 136v(b) is an explicit
statement that FIFRA pre-empts some state-law claims.
Thus, our task is to determine which state-law claims

$ 136v(b) pre-empts, without slanting the inquiry in favor of
either the Federal Government or the States.

The history of tort litigation against manufacturers is also
irrelevant. Ante, at 449-450. We cannot know, without
looking to the text of $ 136v(b), whether FIFRA preserved
that tradition or displaced it. The majority notes that Con544US2 Unit: $U44 [11-04-07 13:27:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
gress must have intended to preserve common-law suits, because the legislative history does not indicate that Congress
meant to abrogate such suits. Ante, at 452, n. 26; see also
Small v. United States, ante, at 406 (Thomas, J., dissenting)
(criticizing novel practice of relying on silence in the legislative history); Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543
U. S. 50, 73-74 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (same). For
the Court, then, enacting a pre-emption provision is not
enough: Either Congress must speak with added specificity
in the statute (to avoid the presumption against pre-emption)
or some individual Members of Congress or congressional
committees must display their preference for pre-emption in
the legislative record (to avoid a new canon of congressional
silence). But the Court does not believe its own test, for it
agrees that $ 136v(b) stands to abrogate many common-law
causes of action. On remand, for example, petitioners may
be unable to pursue a traditional common-law suit under
Texas' law of fraud. Finally, while allowing additional
state-law remedies likely aids in enforcing FIFRA's misbranding requirements, ante, at 451, it is for Congress, not
this Court, to strike a balance between state tort suits and
federal regulation.

Because we need only determine the ordinary meaning of

$ 136v(b), the majority rightly declines to address respondent's argument that petitioners' claims are subject to other
types of pre-emption. Brief for Respondent 36-37. For instance, the majority does not ask whether FIFRA's regulatory scheme is "so pervasive," and the federal interest in
labeling "so dominant," that there is no room for States to
provide additional remedies. Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Nor does the majority ask
whether enforcement of state-law labeling claims would
"stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of the full purposes and objectives of Congress" in enacting
FIFRA. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).

Today's decision thus comports with this Court's increas-ing reluctance to expand federal statutes beyond their terms

GRANHOLM, GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN, et al. v.HEALD

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 03-1116. Argued December 7, 2004--Decided May 16, 2005*
Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of wine through

three-tier systems requiring separate licenses for producers, wholesalers, and retailers. These schemes allow in-state, but not out-of-state,
wineries to make direct sales to consumers. This differential treatment
explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce by limiting the
emerging and significant direct-sale business. Influenced by an increasing number of small wineries and a decreasing number of wine
wholesalers, direct sales have grown because small wineries may not
produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine
to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products. In
Nos. 03-1116 and 03-1120, Michigan residents, joined by an intervening out-of-state winery, sued Michigan officials, claiming that the
State's laws violate the Commerce Clause. The State and an intervening in-state wholesalers association responded that the direct-shipment
ban was a valid exercise of Michigan's power under the Twenty-first
Amendment. The District Court sustained the scheme, but the Sixth
Circuit reversed, rejecting the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes state liquor laws from Commerce Clause strictures
and holding that there was no showing that the State could not meet
its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means. In
No. 03-1274, out-of-state wineries and their New York customers filed
suit against state officials, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the
State's direct-shipment laws violate the Commerce Clause. State liquor wholesalers and retailers' representatives intervened in support of
the State. The District Court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that New York's laws
fell within the ambit of its powers under the Twenty-first Amendment.

York case are referred to as the wineries, while the opposing parties
are referred to as the States.

Held: Both States' laws discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and that discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment. Pp. 472-493.

(a) This Court has long held that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate "differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter." Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.
v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99.
Laws such as those at issue contradict the principles underlying this
rule by depriving citizens of their right to have access to other States'
markets on equal terms. The Michigan system's discriminatory character is obvious. It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers,
subject only to a licensing requirement, but out-of-state wineries, even
if licensed, must go through a wholesaler and retailer. The resulting
price differential, plus the possible inability to secure a wholesaler for
small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from Michigan's market. New York's scheme also grants in-state wineries access to state
consumers on preferential terms. It allows in-state wineries to ship
directly to consumers, but requires an out-of-state winery to open a
New York branch office and warehouse, which drives up its costs. Outof-state wineries are also ineligible for a "farm winery" license, which
provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.
Pp. 472-476.

(b) Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment does not allow States
to regulate direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor
of in-state producers. The States' position is inconsistent with this
Court's precedents and the Amendment's history. Pp. 476-489.

(1) This Court invalidated many state liquor regulations before the
Eighteenth Amendment's ratification, finding either that the Commerce
Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor,
Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 58, or that States could not pass facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce,
Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465. While
States could ban domestic liquor production, Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S.
623, such laws were ineffective because they could not regulate imported liquor in its original package, Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100. To
resolve this matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act, which empowered
the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic
liquor. After this Court narrowly construed the Act to permit regulation of the resale of imported liquor, not its direct shipment to consum544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ers, Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon
Act to close the direct-shipment loophole, see Clark Distilling Co. v.
Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U. S. 311. The States argue that the
Webb-Kenyon Act went further, removing any barrier to discriminatory
state liquor regulations, but that reading conflicts with Clark Distilling's description of the Webb-Kenyon Act's purpose, which was simply
to extend the Wilson Act. Nor does the statute's text compel a different response. At the very least, it expresses no clear congressional
intent to depart from the principle disfavoring discrimination against
out-of-state goods. Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act
did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes
state discrimination. The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the WebbKenyon Act did not displace, the Court's Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against out-of-state liquor.
States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal
terms. Pp. 476-484.

(2) A brief respite from these legal battles brought on by the Eighteenth Amendment's ratification ended with the Twenty-first Amendment. The States contend that $ 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment
transfers to States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state
goods, but the pre-Amendment history recited here provides strong support for the view that $ 2 only restored to the States the powers they
had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts. The Twenty-first
Amendment's aim was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use. It did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege
they never enjoyed. Cases decided soon after the Twenty-first Amendment's ratification did not take account of the underlying history and
were inconsistent with this view, e. g., State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.
v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 59, but the Court's reluctance to consider this history did not reflect a consensus that such evidence was
irrelevant or that prior history was unsupportive of the principle that
the Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state
liquor. More recent cases confirm that the Twenty-first Amendment
does not supersede other provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace the rule that States may not give a discriminatory
preference to their own producers. Pp. 484-486.

(3) This Court has held, in the modern $ 2 cases, (1) that state laws
violating other provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the
Twenty-first Amendment, e. g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517
U. S. 484, (2) that $ 2 does not abrogate Congress' Commerce Clause
powers with regard to liquor, e. g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

467 U. S. 691, and (3) as most relevant here, that state regulation of
alcohol is limited by the Commerce Clause's nondiscrimination principle,
e. g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 276. Bacchus, which
dealt with a Hawaii excise tax exempting some in-state alcoholic beverages, provides a particularly telling example of this last proposition, and
this Court declines the States' suggestion to overrule or limit that case.
The decision to invalidate the instant direct-shipment laws also does not
call into question their three-tier systems' constitutionality, see North
Dakota v. United States, 495 U. S. 423, 432. State policies are protected
under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out
of state the same as its domestic equivalent. In contrast, the instant
cases involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local
producers. Pp. 486-489.

(c) Concluding that the States' direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry, for this
Court must still consider whether either State's regime "advances a
legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives," New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach,
486 U. S. 269, 278. The States provide little evidence for their claim
that purchasing wine over the Internet by minors is a problem. The
26 States now permitting direct shipments report no such problem, and
the States can minimize any risk with less restrictive steps, such as
requiring an adult signature on delivery. The States' tax evasion justification is also insufficient. Increased direct shipment, whether in or
out of state, brings the potential for tax evasion. However, this argument is a diversion with regard to Michigan, which does not rely on
in-state wholesalers to collect taxes on out-of-state wines. New York's
tax collection objectives can be achieved without discriminating against
interstate commerce, e. g., by requiring a permit as a condition of direct
shipping, which is what it does for in-state wineries. Both States also
benefit from federal laws that supply incentives for wineries to comply
with state regulations. Other rationales--facilitating orderly market
conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory
accountability--can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement. Pp. 489-493.

466 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
chanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the objectand effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries

to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to pro-hibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to
make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and
New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitiveadvantage over wineries located beyond the States' borders.

We hold that the laws in both States discriminate againstinterstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither author-ized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws;
and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theSecond Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

I
Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulatethe sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including

wine, through a three-tier distribution system. Separate li-censes are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.
See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce:Wine 5-7 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at
http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/winereport2.pdf (all Internetmaterials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of
Court's case file). The three-tier scheme is preserved by acomplex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.
For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical inte-gration between tiers. Id., at 5; 27 U. S. C. $ 205; see, e. g.,
Bainbridge v. Turner, 311 F. 3d 1104, 1106 (CA11 2002). Wehave held previously that States can mandate a three-tier
distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority underthe Twenty-first Amendment. North Dakota v. United
States, 495 U. S. 423, 432 (1990); id., at 447 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment). As relevant to today's cases, though,

Opinion of the Court
the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinementsto be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only

for sales from out-of-state wineries. In-state wineries, bycontrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.
The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-statewineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.

This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale ofwine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant

business. FTC Report 7. From 1994 to 1999, consumerspending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500
million per year, or three percent of all wine sales. Id.,
at 5. The expansion has been influenced by several related
trends. First, the number of small wineries in the United
States has significantly increased. By some estimates there
are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica,
The National Association of American Wineries, Wine
Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/
winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years
ago, FTC Report 6. At the same time, the wholesale market
has consolidated. Between 1984 and 2002, the number of
licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600. Riekhof &
Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3,
pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/pubs/
regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf. The increasing wineryto-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not
produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for
their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry
their products. FTC Report 6. This has led many small
wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.
Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct
shipments an attractive sales channel.

Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of
wine, with various restrictions. Thirteen of these States
have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from win544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
468 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
eries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords
similar nondiscriminatory treatment. Id., at 7-8. In many
parts of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or
severely restrict direct shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market. According to the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), "[s]tate bans on interstate direct shipping represent the single largest regulatory barrier to expanded e-commerce in wine." Id., at 3.

The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part
of their businesses. Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in
the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis
Obispo, California. It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.
Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from
Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the
State's direct-shipment ban. Even if the winery could find
a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesaler's
markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of
the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries
in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California
(the Lucas Winery). Some of their customers are tourists,
from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries. If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or
Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to
do so if they reside in a State with restrictive directshipment laws. For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are
unable to fill orders from New York, the Nation's secondlargest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes
on direct wine shipments.

A

We first address the background of the suit challenging
the Michigan direct-shipment law. Most alcoholic beverages
in Michigan are distributed through the State's three-tier

system. Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages,whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell

only to licensed in-state wholesalers. Mich. Comp. LawsAnn. $$ 436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West
2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719(2000). Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $$ 436.1113(7), 436.1607(1)
(West 2001). Licensed retailers are the final link in thechain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home de-livery. $$ 436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)-(4).

Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter,
must distribute their wine through wholesalers. There is,
however, an exception for Michigan's approximately 40
in-state wineries, which are eligible for "wine maker" licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.

cost of the license varies with the size of the winery. For a
small winery, the license is $25. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.

$ 436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004). Out-of-state wineries
can apply for a $300 "outside seller of wine" license, but this
license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.

Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).

Some Michigan residents brought suit against various
state officials in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan. Domaine Alfred, the San
Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit. The plaintiffs contended that Michigan's direct-shipment laws discriminated
against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce
Clause. The trade association Michigan Beer & Wine
Wholesalers intervened as a defendant. Both the State and
the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from
out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigan's power
under $ 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

470 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
On cross-motions for summary judgment the DistrictCourt sustained the Michigan scheme. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Heald v. Engler, 342F. 3d 517 (2003). Relying on Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,
468 U. S. 263 (1984), the court rejected the argument thatthe Twenty-first Amendment immunizes all state liquor laws
from the strictures of the Commerce Clause, 342 F. 3d, at524, and held the Michigan scheme was unconstitutional because the defendants failed to demonstrate the State couldnot meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means, id., at 527. B

New York's licensing scheme is somewhat different. Itchannels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but
it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries. As in Michi-gan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales
to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries. Wineries that produce wine only from New
York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct ship-ment to in-state consumers. N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law
Ann. $ 76-a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABCLaw). These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines
of other wineries as well, $ 76-a(6)(a), but only if the wine ismade from grapes "at least seventy-five percent the volume
of which were grown in New York state," $ 3(20-a). Anout-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, whichrequires the establishment of "a branch factory, office or
storeroom within the state of New York." $ 3(37).Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, joined by three of
their New York customers, brought suit in the SouthernDistrict of New York against the officials responsible for administering New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Lawseeking, inter alia, a declaration that the State's limitations
on the direct shipment of out-of-state wine violate the Com-merce Clause. New York liquor wholesalers and repre544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sentatives of New York liquor retailers intervened in sup-port of the State.

The District Court granted summary judgment to theplaintiffs. 232 F. Supp. 2d 135 (2002). The court first determined that, under established Commerce Clause principles,the New York direct-shipment scheme discriminates against
out-of-state wineries. Id., at 146-147. The court then re-jected the State's Twenty-first Amendment argument, finding that the "[d]efendants have not shown that New York'sban on the direct shipment of out-of-state wine, and particularly the in-state exceptions to the ban, implicate the State'score concerns under the Twenty-first Amendment."

Id.,at 148.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.358 F. 3d 223 (2004). The court "recognize[d] that the physical presence requirement could create substantial dormantCommerce Clause problems if this licensing scheme regulated a commodity other than alcohol." Id., at 238. Thecourt nevertheless sustained the New York statutory scheme
because, in the court's view, "New York's desire to ensureaccountability through presence is aimed at the regulatory
interests directly tied to the importation and transportationof alcohol for use in New York,"

ibid. As such, the NewYork direct-shipment laws were "within the ambit of the

powers granted to states by the Twenty-first Amendment."Id., at 239.

C
We consolidated these cases and granted certiorari on thefollowing question: " `Does a State's regulatory scheme that

permits in-state wineries directly to ship alcohol to consum-ers but restricts the ability of out-of-state wineries to do so
violate the dormant Commerce Clause in light of $ 2 of theTwenty-first Amendment?' " 541 U. S. 1062 (2004).

Michigan, New York, and the wholesalers and retailers--

A

Time and again this Court has held that, in all but the
narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce
Clause if they mandate "differential treatment of in-state
and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former
and burdens the latter." Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99
(1994). See also New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486
U. S. 269, 274 (1988). This rule is essential to the foundations of the Union. The mere fact of nonresidence should
not foreclose a producer in one State from access to markets
in other States. H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336
U. S. 525, 539 (1949). States may not enact laws that burden
out-of-state producers or shippers simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses. This mandate "reflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the
conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would
have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization
that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later
among the States under the Articles of Confederation."
Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325-326 (1979).

The rule prohibiting state discrimination against interstate commerce follows also from the principle that States
should not be compelled to negotiate with each other regarding favored or disfavored status for their own citizens.
States do not need, and may not attempt, to negotiate with
other States regarding their mutual economic interests. Cf.
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3. Rivalries among the States
are thus kept to a minimum, and a proliferation of trade
zones is prevented. See C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown,

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
511 U. S. 383, 390 (1994) (citing The Federalist No. 22,pp. 143-145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton); Madison,

Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writ-ings of James Madison 362-363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).

Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradictthese principles. They deprive citizens of their right to
have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks
generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliancesand exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the
Commerce Clause were designed to avoid. State laws thatprotect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes
under which some States condition the right of out-of-statewineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on
a reciprocal right in the shipping State. California, for ex-ample, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the
State's previous regime that allowed unfettered direct ship-ments from out-of-state wineries. Riekhof & Sykuta, 27
Regulation, No. 3, at 30. Prior to 1986, all but three Statesprohibited direct shipments of wine. The obvious aim of the
California statute was to open the interstate direct-shippingmarket for the State's many wineries. Ibid. The current
patchwork of laws--with some States banning direct ship-ments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines,
and still others requiring reciprocity--is essentially theproduct of an ongoing, low-level trade war. Allowing States
to discriminate against out-of-state wine "invite[s] a multipli-cation of preferential trade areas destructive of the very
purpose of the Commerce Clause." Dean Milk Co. v. Madi-son, 340 U. S. 349, 356 (1951). See also Baldwin v. G. A. F.
Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, 521-523 (1935).

B
The discriminatory character of the Michigan system isobvious. Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly

to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement. Out544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
474 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a completeban on direct shipment. The differential treatment requires

all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to passthrough an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching
consumers. These two extra layers of overhead increase thecost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers. The cost
differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineriesfrom the Michigan market.

The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigan'sin that it does not ban direct shipments altogether. Out-ofstate wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of
direct shipment. N. Y. ABC Law $$ 3(37), 96 (West Supp.
2005). This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting
out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system. New York and those allied with its interests defend
the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the
same access to the State's consumers as in-state wineries:
All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to
New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.
There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state
wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the State's regulatory gauntlet. New York's argument, in any event, is
unconvincing.

The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to
the State's consumers on preferential terms. The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-ofstate wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory
nature of New York's regulations. In-state producers, with
the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from
their wineries. $$ 76-a(3), 76(4), and 77(2) (West 2000).
Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
of their wine. $$ 3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005). See also App.in No. 03-1274, pp. 159-160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon,

General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-andmortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, isprohibitive. It comes as no surprise that not a single outof-state winery has availed itself of New York's directshipping privilege. We have "viewed with particular sus-picion state statutes requiring business operations to be

performed in the home State that could more efficiently beperformed elsewhere."

Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397
U. S. 137, 145 (1970). New York's in-state presence requirement runs contrary to our admonition that States cannot require an out-of-state firm "to become a resident in order to
compete on equal terms." Halliburton Oil Well Cementing
Co. v. Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 72 (1963). See also Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418 (1871).

In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries
in other ways. Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a "farm winery" license, the license that provides
the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.
N. Y. ABC Law $ 76-a(5) (West Supp. 2005) ("No licensed
farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced
exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state"). Out-of-state
wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.
See $$ 3(37), 76. Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the
state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, $ 77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state
wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining
a distribution operation in New York. New York law also
allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to
distribute their wine through other wineries that have the

476 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
applicable licenses. $ 76(5) (West Supp. 2005). This is an-other privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

We have no difficulty concluding that New York, like Mich-igan, discriminates against interstate commerce through its
direct-shipping laws. III

State laws that discriminate against interstate commerceface "a virtually per se rule of invalidity." Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978). The Michigan andNew York laws by their own terms violate this proscription.
The two States, however, contend their statutes are savedby $ 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, which provides:

"The transportation or importation into any State, Ter-ritory, or possession of the United States for delivery or
use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of thelaws thereof, is hereby prohibited."

The States' position is inconsistent with our precedents andwith the Twenty-first Amendment's history. Section 2 does
not allow States to regulate the direct shipment of wine onterms that discriminate in favor of in-state producers.

A
Before 1919, the temperance movement fought to curb thesale of alcoholic beverages one State at a time. The movement made progress, and many States passed laws restrict-ing or prohibiting the sale of alcohol. This Court upheld
state laws banning the production and sale of alcoholic bever-ages,

Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887), but was lesssolicitous of laws aimed at imports. In a series of cases before ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the Court,relying on the Commerce Clause, invalidated a number of
state liquor regulations.These cases advanced two distinct principles. First, the
Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States fromdiscriminating against imported liquor.

laws burdening only out-of-state products:

"A discriminating tax imposed by a State operating to

introduced into the first mentioned State, is, in effect, a
regulation in restraint of commerce among the States,
and as such is a usurpation of the power conferred by
the Constitution upon the Congress of the United
States." 116 U. S., at 455.

Second, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from passing facially neutral laws that placed
an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Rhodes
v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412 (1898); Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co.,
170 U. S. 438 (1898); Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100 (1890);
Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465
(1888). For example, in Bowman, the Court struck down an
Iowa statute that required all liquor importers to have a permit. Bowman and its progeny rested in part on the sincerejected original-package doctrine. Under this doctrine
goods shipped in interstate commerce were immune from
state regulation while in their original package. As the
Court explained in Vance:

"[T]he power to ship merchandise from one State into
another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the
receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate
Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate
Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in
the original package they have been commingled with

478 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
the general mass of property in the State." 170 U. S.,at 444-445.

Bowman reserved the question whether a State could banthe sale of imported liquor altogether. 125 U. S., at 499-500.
Iowa responded to Bowman by doing just that but wasthwarted once again. In Leisy, supra, the Court held that
Iowa could not ban the sale of imported liquor in its origi-nal package.

Leisy left the States in a bind. They could ban the pro-duction of domestic liquor, Mugler, supra, but these laws
were ineffective because out-of-state liquor was immunefrom any state regulation as long as it remained in its original package, Leisy, supra. To resolve the matter, Congresspassed the Wilson Act (so named for Senator Wilson of
Iowa), which empowered the States to regulate imported liq-uor on the same terms as domestic liquor:

"That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liq-uors or liquids transported into any State or Territory
or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or stor-age therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory
be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of suchState or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police
powers, to the same extent and in the same manner asthough such liquids or liquors had been produced in such
State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefromby reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise." Ch. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (codified at 27U. S. C. $ 121).

By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States todiscriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed
States to regulate imported liquor only "to the same extentand in the same manner" as domestic liquor.

The Court confirmed this interpretation in Scott, supra.
Scott involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolina'sdispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

479Cite as: 544 U. S. 460 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commis-sioner. 165 U. S., at 92. The statute discriminated against

out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways. First, $ 15required the commissioner to "purchase his supplies from the
brewers and distillers in this State when their productreaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such
supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and
distillers in this State as elsewhere." 1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.Second, $ 23 of the statute limited the State's markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided "nosuch limitation of charge in the case of imported wines."
165 U. S., at 93. Based on these discriminatory provisions,
the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina
dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act. Id., at
100. It explained that the Wilson Act was "not intended to
confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously
against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore
the subjects of legitimate commerce." Ibid. To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated "equality or
uniformity of treatment under state laws," ibid., and did not
allow South Carolina to provide "an unjust preference" to its
products "as against similar products of the other States,"
id., at 101. The dissent also understood the validity of the
dispensary law to turn in large part on $$ 15 and 23, but
argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the
correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.
Id., at 104-106 (opinion of Brown, J.).

Although the Wilson Act increased the States' authority
to police liquor imports, it did not solve all their problems.
In Vance and Rhodes--two cases decided soon after Scott--
the Court made clear that the Wilson Act did not authorize
States to prohibit direct shipments for personal use. In
Vance, the Court characterized Scott as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South Carolina dispensary law
"amount[ed] to an unjust discrimination against liquors, the

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
480 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
products of other States." 170 U. S., at 442. This aspect of
the Scott holding, which confirmed the Wilson Act's nondiscrimination principle, was based "on particular provisions of
the law by which the discrimination was brought about."
170 U. S., at 442. Second, "in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending . . . of intoxicating liquors for the
use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was
repugnant to [the Commerce Clause]." Ibid. (citing Scott,
165 U. S. 58). See also 170 U. S., at 443 (distinguishing between the provisions at issue in Scott "which were held to
operate a discrimination" and those which barred direct shipment for personal use).

This second holding, that consumers had the right to receive alcoholic beverages shipped in interstate commerce for
personal use, was only implicit in Scott. 165 U. S., at 78,
99-100. The Court expanded on this point, however, not
only in Vance but again in Rhodes. Rhodes construed the
Wilson Act narrowly to avoid interference with this right.
The Act, the Court said, authorized States to regulate only
the resale of imported liquor, not direct shipment to consumers for personal use. 170 U. S., at 421. Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to
ban such shipments, the Rhodes Court read the words "upon
arrival" in the Wilson Act as authorizing "the power of the
State to attach to an interstate commerce shipment," only
after its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there
to the consignee." Id., at 426. See also id., at 424; Bridenbaugh v. Freeman-Wilson, 227 F. 3d 848, 852 (CA7 2000).
The Court interpreted the Wilson Act to overturn Leisy but
leave Bowman intact. Rhodes, supra, at 423-424. The
right to regulate did not attach until the liquor was in the
hands of the customer. As a result, the mail-order liquor
trade continued to thrive. Rogers, Interstate Commerce in
Intoxicating Liquors Before the Webb-Kenyon Act, 4 Va.

Opinion of the Court
After considering a series of bills in response to theCourt's reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to

the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 37 Stat. 699, 27 U. S. C. $ 122. See Rogers,
supra, at 363-370. The Act, entitled "An Act Divesting in-toxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain
cases," provides:

"That the shipment or transportation . . . of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liq-uor of any kind, from one State . . . into any other

State . . . which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fer-mented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any
person interested therein, to be received, possessed,
sold, or in any manner used, either in the original pack-age or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State . . .

is hereby prohibited." 37 Stat., at 699-700.
The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was indoubt.

Vance and Rhodes implied that any law authorizing
the States to regulate direct shipments for personal usewould be an unlawful delegation of Congress' Commerce

Clause powers. Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice
of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for thisspecific reason. S. Rep. No. 103, 63d Cong., 1st Sess., 3-6

(1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913). Congress overrode theveto and in

Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co.,
242 U. S. 311 (1917), a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.

The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipmentgap left open by the Wilson Act. States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal
use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-ofstate liquor on the same terms. Id., at 321-322 (noting that
the West Virginia law at issue in Clark Distilling "forbade
the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State
whether from inside or out"). The Court understood that

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
482 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
the Webb-Kenyon Act "was enacted simply to extend thatwhich was done by the Wilson Act."

Id., at 324. The Act's
purpose "was to prevent the immunity characteristic of in-terstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of

liquor through such commerce in States contrary to theirlaws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and
indirection to set such laws at naught." Ibid. The Court
thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminatethe regulatory advantage,

i. e., its immunity characteristic,
afforded imported liquor under Bowman and Rhodes.Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act

went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations. We do not agree. First, this
reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given
the statute in Clark Distilling. Clark Distilling recognized
that the Webb-Kenyon Act extended the Wilson Act to allow
the States to intercept liquor shipments before those shipments reached the consignee. The States' contention that
the Webb-Kenyon Act also reversed the Wilson Act's prohibition on discriminatory treatment of out-of-state liquors
cannot be reconciled with Clark Distilling's description of
the Webb-Kenyon Act's purpose--"simply to extend that
which was done by the Wilson Act." 242 U. S., at 324. See
also McCormick & Co. v. Brown, 286 U. S. 131, 140-141
(1932).

The statute's text does not compel a different result. The
Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding
"shipment or transportation" only where it runs afoul of the
State's generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use. Cf. id., at 141 (noting that the Act authorized enforcement of "valid" state laws). At the very least,
the Webb-Kenyon Act expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle, unexceptional at the time
the Act was passed and still applicable today, Hillside Dairy
Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 66 (2003), that discrimination
against out-of-state goods is disfavored. Cf. Western &

Opinion of the Court
Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.,451 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1981) (holding that the McCarranFerguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 et seq., removed all dormantCommerce Clause scrutiny of state insurance laws; $ 1011
provides: "Congress hereby declares that the continued reg-ulation and taxation by the several States of the business of
insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the
part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose anybarrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the

several States").Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not
purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes
States from discriminating. If Congress' aim in passing the
Webb-Kenyon Act was to authorize States to discriminate
against out-of-state goods then its first step would have been
to repeal the Wilson Act. It did not do so. There is no
inconsistency between the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon
Act sufficient to warrant an inference that the latter repealed
the former. See Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422, 428
(1914) (noting that implied repeals are disfavored). Indeed,
this Court has twice noted that the Wilson Act remains in
effect today. Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor
Corp., 377 U. S. 324, 333, n. 11 (1964); Department of Revenue
v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U. S. 341, 345, n. 7
(1964). See 27 U. S. C. $ 121.

The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb-Kenyon Act did
not displace, the Court's line of Commerce Clause cases
striking down state laws that discriminated against liquor
produced out of state. The rule of Tiernan, Walling, and
Scott remained in effect: States were required to regulate
domestic and imported liquor on equal terms. "[T]he intent
of . . . the Webb-Kenyon Act . . . was to take from intoxicating
liquor the protection of the interstate commerce laws in so
far as necessary to deny them an advantage over the intoxicating liquors produced in the state into which they were
brought, yet, [the Act does not] show an intent or purpose to

Opinion of the Court
so abdicate control over interstate commerce as to permitdiscrimination against the intoxicating liquor brought into

one state from another." Pacific Fruit & Produce Co. v.Martin, 16 F. Supp. 34, 39-40 (WD Wash. 1936). See also
Friedman, Constitutional Law: State Regulation of Importa-tion of Intoxicating Liquor Under Twenty-first Amendment,
21 Cornell L. Q. 504, 509 (1936) ("The cases under the Webb-Kenyon Act uphold state prohibition and regulation in the
exercise of the police power yet they clearly forbid lawswhich discriminate arbitrarily and unreasonably against liquor produced outside of the state" (footnote omitted)).

B
The ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 pro-vided a brief respite from the legal battles over the validity

of state liquor regulations. With the ratification of theTwenty-first Amendment 14 years later, however, nationwide Prohibition came to an end. Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment.
Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment is at issue here.Michigan and New York say the provision grants to the
States the authority to discriminate against out-of-stategoods. The history we have recited does not support this
position. To the contrary, it provides strong support for theview that $ 2 restored to the States the powers they had
under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts. "The wording of$ 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment closely follows the
Webb-Kenyon and Wilson Acts, expressing the framers' clearintention of constitutionalizing the Commerce Clause framework established under those statutes." Craig v. Boren, 429U. S. 190, 205-206 (1976) (footnote omitted).

The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allowStates to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation,and use. The Amendment did not give States the authority
to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

485Cite as: 544 U. S. 460 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
out-of-state goods, a privilege they had not enjoyed at anyearlier time.

Some of the cases decided soon after ratification of theTwenty-first Amendment did not take account of this history
and were inconsistent with this view. In State Bd. of
Equalization of Cal. v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 59, 62
(1936), for example, the Court rejected the argument that
the Amendment did not authorize discrimination:

"The plaintiffs ask us to limit this broad command [of$ 2]. They request us to construe the Amendment as

saying, in effect: The State may prohibit the importationof intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its borders; but if it permits such
manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors com-pete with the domestic on equal terms. To say that,

would involve not a construction of the Amendment, buta rewriting of it."

The Court reaffirmed the States' broad powers under $ 2 in
a series of cases, see Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304U. S. 401 (1938);

Indianapolis Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control
Comm'n, 305 U. S. 391 (1939); Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308
U. S. 132 (1939); Joseph S. Finch & Co. v. McKittrick, 305U. S. 395 (1939), and unsurprisingly many States used the

authority bestowed on them by the Court to expand tradebarriers. T. Green, Liquor Trade Barriers: Obstructions to
Interstate Commerce in Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits 4,and App. I (1940) (stating in the wake of

Young's Market
that "[r]ivalries and reprisals have thus flared up").It is unclear whether the broad language in

Young's Market was necessary to the result because the Court also stated
that "the case [did] not present a question of discrimination
prohibited by the commerce clause." 299 U. S., at 62. The
Court also declined, contrary to the approach we take today,
to consider the history underlying the Twenty-first Amendment. Id., at 63-64. This reluctance did not, however, re544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
flect a consensus that such evidence was irrelevant or thatprior history was unsupportive of the principle that the

Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state liquors. There was ample opinion to the contrary.
See, e. g., Young's Market Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization ofCal., 12 F. Supp. 140 (SD Cal. 1935) (per curiam), rev'd, 299
U. S. 59 (1936); Pacific Fruit & Produce Co. v. Martin, supra,at 39;

Note, 55 Yale L. J. 815, 819-820 (1946).Our more recent cases, furthermore, confirm that the
Twenty-first Amendment does not supersede other provi-sions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace
the rule that States may not give a discriminatory prefer-ence to their own producers.

C
The modern $ 2 cases fall into three categories.First, the Court has held that state laws that violate other

provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment. The Court has applied this rule in the
context of the First Amendment, 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.
Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484 (1996); the EstablishmentClause, Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982);

the Equal Protection Clause, Craig, supra, at 204-209; theDue Process Clause,

Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
433 (1971); and the Import-Export Clause, Department of
Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U. S. 341
(1964).Second, the Court has held that $ 2 does not abrogate Congress' Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor. Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691 (1984); California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,
445 U. S. 97 (1980). The argument that "the Twenty-firstAmendment has somehow operated to `repeal' the Commerce

Clause" for alcoholic beverages has been rejected. Hostetter, 377 U. S., at 331-332. Though the Court's language in
Hostetter may have come uncommonly close to hyperbole in
describing this argument as "an absurd oversimplification,"
"patently bizarre," and "demonstrably incorrect," ibid., the
basic point was sound.

Finally, and most relevant to the issue at hand, the Court
has held that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the
nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause. Bacchus, 468 U. S., at 276; Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.
New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573 (1986);
Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324 (1989). "When a state
statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate
commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic
interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally
struck down the statute without further inquiry." BrownForman, supra, at 579.

Bacchus provides a particularly telling example of this
proposition. At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii
that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that
State. The Court rejected the argument that Hawaii's discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the
Twenty-first Amendment. 468 U. S., at 274-276. "The central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States
to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition." Id., at 276. Despite attempts to distinguish it in
the instant cases, Bacchus forecloses any contention that $ 2

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
488 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatorydirect-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny. See

also Brown-Forman, supra, at 576 (invalidating a New Yorkprice affirmation statute that required producers to limit the
price of liquor based on the lowest price they offered out ofstate);

Healy, 491 U. S., at 328 (invalidating a similar Connecticut statute); id., at 344 (Scalia, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) ("The Connecticut statute'sinvalidity is fully established by its facial discrimination

against interstate commerce . . . . This is so despite the factthat the law regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages, since
its discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-first Amendment").

Recognizing that Bacchus is fatal to their position, the
States suggest it should be overruled or limited to its facts.
As the foregoing analysis makes clear, we decline their invitation. Furthermore, Bacchus does not stand alone in recognizing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not give the
States complete freedom to regulate where other constitutional principles are at stake. A retreat from Bacchus
would also undermine Brown-Forman and Healy. These
cases invalidated state liquor regulations under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, Healy explicitly relied on the discriminatory character of the Connecticut price affirmation
statute. 491 U. S., at 340-341. Brown-Forman and Healy
lend significant support to the conclusion that the Twentyfirst Amendment does not immunize all laws from Commerce
Clause challenge.

The States argue that any decision invalidating their
direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system. This does not follow from
our holding. "The Twenty-first Amendment grants the
States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor
distribution system." Midcal, supra, at 110. A State
which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

489Cite as: 544 U. S. 460 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history
shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective.
States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution
through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the threetier system. We have previously recognized that the threetier system itself is "unquestionably legitimate." North Dakota v. United States, 495 U. S., at 432. See also id., at 447
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("The Twenty-first
Amendment . . . empowers North Dakota to require that
all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler"). State policies are protected
under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor
produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.
The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers. The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not
saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.

IV
Our determination that the Mich igan and New York
direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first
Amendment does not end the inquiry. We still must consider whether either state regime "advances a legitimate
local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives." New Energy Co. of Ind.,
486 U. S., at 278. The States offer two primary justifications
for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries:
keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating
tax collection. We consider each in turn.

The States, aided by several amici, claim that allowing
direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their
ability to police underage drinking. Minors, the States
argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and
are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a
means of obtaining alcohol illegally.

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
490 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Opinion of the Court
The States provide little evidence that the purchase ofwine over the Internet by minors is a problem. Indeed,

there is some evidence to the contrary. A recent study bythe staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors' in-creased access to wine. FTC Report 34. This is not surprising for several reasons. First, minors are less likely to
consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hardliquor.

Id., at 12. Second, minors who decide to disobey
the law have more direct means of doing so. Third, directshipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National
Conference of State Liquor Administrators, " `want instant
gratification.' " Id., at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors
rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet). Without
concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to
increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the
States' unsupported assertions. Under our precedents,
which require the "clearest showing" to justify discriminatory state regulation, C & A Carbone, Inc., 511 U. S., at 393,
this is not enough.

Even were we to credit the States' largely unsupported
claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only
out-of-state direct shipments. As the wineries point out,
minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones. Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers. Michigan counters that
it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers
than over out-of-state wineries. This does not justify Michigan's discriminatory ban on direct shipping. Out-of-state
wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail
to comply with state law. This provides strong incentives
not to sell alcohol to minors. In addition, the States can
take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors

will order wine by mail. For example, the Model DirectShipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State

Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and alabel so instructing on each package.

The States' tax-collection justification is also insufficient.Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or
out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.
With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argu-ment is a diversion. That is because Michigan, unlike many

other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxeson wines imported from out of state. Instead, Michigan
collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all
wine shipped to in-state wholesalers. Mich. Admin. Code
Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) ("Each outside seller of wine shall
submit . . . a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered,
or imported into this state during the preceding calendar
month"). If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate
safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for
direct shipments.

New York and its supporting parties also advance a taxcollection justification for the State's direct-shipment laws.
While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory
objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce. In particular, New York could protect
itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a
condition of direct shipping. This is the approach taken by
New York for in-state wineries. The State offers no reason
to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state
wineries. Licensees could be required to submit regular
sales reports and to remit taxes. Indeed, various States use
this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments,
e. g., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and
report no problems with tax collection. See FTC Report
38-40. This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct

Opinion of the Court
Shipping Bill. See, e. g., S. C. Code Ann. $ 61-4-747(C)(West Supp. 2004).

Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provi-sions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to
comply with state regulations. The Tax and Trade Bureau(formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) has
authority to revoke a winery's federal license if it violates
state law. BATF Industry Circular 96-3 (1997). Without afederal license, a winery cannot operate in any State. See

27 U. S. C. $ 204. In addition the Twenty-first AmendmentEnforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to
sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state
law. $ 122a(b).

These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue. The States have not shown that tax evasion from outof-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies
their discriminatory regimes.

Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales,
such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting
public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability. These objectives can also be achieved through the
alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement. FTC
Report 40-41. Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring
out-of-state wineries. Background checks can be done electronically. Financial records and sales data can be mailed,
faxed, or submitted via e-mail.

In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for
the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries. Our Commerce Clause
cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods. The "burden is on
the State to show that `the discrimination is demonstrably
justified,' " Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504

States have broad power to regulate liquor under $ 2 of
the Twenty-first Amendment. This power, however, doesnot allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment

of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing directshipment by in-state producers. If a State chooses to allow
direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.
Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, NewYork and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers. Under our CommerceClause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for fur-ther proceedings consistent with our opinion.

It is so ordered.

Congress' power to regulate commerce among the Statesincludes the power to authorize the States to place burdens
on interstate commerce. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,328 U. S. 408 (1946). Absent such congressional approval, a
state law may violate the unwritten rules described as the"dormant Commerce Clause" either by imposing an undue
burden on both out-of-state and local producers engaged in
interstate activities or by treating out-of-state producers
less favorably than their local competitors. See, e. g., Pike
v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970); Philadelphia v.

New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978). A state law totally prohib-iting the sale of an ordinary article of commerce might impose an even more serious burden on interstate commerce.If Congress may nevertheless authorize the States to enact
such laws, surely the people may do so through the processof amending our Constitution.

The New York and Michigan laws challenged in thesecases would be patently invalid under well-settled dormant
Commerce Clause principles if they regulated sales of anordinary article of commerce rather than wine. But ever
since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and theTwenty-first Amendment, our Constitution has placed commerce in alcoholic beverages in a special category. Section2 of the Twenty-first Amendment expressly provides that
"[t]he transportation or importation into any State, Terri-tory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use
therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the lawsthereof, is hereby prohibited."

Today many Americans, particularly those members of theyounger generations who make policy decisions, regard alcohol as an ordinary article of commerce, subject to substan-tially the same market and legal controls as other consumer
products. That was definitely not the view of the genera-tions that made policy in 1919 when the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified or in 1933 when it was repealed by theTwenty-first Amendment.

1 On the contrary, the moral condemnation of the use of alcohol as a beverage represented

1 In the words of Justice Jackson: "The people of the United States knew
that liquor is a lawlessness unto itself. They determined that it should
be governed by a specific and particular Constitutional provision. They
did not leave it to the courts to devise special distortions of the general
rules as to interstate commerce to curb liquor's `tendency to get out of
legal bounds.' It was their unsatisfactory experience with that method
that resulted in giving liquor an exclusive place in constitutional law as a
commodity whose transportation is governed by a special, constitutional
provision." Duckworth v. Arkansas, 314 U. S. 390, 398-399 (1941) (opinion concurring in result).

not merely the convictions of our religious leaders, but theviews of a sufficiently large majority of the population to

warrant the rare exercise of the power to amend the Con-stitution on two occasions. The Eighteenth Amendment
entirely prohibited commerce in "intoxicating liquors" forbeverage purposes throughout the United States and the
territories subject to its jurisdiction. While $ 1 of the
Twenty-first Amendment repealed the nationwide prohibi-tion, $ 2 gave the States the option to maintain equally comprehensive prohibitions in their respective jurisdictions.The views of judges who lived through the debates that
led to the ratification of those Amendments are entitled to
special deference. Foremost among them was Justice Brandeis, whose understanding of a State's right to discriminate
in its regulation of out-of-state alcohol could not have been
clearer:

"The plaintiffs ask us to limit [$ 2's] broad command.
They request us to construe the Amendment as saying,
in effect: The State may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture
and sale within its borders; but if it permits such manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors compete
with the domestic on equal terms. To say that, would
involve not a construction of the Amendment, but a rewriting of it. . . . Can it be doubted that a State might
establish a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale
of beer, and either prohibit all competing importations,
or discourage importation by laying a heavy impost, or
channelize desired importations by confining them to a
single consignee?" State Bd. of Equalization of Cal. v.

the Commerce Clause might before that time have imposed." Hostetter

In the years following the ratification of the Twenty-firstAmendment, States adopted manifold laws regulating commerce in alcohol, and many of these laws were discrimina-tory.

3 So-called "dry states" entirely prohibited such commerce; others prohibited the sale of alcohol on Sundays;others permitted the sale of beer and wine but not hard

liquor; most created either state monopolies or distributionsystems that gave discriminatory preferences to local retailers and distributors. The notion that discriminatory statelaws violated the unwritten prohibition against balkanizing
the American economy--while persuasive in contemporarytimes when alcohol is viewed as an ordinary article of commerce--would have seemed strange indeed to the millions ofAmericans who condemned the use of the "demon rum" in
the 1920's and 1930's. Indeed, they expressly authorized the
"balkanization" that today's decision condemns. Today's de-cision may represent sound economic policy and may be consistent with the policy choices of the contemporaries of Adam
Smith who drafted our original Constitution; 4 it is not, how-ever, consistent with the policy choices made by those who

amended our Constitution in 1919 and 1933.My understanding (and recollection) of the historical context reinforces my conviction that the text of $ 2 should be"broadly and colloquially interpreted."

deed, the fact that the Twenty-first Amendment was the onlyAmendment in our history to have been ratified by the people in state conventions, rather than by state legislatures,provides further reason to give its terms their ordinary
meaning. Because the New York and Michigan laws regu-late the "transportation or importation" of "intoxicating liquors" for "delivery or use therein," they are exempt fromdormant Commerce Clause scrutiny.

As Justice Thomas has demonstrated, the text of theTwenty-first Amendment is a far more reliable guide to its
meaning than the unwritten rules that the majority enforcestoday. I therefore join his persuasive and comprehensive
dissenting opinion.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

A century ago, this Court repeatedly invalidated, as incon-sistent with the negative Commerce Clause, state liquor legislation that prevented out-of-state businesses from shippingliquor directly to a State's residents. The Webb-Kenyon Act
and the Twenty-first Amendment cut off this intrusive re-view, as their text and history make clear and as this Court's
early cases on the Twenty-first Amendment recognized.The Court today seizes back this power, based primarily on
a historical argument that this Court decisively rejectedlong ago in State Bd. of Equalization of Cal. v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 59, 64 (1936). Because I would followYoung's Market and the language of both the statute that
Congress enacted and the Amendment that the Nation rati-fied, rather than the Court's questionable reading of history
and the "negative implications" of the Commerce Clause,I respectfully dissent.

negative Commerce Clause barrier to state regulation of liq-uor sales to in-state consumers.

A
The Webb-Kenyon Act immunizes from negative Com-merce Clause review the state liquor laws that the Court

holds are unconstitutional. The Act "prohibit[s]" any "ship-ment or transportation" of alcoholic beverages "into any
State" when those beverages are "intended, by any personinterested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any
manner used . . . in violation of any law of such State." 1State laws that regulate liquor imports in the manner described by the Act are exempt from judicial scrutiny underthe negative Commerce Clause, as this Court has long held.
See McCormick & Co. v. Brown, 286 U. S. 131, 139-140(1932);

Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242U. S. 311, 324 (1917); Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. North Carolina, 245 U. S. 298, 303-304 (1917). The Webb-Kenyon Act'slanguage, in other words, "prevent[s] the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permitthe receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws." Clark Distilling, supra, at 324.

1 The Webb-Kenyon Act provides:
"The shipment or transportation, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating
liquor of any kind from one State, Territory, or District of the United
States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof,
into any other State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place
noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or from any foreign country into any State, Territory, or District of the United States, or
place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, which said
spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold,
or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in
violation of any law of such State, Territory, or District of the United
States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, is

The Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws arewithin the Webb-Kenyon Act's terms and therefore do not

run afoul of the negative Commerce Clause. Those laws re-strict out-of-state wineries from shipping and selling wine
directly to Michigan and New York consumers. Ante, at469, 470. Any winery that ships wine directly to a Michigan
or New York consumer in violation of those state-law restrictions is a "person interested therein" "intend[ing]" to "s[ell]"wine "in violation of " Michigan and New York law, and thus

comes within the terms of the Webb-Kenyon Act.This construction of the Webb-Kenyon Act is no innovation. The Court adopted this reading of the Act in McCormick & Co. v. Brown, supra, and Congress approved it
shortly thereafter in 1935 when it reenacted the Act without
alteration, 49 Stat. 877; see, e. g., Keene Corp. v. United
States, 508 U. S. 200, 212-213 (1993) (applying presumption
that reenacted statute incorporates settled judicial construction). McCormick considered a state law that prohibited
out-of-state manufacturers (as well as in-state manufacturers) from shipping liquor to a licensed in-state dealer without
first obtaining a wholesaler permit. The Court held that by
shipping liquor into the State without a license, the out-ofstate manufacturer "[fell] directly within the terms of " the
Webb-Kenyon Act, thus violating it. 286 U. S., at 143; see
also Rainier Brewing Co. v. Great Northern Pacific S. S. Co.,
259 U. S. 150, 152-153 (1922) (holding that under the WebbKenyon Act, beer importers must "carry" beer into the State
"in the manner allowed by the laws of that State"). While
the law at issue in McCormick did not discriminate against
out-of-state products, the construction of the Webb-Kenyon
Act it adopted applies equally to state laws that so discriminate. If an out-of-state manufacturer shipping liquor to an
in-state distributor without a license "s[ells]" liquor "in violation of any law of such State" within the meaning of WebbKenyon, as McCormick held, an out-of-state winery directly

tory state law does so as well. The Michigan and New York
laws are indistinguishable in relevant part from the state law
upheld in McCormick.2

The Court answers that the Webb-Kenyon Act's text
"readily can be construed as forbidding `shipment or transportation' only where it runs afoul of the States' generally
applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use."
Ante, at 482. What the Court means by "generally applicable" laws is unclear, for the Court concedes that the WebbKenyon Act allows States to pass laws discriminating against
out-of-state wholesalers. See ante, at 484, 488-489. By
"generally applicable [state] laws," therefore, the Court apparently means all state laws except for those that "discriminate" against out-of-state liquor products. See ante, at 482-
484, 488-489.

The Court leaves unexplained how this ad hoc exception
follows from the Act's text. The Act's language leaves no
room for this exception. The Act does not condition a
State's ability to regulate the receipt, possession, and use of
liquor free from negative Commerce Clause immunity on the
character of the state law. It does not mention "discrimination," much less discrimination against out-of-state liquor
products. Instead, it prohibits the interstate shipment of
liquor into a State "in violation of any law of such State."
27 U. S. C. $ 122. "[A]ny law of such State" means any law,
including a "discriminatory" one.

The Court's distinction between discrimination against
manufacturers and discrimination against wholesalers is

2 The Court notes that McCormick held that the Webb-Kenyon Act only
authorized "valid" laws, the suggestion being that McCormick's holding
applies only to nondiscriminatory (and hence "valid" laws). Ante, at 482.
The Court takes this word out of context. By "valid" laws, McCormick
meant laws not pre-empted by the National Prohibition Act, rather than
laws that treated in-state and out-of-state products equally. See 286
U. S., at 143-144 (finding the legislation "valid" because the National Prohibition Act did not pre-empt it).

equally unjustified. There is no warrant in the Act's textfor treating regulated entities differently depending on their

place in the distribution chain: The Act applies in undifferen-tiated fashion to "any person interested therein." A wine
manufacturer shipping wine directly to a consumer is an in-terested party, just as an out-of-state liquor wholesaler is.

The contrast between the language of the Webb-KenyonAct and its predecessor, the Wilson Act, casts still more

doubt on the Court's reading. The Wilson Act provided thatliquor shipped into a State was "subject to the operation and
effect of the laws of such State . . . to the same extent andin the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had
been produced in such State or Territory." $ 121. Evenif this language does not authorize States to discriminate
against out-of-state liquor products, see ante, at 478, theWebb-Kenyon Act has no comparable language addressing discrimination. The contrast is telling. It shows thatthe Webb-Kenyon Act encompasses laws that discriminate against both out-of-state wholesalers and out-of-statemanufacturers.

In support of its conclusion that the Webb-Kenyon Act didnot authorize States to discriminate, the Court relies heavily
on Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242U. S. 311 (1917). Ante, at 481-482. Its reliance is misplaced. Clark Distilling held that the Webb-Kenyon Actauthorized a nondiscriminatory state law, 242 U. S., at 321-
322, and so had no direct occasion to pass on whether the Actalso authorized discriminatory laws. Nothing in it implicitly

3 The Court also states that the "Webb-Kenyon Act expresses no clear
congressional intent to depart from the principle . . . that discrimination
against out-of-state goods is disfavored." Ante, at 482. That is not correct. It is settled that the Webb-Kenyon Act explicitly abrogates negative Commerce Clause review of state laws that fall within its terms. See
supra, at 498-499. There is no reason to require another clear statement
for each sort of law to which it might apply. The only question is whether,
fairly read, the Webb-Kenyon Act covers Michigan's and New York's
direct-shipment laws. As I have explained, it does.

decided that unsettled question in the manner the Courtsuggests.

To the extent that it is relevant, Clark Distilling supportsthe view that the Webb-Kenyon Act authorized States to discriminate. Contrary to the Court's suggestion, Clark Dis-tilling did not say (on pages 321, 322, or elsewhere) that the
Webb-Kenyon Act "empowered [States] to forbid shipmentsof alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that [they]
treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms."
Ante, at 481. Instead, Clark Distilling construed theWebb-Kenyon Act to "extend that which was done by the

Wilson Act" in that its "purpose was to prevent the immunitycharacteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in Statescontrary to their laws." 242 U. S., at 324. The Court takes
this passage only to refer to "nondiscriminatory" state laws,
ante, at 481, but this is not correct. The passage the Court
cites implies that the Webb-Kenyon Act also abrogatedthe nondiscrimination principle of the negative Commerce

Clause, since that principle flows from the "immunity characteristic of interstate commerce," no less than any other nega-tive Commerce Clause doctrine. In other words,

Clark Distilling recognized that the Webb-Kenyon Act took "theprotection of interstate commerce away from

all receipt and
possession of liquor prohibited by state law." 242 U. S., at325 (emphasis added).

Clark Distilling thus confirms what
the text of the Webb-Kenyon Act makes clear: The Webb-Kenyon Act "extended" the Wilson Act by completely immunizing all state laws regulating liquor imports from negativeCommerce Clause restraints.

4 The Court also opines that, quite apart from the Webb-Kenyon Act,
the Wilson Act "expressly precludes States from discriminating." Ante,
at 483. It does not. The Wilson Act "precludes" States from nothing.
Instead, it authorizes them to regulate liquor free of negative Commerce
Clause restraints by "subject[ing]" imported liquor "to the operation" of
state law, taking state law as it finds it. 27 U. S. C. $ 121. Even if, as

Straying from the Webb-Kenyon Act's text, the Courtspeculates that Congress intended the Act merely to overrule a discrete line of this Court's negative Commerce Clausecases invalidating "nondiscriminatory" state liquor regulation laws, including Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U. S.438 (1898), and

Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412 (1898). Ante,at 478-484. According to the majority, ante, at 483-484, the

Webb-Kenyon Act left untouched this Court's cases prevent-ing States from regulating liquor in "discriminatory" fashion.
See, e. g., Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 58 (1897) (Scott); Wallingv.

Michigan, 116 U. S. 446 (1886); and Tiernan v. Rinker, 102U. S. 123 (1880). The plain language of the Webb-Kenyon

Act makes the Court's guesswork about Congress' intent un-necessary. But even taken on its own terms, the majority's
historical argument is unpersuasive. History reveals thatthe Webb-Kenyon Act overturned not only Vance and
Rhodes, but also Scott and therefore its "nondiscrimination"principle.

The origins of the Webb-Kenyon Act are in this Court'sdecision in Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100 (1890). Leisy held
that States were prohibited from regulating the resale ofalcohol imported from outside the State so long as the liquor
stayed in its "original packag[e]." Id., at 124-125. Thisrule made it more difficult for States to prohibit the in-state
consumption of liquor. Even if a State banned the domesticproduction of liquor altogether,

Leisy left it powerless tostop the flow of liquor from outside its borders.

Congress reacted swiftly by enacting the Wilson Act inAugust 1890. The Wilson Act authorized States to regulate
liquor "upon arrival in such State" whether "in original packthe Court suggests, the Wilson Act does not authorize States to discriminate, ante, at 478, the Webb-Kenyon Act extends that authorization to
cover discriminatory state laws. The only question here is the scope of
the broader, more inclusive Webb-Kenyon Act. The Court's argument
therefore adds nothing to the analysis.

ages or otherwise," 27 U. S. C. $ 121, and therefore subjected
imports to state jurisdiction "upon arrival within the jurisdiction of the State." Rhodes, supra, at 433 (Gray, J., dissenting). The Wilson Act accordingly abrogated Leisy and
similar decisions by subjecting liquor imports to the operation of state law once the liquor came within a State's geographic borders.

Rather than holding that the Wilson Act meant what it
said, three decisions of this Court construed the Act to be a
virtual nullity. The first was Scott, supra. South Carolina
had decided to regulate traffic in liquor by monopolizing the
sale and distribution of liquor. All liquor, whether produced
in or out of the State, could be sold to consumers in the State
only by the state commissioner of alcohol. Id., at 66-68, n. 1,
92. The law thus prohibited out-of-state manufacturers and
wholesalers, as well as their in-state counterparts, from shipping liquor directly to consumers.

The appellee, Donald, was a citizen of South Carolina who
had ordered liquor directly from out-of-state shippers for his
own personal use, rather than through the state monopoly
system as South Carolina law required. Id., at 59; see also
Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 107, 108-109 (1897) (Donald).
South Carolina officials seized the liquor he ordered after it
had crossed South Carolina lines, but before he had received
it. Donald sued the officials for damages, as well as an injunction allowing him to import liquor directly from out-ofstate shippers for his own personal use. Scott, supra, at
69-70; Donald, supra, at 109-110.

The Court held that South Carolina's ban on the direct
shipment of liquor unconstitutionally interfered with the
right of out-of-state entities to ship liquor directly to consumers for their personal use, entitling Donald to damages
and injunctive relief. Scott, supra, at 78, 99-100; Donald,
supra, at 114; see also Vance, supra, at 452 (describing the

shipment into the State from other States of intoxicating liquors for the use of a resident"). The Court reasoned that
the ban on importation, "in effect, discriminate[d] between
interstate and domestic commerce in commodities to make
and use which are admitted to be lawful." Scott, 165 U. S.,
at 100. The Court reserved the question whether a state
monopoly system that allowed consumers to import liquor
directly was constitutional; for the Court, it "suffic[ed]" that
South Carolina's ban on imports "discriminate[d] against the
bringing of such articles in, and importing them from other
States." Id., at 101. The Court's excuse for holding that
the Wilson Act did not save the State's ban on importation
was the same as the Court's excuse today: that the Wilson Act did not authorize "discriminatory" state legislation.
Ibid. On this basis, the Court affirmed Donald's damages
award. Ibid.

In response to Scott, Senator Tillman of South Carolina
quickly introduced the first version of what became the
Webb-Kenyon Act. His bill explicitly attempted to reverse
the Scott decision. The Senate Report on the bill noted that
"[t]he effect of [Scott was] to throw down all the barriers
erected by the State law, in which she is protected by the
Wilson bill, and allow the untrammeled importation of liquor
into the State upon the simple claim that it is for private
use." S. Rep. No. 151, 55th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1897). The
Report also addressed Scott's holding that South Carolina's
ban on importation was "discriminatory" and adopted the
Scott dissenter's view that the ban on importation effected
"no discrimination against citizens of other States." S. Rep.
No. 151, at 5. The bill accordingly would have amended the
Wilson Act to grant States " `absolute control of . . . liquors
or liquids within their borders, by whomsoever produced and
for whatever use imported.' " 30 Cong. Rec. 2612 (1897).
The bill passed in the Senate without debate. It failed in
the House, perhaps because the House Judiciary Committee

Thomas, J., dissenting
added an amendment that barred discrimination against theproducts of other States, leaving

Scott intact. H. R. Rep.
No. 667, 55th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1898).Meanwhile, the Court continued to narrow the reach of

the Wilson Act. In Rhodes and Vance, the Court even morebroadly stripped States of their control over liquor regulation. Rhodes did so by holding that the phrase "upon arrival
in such State" in the Wilson Act meant that state law couldregulate imports only after their delivery to a consignee

within the State. 170 U. S., at 421 (internal quotation marksomitted). This meant that States could regulate imported
liquor, even when in its original package, but only after it
had been delivered to the eventual consignee. Rhodes, in
other words, read the Wilson Act to overturn Leisy, but not
Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465
(1888), which had recognized a constitutional right to import
liquor in its original package free from state regulation until
it reached its consignee. Rhodes, supra, at 423. Like
Leisy, then, Rhodes seriously hampered the ability of States
to intercept liquor at their borders.

Vance involved the constitutionality of a law very similar
to the law struck down in Scott. After its loss in Scott,
South Carolina amended its ban on importation. Rather
than flatly banning imports unless they went through the
state monopoly system, the new law allowed out-of-state
wholesalers and manufacturers to ship liquor directly to consumers, but only if the consumer showed that the liquor
passed a state-administered test of its purity. Vance, 170
U. S., at 454-455.

Vance had two distinct holdings. First, the Court struck
down this condition on the direct importation of liquor as
an impermissible burden on "the constitutional right of the
non-resident to ship into the State and of the resident in the
State to receive for his own use." Id., at 455. The Court
derived the right to direct importation primarily from the
"ruling" of Scott that a State could not "forbid the shipment

Thomas, J., dissenting
into the State from other States of intoxicating liquors forthe use of a resident." 170 U. S., at 452.

Second, the Court held that, apart from its ban on directshipments of liquor to consumers, South Carolina's monopoly
over liquor distribution was otherwise constitutional. Id.,at 450-452. It rejected the argument that this monopoly
system was unconstitutionally discriminatory. In particu-lar, the Court reasoned that the monopoly system was not
discriminatory because Scott had held (a holding that Rhodeshad fortified) that South Carolina consumers had a constitutional right to import liquor for their own personal use, evenif a State otherwise monopolized the sale and distribution of
liquor.5 A monopoly system, the Court implied, was nondis-criminatory under the rule of

Scott only if it also allowedconsumers to import liquor from out-of-state shippers for

their own personal use. Three Justices in Vance dissentedfrom that holding, on the ground that such a state monopoly
system constituted unconstitutional discrimination under,among other cases,

Scott and Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S.446 (1886). 170 U. S., at 462-468 (opinion of Shiras, J., joined

by Fuller, C. J., and McKenna, J.).Rhodes and Vance swept more broadly than Sco tt.
Rhodes held that States lacked power to regulate importedliquor before it reached the consignee, regardless of whether
the liquor was intended for the consignee's personal use, seesupra, at 506; it did not, as the Court implies, simply repeat
Scott's holding that consumers had a right to import liquorfor their own personal use, ante, at 480. Rhodes' holding,

5 See Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U. S. 438, 451-452 (1898) ("But
the weight of [the argument that the state monopoly system is discriminatory] is overcome when it is considered that the Interstate Commerce
clause of the Constitution guarantees the right to ship merchandise from
one State into another, and protects it until the termination of the shipment by delivery at the place of consignment, and this right is wholly
unaffected by the act of Congress [i. e., the Wilson Act] which allows state
authority to attach to the original package before sale but only after delivery. Scott v. Donald, supra; Rhodes v. Iowa").

Thomas, J., dissenting
for example, made it easier for bootleggers to circumventstate prohibitions on the resale of imported liquor, because

it enabled them to order large quantities of liquor directlyfrom out-of-state interests. For its part,

Vance held that
the right to import for personal use recognized in Scottapplied even if the State conditioned the right to import

directly on compliance with regulatory conditions (e. g.,
a state-administered purity test). Those broader holdings,consequently, spurred more vigorous congressional attempts

to return control of liquor regulation to the States. See R.Hamm, Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment 206-212 (1995)
(hereinafter Hamm); Rogers, Interstate Commerce in Intoxicating Liquors Before the Webb-Kenyon Act, 4 Va. L. Rev.
353, 364-365 (1917). The legislative debate in subsequent
years accordingly focused on their effect. That may be what
misleads the majority into believing that the Webb-Kenyon
Act took aim only at Rhodes and Vance.

Yet early versions of the Webb-Kenyon Act, not to mention the Act itself, also overturned Scott's holding that banning the direct shipment of liquor for personal use was
unconstitutionally discriminatory. Like Senator Tillman's
initial bill, other early versions of the Webb-Kenyon Act took
aim at Scott, Rhodes, and Vance. They made clear that outof-state liquor was subject to state law immediately upon
entering the State's territorial boundaries, even if intended
for personal use. See Hamm 206, 208.

The version that eventually became the Webb-Kenyon Act
was likewise designed to overturn the holdings of all three
cases, and thus to reverse Scott's "nondiscrimination" principle. The House Report says that the bill was "intended to
withdraw the protecting hand of interstate commerce from
intoxicating liquors transported into a State or Territory and
intended to be used therein in violation of the law of such
State or Territory." H. R. Rep. No. 1461, 62d Cong., 3d
Sess., 1 (1913). Thus, the bill targeted Scott's notion (as applied by Vance) that imports destined for personal use were

Thomas, J., dissenting
exempt from state regulation. There was no mention of anexception for "discriminatory" state laws, though such an

amendment to an earlier version of the Webb-Kenyon Acthad been proposed before, see

supra, at 505-506; the idea
was that imports were subject to state law once within aState's geographic borders, regardless of the law's character.

In fact, proponents of the final version of the bill defeated
proposed amendments that would have restrained Statesfrom restricting imports destined for personal use, and

thereby would have left Scott intact. Hamm 215; 49 Cong.Rec. 2921 (1913); see also H. R. Rep. No. 2337, 58th Cong.,
2d Sess., 2-3 (1904) (prior unenacted version drawing exception for shipments for in-state personal use).

In contrast to those unenacted amendments, the WebbKenyon Act reversed Scott, Rhodes, and Vance by forbidding
the importation of liquor "intended to be received, possessed,
sold or in any manner used . . . in violation of any law of
such state"--regardless of the nature of the state law or the
imported liquor's intended use. See Seaboard Air Line R.
Co., 245 U. S., at 304 (noting that the Webb-Kenyon Act allowed States to regulate "irrespective of any personal right
in a consignee there to have and consume liquor"). That is
why, just four years after its enactment, this Court described
the Webb-Kenyon Act as removing "the protection of interstate commerce away from all receipt and possession of liquor prohibited by state law." Clark Distilling, 242 U. S., at
325 (emphasis added).

The foregoing historical account belies the majority's claim
that the Webb-Kenyon Act left Scott untouched. The Court
reasons that the Webb-Kenyon Act overturned only those
decisions that " `in effect afford[ed] a means by subterfuge
and indirection to set [state liquor laws] at naught,' " ante, at
482 (quoting Clark Distilling, supra, at 324), a description
the Court takes to cover Rhodes and Vance, but not Scott.
However, Scott's holding, by precluding state monopoly systems from prohibiting direct shipments of liquor to consum544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
ers, "set [state liquor laws] at naught" just as Rhodes and
Vance did. The Court concedes that the Webb-Kenyon Act
"close[d] the direct-shipment gap" and that Scott recognizeda constitutional right for consumers to import liquor directly

for their own personal use. Ante, at 480, 481. These con-cessions cannot be squared with the Court's simultaneous
suggestion, ante, at 481-484, that the Webb-Kenyon Act left
Scott untouched. The only way to overturn Scott's direct-shipment holding was to abrogate its premise that South

Carolina's monopoly system was unconstitutionally discrimi-natory, as Senator Tillman recognized from the start. See
supra, at 505. Reversing Scott's holding that a State could
not ban direct shipments of liquor to consumers was a core
concern of the Webb-Kenyon Act.

Repudiating Scott's nondiscrimination holding was also essential to ensuring the constitutionality of state liquor licensing schemes and state monopolies on the sale and distribution of liquor. This is so because the constitutionality of
these state systems remained in some doubt even after
Vance. As explained, Vance upheld South Carolina's monopoly system (stripped of its ban on direct shipments) as
"nondiscriminatory" only because that system had preserved
the constitutional right established in Scott and Rhodes to
send and receive direct shipments of liquor free of state interference. Supra, at 506-507. The Court admits that the
Webb-Kenyon Act abolished that right. Ante, at 481. Had
the Webb-Kenyon Act done so without also allowing the
States to discriminate, Vance's reasoning implied that the
Court was likely to strike down state monopoly systems, and
therefore probably licensing schemes as well, as unduly "discriminatory." See 170 U. S., at 451 (equating a state monopoly scheme with a private licensing scheme). The only way
to stave off that holding, and so to preserve States' ability
to regulate liquor traffic, was to overturn Scott's "nondiscrimination" reasoning. Faced with a Judiciary that had
narrowly construed the Wilson Act, see supra, at 504-508,

544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

511Cite as: 544 U. S. 460 (2005)
Thomas, J., dissenting
Congress drafted the Webb-Kenyon Act to authorize allstate regulation of importation, whether or not "discriminatory." Just as Rhodes read the Wilson Act to repudiateLeisy but not Bowman, see supra, at 506, the majority reads
the Webb-Kenyon Act to repudiate Rhodes but not Scott,committing an analogous error. I would not so construe
the Webb-Kenyon Act. C

The majority disagrees with this historical account pri-marily by disputing my reading of Scott. It reads Scott to
have held two things: first, that certain discriminatory provi-sions of South Carolina's monopoly system were not authorized by the Wilson Act, and therefore were unconstitutional;and second, that Donald had a constitutional right to import
liquor directly from out-of-state shippers. Ante, at 478-480.This recharacterization of

Scott (together with its mischarac-terization of Rhodes' holding, see supra, at 506) is the basis

for the Court's contention that the Webb-Kenyon Act onlyoverruled Scott's second holding, leaving the first untouched.
Ante, at 481-484.The Court misreads Scott. Scott had only one holding:
that the state monopoly system unconstitutionally discrimi-nated against Donald by allowing him to purchase liquor
from in-state stores, but not directly from out-of-state inter-ests. The issue of direct importation was squarely at issue
in Scott, not simply "implicit." Ante, at 480. This was theonly basis, after all, for affirming Donald's damages award
for interference with his ability to import goods directlyfrom outside the State.

Scott's reasoning that the SouthCarolina law was unconstitutionally discriminatory was the

basis for affirming that award, not a separate and distinctholding.

While South Carolina law also allowed the state alcoholadministrator to discriminate against out-of-state liquor
when purchasing liquor for sale through the monopoly sys-tem,

Thomas, J., dissenting
portions of the law would have been at most grounds forallowing Donald to purchase out-of-state liquor through the

state monopoly system, as the dissent argued (and as themajority strains to characterize

Scott's actual holding, ante,
at 479). See 165 U. S., at 104-106 (Brown, J., dissenting).But

Scott rejected that view and held that the broader discrimination effected by the law was grounds for allowing
Donald to import liquor directly himself, bypassing the mo-nopoly system entirely.

Scott's holding therefore rested on
a conclusion that a ban on direct importation was "discrimi-nation" under the negative Commerce Clause. That conclusion was natural for Justice Shiras, the author of Scott,
whose view apparently was that all state monopoly systems,
even ones that seem nondiscriminatory to our modern eyes,
were unconstitutionally discriminatory. See Vance, supra,
at 465, 467 (Shiras, J., dissenting) (citing the nondiscrimination cases Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446 (1886), and
Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313 (1890)). The Court's narrower understanding of "discrimination" is anachronistic.

Vance confirms this reading of Scott. Vance correctly
characterized Scott as establishing a right for consumers
to receive shipments of liquor directly from out-of-state
sources. 170 U. S., at 452. It also characterized Scott's reasoning as resting on the discriminatory character of the state
law. 170 U. S., at 449. These two descriptions, taken together, suggest that the discriminatory character of the law
was the basis for Scott's holding that Donald had a constitutional right to receive liquor directly, instead of a separate
holding. Moreover, Vance also implied that a monopoly system that did not allow consumers to receive liquor directly
was unconstitutionally discriminatory. See supra, at 507.
That suggestion supports the idea that Scott considered a
ban on such direct shipments to be discriminatory.

Brennen v. Southern Express Co., 106 S. C. 102, 90 S. E.
402 (1916), likewise bolsters that Scott considered South Carolina's ban on direct importation to be unconstitutionally dis544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
criminatory, quite apart from the provisions that authorizedthe state administrator of alcohol to prefer local products

over out-of-state ones. See ante, at 478-479 (describing dis-criminatory provisions). In

Brennen, the court considered
the constitutionality of a state monopoly system that chan-neled all liquor through state dispensaries by banning direct

shipments, but that allowed a consumer to import directly
one gallon of liquor per month for his own personal use. 106S. C., at 107-108, 90 S. E., at 403. Though out-of-state liquor

had equal access to the state-run liquor dispensaries, seegenerally 2 S. C. Crim. Code $$ 794-878 (1912) (providing for
otherwise nondiscriminatory state-run monopoly system),
the court held that this system unconstitutionally discriminated against out-of-state liquor because it allowed consumers to purchase only a limited quantity of liquor via direct
shipments, yet unlimited amounts from state stores. The
court noted that "there was no limit to the quantity which a
citizen who patronized the dispensaries might buy and keep
in his possession for personal use," whereas the law limited
direct-shipment purchases to a specific quantity each month.
106 S. C., at 108, 90 S. E., at 403. This, the court reasoned,
"was, therefore, clearly a discrimination made in favor of liquors bought from the dispensaries," and so was unconstitutionally discriminatory under the rule of Scott. 106 S. C., at
108, 90 S. E., at 403-404. The court thus recognized that
Scott's reasoning implied that a state monopoly system was
unconstitutionally discriminatory unless it allowed consumers to purchase liquor directly from out-of-state shippers on
the same terms as they could purchase liquor from the state
monopoly system.

Brennen refutes the Court's characterization of Scott. It
shows that the South Carolina system at issue in Scott was
"discriminatory" because it banned direct importation, not
because its provisions authorized the state alcohol administrator to prefer local products. Even the Court concedes
that the Webb-Kenyon Act abrogated the right to direct im544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

portation recognized in Scott. See ante, at 480, 481. It fol-lows that the Act also overturned the nondiscrimination reasoning that was the foundation of that right.In sum, the Webb-Kenyon Act authorizes the discriminatory state laws before the Court today.

II
There is no need to interpret the Twenty-first Amend-ment, because the Webb-Kenyon Act resolves these cases.

However, the state laws the Court strikes down are lawfulunder the plain meaning of $ 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, as this Court's case law in the wake of the Amendmentand the contemporaneous practice of the States reinforce.

A
Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment provides: "Thetransportation or importation into any State, Territory, or

possession of the United States for delivery or use thereinof intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is
hereby prohibited." As the Court notes, ante, at 484, thislanguage tracked the Webb-Kenyon Act by authorizing state
regulation that would otherwise conflict with the negativeCommerce Clause. To remove any doubt regarding its
broad scope, the Amendment simplified the language of theWebb-Kenyon Act and made clear that States could regulate importation destined for in-state delivery free of nega-tive Commerce Clause restraints. Though the Twenty-first
Amendment mirrors the basic terminology of the Webb-Kenyon Act, its language is broader, authorizing States to
regulate all "transportation or importation" that runs afoulof state law. The broader language even more naturally encompasses discriminatory state laws. Its terms suggest, forexample, that a State may ban imports entirely while leaving
in-state liquor unregulated, for they do not condition theState's ability to prohibit imports on the manner in which
state law treats domestic products.

The state laws at issue in these cases fall within $ 2's broadterms. They prohibit wine manufacturers from "transport[ing] or import[ing]" wine directly to consumers in NewYork and Michigan "for delivery or use therein." Michigan
law does so by requiring all out-of-state wine manufacturersto distribute wine through licensed in-state wholesalers.
Ante, at 468-469. New York law does so by prohibiting
out-of-state wineries from shipping wine directly to consum-ers unless they establish an in-state physical presence, something that in-state wineries naturally have. Ante, at 470,474-476. The Twenty-first Amendment prohibits out-ofstate wineries from shipping wine into Michigan and New
York in violation of these laws. In holding that the Constitution prohibits Michigan's and New York's laws, the majority turns the Amendment's text on its head.

The majority's holding is also at odds with this Court's
early Twenty-first Amendment case law. In State Bd. of
Equalization of Cal. v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 59
(1936), this Court considered the constitutionality of a California law that facially discriminated against beer importers
and, by extension, out-of-state producers. The California
law required wholesalers to pay a special $500 license fee to
import beer, in addition to the $50 fee California charged
for wholesalers to distribute beer generally. Id., at 60-61.
California law thus discriminated against out-of-state beer
by charging wholesalers of imported beer 11 times the fee
charged to wholesalers of domestic beer.

Young's Market held that this explicit discrimination
against out-of-state beer products came within the terms of
the Twenty-first Amendment, and therefore did not run afoul
of the negative Commerce Clause. The Court reasoned that
the Twenty-first Amendment's words are "apt to confer upon
the State the power to forbid all importations which do not
comply with the conditions which it prescribes." Id., at 62.
The Court rejected the argument that a State "must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms,"

516 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Thomas, J., dissenting
declaring that "[t]o say that, would involve not a constructionof the Amendment, but a rewriting of it."

Ibid. It recognized that a State could adopt a "discriminatory" regulationof out-of-state manufacturers as an incident to a "lesser degree of regulation than total prohibition," for example, byimposing "a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of
beer," or by "channel[ing] desired importations by confining
them to a single consignee." Id., at 63 (punctuation omit-ted). And far from "[not] consider[ing]" the historical argument that forms the core of the majority's reasoning, ante,at 485,

Young's Market expressly rejected its relevance:

"The plaintiffs argue that limitation of the broad language of the Twenty-first Amendment is sanctioned by
its history; and by the decisions of this Court on theWilson Act, the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Reed Amendment. As we think the language of the Amendment isclear, we do not discuss these matters." 299 U. S., at
63-64 (footnote omitted).
The plaintiffs in Young's Market advanced virtually the samehistorical argument the Court today accepts. Brief for Appellees, O. T. 1936, No. 22, pp. 57-75. Young's Market properly reasoned that the text of our Constitution is the bestguide to its meaning. That logic requires sustaining the

state laws that the Court invalidates.

Young's Market was no outlier. The next Term, the
Court upheld a Minnesota law that prohibited the impor-tation of 50-proof liquor, concluding that "discrimination

against imported liquor is permissible." Mahoney v. Joseph
Triner Corp., 304 U. S. 401, 403 (1938). One Term after
that, the Court upheld two state laws that prohibited the
importation of liquor from States that discriminated against
domestic liquor. See Indianapolis Brewing Co. v. Liquor
Control Comm'n, 305 U. S. 391, 394 (1939) (noting that the
Twenty-first Amendment permitted States to "discriminat[e]
between domestic and imported intoxicating liquors");

Joseph S. Finch & Co. v. McKittrick, 305 U. S. 395, 398(1939). In sum, the Court recognized from the start that

"[t]he Twenty-first Amendment sanctions the right of a Stateto legislate concerning intoxicating liquors brought from
without, unfettered by the Commerce Clause." Ziffrin, Inc.v. Reeves, 308 U. S. 132, 138 (1939); accord, Duckworth v. Arkansas, 314 U. S. 390, 398-399 (1941) (Jackson, J., concurringin result);

Amendment, as Justice Stevens properly stresses. Ante,at 495 (dissenting opinion).

B
The widespread, unquestioned acceptance of the three-tier system of liquor regulation, see

ante, at 466-467, andthe contemporaneous practice of the States following the

ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment confirm thatthe Amendment freed the States from negative Commerce
Clause restraints on discriminatory regulation. Like theWebb-Kenyon Act, the Twenty-first Amendment was designed to remove any doubt regarding whether state monop-oly and licensing schemes violated the Commerce Clause, as
the majority properly acknowledges. Ante, at 488-489; seealso

supra, at 510-511. Accordingly, in response to the endof Prohibition, States that made liquor legal imposed either

state monopoly systems, or licensing schemes strictly cir-cumscribing the ability of private interests to sell and distribute liquor within state borders. Skilton, State PowerUnder the Twenty-First Amendment, 7 Brooklyn L. Rev.
342, 345-346 (1938); L. Harrison & E. Laine, After Repeal:A Study of Liquor Control Administration 43 (1936).

These liquor regulation schemes discriminated againstout-of-state economic interests, just as Michigan's and New
York's direct-shipment laws do. State monopolies that didnot permit direct shipments to consumers, for example, were

thought to discriminate against out-of-state wholesalers andretailers by favoring in-state products. See Vance, 170

U. S., at 451-452; supra, at 507. Private licensing schemesdiscriminated as well, often by requiring in-state residency
or physical presence as a condition of obtaining licenses.6Even today, the requirement that liquor pass through a licensed in-state wholesaler is a core component of the threetier system. As the Court concedes, each of these schemesis within the ambit of the Twenty-first Amendment, even

though each discriminates against out-of-state interests.
Ante, at 466-467, 488-489.

Many States had laws that discriminated against out-of-state products in addition to out-of-state wholesalers and

retailers. See Kallenbach, Interstate Commerce in Intox6 See Note, Economic Localism in State Alcoholic Beverage Laws--

that discriminated against out-of-state products, many if notmost of which (contrary to the Court's suggestion,

ante, at
485) predated Young's Market and its progeny. See, e. g.,Green App. I. This contemporaneous state practice refutes the Court's assertion, ante, at 484-485, 488-489, thatthe Twenty-first Amendment allowed States to discriminate against out-of-state wholesalers and retailers, but not
against out-of-state products.Rather than credit the lay consensus this state practice

reflects, the Court relies instead on scattered academic andjudicial commentary arguing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not permit States to enact discriminatory liquor
legislation. Ante, at 485-486. Most of the commentators
and judges the Court cites did not adopt the construction of
the Amendment the Court embraces. For example, some
argued that the Twenty-first Amendment only allowed
States to enact nondiscriminatory prohibition laws--i. e., to
allow "dry states to remain dry." See Note, 55 Yale L. J.
815, 816-817 (1946); de Ganahl, The Scope of Federal Power

The Court, by contrast, concedes that a State could have a
discriminatory licensing or monopoly scheme. Ante, at 488-
489. The Court must concede this, given that state practice
shows that the Twenty-first Amendment authorized such
practices, and given that the Webb-Kenyon Act allowed
States to enforce their own licensing laws, even if they did
not prohibit the use and consumption of liquor entirely.
Others apparently defended the position that the Twentyfirst Amendment did no more than prevent Congress from
permitting the direct importation of liquor into a State, leav544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Market Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 12 F. Supp.140, 142 (SD Cal. 1935), rev'd, 299 U. S. 59 (1936). Still

others did not state a clear view on the scope of the Twenty-first Amendment. See generally Legislation, Liquor Control, 38 Colum. L. Rev. 644 (1938); Wiser & Arledge, Does
the Repeal Amendment Empower a State to Erect TariffBarriers and Disregard the Equal Protection Clause in Legislating on Intoxicating Liquors in Interstate Commerce? 7Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 402 (1939) (arguing that the Twenty-first
Amendment did not repeal the Equal Protection Clause).
Instead of following this confused mishmash of elite opinion--the same sort of elite opinion that drove the expansive interpretation of the negative Commerce Clause that
prompted the Twenty-first Amendment--I would credit the
uniform practice of the States whose people ratified the
Twenty-first Amendment. See ante, at 496-497 (Stevens,
J., dissenting).

The majority's reliance on the difference between discrimination against manufacturers (and therefore, their products)
and discrimination against wholesalers and retailers is difficult to understand. The pre-Twenty-first Amendment "nondiscrimination" principle enshrined in this Court's negative
Commerce Clause cases could not have prohibited discrimination against the producers of out-of-state goods, while permitting discrimination against out-of-state services like
wholesaling and retailing. See Lewis v. BT Investment
Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 42 (1980) (invalidating state law
that discriminated against banks, bank holding companies,
and trust companies with out-of-state business operations);

389, 394-395 (1952) (invalidating tax that discriminated
against solicitors for out-of-state-licensed businesses). Discrimination against out-of-state wholesalers and retailers
also risks allowing "economic protectionism." The Court's

Thomas, J., dissenting
concession that the Twenty-first Amendment allowed Statesto require all liquor traffic to pass through in-state wholesalers and retailers shows that States may also havedirect-shipment laws that discriminate against out-of-state
wineries. III

Though the majority dismisses this Court's early Twenty-first Amendment case law, it relies on the reasoning, if not
the holdings, of our more recent Twenty-first Amendmentcases. Ante, at 486-489. But the Court's later cases do not
require the result the majority reaches. Moreover, I wouldresolve any conflict in this Court's precedents in favor of
those cases most contemporaneous with the ratification ofthe Twenty-first Amendment.

A
The test set forth in this Court's more recent Twenty-firstAmendment cases shows that Michigan's and New York's

direct-shipment laws are constitutional. In Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), this Court estab-lished a standard for determining when a discriminatory

state liquor regulation is permissible under the Twenty-firstAmendment. At issue in Bacchus was a Hawaii statute that
imposed a 20 percent excise tax on liquor, but exempted cer-tain locally produced products from the tax. The Court held
that the Twenty-first Amendment did not save the discrimi-natory tax. The Court reasoned that the Twenty-first
Amendment did not permit state laws that constituted "mereeconomic protectionism," because the Twenty-first Amendment's "central purpose . . . was not to empower States tofavor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition." Id., at 276. The Court noted that the State did "notseek to justify its tax on the ground that it was designed to
promote temperance or to carry out any other purpose of theTwenty-first Amendment, but instead acknowledg[ed] that
the purpose was `to promote a local industry.' " Ibid. (quot544US2 Unit: $U45 [11-04-07 13:33:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
ing Brief for Appellee Dias, O. T. 1983, No. 82-1565, p. 40).The Court therefore struck down the tax, "because [it] violate[d] a central tenet of the Commerce Clause but [was] notsupported by any clear concern of the Twenty-first Amendment." 468 U. S., at 276; accord, Brown-Forman Distillers
Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573,
584-585 (1986) ("Our task . . . is to reconcile the interests
protected by the" Twenty-first Amendment and the negativeCommerce Clause)

.
Michigan's and New York's direct-shipment laws are con-stitutional under

Bacchus. Allowing States to regulate the
direct shipment of liquor was of "clear concern" to the framers of the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Twenty-first Amendment. Bacchus, supra, at 276. The driving force behind
the passage of the Webb-Kenyon Act was a desire to reverse
this Court's decisions that had precluded States from regulating the direct shipment of liquor by out-of-state interests.
See supra, at 508-509. The laws struck down in Scott, 165
U. S. 58 (1897), and Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U. S.
438 (1898), required out-of-state manufacturers to ship liquor
through the State's liquor regulation scheme--exactly what
the Michigan and New York schemes do. By contrast, there
is little evidence that purely protectionist tax exemptions
like those at issue in Bacchus were of any concern to the
framers of the Act and the Amendment.

Moreover, if the three-tier liquor regulation system falls
within the "core concerns" of the Twenty-first Amendment,
then so do Michigan's and New York's direct-shipment laws.
The same justifications for requiring wholesalers and retailers to be in-state businesses equally apply to Michigan's and
New York's direct-shipment laws. For example, States require liquor to be shipped through in-state wholesalers because it is easier to regulate in-state wholesalers and retailers. State officials can better enforce their regulations by
inspecting the premises and attaching the property of instate entities; "[p]resence ensures accountability." 358 F. 3d

Thomas, J., dissenting
223, 237 (CA2 2004). It is therefore understandable that theframers of the Twenty-first Amendment and the WebbKenyon Act would have wanted to free States to discrimi-nate between in-state and out-of-state wholesalers and retailers, especially in the absence of the modern technologicalimprovements and federal enforcement mechanisms that the
Court argues now make regulating liquor easier. Ante, at492. Michigan's and New York's laws simply allow some
in-state wineries to act as their own wholesalers and retail-ers in limited circumstances. If allowing a State to require
all wholesalers and retailers to be in-state companies is acore concern of the Twenty-first Amendment, so is allowing
a State to select only in-state manufacturers to ship directlyto consumers, and therefore act, in effect, as their own
wholesalers and retailers. B

The Court places much weight upon the authority of Bacchus. Ante, at 487-488. This is odd, because the Courtdoes not even mention, let alone apply, the "core concerns"

test that Bacchus established. The Court instead sub si-lentio casts aside that test, employing otherwise-applicable
negative Commerce Clause scrutiny and giving no weightto the Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act.
Ante, at 472-476, 489-493. The Court therefore at least im-plicitly acknowledges the unprincipled nature of the test
Bacchus established and the grave departure Bacchus wasfrom this Court's precedents. See 468 U. S., at 278-287
(Stevens, J., dissenting); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.
Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 554-557 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing). Bacchus should be overruled, not fortified with a textually and historically unjustified "nondiscrimination againstproducts" test.

Bacchus' reasoning is unpersuasive. It swept aside theweighty authority of this Court's early Twenty-first Amendment case law, see 468 U. S., at 281-282 (Stevens, J., dis-senting), because the

Bacchus Court thought it " `an absurd

Thomas, J., dissenting
oversimplification' " to conclude that " ` the Twenty-first
Amendment has somehow operated to "repeal" the Commerce Clause,' " id., at 275 (quoting Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon
Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U. S. 324, 331-332 (1964)). The
Twenty-first Amendment did not impliedly repeal the Commerce Clause, but that does not justify Bacchus' narrowing
of the Twenty-first Amendment to its "core concerns."

The Twenty-first Amendment's text has more modest effect than Bacchus supposed. Though its terms are broader
than the Webb-Kenyon Act, the Twenty-first Amendment

also parallels the Act's structure. In particular, the
Twenty-first Amendment provides that any importation into
a State contrary to state law violates the Constitution, just
as the Webb-Kenyon Act provides that any such importation
contrary to state law violates federal law. Its use of those
same terms of art shows that just as the Webb-Kenyon Act
repealed liquor's negative Commerce Clause immunity, the
Twenty-first Amendment likewise insulates state liquor laws
from negative Commerce Clause scrutiny. Authorizing
States to regulate liquor importation free from negative
Commerce Clause restraints is a far cry from precluding
Congress from regulating in that field at all. See Bacchus,
supra, at 279, n. 5 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Moreover, Bacchus' concern that the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the
Commerce Clause is no excuse for ignoring the independent
force of the Webb-Kenyon Act, which equally divested discriminatory state liquor laws of Commerce Clause immunity.

Stripped of Bacchus, the Court's holding is bereft of support in our cases. Bacchus is the only decision of this Court
holding that the Twenty-first Amendment does not authorize
the in-state regulation of imported liquor free of the negative
Commerce Clause. Given the uniformity of our early case
law supporting even discriminatory state laws regulating imports into States, then, Michigan's and New York's laws easily pass muster under this Court's cases.

526 GRANHOLM v. HEALD

Thomas, J., dissenting
Nevertheless, in support of Bacchus' holding that "stateregulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause," ante, at 487, the Court cites
Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor
Authority, 476 U. S. 573 (1986), and Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324 (1989). Ante, at 487. At issue in those
cases was the constitutionality of protectionist legislation
that controlled the price of liquor in other States. BrownForman, supra, at 582-583; Healy, supra, at 337-338. In
invalidating such a statute, Brown-Forman found that theTwenty-first Amendment, by its terms, gives "New York

only the authority to control sales of liquor in New York, and
confers no authority to control sales in other States." 476
U. S., at 585; see also Healy, supra, at 342-343 (following
Brown-Forman's construction). Brown-Forman and Healy
are beside the point in these cases. Brown-Forman did not
involve a facially discriminatory law. See 476 U. S., at 579.
And unlike Healy, there is no claim here that the Michigan
and New York laws do anything but regulate within their
own borders, thereby interfering with the ability of other
States to exercise their own Twenty-first Amendment power.

Equally inapposite are the cases the Court cites concerning state laws that violate other provisions of the Constitution or Acts of Congress. Ante, at 486-487. Cases involving the relation between the Twenty-first Amendment and
Congress' affirmative Commerce Clause power are irrelevant
to whether the Twenty-first Amendment protects state
power against the negative implications of the Commerce
Clause. See James B. Beam, supra, at 556 (O'Connor, J.,
dissenting); Bacchus, supra, at 279, and n. 5 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting). Similarly, my interpretation of the Twentyfirst Amendment would not free States to regulate liquor
unhampered by other constitutional restraints, like the First
Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. As this
Court explained in Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 205-207
(1976), the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment

demonstrate that it displaces liquor's negative CommerceClause immunity, not other constitutional provisions.

IV
The Court begins its opinion by detailing the evils of statelaws that restrict the direct shipment of wine. Ante, at

466-468. It stresses, for example, the Federal Trade Com-mission's opinion that allowing the direct shipment of wine
would enhance consumer welfare. FTC, Possible Anticom-petitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 3-5 (July 2003),
available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/winereport2.pdf(as visited May 12, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's
case file). The Court's focus on these effects suggests thatit believes that its decision serves this Nation well. I am
sure that the judges who repeatedly invalidated state liquorlegislation, even in the face of clear congressional direction
to the contrary, thought the same. See supra, at 503-508.The Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act
took those policy choices away from judges and returnedthem to the States. Whatever the wisdom of that choice,
the Court does this Nation no service by ignoring the textualcommands of the Constitution and Acts of Congress. The
Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act dis-placed the negative Commerce Clause as applied to regulation of liquor imports into a State. They require sustainingthe constitutionality of Michigan's and New York's directshipment laws. I respectfully dissent.

LINGLE, GOVERNOR OF HAWAII, et al. v.CHEVRON U. S. A. INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 04-163. Argued February 22, 2005--Decided May 23, 2005
Concerned about the effects of market concentration on retail gasoline

prices, the Hawaii Legislature passed Act 257, which limits the rent oil
companies may charge dealers leasing company-owned service stations.
Respondent Chevron U. S. A. Inc., then one of the largest oil companies
in Hawaii, brought this suit seeking a declaration that the rent cap effected an unconstitutional taking of its property and an injunction
against application of the cap to its stations. Applying Agins v. City of
Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260--where this Court declared that government
regulation of private property "effects a taking if [it] does not substantially advance legitimate state interests"--the District Court held that
the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not substantially advance
Hawaii's asserted interest in controlling retail gas prices. The Ninth
Circuit affirmed.

Held: Agins' "substantially advance[s]" formula is not an appropriate test

for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking. Pp. 536-548.

(a) The paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a direct
government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.
See, e. g., United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U. S. 114. Beginning
with Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, however, the
Court recognized that government regulation of private property may
be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or
ouster. Regulatory actions generally will be deemed per se takings for
Fifth Amendment purposes (1) where government requires an owner
to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property, see Loretto
v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, or (2) where
regulations completely deprive an owner of "all economically beneficial
us[e]" of her property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505
U. S. 1003, 1019. Outside these two categories (and the special context
of land-use exactions discussed below), regulatory takings challenges
are governed by Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S.
104, 124. Penn Central identified several factors--including the regulation's economic impact on the claimant, the extent to which it interferes

Syllabus
with distinct investment-backed expectations, and the character of the
government action--that are particularly significant in determining
whether a regulation effects a taking. Because the three inquiries reflected in Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central all aim to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to a direct appropriation
of or ouster from private property, each of them focuses upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon property rights.
Pp. 536-540.

(b) The "substantially advances" formula is not a valid method of
identifying compensable regulatory takings. It prescribes an inquiry
in the nature of a due process test, which has no proper place in the
Court's takings jurisprudence. The formula unquestionably was derived from due process precedents, since Agins supported it with citations to Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, 185, and Village of Euclid
v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395. Although Agins' reliance on
those precedents is understandable when viewed in historical context,
the language the Court selected was imprecise. It suggests a meansends test, asking, in essence, whether a regulation of private property
is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose. Such an inquiry is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has
been "taken" for Fifth Amendment purposes. In stark contrast to the
three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the "substantially advances" inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of
the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights
or how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners.
Thus, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects
are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of
private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause
nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause. Moreover, the Agins formula's application as
a takings test would present serious practical difficulties. Reading it
to demand heightened means-ends review of virtually all regulation of
private property would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast
array of state and federal regulations--a task for which they are not
well suited. It would also empower--and might often require--courts
to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures
and expert agencies. Pp. 540-545.

(c) The Court's holding here does not require it to disturb any of its
prior holdings. Although it applied a "substantially advances" inquiry
in Agins itself, see 447 U. S., at 261-262, and arguably in Keystone
Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 485-492, it has
never found a compensable taking based on such an inquiry. Moreover,
in most of the cases reciting the Agins formula, the Court has merely

assumed its validity when referring to it in dicta. See, e. g., TahoeSierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,
535 U. S. 302, 334. Although Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n,
483 U. S. 825, 834, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 385, drew
upon Agins' language, the rule those cases established is entirely distinct from the "substantially advances" test: They involved a special
application of the "doctrine of unconstitutional conditions," which provides that the government may not require a person to give up the
constitutional right to receive just compensation when property is taken
for a public use in exchange for a discretionary benefit that has little or
no relationship to the property. 512 U. S., at 385. Pp. 545-548.

(d) A plaintiff seeking to challenge a government regulation as an
uncompensated taking of private property may proceed by alleging a
"physical" taking, a Lucas-type total regulatory taking, a Penn Central
taking, or a land-use exaction violating the Nollan and Dolan standards.
Because Chevron argued only a "substantially advances" theory, it was
not entitled to summary judgment on its takings claim. P. 548.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
On occasion, a would-be doctrinal rule or test finds its wayinto our case law through simple repetition of a phrase--

however fortuitously coined. A quarter century ago, in
Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255 (1980), the Courtdeclared that government regulation of private property "effects a taking if [such regulation] does not substantially ad-vance legitimate state interests . . . ." Id., at 260. Through

language has been ensconced in our Fifth Amendment tak-ings jurisprudence. See Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at

Monterey, Ltd., 526 U. S. 687, 704 (1999) (citing cases).In the case before us, the lower courts applied Agins'
"substantially advances" formula to strike down a Hawaiistatute that limits the rent that oil companies may charge to
dealers who lease service stations owned by the companies.The lower courts held that the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking of private property in violation of the Fifth andFourteenth Amendments because it does not substantially
advance Hawaii's asserted interest in controlling retail gaso-line prices. This case requires us to decide whether the
"substantially advances" formula announced in Agins is anappropriate test for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking. We conclude that it is not.

I
The State of Hawaii, whose territory comprises an archi-pelago of 132 islands clustered in the midst of the Pacific

Ocean, is located over 1,600 miles from the U. S. mainlandand ranks among the least populous of the 50 States. Because of Hawaii's small size and geographic isolation, itswholesale market for oil products is highly concentrated.
When this lawsuit began in 1997, only two refineries and sixgasoline wholesalers were doing business in the State. As
of that time, respondent Chevron U. S. A. Inc. was thelargest refiner and marketer of gasoline in Hawaii: It controlled 60 percent of the market for gasoline produced orrefined in-state and 30 percent of the wholesale market on
the State's most populous island, Oahu.Gasoline is sold at retail in Hawaii from about 300 different
service stations. About half of these stations are leasedfrom oil companies by independent lessee-dealers, another 75
or so are owned and operated by "open" dealers, and theremainder are owned and operated by the oil companies.
Chevron sells most of its product through 64 independent

Opinion of the Court
lessee-dealer stations. In a typical lessee-dealer arrange-ment, Chevron buys or leases land from a third party, builds

a service station, and then leases the station to a dealeron a turnkey basis. Chevron charges the lessee-dealer a
monthly rent, defined as a percentage of the dealer's marginon retail sales of gasoline and other goods. In addition,
Chevron requires the lessee-dealer to enter into a supply
contract, under which the dealer agrees to purchase fromChevron whatever is necessary to satisfy demand at the station for Chevron's product. Chevron unilaterally sets thewholesale price of its product.

The Hawaii Legislature enacted Act 257 in June 1997, apparently in response to concerns about the effects of market
concentration on retail gasoline prices. See 1997 Haw. Sess.
Laws no. 257, $ 1. The statute seeks to protect independent
dealers by imposing certain restrictions on the ownership
and leasing of service stations by oil companies. It prohibits oil companies from converting existing lessee-dealer stations to company-operated stations and from locating new
company-operated stations in close proximity to existing
dealer-operated stations. Haw. Rev. Stat. $$ 486H-10.4(a),
(b) (1998 Cum. Supp.). More importantly for present purposes, Act 257 limits the amount of rent that an oil company
may charge a lessee-dealer to 15 percent of the dealer's gross
profits from gasoline sales plus 15 percent of gross sales of
products other than gasoline. $ 486H-10.4(c).

Thirty days after Act 257's enactment, Chevron sued the
Governor and Attorney General of Hawaii in their official
capacities (collectively Hawaii) in the United States District
Court for the District of Hawaii, raising several federal constitutional challenges to the statute. As pertinent here,
Chevron claimed that the statute's rent cap provision, on its
face, effected a taking of Chevron's property in violation of
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Chevron sought a
declaration to this effect as well as an injunction against the
application of the rent cap to its stations. Chevron swiftly

534 LINGLE v. CHEVRON U. S. A. INC.

Opinion of the Court
moved for summary judgment on its takings claim, arguingthat the rent cap does not substantially advance any legitimate government interest. Hawaii filed a cross-motion forsummary judgment on all of Chevron's claims.

To facilitate resolution of the summary judgment motions,the parties jointly stipulated to certain relevant facts. They
agreed that Act 257 reduces by about $207,000 per year the
aggregate rent that Chevron would otherwise charge on 11of its 64 lessee-dealer stations. On the other hand, the statute allows Chevron to collect more rent than it would other-wise charge at its remaining 53 lessee-dealer stations, such
that Chevron could increase its overall rental income from
all 64 stations by nearly $1.1 million per year. The parties
further stipulated that, over the past 20 years, Chevron has
not fully recovered the costs of maintaining lessee-dealer
stations in any State through rent alone. Rather, the company recoups its expenses through a combination of rent and
product sales. Finally, the joint stipulation states that
Chevron has earned in the past, and anticipates that it will
continue to earn under Act 257, a return on its investment
in lessee-dealer stations in Hawaii that satisfies any constitutional standard.

The District Court granted summary judgment to Chevron, holding that "Act 257 fails to substantially advance a
legitimate state interest, and as such, effects an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Cayetano, 57 F.
Supp. 2d 1003, 1014 (1998). The District Court accepted
Hawaii's argument that the rent cap was intended to prevent
concentration of the retail gasoline market--and, more
importantly, resultant high prices for consumers--by maintaining the viability of independent lessee-dealers. Id., at
1009-1010. The court concluded that the statute would not
substantially advance this interest, however, because it
would not actually reduce lessee-dealers' costs or retail
prices. It found that the rent cap would allow incumbent

Opinion of the Court
lessee-dealers, upon transferring occupancy rights to a newlessee, to charge the incoming lessee a premium reflecting

the value of the rent reduction. Accordingly, the DistrictCourt reasoned, the incoming lessee's overall expenses
would be the same as in the absence of the rent cap, so therewould be no savings to pass along to consumers.

Id., at
1010-1012. Nor would incumbent lessees benefit from the
rent cap, the court found, because the oil company lessorswould unilaterally raise wholesale fuel prices in order to offset the reduction in their rental income. Id., at 1012-1014.On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit held that the District Court had applied the
correct legal standard to Chevron's takings claim. Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Cayetano, 224 F. 3d 1030, 1033-1037 (2000).
The Court of Appeals vacated the grant of summary judgment, however, on the ground that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the Act would benefit
consumers. Id., at 1037-1042. Judge William Fletcher
concurred in the judgment, maintaining that the "reasonableness" standard applicable to "ordinary rent and price
control laws" should instead govern Chevron's claim. Id.,
at 1048.

On remand, the District Court entered judgment for Chevron after a 1-day bench trial in which Chevron and Hawaii
called competing expert witnesses (both economists) to testify. 198 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (2002). Finding Chevron's expert
witness to be "more persuasive" than the State's expert, the
District Court once again concluded that oil companies would
raise wholesale gasoline prices to offset any rent reduction
required by Act 257, and that the result would be an increase
in retail gasoline prices. Id., at 1187-1189. Even if the rent
cap did reduce lessee-dealers' costs, the court found, they
would not pass on any savings to consumers. Id., at 1189.
The court went on to reiterate its determination that Act
257 would enable incumbent lessee-dealers to sell their leaseholds at a premium, such that incoming lessees would not

Opinion of the Court
obtain any of the benefits of the rent cap. Id., at 1189-1190.And while it acknowledged that the rent cap could preclude

oil companies from constructively evicting dealers throughexcessive rents, the court found no evidence that Chevron or
any other oil company would attempt to charge such rentsin the absence of the cap. Id., at 1191. Finally, the court
concluded that Act 257 would in fact decrease the number oflessee-dealer stations because the rent cap would discourage
oil companies from building such stations. Id., at 1191-1192.Based on these findings, the District Court held that "Act
257 effect[ed] an unconstitutional regulatory taking given itsfailure to substantially advance any legitimate state interest." Id., at 1193.The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in the
prior appeal barred Hawaii from challenging the applicationof the "substantially advances" test to Chevron's takings
claim or from arguing for a more deferential standard of re-view. 363 F. 3d 846, 849-855 (2004). The panel majority
went on to reject Hawaii's challenge to the application of thestandard to the facts of the case. Id., at 855-858. Judge
Fletcher dissented, renewing his contention that Act 257should not be reviewed under the "substantially advances"
standard. Id., at 859-861. We granted certiorari, 543 U. S.924 (2004), and now reverse.

A

The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made appli-cable to the States through the Fourteenth, see

Chicago,B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897), provides that

private property shall not "be taken for public use, withoutjust compensation." As its text makes plain, the Takings
Clause "does not prohibit the taking of private property, butinstead places a condition on the exercise of that power."
First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 314 (1987). In other

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
words, it "is designed not to limit the governmental interfer-ence with property rights

per se, but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interferenceamounting to a taking."

Id., at 315 (emphasis in original).
While scholars have offered various justifications for this re-gime, we have emphasized its role in "bar[ring] Government

from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,
in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as awhole."

Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960);
see also Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S.312, 325 (1893).

The paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a
direct government appropriation or physical invasion of private property. See, e. g., United States v. Pewee Coal Co.,
341 U. S. 114 (1951) (Government's seizure and operation of
a coal mine to prevent a national strike of coal miners effected a taking); United States v. General Motors Corp., 323
U. S. 373 (1945) (Government's occupation of private warehouse effected a taking). Indeed, until the Court's watershed decision in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S.
393 (1922), "it was generally thought that the Takings Clause
reached only a `direct appropriation' of property, or the functional equivalent of a `practical ouster of [the owner's] possession.' " Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505
U. S. 1003, 1014 (1992) (citations omitted and emphasis added;
brackets in original); see also id., at 1028, n. 15 ("[E]arly
constitutional theorists did not believe the Takings Clause
embraced regulations of property at all").

Beginning with Mahon, however, the Court recognized
that government regulation of private property may, in some
instances, be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a
direct appropriation or ouster--and that such "regulatory
takings" may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment.
In Justice Holmes' storied but cryptic formulation, "while
property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation
goes too far it will be recognized as a taking." 260 U. S.,

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
538 LINGLE v. CHEVRON U. S. A. INC.

Opinion of the Court
at 415. The rub, of course, has been--and remains--how todiscern how far is "too far." In answering that question,

we must remain cognizant that "government regulation--bydefinition--involves the adjustment of rights for the public
good," Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 65 (1979), and that"Government hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying
for every such change in the general law," Mahon, supra,at 413.

Our precedents stake out two categories of regulatory ac-tion that generally will be deemed

per se takings for Fifth
Amendment purposes. First, where government requires
an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her
property--however minor--it must provide just compensation. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,
458 U. S. 419 (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit
cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking). A second categorical rule applies to
regulations that completely deprive an owner of "all economically beneficial us[e]" of her property. Lucas, 505 U. S.,
at 1019 (emphasis in original). We held in Lucas that the
government must pay just compensation for such "total regulatory takings," except to the extent that "background
principles of nuisance and property law" independently restrict the owner's intended use of the property. Id., at
1026-1032.

Outside these two relatively narrow categories (and the
special context of land-use exactions discussed below, see
infra, at 546-548), regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards set forth in Penn Central Transp.
Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978). The Court in
Penn Central acknowledged that it had hitherto been "unable to develop any `set formula' " for evaluating regulatory
takings claims, but identified "several factors that have particular significance." Id., at 124. Primary among those factors are "[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

539Cite as: 544 U. S. 528 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulationhas interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations." Ibid. In addition, the "character of the governmen-tal action"--for instance whether it amounts to a physical
invasion or instead merely affects property interests through"some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of
economic life to promote the common good"--may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred. Ibid.The

Penn Central factors--though each has given rise to
vexing subsidiary questions--have served as the principalguidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do

not fall within the physical takings or Lucas rules. See,
e. g., Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 617-618 (2001);
id., at 632-634 (O'Connor, J., concurring).

Although our regulatory takings jurisprudence cannot be
characterized as unified, these three inquiries (reflected in
Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central) share a common touchstone. Each aims to identify regulatory actions that are
functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the
owner from his domain. Accordingly, each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights. The Court has
held that physical takings require compensation because of
the unique burden they impose: A permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails, eviscerates the owner's right to exclude others from entering and
using her property--perhaps the most fundamental of all
property interests. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S.
374, 384 (1994); Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483
U. S. 825, 831-832 (1987); Loretto, supra, at 433; Kaiser
Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979). In the
Lucas context, of course, the complete elimination of a property's value is the determinative factor. See Lucas, supra,
at 1017 (positing that "total deprivation of beneficial use is,
from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent of a physi544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cal appropriation"). And the Penn Central inquiry turns inlarge part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a

regulation's economic impact and the degree to which it in-terferes with legitimate property interests.

B
In Agins v. City of Tiburon, a case involving a facial tak-ings challenge to certain municipal zoning ordinances, the

Court declared that "[t]he application of a general zoning lawto particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does
not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see
Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, 188 (1928), or denies anowner economically viable use of his land, see Penn Central

Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 138, n. 36(1978). " 447 U. S., at 260. Because this statement is
phrased in the disjunctive, Agins' "substantially advances"language has been read to announce a stand-alone regulatory
takings test that is wholly independent of Penn Central orany other test. Indeed, the lower courts in this case struck
down Hawaii's rent control statute based solely upon theirfindings that it does not substantially advance a legitimate
state interest. See supra, at 534, 536. Although a numberof our takings precedents have recited the "substantially advances" formula minted in Agins, this is our first opportunityto consider its validity as a freestanding takings test. We
conclude that this formula prescribes an inquiry in the na-ture of a due process, not a takings, test, and that it has no
proper place in our takings jurisprudence.There is no question that the "substantially advances" formula was derived from due process, not takings, precedents.In support of this new language,

Agins cited Nectow v. Cam-bridge, 277 U. S. 183, a 1928 case in which the plaintiff

claimed that a city zoning ordinance "deprived him of hisproperty without due process of law in contravention of the
Fourteenth Amendment," id., at 185. Agins then went onto discuss

Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S.

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

541Cite as: 544 U. S. 528 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
365 (1926), a historic decision holding that a municipal zoningordinance would survive a substantive due process challenge

so long as it was not "clearly arbitrary and unreasonable,having no

substantial relation to the public health, safety,
morals, or general welfare." Id., at 395 (emphasis added);see also

Nectow, supra, at 187-188 (quoting the same "substantial relation" language from Euclid).

When viewed in historical context, the Court's relianceon

Nectow and Euclid is understandable. Agins was the
Court's first case involving a challenge to zoning regulationsin many decades, so it was natural to turn to these seminal

zoning precedents for guidance. See Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae in Agins v. City of Tiburon, O. T. 1979,
No. 79-602, pp. 12-13 (arguing that Euclid "set out the principles applicable to a determination of the facial validity of a
zoning ordinance attacked as a violation of the Takings
Clause of the Fifth Amendment"). Moreover, Agins' apparent commingling of due process and takings inquiries had
some precedent in the Court's then-recent decision in Penn
Central. See 438 U. S., at 127 (stating in dicta that "[i]t
is . . . implicit in Goldblatt [v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590
(1962),] that a use restriction on real property may constitute
a `taking' if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of
a substantial public purpose, see Nectow v. Cambridge,
supra"). But see Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590,
594-595 (1962) (quoting " `reasonably necessary' " language
from Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 137 (1894), a due process
case, and applying a deferential " `reasonableness' " standard
to determine whether a challenged regulation was a "valid
exercise of the . . . police power" under the Due Process
Clause). Finally, when Agins was decided, there had been
some history of referring to deprivations of property without
due process of law as "takings," see, e. g., Rowan v. Post
Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 740 (1970), and the Court had yet
to clarify whether "regulatory takings" claims were properly
cognizable under the Takings Clause or the Due Process

Opinion of the Court
Clause, see Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'nv.

Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 197-199
(1985).Although

Agins' reliance on due process precedents is understandable, the language the Court selected was regretta-bly imprecise. The "substantially advances" formula suggests a means-ends test: It asks, in essence, whether a
regulation of private property is effective in achieving somelegitimate public purpose. An inquiry of this nature has

some logic in the context of a due process challenge, for aregulation that fails to serve any legitimate governmental
objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul
of the Due Process Clause. See, e. g., County of Sacramento
v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 846 (1998) (stating that the Due Process Clause is intended, in part, to protect the individual
against "the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective"). But such a test is not a valid method of discerning
whether private property has been "taken" for purposes of
the Fifth Amendment.

In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the "substantially advances" inquiry reveals
nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a
particular regulation imposes upon private property rights.
Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners. In consequence, this test does not help to identify those regulations
whose effects are functionally comparable to government
appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered
neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic
justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged
under the Clause.

Chevron appeals to the general principle that the Takings
Clause is meant " `to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and
justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.' " Brief

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

543Cite as: 544 U. S. 528 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
for Respondent 17-21 (quoting Armstrong, 364 U. S., at 49).But that appeal is clearly misplaced, for the reasons just indicated. A test that tells us nothing about the actual burdenimposed on property rights, or how that burden is allocated,
cannot tell us when justice might require that the burden bespread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation. The owner of a property subject to a regulation that
effectively serves a legitimate state interest may be just assingled out and just as burdened as the owner of a property

subject to an ineffective regulation. It would make littlesense to say that the second owner has suffered a taking
while the first has not. Likewise, an ineffective regulation
may not significantly burden property rights at all, and it
may distribute any burden broadly and evenly among property owners. The notion that such a regulation nevertheless "takes" private property for public use merely by virtue
of its ineffectiveness or foolishness is untenable.

Instead of addressing a challenged regulation's effect on
private property, the "substantially advances" inquiry

probes the regulation's underlying validity. But such an inquiry is logically prior to and distinct from the question
whether a regulation effects a taking, for the Takings Clause
presupposes that the government has acted in pursuit of a
valid public purpose. The Clause expressly requires compensation where government takes private property "for
public use." It does not bar government from interfering
with property rights, but rather requires compensation "in
the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a
taking." First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, 482
U. S., at 315 (emphasis added). Conversely, if a government
action is found to be impermissible--for instance because it
fails to meet the "public use" requirement or is so arbitrary
as to violate due process--that is the end of the inquiry. No
amount of compensation can authorize such action.

Chevron's challenge to the Hawaii statute in this case illustrates the flaws in the "substantially advances" theory. To

544 LINGLE v. CHEVRON U. S. A. INC.

Opinion of the Court
begin with, it is unclear how significantly Hawaii's rent capactually burdens Chevron's property rights. The parties

stipulated below that the cap would reduce Chevron's aggre-gate rental income on 11 of its 64 lessee-dealer stations by
about $207,000 per year, but that Chevron nevertheless ex-pects to receive a return on its investment in these stations
that satisfies any constitutional standard. See supra, at 534.
Moreover, Chevron asserted below, and the District Courtfound, that Chevron would recoup any reductions in its

rental income by raising wholesale gasoline prices. See
supra, at 535. In short, Chevron has not clearly argued--
let alone established--that it has been singled out to bear
any particularly severe regulatory burden. Rather, the gravamen of Chevron's claim is simply that Hawaii's rent cap
will not actually serve the State's legitimate interest in protecting consumers against high gasoline prices. Whatever
the merits of that claim, it does not sound under the Takings
Clause. Chevron plainly does not seek compensation for a
taking of its property for a legitimate public use, but rather
an injunction against the enforcement of a regulation that it
alleges to be fundamentally arbitrary and irrational.

Finally, the "substantially advances" formula is not only
doctrinally untenable as a takings test--its application as
such would also present serious practical difficulties. The
Agins formula can be read to demand heightened meansends review of virtually any regulation of private property.
If so interpreted, it would require courts to scrutinize the
efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulations--a
task for which courts are not well suited. Moreover, it
would empower--and might often require--courts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies.

Although the instant case is only the tip of the proverbial
iceberg, it foreshadows the hazards of placing courts in this
role. To resolve Chevron's takings claim, the District Court
was required to choose between the views of two opposing

Opinion of the Court
economists as to whether Hawaii's rent control statute wouldhelp to prevent concentration and supracompetitive prices in

the State's retail gasoline market. Finding one expert to be"more persuasive" than the other, the court concluded that
the Hawaii Legislature's chosen regulatory strategy wouldnot actually achieve its objectives. See 198 F. Supp. 2d, at
1187-1193. The court determined that there was no evi-dence that oil companies had charged, or would charge, excessive rents. See id., at 1191. Based on this and otherfindings, the District Court enjoined further enforcement of
Act 257's rent cap provision against Chevron. We find theproceedings below remarkable, to say the least, given that
we have long eschewed such heightened scrutiny when ad-dressing substantive due process challenges to government
regulation. See, e. g., Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 124-125 (1978); Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372U. S. 726, 730-732 (1963). The reasons for deference to legislative judgments about the need for, and likely effective-ness of, regulatory actions are by now well established, and
we think they are no less applicable here.For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the "substantially advances" formula announced in Agins is not a validmethod of identifying regulatory takings for which the Fifth
Amendment requires just compensation. Since Chevron ar-gued only a "substantially advances" theory in support of its
takings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment onthat claim.

III
We emphasize that our holding today--that the "substan-tially advances" formula is not a valid takings test--does not

require us to disturb any of our prior holdings. To be sure,we applied a "substantially advances" inquiry in Agins itself,
see 447 U. S., at 261-262 (finding that the challenged zoningordinances "substantially advance[d] legitimate governmental goals"), and arguably also in Keystone Bituminous Coal
Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 485-492 (1987) (quoting

Opinion of the Court
" `substantially advance[s]' " language and then finding thatthe challenged statute was intended to further a substantial

public interest). But in no case have we found a compensa-ble taking based on such an inquiry. Indeed, in most of the
cases reciting the "substantially advances" formula, theCourt has merely assumed its validity when referring to it
in dicta. See Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v.
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U. S. 302, 334 (2002);
Del Monte Dunes, 526 U. S., at 704; Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1016;
Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992); United States v.
Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 126 (1985).

It might be argued that this formula played a role in our
decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S.
825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374 (1994).
See Brief for Respondent 21-23. But while the Court drew
upon the language of Agins in these cases, it did not apply
the "substantially advances" test that is the subject of today's decision. Both Nollan and Dolan involved Fifth
Amendment takings challenges to adjudicative land-use exactions--specifically, government demands that a landowner
dedicate an easement allowing public access to her property
as a condition of obtaining a development permit. See
Dolan, supra, at 379-380 (permit to expand a store and parking lot conditioned on the dedication of a portion of the relevant property for a "greenway," including a bike/pedestrian
path); Nollan, supra, at 828 (permit to build a larger residence on beachfront property conditioned on dedication of an
easement allowing the public to traverse a strip of the property between the owner's seawall and the mean high-tide
line).

In each case, the Court began with the premise that, had
the government simply appropriated the easement in question, this would have been a per se physical taking. Dolan,
supra, at 384; Nollan, supra, at 831-832. The question was
whether the government could, without paying the compensation that would otherwise be required upon effecting such

544US2 Unit: $U46 [03-16-06 13:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

547Cite as: 544 U. S. 528 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
a taking, demand the easement as a condition for granting adevelopment permit the government was entitled to deny.

The Court in Nollan answered in the affirmative, providedthat the exaction would substantially advance the same government interest that would furnish a valid ground for denialof the permit. 483 U. S., at 834-837. The Court further refined this requirement in Dolan, holding that an adjudicative
exaction requiring dedication of private property must alsobe " `rough[ly] proportiona[l]' . . . both in nature and extent

to the impact of the proposed development." 512 U. S., at391; see also

Del Monte Dunes, supra, at 702 (emphasizing
that we have not extended this standard "beyond the special
context of [such] exactions").

Although Nollan and Dolan quoted Agins' language, see
Dolan, supra, at 385; Nollan, supra, at 834, the rule those
decisions established is entirely distinct from the "substantially advances" test we address today. Whereas the "substantially advances" inquiry before us now is unconcerned
with the degree or type of burden a regulation places upon
property, Nollan and Dolan both involved dedications of
property so onerous that, outside the exactions context, they
would be deemed per se physical takings. In neither case
did the Court question whether the exaction would substantially advance some legitimate state interest. See Dolan,
supra, at 387-388; Nollan, supra, at 841. Rather, the issue
was whether the exactions substantially advanced the same
interests that land-use authorities asserted would allow
them to deny the permit altogether. As the Court explained in Dolan, these cases involve a special application of
the "doctrine of `unconstitutional conditions,' " which provides that "the government may not require a person to give
up a constitutional right--here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use--in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the benefit has little or no relationship to the
property." 512 U. S., at 385. That is worlds apart from a

rule that says a regulation affecting property constitutes ataking on its face solely because it does not substantially

advance a legitimate government interest. In short, Nollanand Dolan cannot be characterized as applying the "substantially advances" test we address today, and our decisionshould not be read to disturb these precedents.

* * *
Twenty-five years ago, the Court posited that a regulationof private property "effects a taking if [it] does not substantially advance [a] legitimate state interes[t]." Agins, 447U. S., at 260. The lower courts in this case took that statement to its logical conclusion, and in so doing, revealed itsimprecision. Today we correct course. We hold that the
"substantially advances" formula is not a valid takings test,and indeed conclude that it has no proper place in our takings
jurisprudence. In so doing, we reaffirm that a plaintiff seek-ing to challenge a government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may proceed under one ofthe other theories discussed above--by alleging a "physical"
taking, a Lucas-type "total regulatory taking," a Penn Central taking, or a land-use exaction violating the standardsset forth in Nollan and Dolan. Because Chevron argued

only a "substantially advances" theory in support of its tak-ings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment on that
claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the NinthCircuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JOHANNS, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, et al. v.LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 03-1164. Argued December 8, 2004--Decided May 23, 2005*
The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Act) establishes a

federal policy of promoting and marketing beef and beef products. The
Secretary of Agriculture has implemented the Beef Act through a Beef
Promotion and Research Order (Order), which creates a Cattlemen's
Beef Promotion and Research Board (Beef Board) and an Operating
Committee, and imposes an assessment, or "checkoff," on all sales and
importation of cattle. The assessment funds, among other things, beef
promotional campaigns approved by the Operating Committee and the
Secretary. Respondents, associations whose members pay the checkoff
and individuals whose cattle are subject to the checkoff, challenged the
program on First Amendment grounds, relying on United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, in which this Court invalidated a mandatory checkoff that funded mushroom advertising. The District Court
found that the Beef Act and Order unconstitutionally compel respondents to subsidize speech to which they object. Affirming, the Eighth
Circuit held that compelled funding of speech may violate the First
Amendment even when it is the government's speech.

Held: Because the beef checkoff funds the Government's own speech, it is

not susceptible to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge.
Pp. 557-567.

(a) This Court has sustained First Amendment challenges in
"compelled-subsidy" cases, in which the government requires an individual to subsidize a private message he disagrees with. See Keller v.
State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1; Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209.
Keller and Abood led the Court to sustain a compelled-subsidy challenge
to an assessment whose only purpose was to fund mushroom advertising. United Foods, supra, at 413, 415-416. However, the speech in
United Foods, Keller, and Abood was found, or presumed, to be private.
The compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle
that compelled support of private speech differs from compelled support
of government speech. The Court has generally assumed, though not

squarely held, that such funding of government speech does not alone
raise First Amendment concerns. Pp. 557-559.

(b) Respondents argue that the speech here is not government speech
because it is controlled by nongovernmental entities, i. e., the Beef
Board and Operating Committee. In fact, the message is effectively
controlled by the Federal Government. Congress and the Secretary
have set out the overarching message and some of the campaign's elements, and have left the development of the remaining details to the
Operating Committee, half of whose members are appointed by the Secretary and all of whom are subject to removal by the Secretary. The
Secretary also has final approval authority over every word in every
promotional campaign, and his subordinates attend and participate in
meetings at which proposals are developed. By contrast, in Keller the
compelled-subsidy-funded communicative activities that were not prescribed by law or developed under official government supervision.
Nor does the Order's funding mechanism affect the compelled-subsidy
analysis. That citizens have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech is no less true when, as here, the funding is achieved
through targeted assessments devoted to a program to which some assessed citizens object, rather than through general taxes. The Court
need not address respondents' argument that the advertisements, most
of which are credited to "America's Beef Producers," give the impression that respondents endorse their message. Neither the Beef Act nor
the Order requires attribution of the ads to "America's Beef Producers"
or to anyone else, so neither can be facially invalid on this theory, and
the record contains no evidence from which to conclude that the ads'
message would be associated with respondents. Pp. 560-567.

(c) Respondents may proceed with their other challenges to the Beef
Act and Order, which the District Court did not reach. P. 567.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
For the third time in eight years, we consider whether afederal program that finances generic advertising to promote

an agricultural product violates the First Amendment. Inthese cases, unlike the previous two, the dispositive question
is whether the generic advertising at issue is the Govern-ment's own speech and therefore is exempt from First
Amendment scrutiny. I

A
The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Actor Act), 99 Stat. 1597, announces a federal policy of promoting the marketing and consumption of "beef and beef prod-ucts," using funds raised by an assessment on cattle sales
and importation. 7 U. S. C. $ 2901(b). The statute directsthe Secretary of Agriculture to implement this policy by
issuing a Beef Promotion and Research Order (Beef Orderor Order), $ 2903, and specifies four key terms it must contain: The Secretary is to appoint a Cattlemen's Beef Promo-tion and Research Board (Beef Board or Board), whose members are to be a geographically representative group of beefproducers and importers, nominated by trade associations.

sentatives named by a federation of state beef councils.$ 2904(4)(A). The Secretary is to impose a $1-per-head

assessment (or "checkoff ") on all sales or importation of cat-tle and a comparable assessment on imported beef products.

$ 2904(8). And the assessment is to be used to fund beef-related projects, including promotional campaigns, designed
by the Operating Committee and approved by the Secre-tary. $$ 2904(4)(B), (C).

The Secretary promulgated the Beef Order with the speci-fied terms. The assessment is collected primarily by state
beef councils, which then forward the proceeds to the BeefBoard. 7 CFR $ 1260.172(a)(5) (2004).

1 The Operating

Committee proposes projects to be funded by the checkoffincluding promotion and research. $ 1260.167(a). The

Secretary or his desig nee (see $$ 2.22(a)(1)(vii i)(X),2.79(a)(8)(xxxii)) approves each project and, in the case of
promotional materials, the content of each communication.$$ 1260.168(e), 1260.169; App. 114, 143.

The Beef Order was promulgated in 1986 on a temporarybasis, subject to a referendum among beef producers on
whether to make it permanent. 7 U. S. C. $$ 2903, 2906(a).In May 1988, a large majority voted to continue it. Since
that time, more than $1 billion has been collected throughthe checkoff, 132 F. Supp. 2d 817, 820 (SD 2001), and a large
fraction of that sum has been spent on promotional projectsauthorized by the Beef Act--many using the familiar trademarked slogan "Beef. It's What's for Dinner." App. 50.In fiscal year 2000, for example, the Beef Board collected
over $48 million in assessments and spent over $29 millionon domestic promotion. The Board also funds overseas marketing efforts; market and food-science research, such asevaluations of the nutritional value of beef; and informa1 In most cases, only 50 cents per head is remitted to the Beef Board,
because the Beef Act and Beef Order allow domestic producers to deduct
from their $1 assessment up to 50 cents in voluntary contributions to their
state beef councils. 7 U. S. C. $ 2904(8)(C); 7 CFR $ 1260.172(a)(3) (2004).

tional campaigns for both consumers and beef producers.See 7 U. S. C. $$ 2902(6), (9), (15), 2904(4)(B).

Many promotional messages funded by the checkoff(though not all, see App. 52-53) bear the attribution "Funded

usually a checkmark with the word "BEEF." E. g., id., at50-52.

Respondents are two associations whose members collectand pay the checkoff, and several individuals who raise and

sell cattle subject to the checkoff. Id., at 17-19. They suedthe Secretary, the Department of Agriculture, and the Board
in Federal District Court on a number of constitutional andstatutory grounds not before us--in particular, that the
Board impermissibly used checkoff funds to send communica-tions supportive of the beef program to beef producers. 132
F. Supp. 2d, at 823. Petitioners in No. 03-1165, a state beefproducers' association and two individual producers, intervened as defendants to argue in support of the program.The District Court granted a limited preliminary injunction,
which forbade the continued use of checkoff funds to laud thebeef program or to lobby for governmental action relating to
the checkoff. Id., at 832.While the litigation was pending, we held in

United Statesv. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405 (2001), that a mandatory

checkoff for generic mushroom advertising violated the FirstAmendment. Noting that the mushroom program closely
resembles the beef program,2 respondents amended their

complaint to assert a First Amendment challenge to the use
of the beef checkoff for promotional activity. 207 F. Supp.
2d 992, 996 (SD 2002); App. 30-32. Respondents noted that
the advertising promotes beef as a generic commodity,
which, they contended, impedes their efforts to promote the
superiority of, inter alia, American beef, grain-fed beef, or
certified Angus or Hereford beef.

After a bench trial, the District Court ruled for respondents on their First Amendment claim. It declared that the
Beef Act and Beef Order unconstitutionally compel respondents to subsidize speech to which they object, and rejected
the Government's contention that the checkoff survives First
Amendment scrutiny because it funds only government
speech. 207 F. Supp. 2d, at 1002-1007. The court entered
a permanent injunction barring any further collection of the
beef checkoff, even from producers willing to pay (allowing continued collection of voluntary checkoffs, the court
thought, would require "rewrit[ing]" the Beef Act). Id., at
1007-1008. Believing that the cost of calculating the share
of the checkoff attributable to the compelled subsidy would
be too great, the court also declined to order a refund of
checkoff funds already collected. Ibid. Finally, the court
made permanent its earlier injunction against "producer
communications" praising the beef program or seeking to influence governmental policy. Id., at 1008. The court did
not rule on respondents' other claims, but certified its resolution of the First Amendment claim as final pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). 207 F. Supp. 2d, at 1008.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.
335 F. 3d 711 (2003). Unlike the District Court, the Court
of Appeals did not dispute that the challenged advertising is
government speech; instead, it held that government speech
status is relevant only to First Amendment challenges to the
speech's content, not to challenges to its compelled funding.
See id., at 720-721. Compelled funding of speech, it held,

may violate the First Amendment even if the speech in ques-tion is the government's. Ibid.

We granted certiorari. 541 U. S. 1062 (2004).

II
We have sustained First Amendment challenges to alleg-edly compelled expression in two categories of cases: true

"compelled-speech" cases, in which an individual is obligedpersonally to express a message he disagrees with, imposed
by the government; and "compelled-subsidy" cases, in whichan individual is required by the government to subsidize a
message he disagrees with, expressed by a private entity.We have not heretofore considered the First Amendment
consequences of government-compelled subsidy of the gov-ernment's own speech.

We first invalidated an outright compulsion of speech inWest Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943).
The State required every schoolchild to recite the Pledgeof Allegiance while saluting the American flag, on pain of
expulsion from the public schools. We held that the FirstAmendment does not "le[ave] it open to public authorities to
compel [a person] to utter" a message with which he doesnot agree. Id., at 634. Likewise, in Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U. S. 705 (1977), we held that requiring a New Hamp-shire couple to bear the State's motto, "Live Free or Die,"
on their cars' license plates was an impermissible compul-sion of expression. Obliging people to "use their private
property as a `mobile billboard' for the State's ideologicalmessage" amounted to impermissible compelled expression.
Id., at 715.The reasoning of these compelled-speech cases has been
carried over to certain instances in which individuals arecompelled not to speak, but to subsidize a private message
with which they disagree. Thus, although we have upheldstate-imposed requirements that lawyers be members of the
state bar and pay its annual dues, and that public school

teachers either join the labor union representing their "shop"or pay "service fees" equal to the union dues, we have invalidated the use of the compulsory fees to fund speech on politi-cal matters. See

Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1
(1990); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977). Bar
or union speech with such content, we held, was not germane
to the regulatory interests that justified compelled membership, and accordingly, making those who disagreed with it
pay for it violated the First Amendment. See Keller, supra,
at 15-16; Abood, supra, at 234-235.

These latter cases led us to sustain a compelled-subsidy
challenge to an assessment very similar to the beef checkoff, imposed to fund mushroom advertising. United Foods,
supra; see 335 F. 3d, at 717 ("[W]e agree with the district
court that `[t]he beef checkoff is, in all material respects,
identical to the mushroom checkoff ' " at issue in United
Foods). Deciding the case on the assumption that the advertising was private speech, not government speech, see
533 U. S., at 416-417,3 we concluded that Abood and Keller
were controlling. As in those cases, mushroom producers
were obliged by "law or necessity" to pay the checkoff; although Abood and Keller would permit the mandatory fee if
it were "germane" to a "broader regulatory scheme," in

3 In United Foods, the Court distinguished (and the dissent relied on)
Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457 (1997), which
upheld the use of mandatory assessments to fund generic advertising promoting California tree fruit. In Glickman, as in United Foods, the Government did not argue that the advertising was permissible government
speech. See 521 U. S., at 482, n. 2 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting that the
Government had waived any such argument). Rather, the Government
contended, and we agreed, that compelled support for generic advertising
was legitimately part of the Government's "collectivist" centralization of
the market for tree fruit. Id., at 475 (opinion of the Court). Here, as
in United Foods, "there is no broader regulatory system in place" that
collectivizes aspects of the beef market unrelated to speech, so Glickman
is not controlling. 533 U. S., at 415.

Opinion of the Court
United Foods the only regulatory purpose was the funding
of the advertising. 533 U. S., at 413, 415-416.

In all of the cases invalidating exactions to subsidize
speech, the speech was, or was presumed to be, that of an
entity other than the government itself. See Keller, supra,
at 11, 15-16; Abood, supra, at 212-213; United Foods, supra,
at 416-417; see also Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 229, 230 (2000) (because
"[t]he University ha[s] disclaimed that the speech is its own,"
Abood and Keller "provide the beginning point for our analysis"); cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,
515 U. S. 819, 851-852 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (university's Student Activities Fund likely does not unconstitutionally compel speech because it "represents not government resources . . . but a fund that simply belongs to the
students"). Our compelled-subsidy cases have consistently
respected the principle that "[c]ompelled support of a private
association is fundamentally different from compelled support of government." Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13 (Powell,
J., concurring in judgment). "Compelled support of government"--even those programs of government one does not
approve--is of course perfectly constitutional, as every taxpayer must attest. And some government programs involve, or entirely consist of, advocating a position. "The
government, as a general rule, may support valid programs
and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent for
speech and other expression to advocate and defend its own
policies." Southworth, 529 U. S., at 229. We have generally assumed, though not yet squarely held, that compelled
funding of government speech does not alone raise First
Amendment concerns. See ibid.; Keller, supra, at 12-13;
Rosenberger, supra, at 833; see also Wooley, supra, at 721
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).

560 JOHANNS v. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN.

Opinion of the Court

III
Respondents do not seriously dispute these principles, nordo they contend that, as a general matter, their First

Amendment challenge requires them to show only that theircheckoff dollars pay for speech with which they disagree.
Rather, they assert that the challenged promotional cam-paigns differ dispositively from the type of government
speech that, our cases suggest, is not susceptible to FirstAmendment challenge. They point to the role of the Beef
Board and its Operating Committee in designing the promo-tional campaigns, and to the use of a mandatory assessment
on beef producers to fund the advertising. We consider eachin turn.

A
The Secretary of Agriculture does not write ad copy him-self. Rather, the Beef Board's promotional campaigns are

designed by the Beef Board's Operating Committee, only halfof whose members are Beef Board members appointed by
the Secretary. (All members of the Operating Committeeare subject to

removal by the Secretary. 7 CFR $ 1260.213(2004).) Respondents contend that speech whose content

is effectively controlled by a nongovernmental entity--theOperating Committee--cannot be considered "government
speech." We need not address this contention, because wereject its premise: The message of the promotional campaigns is effectively controlled by the Federal Governmentitself.

4

The message set out in the beef promotions is from begin-ning to end the message established by the Federal Gov4 We therefore need not label the Operating Committee as "governmental" or "nongovernmental." The entity to which assessments are
remitted is the Beef Board, all of whose members are appointed by the
Secretary pursuant to law. The Operating Committee's only relevant
involvement is ancillary--it designs the promotional campaigns, which the
Secretary supervises and approves--and its status as a state actor thus is
not directly at issue.

Opinion of the Court
ernment.5 Congress has directed the implementation of a"coordinated program" of promotion, "including paid advertising, to advance the image and desirability of beef and beefproducts." 7 U. S. C. $$ 2901(b), 2902(13). Congress and
the Secretary have also specified, in general terms, what thepromotional campaigns shall contain, see, e. g., $ 2904(4)(B)(i)
(campaigns "shall . . . take into account" different types ofbeef products), and what they shall not, see,

e. g., 7 CFR$ 1260.169(d) (2004) (campaigns shall not, without prior approval, refer "to a brand or trade name of any beef product").Thus, Congress and the Secretary have set out the overarching message and some of its elements, and they have leftthe development of the remaining details to an entity whose
members are answerable to the Secretary (and in some casesappointed by him as well).

Moreover, the record demonstrates that the Secretary ex-ercises final approval authority over every word used in
every promotional campaign. All proposed promotionalmessages are reviewed by Department officials both for substance and for wording, and some proposals are rejected orrewritten by the Department. App. 114, 118-121, 274-275.
Nor is the Secretary's role limited to final approval or rejec-tion: Officials of the Department also attend and participate
in the open meetings at which proposals are developed. Id.,at 111-112.

This degree of governmental control over the messagefunded by the checkoff distinguishes these cases from

Keller.

5 The principal dissent suggests that if this is so, then the Government
has adopted at best a mixed message, because it also promulgates dietary
guidelines that, if followed, would discourage excessive consumption of
beef. Post, at 577, n. 5 (opinion of Souter, J.); see also post, at 569-570
(Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment). Even if we agreed that the protection of the government-speech doctrine must be forfeited whenever
there is inconsistency in the message, we would nonetheless accord the
protection here. The beef promotions are perfectly compatible with the
guidelines' message of moderate consumption--the ads do not insist that
beef is also What's for Breakfast, Lunch, and Midnight Snack.

562 JOHANNS v. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN.

Opinion of the Court
There the state bar's communicative activities to which the
plaintiffs objected were not prescribed by law in their general outline and not developed under official government
supervision. Indeed, many of them consisted of lobbying
the state legislature on various issues. See 496 U. S., at 5,
and n. 2. When, as here, the government sets the overall
message to be communicated and approves every word that
is disseminated, it is not precluded from relying on the
government-speech doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in developing specific
messages.

B

Respondents also contend that the beef program does not
qualify as "government speech" because it is funded by a
targeted assessment on beef producers, rather than by general revenues. This funding mechanism, they argue, has
two relevant effects: It gives control over the beef program
not to politically accountable legislators, but to a narrow interest group that will pay no heed to respondents' dissenting
views, and it creates the perception that the advertisements
speak for beef producers such as respondents.

We reject the first point. The compelled-subsidy analysis
is altogether unaffected by whether the funds for the promotions are raised by general taxes or through a targeted assessment. Citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund
government speech. And that is no less true when the funding is achieved through targeted assessments devoted exclusively to the program to which the assessed citizens object.
Cf. United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 260 (1982) ("There is
no principled way . . . to distinguish between general taxes
and those imposed under the Social Security Act" in evaluating the burden on the right to free exercise of religion). The
First Amendment does not confer a right to pay one's taxes

Opinion of the Court
into the general fund, because the injury of compelled fund-ing (as opposed to the injury of compelled speech) does not

stem from the Government's mode of accounting. Cf. Bowenv.

Roy, 476 U. S. 693, 700 (1986) ("The Free Exercise Clause
. . . does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government's internal procedures"); id., at 716-
717 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in
result).

Some of our cases have justified compelled funding of government speech by pointing out that government speech is
subject to democratic accountability. See, e. g., Abood, 431
U. S., at 259, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment);
Southworth, 529 U. S., at 235. But our references to "traditional political controls," id., at 229, do not signify that the
First Amendment duplicates the Appropriations Clause,
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 7, or that every instance of government speech must be funded by a line item in an appropriations bill. Here, the beef advertisements are subject to
political safeguards more than adequate to set them apart
from private messages. The program is authorized and the
basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements for the promotions' content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated after notice and comment.
The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key
personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements' content, right down to the wording.6 And Congress, of course, retains oversight authority, not to mention

6 Congress also required a referendum among producers before permanently implementing the checkoff, and allowed the Secretary to call another referendum upon demand of a "representative group" comprising 10
percent of cattle producers. 7 U. S. C. $$ 2906(a)-(b). Even before they
amended their complaint to challenge the checkoff as compelled speech,
respondents were seeking in this litigation to force such a referendum.
See 207 F. Supp. 2d 992, 995 (SD 2002).

Opinion of the Court
the ability to reform the program at any time. No more
is required.7

As to the second point, respondents' argument proceeds
as follows: They contend that crediting the advertising to
"America's Beef Producers" impermissibly uses not only
their money but also their seeming endorsement to promote
a message with which they do not agree. Communications
cannot be "government speech," they argue, if they are attributed to someone other than the government; and the person to whom they are attributed, when he is, by compulsory
funding, made the unwilling instrument of communication,
may raise a First Amendment objection.

We need not determine the validity of this argument--
which relates to compelled speech rather than compelled

7 The principal dissent finds some "First Amendment affront" in all compelled funding of government speech--and when, it says, "a targeted assessment . . . makes the First Amendment affront more galling, . . . greater
care is required to ensure that the political process can practically respond
to limit the compulsion." Post, at 576. That greater care consists, the
dissent says, of a requirement that government speech funded by a targeted assessment must identify government as the speaker. Post, at 576-
578. The dissent cites no prior practice, no precedent, and no authority
for this highly refined elaboration--not even anyone who has ever before
thought of it. It is more than we think can be found within "Congress
shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." Of course, nothing in the Beef Act or Beef Order prevents the Government from identifying itself as sponsor of the ads--much less requires concealment of the
ads' provenance--so even if it were correct, this theory would not sustain
the judgment below, which altogether enjoined the Act and the Order.
But the correct focus is not on whether the ads' audience realizes the
Government is speaking, but on the compelled assessment's purported interference with respondents' First Amendment rights. As we hold today,
respondents enjoy no right not to fund government speech--whether by
broad-based taxes or targeted assessments, and whether or not the reasonable viewer would identify the speech as the government's. If a
viewer would identify the speech as respondents', however, the analysis
would be different. See infra this page and 565-567, and n. 8.

Opinion of the Court
subsidy 8--with regard to respondents' facial challenge.
Since neither the Beef Act nor the Beef Order requires attribution, neither can be the cause of any possible First Amendment harm. The District Court's order enjoining the enforcement of the Act and the Order thus cannot be sustained
on this theory.

On some set of facts, this second theory might (again, we
express no view on the point) form the basis for an as-applied
challenge--if it were established, that is, that individual beef
advertisements were attributed to respondents. The record, however, includes only a stipulated sampling of these
promotional materials, see App. 47, and none of the exemplars provides any support for this attribution theory except
for the tagline identifying the funding. Respondents apparently presented no other evidence of attribution at trial, and
the District Court made no factual findings on the point.
Indeed, in the only trial testimony on the subject that any
party has identified, an employee of one of the respondent
associations said he did not think the beef promotions would

8 The principal dissent conflates the two concepts into something it describes as citizens' "presumptive autonomy as speakers to decide what to
say and what to pay for others to say." Post, at 576. As we discuss in
the text, there might be a valid objection if "those singled out to pay the
tax are closely linked with the expression" (post, at 575-576) in a way
that makes them appear to endorse the government message. But this
compelled-speech argument (like the Wooley and Barnette opinions on
which it draws) differs substantively from the compelled-subsidy analysis.
The latter invalidates an exaction not because being forced to pay for
speech that is unattributed violates personal autonomy, but because being
forced to fund someone else's private speech unconnected to any legitimate
government purpose violates personal autonomy. Supra, at 557-558 (discussing Keller and Abood). Such a violation does not occur when the
exaction funds government speech. Apportioning the burden of funding
government operations (including speech) through taxes and other levies
does not violate autonomy simply because individual taxpayers feel "singled out" or find the exaction "galling," post, at 575-576, and n. 4.

be attributed to his group.9 Whether the individual re-spondents who are beef producers would be associated with

speech labeled as coming from "America's Beef Producers"is a question on which the trial record is altogether silent.
We have only the funding tagline itself, a trademarkedterm

10 that, standing alone, is not sufficiently specific to convince a reasonable factfinder that any particular beef producer, or all beef producers, would be tarred with the content of each trademarked ad.11 We therefore conclude that

9 An employee of respondent Western Organization of Resource Councils
(WORC) testified as follows:

"Q When someone would see an ad that says, `Beef, it's what's for dinner,' do you believe anyone looks at that ad and says that message is
coming from WORC?

"A I don't think so.
"Q . . . [D]o you have any basis to actually believe that any of these
messages promoted by the Cattlemen's Beef Board are attributed to
WORC as an organization?. . . . .

"A No, I don't think so." Tr. 46-47 (Jan. 14, 2002).
10 The phrase "America's Beef Producers" has apparently been trademarked by the Board since 1999, see http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?
regser=registration&entry=2352917 (as visited May 20, 2005, and available
in Clerk of Court's case file), and some promotional materials are attributed to "America's Beef ProducersSM." Other promotional materials in
the record, however, bear other attributions (such as a notice identifying
the Beef Board as the copyright holder, or the apparently untrademarked
phrase "Funded by America's Veal Producers through the Beef Checkoff"). App. 52.

11 "America's Beef Producers" might be thought more plausibly to refer

to a particular organization of beef producers, and such an organization
might have a valid First Amendment objection if the ads' message were
incorrectly attributed to it. Cf. Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 572-573 (1995). But
neither of the respondent groups claims that it would be mistaken for
"America's Beef Producers," see n. 9, supra, and none of the individual
respondents claims to be injured because of his membership in an organization. Rather, respondents claim that "America's Beef Producers" is
precise enough to identify the speech as coming from Robert Thullner,
John Smith, Ernie Mertz, and the other respondents who are American
beef producers.

on the record before us an as-applied First Amendment challenge to the individual advertisements affords no basis on
which to sustain the Eighth Circuit's judgment, even in part.

* * *
Respondents' complaint asserted a number of other
grounds for declaring the Beef Act, the Beef Order, or both
invalid in their entirety. The District Court, having enjoined the Act and the Order on the basis of the First
Amendment, had no occasion to address these other grounds.
Respondents may now proceed on these other claims.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion. I continue to believe that
"[a]ny regulation that compels the funding of advertising
must be subjected to the most stringent First Amendment
scrutiny." United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S.
405, 419 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Glickman
v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 504-

506 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting). At the same time,
I recognize that this principle must be qualified where the
regulation compels the funding of speech that is the government's own. It cannot be that all taxpayers have a First
Amendment objection to taxpayer-funded government
speech, even if the funded speech is not "germane" to some
broader regulatory program. See ante, at 557-559. Like
the Court, I see no analytical distinction between "pure"
government speech funded from general tax revenues and
speech funded from targeted exactions, ante, at 562-564; the
practice of using targeted taxes to fund government operations, such as excise taxes, dates from the founding, see The
Federalist No. 12, p. 75 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).

568 JOHANNS v. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN.

Thomas, J., concurring
Still, if the advertisements associated their generic pro-beef message with either the individual or organization respondents, then respondents would have a valid as-appliedFirst Amendment challenge. The government may not,
consistent with the First Amendment, associate individualsor organizations involuntarily with speech by attributing an
unwanted message to them, whether or not those individualsfund the speech, and whether or not the message is under
the government's control. This principle follows not onlyfrom our cases establishing that the government may not
compel individuals to convey messages with which they dis-agree, see,

e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319U. S. 624, 633-634 (1943); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705,

713-717 (1977), but also from our expressive-associationcases, which prohibit the government from coercively associating individuals or groups with unwanted messages, see,e. g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 653 (2000)
(government cannot "force [an] organization to send a mes-sage" with which it disagrees);

Hurley v. Irish-AmericanGay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515

U. S. 557, 576-577 (1995). If West Virginia had compelledMr. Barnette to take out an advertisement reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance and purporting to be "A Message fromthe Barnette Children," for example, that would have been
compelled speech (if a less intrusive form of it), just like themandatory flag salute invalidated in Barnette. The present
record, however, does not show that the advertisementsobjectively associate their message with any individual
respondent. Ante, at 564-567, and n. 11.* The targetednature of the funding is also too attenuated a link.

Moreover, these are not cases like Barnette; the Govern-ment has not forced respondents to bear a governmentimposed message. Cf. ante, at 565, n. 8; post, at 579, n. 9(

ernment for purposes of supporting government speech isnot nearly as intrusive as being forced to "utter what is not

With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.
Justice Breyer, concurring.
The beef checkoff program in these cases is virtually iden-tical to the mushroom checkoff program in

United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405 (2001), which the Courtstruck down on First Amendment grounds. The "government speech" theory the Court adopts today was not beforeus in

United Foods, and we declined to consider it when
it was raised at the eleventh hour. See id., at 416-417.I dissented in

United Foods, based on my view that the challenged assessments involved a form of economic regulation,not speech. See

id., at 428. And I explained that, were I
to classify the program as involving "commercial speech," I
would still vote to uphold it. See id., at 429.

I remain of the view that the assessments in these cases
are best described as a form of economic regulation. However, I recognize that a majority of the Court does not share
that view. Now that we have had an opportunity to consider the "government speech" theory, I accept it as a solution to the problem presented by these cases. With the
caveat that I continue to believe that my dissent in United
Foods offers a preferable approach, I join the Court's

The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985, known as

the revenue is spent urging people to eat beef, as in advertisements with the slogan, "Beef. It's What's for Dinner."

a generic message that "beef is good." This message, theranchers say, ignores the fact that not all beef is the same;

the ads fail to distinguish, for example, the Americanranchers' grain-fed beef from the grass-fed beef predominant
in the imports, which the Americans consider inferior.The ranchers' complaint is on all fours with the objection
of the mushroom growers in United States v. United Foods,
Inc., 533 U. S. 405 (2001), where a similar statutory exactionwas struck down as a compelled subsidy of speech prohibited

by the First Amendment absent a comprehensive regulatoryscheme to which the speech was incidental. The defense of
the Government's actions in these cases, however, differs
from the position of the United States in United Foods.
There we left open the possibility that a compelled subsidy
would be justifiable not only as one element of an otherwise
valid regulatory scheme, but also as speech of the Government itself, which the Government may pay for with revenue
(usually from taxes) exacted from those who dissent from the
message as well as from those who agree with it or do not
care about it. Not surprisingly, the Government argues
here that the beef advertising is its own speech, exempting
it from the First Amendment bar against extracting special
subsidies from those unwilling to underwrite an objectionable message.

The Court accepts the defense unwisely. The error is not
that government speech can never justify compelling a subsidy, but that a compelled subsidy should not be justifiable
by speech unless the government must put that speech forward as its own. Otherwise there is no check whatever on
government's power to compel special speech subsidies, and
the rule of United Foods is a dead letter. I take the view
that if government relies on the government-speech doctrine
to compel specific groups to fund speech with targeted taxes,
it must make itself politically accountable by indicating that
the content actually is a government message, not just the
statement of one self-interested group the government is

currently willing to invest with power. Sometimes, as inthese very cases, government can make an effective disclosure only by explicitly labeling the speech as its own. Be-cause the Beef Act fails to require the Government to show
its hand, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals holding the Act unconstitutional, and I respectfully dissent from the Court's decision to condone this compelledsubsidy.

In 1779 Jefferson wrote that "to compel a man to furnishcontributions of money for the propagation of opinions which

he disbelieves . . . is sinful and tyrannical." A Bill for Estab-lishing Religious Freedom, in 5 The Founder's Constitution,
No. 37, p. 77 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987), codified in1786 at Va. Code Ann. $ 57-1 (Lexis 2003). Although he was
not thinking about compelled advertising of farm produce,we echoed Jefferson's view four years ago in United Foods,
where we said that "First Amendment values are at seriousrisk if the government can compel a particular citizen, or a
discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for speechon the side that it favors . . . ." 533 U. S., at 411. United
Foods addressed a scheme of enforced exaction virtuallyidentical to the one here, except that the product involved
was mushrooms, not beef. There, as here, a federal statuteforced a targeted group (mushroom growers) to pay a tax
that funded ads promoting its members' produce at a genericlevel objectionable to some of them. We held that the mushroom statute violated the growers' First Amendment rightto refuse to pay for expression when they object to its
content.2

1 The Government's petition for certiorari also presented a question as
to whether more limited relief might be available, but the Court denied
certiorari on that question and hence it is not before us.

2 We also noted that while the mushroom growers' disagreement with

the ads' message "could be seen as minor . . . , there is no apparent principle which distinguishes out of hand minor debates about whether a

As the Court says, ante, at 557-559, United Foods was adescendent of two lines of precedent. The first, exemplified

by West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943),and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977), stands for the
principle that government may not force individuals to utteror convey messages they disagree with or, indeed, to say
anything at all. The second, comprising Keller v. State Bar
of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990), and Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,431 U. S. 209 (1977), is authority for the related proposition

that, absent substantial justification, government may notforce targeted individuals to pay for others to speak.

Four years before United Foods we held that one suchground was present where enforced contribution to objectionable speech is incidental to a "broader collective enter-prise in which th[e] freedom to act independently is already
constrained by the regulatory scheme. " Gl ickman v.Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 469 (1997).
As noted, United Foods left open the possibility of anotherjustification, that the objectionable message is "government
speech," which our case law suggests is immune to manytypes of First Amendment challenge. See

ante, at 558-559.Although we declined to address the pertinence of a

government-speech justification in United Foods, it is crucialto the defense of the statute here because, as the District
Court and the Court of Appeals observed (and as the Courtappears to agree), these cases are factually on all fours with

branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom." United Foods,
533 U. S., at 411. The First Amendment, in other words, is not limited to
"serious" or "substantial" disputes about content. Even if it were, the
mushroom growers could have argued, as the ranchers could argue here,
that because they would prefer to say nothing than to convey the message
in the ads, the ads violate their First Amendment right not to speak at
all. See, e. g., Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471
U. S. 539, 559 (1985) ("There is necessarily, and within suitably defined
areas, a [First Amendment] freedom not to speak publicly, one which
serves the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

United Foods. See 335 F. 3d 711, 717 (CA8 2003) ("[W]eagree with the district court that `[t]he beef checkoff is, in

all material respects, identical to the mushroom checkoff ' "program challenged in United Foods (quoting 207 F. Supp.
2d 992, 1002 (SD 2002))), quoted ante, at 558. Unless, then,the doctrine of government speech is defined in such a way
as to justify the targeted compulsion here, the enforced sub-sidy for beef ads must fail along with the mushroom subsidy.
In my judgment the beef subvention should fail, for I, unlikethe Court, do not believe that the beef ads qualify for treatment as speech by the Government.The government-speech doctrine is relatively new, and
correspondingly imprecise. In fact, the few cases in whichwe have addressed the doctrine have for the most part not
gone much beyond such broad observations as "[t]he govern-ment, as a general rule, may support valid programs and
policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protestingparties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable
that funds raised by the government will be spent for speechand other expression to advocate and defend its own policies." Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. South-worth, 529 U. S. 217, 229 (2000). Even at this somewhat
early stage of development, however, two points about thedoctrine are clear.

The first point of certainty is the need to recognize thelegitimacy of government's power to speak despite objections by dissenters whose taxes or other exactions neces-sarily go in some measure to putting the offensive message
forward to be heard. To govern, government has to saysomething, and a First Amendment heckler's veto of any
forced contribution to raising the government's voice in the"marketplace of ideas"

3 would be out of the question. See

3 See Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J.,
joined by Brandeis, J., dissenting) ("[T]he ultimate good desired is better
reached by free trade in ideas--th[e] . . . best test of truth is the power of
the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market . . . ").

Keller, supra, at 12-13 ("If every citizen were to have a rightto insist that no one paid by public funds express a view with

which he disagreed, debate over issues of great concern tothe public would be limited to those in the private sector,
and the process of government as we know it radicallytransformed").

The second fixed point of government-speech doctrine is
that the First Amendment interest in avoiding forced subsi-dies is served, though not necessarily satisfied, by the political process as a check on what government chooses to say."When the government speaks, for instance to promote its
own policies or to advance a particular idea, it is, in the end,
accountable to the electorate and the political process for
its advocacy." Southworth, supra, at 235; see also Abood,
supra, at 259, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment)
("[T]he reason for permitting the government to compel the
payment of taxes and to spend money on controversial projects is that the government is representative of the people").
Democracy, in other words, ensures that government is not
untouchable when its speech rubs against the First Amendment interests of those who object to supporting it; if enough
voters disagree with what government says, the next election will cancel the message.

The adequacy of the democratic process to render the subsidization of government speech tolerable is, naturally, tied
to the character of the subsidy. For when government funds
its speech with general tax revenue, as it usually does, no
individual taxpayer or group of taxpayers can lay claim to a
special, or even a particularly strong, connection to the
money spent (and hence to the speech funded). See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 486-487 (1923). Outrage
is likely to be rare, and disagreement tends to stay temperate. But the relative palatability of a remote subsidy shared
by every taxpayer is not to be found when the speech is
funded with targeted taxes. For then, as here, the particular interests of those singled out to pay the tax are closely

linked with the expression, and taxpayers who disagree withit suffer a more acute limitation on their presumptive autonomy as speakers to decide what to say and what to pay forothers to say. See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 573 (1995)("[T]he fundamental rule of protection under the First
Amendment [is] that a speaker has the autonomy to choosethe content of his own message").

When a targeted assessment thus makes the First Amend-ment affront more galling, it does, or should, follow that

greater care is required to ensure that the political processcan practically respond to limit the compulsion Jefferson inveighed against. Whereas it would simply be unrealistic tothink that every speech subsidy from general revenue could
or should be scrutinized for its amenability to effective politi4 The Court asserts that in fact there is no difference between a taxpayer's challenge to speech funded with general revenues, which our precedents foreclose, and a challenge to speech funded with targeted taxes.
But the Court's lone authority for that position, our statement in United
States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982), that "[t]here is no principled way . . . to
distinguish between general taxes and those imposed under the Social
Security Act," id., at 260, quoted ante, at 562, is unavailing. Lee involved
a religious objection to paying Social Security taxes, and the Court's statement in that case was grounded in the recognition that if the Government
were required to accommodate the objection, there would be nothing to
stop others from raising a similar religious objection to paying "general
taxes." Here there is no comparable danger because of the commonsense
notion that individuals feel a closer connection to speech that they are
singled out to fund with targeted taxes than they do to expression paid
for with general revenues. We recognized this in Massachusetts v.
Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), where we noted that the individual taxpayer's
"interest in the moneys of the Treasury--partly realized from taxation
and partly from other sources--is shared with millions of others [and] is
comparatively minute and indeterminable." Id., at 487. This commonsense notion, then, provides a "principled way" to distinguish in this context between targeted and general taxes. The Court in Lee seemed to
recognize that its reasoning might be limited in this way, as the unredacted version of its statement reads: "[t]here is no principled way, however, for purposes of this case, to distinguish between general taxes and
those imposed under the Social Security Act." 455 U. S., at 260.

cal response, the less-common targeted speech subsidies canbe reviewed specifically for their susceptibility to response

by the voters, and the intensity of the provocation experi-enced by the targeted group justifies just such scrutiny.

In these cases, the requirement of effective public account-ability means the ranchers ought to prevail, it being clear
that the Beef Act does not establish an advertising schemesubject to effective democratic checks. The reason for this
is simple: the ads are not required to show any sign of beingspeech by the Government, and experience under the Act
demonstrates how effectively the Government has maskedits role in producing the ads.

5 Most obviously, many of them

include the tagline, "[f]unded by America's Beef Producers,"App. 50-51, which all but ensures that no one reading them

will suspect that the message comes from the National Gov-ernment.

6 But the tagline just underscores the point that

would be true without it, that readers would most naturallythink that ads urging people to have beef for dinner were

placed and paid for by the beef producers who stand to profitwhen beef is on the table. No one hearing a commercial for
Pepsi or Levi's thinks Uncle Sam is the man talking behindthe curtain. Why would a person reading a beef ad think

5 The Court thinks it is enough that the Government is not required to
mislead in this way. Ante, at 564, n. 7. This view that the statute is
saved because it might be applied without misleading readers apparently
reflects the Court's position that these cases involve a facial challenge.
Ante, at 564-565. But the challenge here is to the application of the statute through actual, misleading ads, as shown by a record replete with
examples.

6 Disputing this, petitioners Nebraska Cattlemen, Inc., et al., suggest

that any danger of confusion is eliminated by the inclusion in the beef ads
of a red checkmark with the word "beef" atop it, because this "distinctive
checkoff logo is a direct sign that the ads are disseminated pursuant to the
federal checkoff program." Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 03-1165,
pp. 15-16. It seems to me quite implausible that most (or even some)
Americans associate a red checkmark underneath the word "beef" with
the Federal Government. Indeed, it strikes me that even someone generally familiar with the Beef Act and its taxation mandate might not recognize the checkoff logo as signifying Government involvement.

Uncle Sam was trying to make him eat more steak? 7 Given
the circumstances, it is hard to see why anyone would suspect the Government was behind the message unless the
message came out and said so.

The Court takes the view that because Congress authorized this scheme and the Government controls (or at least
has a veto on) the content of the beef ads, the need for democratic accountability has been satisfied. See ante, at 563-
564. But the Court has it backwards. It means nothing
that Government officials control the message if that fact is
never required to be made apparent to those who get the
message, let alone if it is affirmatively concealed from them.
The political accountability of the officials with control is insufficient, in other words, just because those officials are allowed to use their control (and in fact are deliberately using
it) to conceal their role from the voters with the power to
hold them accountable.8 Unless the putative government

7 Moreover, anyone who did draw such an unlikely connection would also
have to believe that Uncle Sam was having a hard time making his mind
up, for other, expressly governmental messages take a different view of
how much beef Americans should be eating. Dietary Guidelines for
Americans 2005, a publication of the Departments of Agriculture and of
Health and Human Services, discusses beef in a chapter entitled "Fats."
Http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document (as visited
May 16, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The message of
that chapter is that most Americans need to reduce their consumption of
fats, and should get most of the fats they do eat from sources other than
beef, namely, fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. See id., at 29-31. That the
report, which the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human
Services say "is intended to be a primary source of dietary health information," id., at i, does not encourage the consumption of beef (as the beef ads
do) is clear from the fact that a different chapter, which discusses fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free dairy products, is entitled "Food
Groups to Encourage," id., at 23.

8 Notably, the Court nowhere addresses how, or even whether, the benefits of allowing government to mislead taxpayers by concealing its sponsorship of expression outweigh the additional imposition on First Amendment rights that results from it. Indeed, the Court describes no benefits
from its approach and gives no reason to think First Amendment doctrine

Nor is it any answer that resourceful taxpayers could dis-cover the Government behind the beef ads by doing research

on the implementation of the Beef Act. Of course a tax-payer could discover the facts by looking hard enough, but
what would tip off the taxpayer to look? And even if a fewtaxpayers did unearth the truth it would not matter, for the
First Amendment harm cannot be mitigated by the possibil-ity that a few cognoscenti may actually understand how the
scheme works. If the judiciary is justified in keeping handsoff special assessments on dissenters from government
speech, it is because there is a practical opportunity for polit-ical response; esoteric knowledge on the part of a few will
not do.
should accommodate the Government's subterfuge. The Court merely
observes that no precedent requires the Government to show its hand
when it seeks to defend a targeted assessment by claiming government
speech. Ante, at 564, n. 7. That is of course to be expected, since the
government-speech doctrine is so new that the Government has never
before enjoyed the opportunity to invoke it in this Court when attempting
to justify the type of compelled subsidy struck down in United Foods.
Since the Court now says the Government need never show its hand in
cases like this one, ante, at 564-565, there is no chance for an effective
political check on forced funding for speech, however objectionable.

9 That said, I do not mean to suggest that explicitly labeling speech as

that of government would suffice when individuals must personally convey
government's message, as in West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319
U. S. 624 (1943), and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977). The infringement on the speaker's autonomy in those situations is greater than
in cases like the ones before us today, so great that it cannot be saved by
allowing speakers to inform listeners that they (the speakers) are simply
communicating a government message or that they disagree with the message. The Court apparently took the same view in Wooley, as it was
unmoved by the dissent's observation in that case that New Hampshire
drivers were free to "place on their bumper a conspicuous bumper sticker
explaining in no uncertain terms that they do not profess the motto `Live
Free or Die.' " Id., at 722 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.).

In sum, the First Amendment cannot be implemented bysanctioning government deception by omission (or by misleading statement) of the sort the Court today condones,and expression that is not ostensibly governmental, which
government is not required to embrace as publicly as itspeaks, cannot constitute government speech sufficient to
justify enforcement of a targeted subsidy to broadcast it.The Court of Appeals thus correctly held that

United Foodsrenders the Beef Act's mandatory-assessment provisions

unconstitutional.10

10 Petitioners also defend the Beef Act by pointing to Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980),
where we subjected restrictions on commercial speech to a less rigorous
level of review than that applied to restrictions on most other types of
speech. But the Court strongly suggested in Glickman v. Wileman
Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 469 (1997), and in United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405 (2001), both that Central Hudson scrutiny is not appropriate in a case involving compelled speech rather than
restrictions on speech, and that even if some relaxed standard of review
analogous to Central Hudson were employed the Beef Act would not survive it. See Glickman, supra, at 474, n. 18 ("The Court of Appeals fails
to explain why the Central Hudson test, which involved a restriction on
commercial speech, should govern a case involving the compelled funding
of speech"); United Foods, supra, at 410 ("[E]ven viewing commercial
speech as entitled to lesser protection, we find no basis under either Glickman or our other precedents to sustain the compelled assessments sought
in this case"). Petitioners do not explain why we should depart from
these intimations that restrictions on speech are not judged by the same
standard as compelled speech.

CLINGMAN, SECRETARY, OKLAHOMA STATEELECTION BOARD,

et al. v. BEAVER et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 04-37. Argued January 19, 2005--Decided May 23, 2005
Under Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law, a political party may invite

only its own registered members and voters registered as Independents
to vote in its primary. When the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO)
notified the State Election Board it wanted to open its upcoming primary to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation, the board
agreed as to Independents, but not as to other parties' members. The
LPO and several Oklahomans registered as Republicans and Democrats
then sued for equitable relief, alleging that Oklahoma's statute unconstitutionally burdens their First Amendment right to freedom of political
association. The District Court upheld the statute on the grounds that
it did not severely burden respondents' associational rights and that
any burden imposed was justified by Oklahoma's asserted interests in
preserving parties as viable and identifiable interest groups and in ensuring that primary results accurately reflect party members' voting.
Reversing, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the statute imposed a severe burden on respondents' associational rights and was not narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
363 F. 3d 1048, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court except as to
Part II-A, concluding that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system does
not violate the right to freedom of association. Any burden it imposes
is minor and justified by legitimate state interests. Pp. 586-587,
591-598.

(a) The First Amendment protects citizens' right "to band together in
promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political
views." California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 574.
Regulations imposing severe burdens on associational rights must be
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, but when they
impose lesser burdens, "a State's important regulatory interests will
usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions."
Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 358. In Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 224, n. 13, the Court

Syllabus
left open the question whether a State may prevent a political party
from inviting registered voters of other parties to vote in its primary.
Pp. 586-587.

(b) Oklahoma's system does not severely burden associational rights.
The Court disagrees with respondents' argument that the burden Oklahoma imposes is no less severe than the burden at issue in Tashjian,
and thus the Court must apply strict scrutiny as it did in Tashjian.
Tashjian applied strict scrutiny without carefully examining the burden
on associational rights. Not every electoral law burdening associational
rights is subject to strict scrutiny, which is appropriate only if the burden is severe, e. g., Jones, supra, at 582. Requiring voters to register
with a party before participating in its primary minimally burdens voters' associational rights. Moreover, Tashjian is distinguishable. Oklahoma's semiclosed primary imposes an even less substantial burden than
did the Connecticut closed primary at issue in Tashjian. Unlike that
law, Oklahoma's system does not require Independent voters to affiliate
publicly with a party to vote in its primary, 479 U. S., at 216, n. 7. Although, like the earlier law, Oklahoma's statute does not allow parties
to "broaden opportunities for joining . . . by their own act," but requires
"intervening action by potential voters," ibid., this burden is not severe,
since many electoral regulations require that voters take some action
to participate in the primary process. Such minor barriers between
voter and party do not compel strict scrutiny. See Bullock v. Carter,
405 U. S. 134, 143. To deem ordinary and widespread burdens like
these severe would subject virtually every electoral regulation to strict
scrutiny, hamper the ability of States to run efficient and equitable elections, and compel federal courts to rewrite state electoral codes. The
Constitution does not require that result. Pp. 591-593.

(c) Oklahoma's primary advances a number of regulatory interests
this Court recognizes as important: It "preserv[es] [political] parties as
viable and identifiable interest groups," Nader v. Schaffer, 417 F. Supp.
837, 845 (Conn.), aff'd, 429 U. S. 989; enhances parties' electioneering
and party-building efforts, 417 F. Supp., at 848; and guards against party
raiding and "sore loser" candidacies by spurned primary contenders,
Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 735. Pp. 593-597.

(d) The Court declines to consider respondents' expansion of their
challenge to include several of Oklahoma's ballot access and voter registration laws. Those claims were neither raised nor decided below, see,
e. g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 168-
169, and respondents have pointed to no unusual circumstances warranting their consideration now, see Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S.
638, 645-646. Pp. 597-598.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Kennedy, concluded in Part II-A that a voter unwilling
to disaffiliate from another party in order to vote in the LPO's primary
forms little "association" with the LPO--nor the LPO with him. See
Tashjian, supra, at 235. But even if Oklahoma's system burdens an
associational right, the burden is less severe than others this Court has
upheld as constitutional. The reasons underpinning Timmons, supra,
show that Oklahoma's system burdens the LPO only minimally. As in
Timmons, Oklahoma's law does not regulate the LPO's internal processes, its authority to exclude unwanted members, or its capacity to
communicate with the public. And just as in Timmons, in which a Minnesota law conditioned a party's ability to nominate the candidate of its
choice on the candidate's willingness to disaffiliate from another party,
Oklahoma conditions a party's ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the voter's willingness to dissociate from his current party of
choice. If a party may be prevented from associating with its desired
standard bearer because he refuses to disaffiliate from another party, it
may also be prevented from associating with a voter who refuses to do
the same. Oklahoma's system imposes an even slighter burden on voters than on the LPO. Disaffiliation is not difficult: Other parties' registered members who wish to vote in the LPO primary simply need to
file a form changing their registration. Voters are not "locked in" to
an unwanted party affiliation, see Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51, 60-
61, because with only nominal effort they are free to vote in the LPO
primary. Pp. 587-591.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Breyer except as to Part III,
agreed with most of the Court's reasoning, but wrote separately to emphasize two points. First, the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO)
and voters registered with another party have constitutionally cognizable interests in associating with one another through the LPO's primary,
and these interests should not be minimized to dispose of this case.
Second, while the Court is correct that only Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law is properly under review, that standing alone it imposes only
a modest, nondiscriminatory burden on respondents' associational
rights, and that this burden is justified by the State's legitimate regulatory interests, there are some grounds for concern that other Oklahoma
laws governing party recognition and changes in party affiliation may
unreasonably restrict voters' ability to participate in the LPO's primary.
A realistic assessment of regulatory burdens on associational rights
would, in an appropriate case, require examination of the cumulative
effects of the State's overall primary scheme; and any finding of a more
severe burden would trigger more probing review of the State's justifications. Pp. 598-608.

Oklahoma has a semiclosed primary system, in which apolitical party may invite only its own party members and

the right to freedom of association of the Libertarian Partyof Oklahoma (LPO) and several Oklahomans who are registered members of the Republican and Democratic Parties.We hold that it does not.

see Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $ 1-104(A) (West 1997), unlessthe party opens its primary to registered Independents as

well, see $ 1-104(B)(1). In May 2000, the LPO notified thesecretary of the Oklahoma State Election Board that it
wanted to open its upcoming primary to all registered Okla-homa voters, without regard to their party affiliation. See

$ 1-104(B)(4) (requiring notice when a party opens its primary to Independents). Pursuant to $ 1-104, the secretaryagreed as to Independent voters, but not as to voters registered with other political parties. The LPO and several Re-publican and Democratic voters then sued for declaratory
and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma, alleging that Oklahoma's
semiclosed primary law unconstitutionally burdens their
First Amendment right to freedom of political association.
App. 20.

After a hearing, the District Court declined to enjoin
Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law for the 2000 primaries.
After a 2-day bench trial following the primary election, the
District Court found that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
system did not severely burden respondents' associational
rights. Further, it found that any burden imposed by the
system was justified by Oklahoma's asserted interest in "preserving the political parties as viable and identifiable interest
groups, [and] insuring that the results of a primary election
. . . accurately reflect the voting of the party members."

District Court therefore upheld the semiclosed primary statute as constitutional. Id., at 72-73.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court. The Court of
Appeals concluded that the State's semiclosed primary statute imposed a severe burden on respondents' associational
rights, and thus was constitutional only if the statute was

interests compelling, the Court of Appeals enjoined Okla-homa from using its semiclosed primary law. Id., at 1060-
1061. Because the Court of Appeals' decision not only pro-hibits Oklahoma from using its primary system but also casts
doubt on the semiclosed primary laws of 23 other States,1 wegranted certiorari. 542 U. S. 965 (2004).

when regulations impose lesser burdens, "a State's impor-tant regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify

reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions." Ibid. (internalquotation marks omitted).

In Tashjian, this Court struck down, as inconsistent withthe First Amendment, a closed primary system that prevented a political party from inviting Independent voters tovote in the party's primary. 479 U. S., at 225. This case
presents a question that Tashjian left open: whether a Statemay prevent a political party from inviting registered voters
of other parties to vote in its primary. Id., at 224, n. 13.As

Tashjian acknowledged, opening a party's primary "toall voters, including members of other parties, . . . raise[s]

a different combination of considerations." Ibid. We arepersuaded that any burden Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
imposes is minor and justified by legitimate state interests.

A
At the outset, we note that Oklahoma's semiclosed primarysystem is unlike other laws this Court has held to infringe

associational rights. Oklahoma has not sought through itselectoral system to discover the names of the LPO's members, see NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.449, 451 (1958); to interfere with the LPO by restricting activities central to its purpose, see NAACP v. ClaiborneHardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 895 (1982); NAACP v. Button,
371 U. S. 415, 423-426 (1963); to disqualify the LPO frompublic benefits or privileges, see Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 595-596 (1967);or to compel the LPO's association with unwanted members
or voters, see Jones, supra, at 577. The LPO is free to can-vass the electorate, enroll or exclude potential members,
nominate the candidate of its choice, and engage in the sameelectoral activities as every other political party in Oklahoma. Oklahoma merely prohibits the LPO from leavingthe selection of its candidates to people who are members of

another political party. Nothing in $ 1-104 prevents mem-bers of other parties from switching their registration to the

LPO or to Independent status.2 The question is whetherthe Constitution requires that voters who are registered in
other parties be allowed to vote in the LPO's primary.In other words, the Republican and Democratic voters who
have brought this action do not want to associate with theLPO, at least not in any formal sense. They wish to remain
registered with the Republican, Democratic, or Reform par-ties, and yet to assist in selecting the Libertarian Party's
candidates for the general election. Their interest is in cast-ing a vote for a Libertarian candidate in a particular primary
election,3 rather than in banding together with fellow citizenscommitted to the LPO's political goals and ideas. See

Jones,supra, at 573-574, n. 5 ("As for the associational `interest' in

selecting the candidate of a group to which one does not be-long, that falls far short of a constitutional right, if indeed it

2 Respondents argue, for the first time before this Court, that Oklahoma
election statutes other than $ 1-104 make it difficult for voters to disaffiliate from their parties of first choice and register as Libertarians or Independents (either of which would allow them to vote in the LPO primary).
Brief for Respondents 13-19. For reasons we explain fully in Part III,
we decline to consider this aspect of respondents' challenge. See infra,
at 597-598.

3 Respondents who are members of the Republican and Democratic Parties alleged before the District Court that they wished to have the right
to participate in the 2000 LPO primary. See Amended Complaint 4, Record Doc. 23; Complaint 3, id., Doc. 1. The only evidence respondents submitted on this point was a pair of affidavits from respondents Mary Burnett (a registered Republican) and Floyd Turner (a registered Democrat),
asserting that each might have wished to vote in the 2000 LPO primary.
See Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, id., Doc. 9 (attached affidavits). Based on Turner's affidavit, the parties stipulated that there
were "a number of voters" "registered in political parties other than the
[LPO] who wish[ed] to vote" in the 2000 LPO primary. See Supplemental
Joint Stipulations of Fact || 32, id., Doc. 17. Respondents have never
claimed that they are prevented from associating with the LPO in any
way, except that they are unable to vote in the LPO's primary and runoff elections.

can even fairly be characterized as an interest"). And theLPO is happy to have their votes, if not their membership

on the party rolls.However, a voter who is unwilling to disaffiliate from another party to vote in the LPO's primary forms little "associ-ation" with the LPO--nor the LPO with him. See

Tashjian, supra, at 235 (Scalia, J., dissenting). That same voter
might wish to participate in numerous party primaries, orcast ballots for several candidates, in any given race. The

issue is not "dual associations," post, at 601 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but seemingly boundless ones. "If the concept of freedom of association is extended" to a voter's every desire at the ballot
box, "it ceases to be of any analytic use." Tashjian, supra,
at 235 (Scalia, J., dissenting); cf. Democratic Party of
United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107,
130 (1981) (Powell, J., dissenting) ("[Not] every conflict between state law and party rules concerning participation in
the nomination process creates a burden on associational
rights").

But even if Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system burdens an associational right, the burden is less severe than
others this Court has upheld as constitutional. For instance, in Timmons, we considered a Minnesota election law
prohibiting multiparty, or "fusion," candidacies in which a
candidate appears on the ballot as the nominee of more than
one party. 520 U. S., at 353-354. Minnesota's law prevented the New Party, a minor party under state law, from
putting forward the same candidate as a major party. The
New Party challenged the law as unconstitutionally burdening its associational rights. Id., at 354-355. This Court
concluded that the burdens imposed by Minnesota's law--
"though not trivial--[were] not severe." Id., at 363.

The burdens were not severe because the New Party and
its members remained free to govern themselves internally
and to communicate with the public as they wished. Ibid.

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
590 CLINGMAN v. BEAVER

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Minnesota had neither regulated the New Party's internaldecisionmaking process, nor compelled it to associate with

voters of any political persuasion, see Jones, 530 U. S., at 577.The New Party and its members simply could not nominate
as their candidate any of "those few individuals who bothhave already agreed to be another party's candidate and also,
if forced to choose, themselves prefer that other party."
Timmons, supra, at 363.The same reasons underpinning our decision in

Timmons
show that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system burdensthe LPO only minimally. As in

Timmons, Oklahoma's law
does not regulate the LPO's internal processes, its authority
to exclude unwanted members, or its capacity to communicate with the public. And just as in Timmons, in which
Minnesota conditioned the party's ability to nominate the
candidate of its choice on the candidate's willingness to disaffiliate from another political party, Oklahoma conditions the
party's ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the
voter's willingness to dissociate from his current party of
choice. If anything, it is "[t]he moment of choosing the party's nominee" that matters far more, Jones, 530 U. S., at 575,
for that is " `the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and
hence to political power in the community,' " ibid. (quoting
Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 216). If a party may be prevented
from associating with the candidate of its choice--its desired
" `standard bearer,' " Timmons, supra, at 359; Jones, supra,
at 575--because that candidate refuses to disaffiliate from
another political party, a party may also be prevented from
associating with a voter who refuses to do the same.

Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system imposes an even
slighter burden on voters than on the LPO. Disaffiliation is
not difficult: In general, "anyone can `join' a political party
merely by asking for the appropriate ballot at the appropriate time or (at most) by registering within a state-defined
reasonable period of time before an election." Jones, supra,

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

591Cite as: 544 U. S. 581 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
at 596 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In Oklahoma, registeredmembers of the Republican, Democratic, and Reform Parties

who wish to vote in the LPO primary simply need to file aform with the county election board secretary to change
their registration. See Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $ 4-119(West Supp. 2005). Voters are not "locked in" to an unwanted party affiliation, see Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51,60-61 (1973), because with only nominal effort they are free
to vote in the LPO primary. For this reason, too, the regis-tration requirement does not unduly hinder the LPO from
associating with members of other parties. To attract mem-bers of other parties, the LPO need only persuade voters to
make the minimal effort necessary to switch parties.

B
Respondents argue that this case is no different fromTashjian. According to respondents, the burden imposed

by Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system is no less severethan the burden at issue in Tashjian, and hence we must
apply strict scrutiny as we did in Tashjian. We disagree.At issue in Tashjian was a Connecticut election statute that
required voters to register with a political party before par-ticipating in its primary. 479 U. S., at 210-211. The State's
Republican Party, having adopted a rule that allowed Inde-pendent voters to participate in its primary, contended that
Connecticut's closed primary infringed its right to associatewith Independent voters.

Ibid. Applying strict scrutiny,this Court found that the interests Connecticut advanced to

justify its ban were not compelling, and thus that the Statecould not constitutionally prevent the Republican Party from
inviting into its primary willing Independent voters. Id.,at 217-225.

Respondents' reliance on Tashjian is unavailing. As aninitial matter, Tashjian applied strict scrutiny with little discussion of the magnitude of the burdens imposed by Con-necticut's closed primary on parties' and voters' associational

592 CLINGMAN v. BEAVER

Opinion of the Court
rights. Post, at 605 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment). But not every electoral law that

burdens associational rights is subject to strict scrutiny.See,

e. g., Nader v. Schaffer, 417 F. Supp. 837, 849 (Conn.)
("There must be more than a minimal infringement on therights to vote and of association . . . before strict judicial

review is warranted"), aff 'd, 429 U. S. 989 (1976). Instead,
as our cases since Tashjian have clarified, strict scrutiny isappropriate only if the burden is severe.

Jones, supra, at
582; Timmons, 520 U. S., at 358. In Tashjian itself, Inde-pendent voters could join the Connecticut Republican Party

as late as the day before the primary. 479 U. S., at 219. As
explained above, supra, at 590-591, requiring voters to register with a party prior to participating in the party's primary minimally burdens voters' associational rights.

Nevertheless, Tashjian is distinguishable. Oklahoma's
semiclosed primary imposes an even less substantial burden
than did the Connecticut closed primary at issue in Tashjian.
In Tashjian, this Court identified two ways in which Connecticut's closed primary limited citizens' freedom of political
association. The first and most important was that it required Independent voters to affiliate publicly with a party
to vote in its primary. 479 U. S., at 216, n. 7. That is not
true in this case. At issue here are voters who have already
affiliated publicly with one of Oklahoma's political parties.
These voters need not register as Libertarians to vote in the
LPO's primary; they need only declare themselves Independents, which would leave them free to participate in any party
primary that is open to registered Independents. See Okla.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $ 1-104(B)(1) (West 1997).

The second and less important burden imposed by Connecticut's closed primary system was that political parties
could not "broaden opportunities for joining . . . by their own
act, without any intervening action by potential voters."
Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 216, n. 7. Voters also had to act by
registering themselves in a particular party. Ibid. That is

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

593Cite as: 544 U. S. 581 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
equally true of Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system: Vot-ers must register as Libertarians or Independents to participate in the LPO's primary. However, Tashjian did not char-acterize this burden alone as severe, and with good reason.
Many electoral regulations, including voter registration gen-erally, require that voters take some action to participate in
the primary process. See, e. g., Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410U. S. 752, 760-762 (1973) (upholding requirement that voters
change party registration 11 months in advance of the pri-mary election). Election laws invariably "affec[t]--at least
to some degree--the individual's right to vote and his rightto associate with others for political ends."

Anderson v.Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983).

These minor barriers between voter and party do not com-pel strict scrutiny. See Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 143
(1972). To deem ordinary and widespread burdens likethese severe would subject virtually every electoral regulation to strict scrutiny, hamper the ability of States to runefficient and equitable elections, and compel federal courts
to rewrite state electoral codes. The Constitution does notrequire that result, for it is beyond question "that States
may, and inevitably must, enact reasonable regulations ofparties, elections, and ballots to reduce electi on- and
campaign-related disorder. " Timmons, supra, at 358;
Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974). Oklahoma'ssemiclosed primary system does not severely burden the associational rights of the State's citizenry.

C
When a state electoral provision places no heavy burdenon associational rights, "a State's important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscrim-inatory restrictions."

Timmons, supra, at 358 (internalquotation marks omitted); Anderson, supra, at 788. Here,

Oklahoma's semiclosed primary advances a number of regu-latory interests that this Court recognizes as important: It

Opinion of the Court
"preserv[es] [political] parties as viable and identifiable inter-est groups,"

Nader, 417 F. Supp., at 845; enhances parties'
electioneering and party-building efforts, id., at 848; andguards against party raiding and "sore loser" candidacies by

spurned primary contenders, Storer, supra, at 735.First, as Oklahoma asserts, its semiclosed primary "preserv[es] the political parties as viable and identifiable interest groups, insuring that the results of a primary election,in a broad sense, accurately reflec[t] the voting of the party

members." Amended and Supplemental Trial Brief of De-fendants 10, Record Doc. 63 (quoting without attribution
Nader, supra, at 845). The LPO wishes to open its primary
to registered Republicans and Democrats, who may well vote
in numbers that dwarf the roughly 300 registered LPO voters in Oklahoma. See Memorandum Opinion 31-32 (at least
95% of voters in LPO's 1996 primary were independents, not
Libertarians). If the LPO is permitted to open its primary
to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation, the
candidate who emerges from the LPO primary may be "unconcerned with, if not . . . hostile to," the political preferences
of the majority of the LPO's members. Nader, supra, at
846. It does not matter that the LPO is willing to risk the
surrender of its identity in exchange for electoral success.
Oklahoma's interest is independent and concerns the integrity of its primary system. The State wants to "avoid primary election outcomes which would tend to confuse or mislead the general voting population to the extent [it] relies on
party labels as representative of certain ideologies." Brief
for Petitioners 12 (quoting without attribution Nader, supra,
at 845); Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central
Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 228 (1989).

Moreover, this Court has found that " `[i]n facilitating the
effective operation of [a] democratic government, a state
might reasonably classify voters or candidates according to
political affiliations.' " Nader, supra, at 845-846 (quoting
Ray v. Blair, 343 U. S. 214, 226, n. 14 (1952)). But for that

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

595Cite as: 544 U. S. 581 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
classification to mean much, Oklahoma must be allowed tolimit voters' ability to roam among parties' primaries. The

purpose of party registration is to provide "a minimal dem-onstration by the voter that he has some `commitment' to the
party in whose primary he wishes to participate." Nader,
supra, at 847. That commitment is lessened if party members may retain their registration in one party while voting
in another party's primary. Opening the LPO's primary toall voters not only would render the LPO's

imprimatur an
unreliable index of its candidate's actual political philosophy,but it also "would make registered party affiliations significantly less meaningful in the Oklahoma primary election system." Memorandum Opinion 59. Oklahoma reasonably has
concluded that opening the LPO's primary to all voters regardless of party affiliation would undermine the crucial role
of political parties in the primary process. Cf. Jones, 530
U. S., at 574.

Second, Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system, by retaining the importance of party affiliation, aids in parties' electioneering and party-building efforts. "It is common experience that direct solicitation of party members--by mail,
telephone, or face-to-face contact, and by the candidates
themselves or by their active supporters--is part of any primary election campaign." Nader, supra, at 848. Yet parties' voter turnout efforts depend in large part on accurate
voter registration rolls. See, e. g., Council of Alternative
Political Parties v. State Div. of Elections, 344 N. J. Super.
225, 231-232, 781 A. 2d 1041, 1045 (2001) ("It is undisputed
that the voter registration lists, with voter affiliation information, . . . provide essential information to the [party state
committees] for other campaign and party-building activities,
including canvassing and fundraising").

When voters are no longer required to disaffiliate before
participating in other parties' primaries, voter registration
rolls cease to be an accurate reflection of voters' political
preferences. And without registration rolls that accurately

Opinion of the Court
reflect likely or potential primary voters, parties risk expending precious resources to turn out party members who
may have decided to cast their votes elsewhere. See Brief
for State of South Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae 20-21. If
encouraging citizens to vote is an important state interest,
see Jones, supra, at 587 (Kennedy, J., concurring), then
Oklahoma is entitled to protect parties' ability to plan their
primaries for a stable group of voters. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.

Third, Oklahoma has an interest in preventing party raiding, or "the organized switching of blocs of voters from one
party to another in order to manipulate the outcome of the
other party's primary election." Anderson, 460 U. S., at
788-789, n. 9; Jones, supra, at 572. For example, if the outcome of the Democratic Party primary were not in doubt,
Democrats might vote in the LPO primary for the candidate
most likely to siphon off votes from the Republican candidate
in the general election. Or a Democratic primary contender
who senses defeat might launch a "sore loser" candidacy by
defecting to the LPO primary, taking with him loyal Democratic voters, and thus undermining the Democratic Party in
the general election.4 Storer, 415 U. S., at 735. Oklahoma
has an interest in "temper[ing] the destabilizing effects" of
precisely this sort of "party splintering and excessive fac4 To be most effective, a spurned candidate would have to defect in advance of the primary election. Before a candidate may file for nomination
by a political party to any state or county office in Oklahoma, generally
the candidate must have been a registered member of the party for six
months prior to filing. See Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $ 5-105(A) (West
1997). However, the registration period is only 15 days for candidates

they must regularly petition to be recognized as political parties. Ibid.;

primary. See $ 4-119; see also $ 1-102 (setting primary on last Tuesday
of July).

onnor, J., concur-ring in judgment). Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system

serves that interest by discouraging voters from temporarilydefecting from another party to vote in the LPO primary.
While the State's interest will not justify "unreasonably ex-clusionary restrictions,"

Timmons, 520 U. S., at 367, we have"repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations" like Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law, id., at 369(internal quotation marks omitted).

III
Beyond their challenge to Oklahoma's semiclosed primarylaw, $ 1-104, respondents have expanded their challenge before this Court to include other Oklahoma election laws.Respondents contend that several of the State's ballot access
and voter registration laws, taken together, severely burdentheir associational rights by effectively preventing them
from changing their party affiliations in advance of a primaryelection. Brief for Respondents 15-18 (discussing the joint
operation of Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $$ 1-108, 1-109, 1-110,4-112, and 4-119 (West Supp. 2005)).

Though the LPO has unsuccessfully challenged one ofthese provisions before, see

Rainbow Coalition of Okla. v.
Oklahoma State Election Bd., 844 F. 2d 740 (CA10 1988)(rejecting First Amendment challenge by LPO and other political parties to Oklahoma's ballot access provision, $ 1-108(West 1981 and Supp. 1987)), respondents raise this argument for the first time in their brief on the merits to thisCourt. Before the District Court and the Court of Appeals,
the only associational burden of which respondents com-plained was that imposed by $ 1-104 (West 1997), i. e., the
need to disaffiliate from one party in order to vote in anotherparty's primary. See, e. g., Appellants' Opening Brief in
No. 03-6058 (CA10), pp. 5, 8-10, 30 (challenging only $ 1-104as applied to respondents); Plaintiffs' Amended Trial Brief

9-25, Record Doc. 65 (same); Amended Complaint 6-9, id.,Doc. 23 (same). As a result, there is virtually no evidence

in the record on how other electoral regulations operate intandem with $ 1-104, whether these other laws actually burden respondents' associational rights, and whether theselaws advance important or even compelling state interests.
We ordinarily do not consider claims neither raised nor de-cided below,

would warrant considering other portions of Oklahoma'selectoral code this late in the day, see Taylor v. Freeland &
Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 645-646 (1992). We therefore declineto consider this aspect of their challenge.

Oklahoma remains free to allow the LPO to invite regis-tered voters of other parties to vote in its primary. But the

Constitution leaves that choice to the democratic process, notto the courts. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

the judgment.

I join the Court's opinion except for Part II-A. AlthoughI agree with most of the Court's reasoning, I write separately to emphasize two points. First, I think respondents'claim implicates important associational interests, and I see
no reason to minimize those interests to dispose of this case.Second, I agree with the Court that only Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law is properly before us, that standing aloneit imposes only a modest, nondiscriminatory burden on respondents' associational rights, and that this burden is justi544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fied by the State's legitimate regulatory interests. I note,however, that there are some grounds for concern that other

state laws may unreasonably restrict voters' ability tochange party registration so as to participate in the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma's (LPO) primary. A realisticassessment of regulatory burdens on associational rights
would, in an appropriate case, require examination of thecumulative effects of the State's overall scheme governing
primary elections; and any finding of a more severe burdenwould trigger more probing review of the justifications offered by the State. I

Nearly every State in the Nation now mandates that polit-ical parties select their candidates for national or statewide
office by means of primary elections. See Galderisi & Ezra,Congressional Primaries in Historical and Theoretical Context, in Congressional Primaries and the Politics of Repre-sentation 11, 17, and n. 34 (P. Galderisi, M. Ezra, & M. Lyons
eds. 2001). Primaries constitute both a " `crucial juncture' "in the electoral process,

California Democratic Party v.Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 575 (2000) (quoting Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 216 (1986)), and a vitalforum for expressive association among voters and political
parties, see Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51, 58 (1973) ("[A]basic function of a political party is to select the candidates
for public office to be offered to the voters at general elec-tions[, and a] prime objective of most voters in associating
themselves with a particular party must surely be to gain avoice in that selection process"). It is here that the parties
invite voters to join in selecting their standard bearers.The outcome is pivotal, of course, for it dictates the range of
choices available at--and often the presumptive winner of--the general election.

Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 17 (1964), and "[t]he right to associatewith the political party of one's choice is an integral part of

this basic constitutional freedom," Kusper, supra, at 57.The Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the rights of voters and partiesto associate through primary elections. See,

e. g., California Democratic Party, supra, at 574-575; Tashjian, supra,
at 214; Kusper, supra, at 56-57. Indeed, constitutional pro-tection of associational rights is especially important in this

context because the aggregation of votes is, in some sense,the essence of the electoral process. To have a meaningful
voice in this process, the individual voter must join together
with like-minded others at the polls. And the choice of who
will participate in selecting a party's candidate obviously
plays a critical role in determining both the party's message
and its prospects of success in the electoral contest. See
California Democratic Party, supra, at 575; see also Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122 (1981) ("[T]he freedom to associate
for the `common advancement of political beliefs' necessarily
presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the association" (quoting Kusper, supra, at 56)).

The plurality questions whether the LPO and voters registered with another party have any constitutionally cognizable interest in associating with one another through the
LPO's primary. See ante, at 588-589. Its doubts on this
point appear to stem from two implicit premises: first, that
a voter forms a cognizable association with a political party
only by registering with that party; and second, that a voter
can only form a cognizable association with one party at a
time. Neither of these premises is sound, in my view. As
to the first, registration with a political party surely may
signify an important personal commitment, which may be
accompanied by faithful voting and even activism beyond the
polls. But for many voters, registration serves principally
as a mandatory (and perhaps even ministerial) prerequisite

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

601Cite as: 544 U. S. 581 (2005)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
to participation in the party's primaries. The act of castinga ballot in a given primary may, for both the voter and the

party, constitute a form of association that is at least as im-portant as the act of registering. See

La Follette, supra, at
130, n. 2 (Powell, J., dissenting) ("[T]he act of voting in theDemocratic primary fairly can be described as an act of affiliation with the Democratic Party"). The fact that voting is
episodic does not, in my judgment, undermine its associa-tional significance; it simply reflects the special character of

the electoral process, which allows citizens to join togetherat regular intervals to shape government through the choice
of public officials.

As to the question of dual associations, I fail to see why
registration with one party should negate a voter's First
Amendment interest in associating with a second party. We
surely would not say, for instance, that a registered Republican or Democrat has no protected interest in associating with
the Libertarian Party by attending meetings or making political contributions. The validity of voters' and parties' interests in dual associations seems particularly clear where
minor parties are concerned. For example, a voter may
have a longstanding affiliation with a major party that she
wishes to maintain, but she may nevertheless have a substantial interest in associating with a minor party during
particular election cycles or in elections for particular offices.
The voter's refusal to disaffiliate from the major party may
reflect her abiding commitment to that party (which is not
necessarily inconsistent with her desire to associate with a
second party), the objective costs of disaffiliation, see, e. g.,
infra, at 606-607, or both. The minor party, for its part,
may have a significant interest in augmenting its voice in the
political process by associating with sympathetic members of
the major parties.

None of this is to suggest that the State does not have a
superseding interest in restricting certain forms of association. We have never questioned, for example, the States'

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
authority to restrict voters' public registration to a singleparty or to limit each voter to participating in a single party's primary. But the fact that a State's regulatory author-ity may ultimately trump voters' or parties' associational interests in a particular context is no reason to dismiss thevalidity of those interests. As a more general matter,
I question whether judicial inquiry into the genuineness, in-tensity, or duration of a given voter's association with a
given party is a fruitful way to approach constitutional chal-lenges to regulations like the one at issue here. Primary
voting is an episodic and sometimes isolated act of associa-tion, but it is a vitally important one and should be entitled
to some level of constitutional protection. Accordingly,where a party invites a voter to participate in its primary
and the voter seeks to do so, we should begin with the prem-ise that there are significant associational interests at stake.
From this starting point, we can then ask to what extent andin what manner the State may justifiably restrict those
interests. II

As to the remainder of the constitutional analysis, I amsubstantially in accord with the Court's reasoning. Our constitutional system assigns the States broad authority to reg-ulate the electoral process, and we have recognized that, "as
a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation ofelections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort
of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democraticprocesses," Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974). We
have sought to balance the associational interests of partiesand voters against the States' regulatory interests through
the flexible standard of review reaffirmed by the Courttoday. See ante, at 586-587. Under that standard, "the
rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state elec-tion law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights."

imposing severe burdens on associational rights must be nar-rowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.

Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 358(1997). Regulations imposing lesser burdens are subject to
less intensive scrutiny, and reasonable, nondiscriminatory re-strictions ordinarily will be sustained if they serve important regulatory interests. Ibid.

This regime reflects the limited but important role ofcourts in reviewing electoral regulation. Although the

State has a legitimate--and indeed critical--role to play inregulating elections, it must be recognized that it is not a
wholly independent or neutral arbiter. Rather, the State is
itself controlled by the political party or parties in power,
which presumably have an incentive to shape the rules of
the electoral game to their own benefit. Recognition of that
basic reality need not render suspect most electoral regulations. Where the State imposes only reasonable and genuinely neutral restrictions on associational rights, there is no
threat to the integrity of the electoral process and no apparent reason for judicial intervention. As such restrictions
become more severe, however, and particularly where they
have discriminatory effects, there is increasing cause for
concern that those in power may be using electoral rules
to erect barriers to electoral competition. In such cases,
applying heightened scrutiny helps to ensure that such
limitations are truly justified and that the State's asserted
interests are not merely a pretext for exclusionary or anticompetitive restrictions.

Throughout the proceedings in the lower courts, respondents framed their suit as a facial challenge to Oklahoma's
semiclosed primary law. The sum of their argument was
that, by requiring voters to register either as Libertarians
or Independents in order to participate in the LPO's primary,
state law imposes a severe and unjustified burden on the
LPO's and Oklahoma voters' associational rights. For the
reasons explained by the Court, ante, at 597-598, that is the

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
only claim properly before us. Assuming (as I believe wemust under the circumstances) that Oklahoma provides reasonable avenues for voters to reregister as Independents orLibertarians, I agree with the Court that the semiclosed primary law imposes only a modest and politically neutral bur-den on associational rights. The burden is not altogether
trivial: A voter with a significant commitment to a major
party (for example) must forfeit registration with that partyin order to participate in the LPO primary in any given election cycle, and the LPO cannot define the bounds of the asso-ciation as broadly as it would like. See

post, at 610, and n. 1
(Stevens, J., dissenting); see also supra, at 601 (discussing
the interest in dual associations). But neither is it severe
or discriminatory.

Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law simply requires that
voters wishing to participate in the LPO's primary do what
they would have to do in order to participate in any other
party's primary. By providing a reasonably fixed partyrelated electoral base from the close of registration until the
date of the vote, this requirement facilitates campaign planning. And assuming the availability of reasonable reregistration procedures, a party's inability to persuade a voter to
disaffiliate from a rival party would suggest not the presence
of anticompetitive regulatory restrictions, but rather the
party's failure to win the voter's allegiance. The semiclosed
primary law, standing alone, does not impose a significant
obstacle to participation in the LPO's primary, nor does it
indicate partisan self dealing or a lockup of the political process that would warrant heightened judicial scrutiny.

For essentially the reasons explained by the Court, see
ante, at 593-597, I agree that Oklahoma has a legitimate interest in requiring voters to disaffiliate from one party before participating in another party's primary. On the record
before us, I also agree that the State's regulatory interests
are adequate to justify the limited burden the semiclosed
primary law imposes on respondents' freedom of association.

And finally, I agree that this case is distinguishable fromTashjian. See ante, at 591-593. I joined the dissent in

that case, and I think the Court's application of strict scru-tiny there is difficult to square with the flexible standard of
review articulated in our more recent cases, see supra, at602-603. But Tashjian is entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis, and it can be fairly distinguished on thegrounds that the closed primary law in that case imposed a
greater burden on associational interests than does Oklaho-ma's semiclosed primary law, see

ante, at 592, while theState's regulatory interests in Tashjian were weaker than

they are here, compare ante, at 593-597, with Tashjian, 479U. S., at 217-225.

III
In briefing and oral argument before this Court, respond-ents raise for the first time the claim that Oklahoma's

semiclosed primary law severely burdens their associationalrights not through the law's own operation, but rather because other state laws make it quite difficult for voters toreregister as Independents or Libertarians so as to participate in the LPO primary. See Brief for Respondents 12-24.Respondents characterize Oklahoma's regulatory scheme as
follows.Partisan primaries in Oklahoma are held on the last Tuesday in July of each even-numbered year. Okla. Stat. Ann.,Tit. 26, $ 1-102 (West Supp. 2005). To field a party candidate
in an election, the LPO must obtain "recognized" party sta-tus. See ibid.; see also $$ 1-107, 5-104 (West 1997 and Supp.
2005). This requires it to submit, no later than May 1 of anyeven-numbered year (i. e., any election year), a petition with
the signatures of registered voters equal to at least five per-cent of the total votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial
or Presidential election. $ 1-108 (West Supp. 2005). TheState Election Board then has 30 days to determine whether
the petition is sufficient. $ 1-108(3). The LPO has attainedrecognized party status in this fashion in every Presidential

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
election year since 1980. However, unless the party's candi-date receives at least 10 percent of the total votes cast for

Governor or President in the general election (which nominor party has been able to do in any State in recent history), it loses recognized party status. $ 1-109. To regainparty status, the group must go through the petition process
again. Ibid.

When a party loses its recognized status, as the LPO hasafter every general election in which it has participated, the

affiliation of any voter registered with the party is changedto Independent. $ 1-110. As the District Court noted, "it
is highly likely that the ranks of independents, and, indeed,
of registered Republicans and Democrats, contain numerous
voters who sympathize with the LPO but who simply do not
wish to go through the motions of re-registering every time
they are purged from the rolls." Memorandum Opinion,
Case No. CIV-00-1071-F (WD Okla., Jan. 24, 2003), App. to
Pet. for Cert. A-48. And the Republican and Democratic
Parties in Oklahoma, as it turns out, do not permit voters
registered as Independents to participate in their primaries.

Most importantly, according to respondents, the deadline
for changing party affiliation makes it quite difficult for the
LPO to invite voters to reregister in order to participate
in its primary. Assuming the LPO submits its petition for
recognized party status on the May 1 deadline, the State
has until May 31 to determine whether party status will be
conferred. See Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, $ 1-108 (West Supp.
2005). But in order to participate in the LPO primary, a
voter registered with another party must change her party
affiliation to Independent or Libertarian no later than June
1. See $ 4-119. Moreover, no candidate for office is permitted officially to declare her candidacy with the State Election
Board until the period between the first Monday in June and
the next succeeding Wednesday. $ 5-110.

If this characterization of state law is accurate, a registered Democrat or Republican sympathetic to the LPO or to

544US2 Unit: $U48 [11-04-07 13:40:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

607Cite as: 544 U. S. 581 (2005)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
an LPO candidate in a given election year would seem toface a genuine dilemma. On the one hand, she may stick

with her major party registration and forfeit the opportunityto participate in the LPO primary. Alternatively, she may
reregister as a Libertarian or Independent, thus forfeitingher opportunity to participate in the major party primary,
though no candidate will have officially declared yet and the
voter may not yet know whether the LPO will even be per-mitted to conduct a primary. Moreover, she must make this

choice roughly eight weeks before the primaries, at a timewhen most voters have not yet even tuned in to the election,
much less decided upon a candidate. See California Democratic Party, 530 U. S., at 586 (Kennedy, J., concurring).
That might pose a special difficulty for voters attracted to
minor party candidates, for whom support may not coalesce
until comparatively late in the election cycle. See Anderson
v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 791-792 (1983) (discussing emergence of independent candidacies late in the election cycle).

Throughout the proceedings in the lower courts, which included a full bench trial before the District Court, respondents made no attempt to challenge these other electoral
requirements or to argue that they were relevant to respondents' challenge to the semiclosed primary law. The lower
courts, accordingly, gave little or no consideration to how
these various regulations interrelate or operate in practice,
nor did the State seek to justify them. Given this posture,
I agree with the Court that it would be neither proper nor
prudent for us to rule on the reformulated claim that respondents now urge. See ante, at 597-598.

Nevertheless, respondents' allegations are troubling, and,
if they had been properly raised, the Court would want to
examine the cumulative burdens imposed by the overall
scheme of electoral regulations upon the rights of voters and
parties to associate through primary elections. A panoply
of regulations, each apparently defensible when considered
alone, may nevertheless have the combined effect of severely

608 CLINGMAN v. BEAVER

Stevens, J., dissenting
restricting participation and competition. Even if each part
of a regulatory regime might be upheld if challenged separately, one or another of these parts might have to fall if the
overall scheme unreasonably curtails associational freedoms.
Oklahoma's requirement that a voter register as an Independent or a Libertarian in order to participate in the LPO's
primary is not itself unduly onerous; but that is true only
to the extent that the State provides reasonable avenues
through which a voter can change her registration status.
The State's regulations governing changes in party affiliation
are not properly before us now. But if it were shown, in an
appropriate case, that such regulations imposed a weighty or
discriminatory restriction on voters' ability to participate in
the LPO's or some other party's primary, then more probing
scrutiny of the State's justifications would be required.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
and with whom Justice Souter joins as to Parts I, II, and
III, dissenting.

The Court's decision today diminishes the value of two important rights protected by the First Amendment: the individual citizen's right to vote for the candidate of her choice
and a political party's right to define its own mission. No
one would contend that a citizen's membership in either the
Republican or the Democratic Party could disqualify her
from attending political functions sponsored by another
party, or from voting for a third party's candidate in a general election. If a third party invites her to participate in
its primary election, her right to support the candidate of
her choice merits constitutional protection, whether she
elects to make a speech, to donate funds, or to cast a ballot.
The importance of vindicating that individual right far outweighs any public interest in punishing registered Republicans or Democrats for acts of disloyalty. The balance
becomes even more lopsided when the individual right is

Stevens, J., dissenting
reinforced by the right of the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma
(LPO) to associate with willing voters.

In concluding that the State's interests override those important values, the Court focuses on interests that are not
legitimate. States do not have a valid interest in manipulating the outcome of elections, in protecting the major parties
from competition, or in stunting the growth of new parties.
While States do have a valid interest in conducting orderly
elections and in encouraging the maximum participation of
voters, neither of these interests overrides (or, indeed, even
conflicts with) the valid interests of both the LPO and the
voters who wish to participate in its primary.

In the final analysis, this case is simple. Occasionally, a
political party's interest in defining its platform and its procedures for selecting and supporting its candidates conflicts
with the voters' interest in participating in the selection of
their elected representatives. If those values do conflict, we
may be faced with difficult choices. But when, as in this
case, those values reinforce one another a decision should be
easy. Oklahoma has enacted a statute that impairs both; it
denies a party the right to invite willing voters to participate
in its primary elections. I would therefore affirm the Court
of Appeals' judgment.

I

In rejecting the individual respondents' claims, the majority focuses on their associational interests. While the voters in this case certainly have an interest in associating with
the LPO, they are primarily interested in voting for a particular candidate, who happens to be in the LPO. Indeed,
I think we have lost sight of the principal purpose of a
primary: to nominate a candidate for office. Cf. Burdick v.
Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 445 (1992) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)
("[T]he purpose of casting, counting, and recording votes is
to elect public officials, not to serve as a general forum for
political expression").

610 CLINGMAN v. BEAVER

Stevens, J., dissenting
Because our recent cases have focused on the associationalinterest of voters, rather than the right to vote itself, it is

important to identify three basic precepts. First, it is clearthat the right to vote includes the right to vote in a primary
election. See United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 318(1941);

Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953). When the
State makes the primary an "integral part of the procedure
of choice," every eligible citizen's right to vote should receivethe same protection as in the general election.

Classic, 313
U. S., at 318; see also, e. g., Gray v. Sanders, 372 U. S. 368(1963) (invalidating primary system that diluted individual's

vote in a primary). Second, the right to vote, whetherin the primary or the general election, is the right to vote
"for the candidate of one's choice." Reynolds v. Sims, 377U. S. 533, 555 (1964). Finally, in assessing burdens on that
right--burdens that are not limited to absolute denial of theright--we should focus on the realities of the situation, not
on empty formalism. See Classic, 313 U. S., at 313 (identifying "the practical operation of the primary law"); Terry,
345 U. S., at 469-470 (noting that the Jaybird primary is "the
only effective part" of the election process and examining
"[t]he effect of the whole procedure" in determining whether
the scheme violated the Fifteenth Amendment).

Here, the impact of the Oklahoma statute on the voters'
right to vote for the candidate of their choosing is not a mere
"burden"; it is a prohibition.1 By virtue of the fact that
their preferred candidate is a member of a different party,
respondents are absolutely precluded from voting for him or
her in the primary election. It is not an answer that the

1 It is not enough that registered members of other parties may simply change their registration. See ante, at 590-591 (plurality opinion).
Changing one's political party is not simply a matter of filing a form with
the State; for many individuals it can be a significant decision. A view
that party membership is merely a label demeans for many the personal
significance of party identification and illustrates what little weight the

voters could participate in another primary (i. e., the primaryfor the party with which they are registered) since the individual for whom they wish to vote is not a candidate in thatprimary. If the so-called "white primary" cases make anything clear, it is that the denial of the right to vote cannotbe cured by the ability to participate in a subsequent or different election. Just as the "only election that has counted"in

Terry, 345 U. S., at 469, was the Jaybird primary, since itwas there that the public official was selected in any meaningful sense, the only primary that counts here is the one inwhich the candidate respondents want to vote for is actually
running. See Burdick, 504 U. S., at 442 (Kennedy, J., dis-senting) ("Because [petitioner] could not write in the name
of a candidate he preferred, he had no way to cast a meaning-ful vote").

This is not to say that voters have an absolute right toparticipate in whatever primary they desire. For instance,
the parties themselves have a strong associational interestin determining which individuals may vote in their primaries, and that interest will normally outweigh the interestof the uninvited voter.

2 But in the ordinary case the State

simply has no interest in classifying voters by their politicalparty and in limiting the elections in which voters may participate as a result of that classification. Just as we held in
Reynolds that all voters of a State stand in the same relationto the State regardless of where they live, and that the State

must thus not make their vote count more or less depending

2 The voters' interest may still prevail if, as was the case in Terry v.
Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953), and Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944),
the party primary is the de facto election. In part because of this Court's
refusal to intervene in political gerrymandering cases, Davis v. Bandemer,
478 U. S. 109 (1986), an increasing number of districts are becoming "safe
districts" in which one party effectively controls the outcome of the election. See, e. g., Courtney, Redistricting: What the United States Can
Learn from Canada, 3 Election L. J. 488 (2004) (concluding that 400 of the
435 Members of the House of Representatives were elected in safe districts in the 2002 election, 81 of whom ran unopposed).

upon that factor, 377 U. S., at 565, so too do citizens stand inthe same relation to the State regardless of the political party

to which they belong. The State may thus not deny themparticipation in a primary of a party that seeks their participation absent a state interest of overriding importance.

II
In addition to burdening the individual respondent's rightto vote, the Oklahoma scheme places a heavy burden on the

LPO's associational rights. While Oklahoma permits inde-pendent voters to participate in the LPO's primary elections,
it refuses to allow registered Republicans or Democrats todo so. That refusal has a direct impact on the LPO's selection of candidates for public office, the importance of whichcannot be overstated. A primary election plays a critical
role in enabling a party to disseminate its message to thepublic. California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S.
567, 575 (2000). It is through its candidates that a party isable to give voice to its political views, to engage other candidates on important issues of the day, and to affect change inthe government of our society. Our cases "vigorously affirm
the special place the First Amendment reserves for, and thespecial protection it accords, the process by which a political
party `select[s] a standard bearer who best represents theparty's ideologies and preferences.' "

Ibid. (quoting Eu v.San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S.

214, 224 (1989)).The Oklahoma statute prohibits the LPO from associating
with all of the voters it believes will best enable it to selecta viable candidate. The ability to select those individuals
with whom to associate is, of course, at the core of the FirstAmendment and goes to the heart of the associational interest itself. "Freedom of association means not only that anindividual voter has the right to associate with the political
party of her choice, but also that a political party has a rightto identify the people who constitute the association . . . ."

Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel.
La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122 (1981). While Libertarianscan undoubtedly associate with Democrats and Republicans

in other ways and at other times, the Oklahoma statute "lim-its the Party's associational opportunities at the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power inthe community."

Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,
479 U. S. 208, 216 (1986).In concluding that the Oklahoma statute is constitutional,

the majority argues that associational interests between the
LPO and registered members of other parties are either nonexistent or not heavily burdened by the Oklahoma scheme.
The plurality relies on a single footnote in Jones to show that
there are no associational interests between the LPO and
registered Republicans and Democrats. See ante, at 588-
589 (citing 530 U. S., at 573-574, n. 5). In Jones, of course,
the political parties did not want voters of other parties participating in their primaries; the putative associational interest in this case, in which the LPO is actively courting voters
of other parties, simply did not exist. More importantly, our
decision in Tashjian rejected these arguments.

In Tashjian we held that the State could not prohibit Republicans from inviting voters who were not registered with
a political party to participate in the Republican primary.
We recognized that "[t]he Party's attempt to broaden the
base of public participation in and support for its activities
is conduct undeniably central to the exercise of the right of
association." 479 U. S., at 214. Importantly, we rejected
the notion that the associational interest was somehow diminished because the voters the party sought to include
were not formally registered as Republicans. Id., at 215
("[C]onsidered from the standpoint of the Party itself, the
act of formal enrollment or public affiliation with the Party
is merely one element in the continuum of participation in

Party affairs, and need not be in any sense the most important"). We reasoned that a State could not prohibit independents from contributing financial support to a Republican
candidate or from participating in the party's events; it
would be anomalous if it were able to prohibit participation
by independents in the " `basic function' " of the party. Id.,
at 216. Because of the importance of those interests, we
carefully examined the interests asserted by the State, and
finding them lacking, struck down the prohibition on independents' participation in the Republican primary.

Virtually identical interests are at stake in this case. It
is the LPO's belief that attracting a more diverse group of
voters in its primary would enable it to select a more mainstream candidate who would be more viable in the general
election. Like the Republicans in Tashjian, the LPO is cognizant of the fact that in order to enjoy success at the voting
booth it must have support from voters who identify themselves as independents, Republicans, or Democrats.

The LPO's desire to include Democrats and Republicans is
undoubtedly informed by the fact that, given the stringent
requirements of Oklahoma law, the LPO ceases to become a
formally recognized party after each election cycle, and its
members automatically revert to being independents.3 Because the LPO routinely loses its status as a recognized
party, many voters who might otherwise register as Libertarians instead register as Democrats or Republicans.4
Thus, the LPO's interest in inviting registered Republicans

a party's nominee for Governor, President, or Vice President receive 10%

4 See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-48 (District Court recognizing that "it is

highly likely that the ranks of independents and, indeed, of registered
Republicans and Democrats, contain numerous voters who sympathize
with the LPO but who simply do not wish to go through the motions of
re-registering every time they are purged from the rolls").

and Democrats to participate in the selection of its standardbearer has even greater force than did the Republican Party's desire to invite independents to associate with it inTashjian.

III
As justification for the State's abridgment of the constitu-tionally protected interests asserted by the LPO and the voters, the majority relies on countervailing state interests thatare either irrelevant or insignificant. Neither separately
nor in the aggregate do these interests support the Court'sdecision.

First, the Court makes the remarkable suggestion that byopening up its primary to Democrats and Republicans, the
LPO will be saddled with so many nonlibertarian voters thatthe ultimate candidate will not be, in any sense, "libertarian." See ante, at 594.5 But the LPO is seeking the cross-over voting of Republicans and Democrats. Rightly or
wrongly, the LPO feels that the best way to produce a viablecandidate is to invite voters from other parties to participate
in its primary. That may dilute what the Court believes tobe the core of the Libertarian philosophy, but it is no business of the State to tell a political party what its messageshould be, how it should select its candidates, or how it
should form coalitions to ensure electoral success. See
Jones, 530 U. S., at 581-582 (rejecting state interests in pro-ducing candidates that are more centrist than the nominee

the party would have selected absent the blanket primary).6

5 Of course, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 594, since the number
of independent voters overwhelms the number of registered-LPO voters,
that is already the case.

Second, the majority expresses concern that crossover voting may create voter confusion. This paternalistic concern
is belied by the District Court's finding that no significant
voter confusion would occur. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-43
(noting that "very simple rules for voting eligibility can be
posted at polling places when the primary and runoff elections are conducted").

Third, the majority suggests that crossover voting will impair the State's interest in properly classifying candidates
and voters. As an empirical matter, a crossover voter may
have a lesser commitment to the party with which he is
registered if he votes in another party's primary. Nevertheless, the State does not have a valid interest in defining
what it means to be a Republican or a Democrat, or in attempting to ensure the political orthodoxy of party members
simply for the convenience of those parties. Cf. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943) ("If
there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it
is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be
orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters
of opinion . . . "). Even if participation in the LPO's primary
causes a voter to be a less committed "Democrat" or "Republican" (a proposition I reject 7), the dilution of that commitment does not justify abridgment of the fundamental rights
at issue in this case. While party identity is important in

tion, however, this is an issue for the party to resolve, not for the State"
(emphasis added)). Such coalition building, and reaching out to other
groups to ensure a candidate gets elected, is a vital part of the political
process. Cf. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal
Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 622-623 (1996) (citing W. Keefe, Parties,
Politics, and Public Policy in America 59-74 (5th ed. 1988)).

7 Allowing a potential crossover voter to vote in the LPO primary would

not change the level of commitment he has toward his party of registration; it would simply give him an outlet to express the views he already
holds.

Fourth, the majority argues that opening up the LPO pri-mary to members of the Republican and Democratic Parties

might interfere with electioneering and party-building ef-forts. It is clear, of course, that the majority here is concerned only with the Democratic and Republican Parties,since party building is precisely what the LPO is attempting to accomplish. Nevertheless, that concern is misplaced.
Even if, as the majority claims, the Republican and Demo-cratic voter rolls, mailing lists, and phone banks are not as

accurate as they would otherwise be,9 the administrative in-convenience of the major parties does not outweigh the right
to vote or the associational interests of those voters and theLPO. At its core, this argument is based on a fear that the
LPO might be successful in convincing Democratic or Re-publican voters to participate more fully in the LPO. Far
from being a compelling interest, it is an impermissible one.
Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 367

8 If, of course, States were able to protect the incumbent parties in the
name of protecting the stability of the two-party system in general, we
might still have the Federalists, the Anti-federalists, or the Whigs. See
generally J. Aldrich, Why Parties? The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America (1995). In any event, we would not have the
evolution of thought or policies that are occasioned through the change of
political parties. While no such change has occurred in recent memory,
that is no reason to ossify the status quo.

9 The majority's argument is that voters who would otherwise vote in

the Republican or Democratic primaries would vote in the LPO primary,
and that the Democratic and Republican lists would not be an accurate
indicator of who is likely to vote in those primaries, and of which voters
to spend party resources on. First, I find it doubtful that those voters
who vote in the LPO primary would have voted in the Democratic or
Republican primary; rather, they probably would not have been sufficiently motivated to vote at all. Further, this would actually give Republicans and Democrats additional information as to which of their voters
have Libertarian leanings.

(1997) (State may not "completely insulate the two-partysystem from minor parties' or independent candidates' competition and influence").Finally, the majority warns against the possibility of raiding, ante, at 596, by which voters of another party mali-ciously vote in a primary in order to change the outcome of
the primary, either to nominate a particularly weak candi-date, a "sore-loser" candidate, or a candidate who would siphon votes from another party. The District Court, whosefactual findings are entitled to substantial deference, found
as a factual and legal matter that the State's argument con-cerning raiding was "unpersuasive." App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-61.Even if raiding were a possibility, however, the state interests are remote. The possibility of harm to the LPO itselfis insufficient to overcome the LPO's associational rights.
See Eu, 489 U. S., at 227-228 ("[E]ven if a ban on endorse-ments saves a political party from pursuing self-destructive
acts, that would not justify a State substituting its judgmentfor that of the party"). If the LPO is willing to take the
risk that its party may be "hijacked" by individuals who holdviews opposite to their own, the State has little interest in
second-guessing the LPO's decision.With respect to the possibility that Democratic or Republican voters might raid the LPO to the detriment of their ownor another party, neither the State nor the majority has identified any evidence that voters are sufficiently organized toachieve such a targeted result.

10 Such speculation is not, in

10 To change the outcome of an election in a way that would benefit their
own party, voters would have to be relatively certain that their preferred
candidate in their own primary would win that primary and to vote in the
LPO primary for a previously agreed-on candidate who is opposed to their
own ideological preferences. Given that voters typically do not focus on
an election until several days or weeks before an election, this prospect is
unlikely. See California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 586
(2000) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Further, one would have expected to
see some evidence of this in States where it is relatively easy to switch
parties close to a primary.

my view, sufficient to override the real and acknowledged
interest of the LPO and the voters who wish to participate
in its primary. See Timmons, 520 U. S., at 375 (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (citing Eu, 489 U. S., at 226; Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 789 (1983); and Norman v. Reed, 502
U. S. 279, 288-289 (1992)).11

In the end, the balance of interests clearly favors the LPO
and those voters who wish to participate in its primary. The
associational interests asserted--the right to select a standard bearer that the party thinks has the best chance of success, the ability to associate at the crucial juncture of selecting a candidate, and the desire to reach out to voters of other
parties--are substantial and undoubtedly burdened by Oklahoma's statutory scheme. Any doubt about that fact is
clearly answered by Tashjian. On the other side, the interests asserted by the State are either entirely speculative or
simply protectionist measures that benefit the parties in
power. No matter what the standard, they simply do not
outweigh the interests of the LPO and its voters.

IV
The Libertarian Party of Oklahoma is not the only loser
in this litigation. Other minor parties and voters who have
primary allegiance to one party but sometimes switch their
support to rival candidates are also harmed by this decision.
In my judgment, however, the real losers include all participants in the political market. Decisions that give undue def11 The flimsy character of the state interests in this case confirms my
view that today's decision rests primarily on a desire to protect the twoparty system. In Jones, the Court concluded that the associational interests of the parties trumped state interests that were much more compelling than those asserted in this case. Here, by contrast, where the
associational interests are being asserted by a minor party rather than by
one of the dominant parties, the Court has reversed course and rejected
those associational interests as insubstantial compared to the interests
asserted by the State.

Primary elections are already replacing general elections asthe most common method of actually determining the composition of our legislative bodies. The trend can only increasethe bitter partisanship that has already poisoned some of
those bodies that once provided inspiring examples of courte-ous adversary debate and deliberation.

The decision in this case, like the misguided decisions in
Timmons, 520 U. S. 351, and Jones, 530 U. S. 567, attachesoverriding importance to the interest in preserving the twoparty system. In my view, there is over a century of experi-ence demonstrating that the two major parties are fully capable of maintaining their own positions of dominance in thepolitical marketplace without any special assistance from the
state governments that they dominate or from this Court.Whenever they receive special advantages, the offsetting
harm to independent voters may be far more significant thanthe majority recognizes.

candidates. Commenting on election laws that disadvan-tage independents, we noted:

DECK v. MISSOURI
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri

No. 04-5293. Argued March 1, 2005--Decided May 23, 2005
Petitioner Deck was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death,

but the Missouri Supreme Court set aside the sentence. At his new
sentencing proceeding, he was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a
belly chain. The trial court overruled counsel's objections to the shackles, and Deck was again sentenced to death. Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected Deck's claim that his shackling violated, inter
alia, the Federal Constitution.

Held: The Constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during a capital

trial's penalty phase, as it does during the guilt phase, unless that use is
"justified by an essential state interest"--such as courtroom security--
specific to the defendant on trial. Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560,
568-569. Pp. 626-635.

(a) The law has long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during
a capital trial's guilt phase, permitting shackling only in the presence of
a special need. In light of Holbrook, Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337,
early English cases, and lower court shackling doctrine dating back to
the 19th century, it is now clear that this is a basic element of due
process protected by the Federal Constitution. Thus, the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments prohibit using physical restraints visible to the
jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion,
that restraints are justified by a state interest specific to the particular
defendant on trial. Pp. 626-629.

(b) If the reasons motivating the guilt phase constitutional rule--the
presumption of innocence, securing a meaningful defense, and maintaining dignified proceedings--apply with like force at the penalty phase,
the same rule will apply there. The latter two considerations obviously
apply. As for the first, while the defendant's conviction means that the
presumption of innocence no longer applies, shackles at the penalty
phase threaten related concerns. The jury, though no longer deciding
between guilt and innocence, is deciding between life and death, which,
given the sanction's severity and finality, is no less important, Monge v.
California, 524 U. S. 721, 732. Nor is accuracy in making that decision
any less critical. Yet, the offender's appearance in shackles almost inevitably implies to a jury that court authorities consider him a danger
to the community (which is often a statutory aggravator and always a
relevant factor); almost inevitably affects adversely the jury's percep544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

623Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)
Syllabus
tion of the defendant's character; and thereby inevitably undermines
the jury's ability to weigh accurately all relevant considerations when
determining whether the defendant deserves death. The constitutional
rule that courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other
restraints visible to the jury during the penalty phase is not absolute.
In the judge's discretion, account may be taken of special circumstances
in the case at hand, including security concerns, that may call for shackling in order to accommodate the important need to protect the courtroom and its occupants. Pp. 630-633.

(c) Missouri's arguments that its high court's decision in this case
meets the Constitution's requirements are unconvincing. The first--
that that court properly concluded that there was no evidence that the
jury saw the restraints--is inconsistent with the record, which shows
that the jury was aware of them, and overstates what the court actually
said, which was that trial counsel made no record of the extent of the
jury's awareness of the shackles. The second--that the trial court
acted within its discretion--founders on the record, which does not
clearly indicate that the judge weighted the particular circumstances of
the case. The judge did not refer to an escape risk or threat to courtroom security or explain why, if shackles were necessary, he did not
provide nonvisible ones as was apparently done during the guilt phase
of this case. The third--that Deck suffered no prejudice--fails to take
account of Holbrook's statement that shackling is "inherently prejudicial," 475 U. S., at 568, a view rooted in this Court's belief that the practice will often have negative effects that "cannot be shown from a trial
transcript," Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 137. Thus, where a court,
without adequate justification, orders the defendant to wear shackles
visible to the jury, the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice
to make out a due process violation. The State must prove "beyond a
reasonable doubt that the [shackling] did not contribute to the verdict
obtained." Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24. Pp. 634-635.

We here consider whether shackling a convicted offenderduring the penalty phase of a capital case violates the Federal Constitution. We hold that the Constitution forbids theuse of visible shackles during the penalty phase, as it forbids

Opinion of the Court
29. Deck was convicted and sentenced to death. The State
Supreme Court upheld Deck's conviction but set aside the
sentence. 68 S. W. 3d 418, 432 (2002) (en banc). The State
then held a new sentencing proceeding.

From the first day of the new proceeding, Deck was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain. App. 58.
Before the jury voir dire began, Deck's counsel objected to
the shackles. The objection was overruled. Ibid.; see also
id., at 41-55. During the voir dire, Deck's counsel renewed
the objection. The objection was again overruled, the court
stating that Deck "has been convicted and will remain in
legirons and a belly chain." Id., at 58. After the voir dire,
Deck's counsel once again objected, moving to strike the jury
panel "because of the fact that Mr. Deck is shackled in front
of the jury and makes them think that he is . . . violent
today." Id., at 58-59. The objection was again overruled,
the court stating that his "being shackled takes any fear out
of their minds." Id., at 59. The penalty phase then proceeded with Deck in shackles. Deck was again sentenced to
death. 136 S. W. 3d 481, 485 (Mo. 2004) (en banc).

On appeal, Deck claimed that his shackling violated both
Missouri law and the Federal Constitution. The Missouri
Supreme Court rejected these claims, writing that there was
"no record of the extent of the jury's awareness of the restraints"; there was no "claim that the restraints impeded"
Deck "from participating in the proceedings"; and there was
"evidence" of "a risk" that Deck "might flee in that he was a
repeat offender" who may have "killed his two victims to
avoid being returned to custody." Ibid. Thus, there was
"sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's
exercise of its discretion" to require shackles, and in any
event Deck "has not demonstrated that the outcome of his
trial was prejudiced. . . . Neither being viewed in shackles
by the venire panel prior to trial, nor being viewed while
restrained throughout the entire trial, alone, is proof of prej544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

udice." Ibid. The court rejected Deck's other claims oferror and affirmed the sentence.

We granted certiorari to review Deck's claim that hisshackling violated the Federal Constitution.

II
We first consider whether, as a general matter, the Consti-tution permits a State to use visible shackles routinely in the

guilt phase of a criminal trial. The answer is clear: The lawhas long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during the
guilt phase; it permits a State to shackle a criminal defend-ant only in the presence of a special need.

This rule has deep roots in the common law. In the 18thcentury, Blackstone wrote that "it is laid down in our antient
books, that, though under an indictment of the highest na-ture," a defendant "must be brought to the bar without irons,
or any manner of shackles or bonds; unless there be evidentdanger of an escape." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on
the Laws of England 317 (1769) (footnote omitted); see also3 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England *34 ("If felons
come in judgement to answer, . . . they shall be out of irons,and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not take
away any manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer,but at their free will"). Blackstone and other English authorities recognized that the rule did not apply at "the timeof arraignment," or like proceedings before the judge.
Blackstone, supra, at 317; see also Trial of ChristopherLayer, 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 99 (K. B. 1722). It was meant to
protect defendants appearing at trial before a jury. SeeKing v. Waite, 1 Leach 28, 36, 168 Eng. Rep. 117, 120 (K. B.
1743) ("[B]eing put upon his trial, the Court immediately or-dered [the defendant's] fetters to be knocked off ").

American courts have traditionally followed Blackstone's"ancient" English rule, while making clear that "in extreme
and exceptional cases, where the safe custody of the prisonerand the peace of the tribunal imperatively demand, the man544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Practice $ 540a, p. 369 (8th ed. 1880); 12 Cyclopedia of Law
and Procedure 529 (1904). While these earlier courts disagreed about the degree of discretion to be afforded trial
judges, see post, at 643-648 (Thomas, J., dissenting), they
settled virtually without exception on a basic rule embodying notions of fundamental fairness: Trial courts may not
shackle defendants routinely, but only if there is a particular
reason to do so.

More recently, this Court has suggested that a version of
this rule forms part of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' due process guarantee. Thirty-five years ago, when
considering the trial of an unusually obstreperous criminal
defendant, the Court held that the Constitution sometimes
permitted special measures, including physical restraints.
Allen, 397 U. S., at 343-344. The Court wrote that "binding

Opinion of the Court
and gagging might possibly be the fairest and most reasonable way to handle" such a defendant. Id., at 344. But the
Court immediately added that "even to contemplate such a
technique . . . arouses a feeling that no person should be tried
while shackled and gagged except as a last resort." Ibid.

Sixteen years later, the Court considered a special courtroom security arrangement that involved having uniformed
security personnel sit in the first row of the courtroom's
spectator section. The Court held that the Constitution allowed the arrangement, stating that the deployment of security personnel during trial is not "the sort of inherently prejudicial practice that, like shackling, should be permitted only
where justified by an essential state interest specific to each
trial." Holbrook, 475 U. S., at 568-569. See also Estelle v.
Williams, 425 U. S. 501, 503, 505 (1976) (making a defendant
appear in prison garb poses such a threat to the "fairness of
the factfinding process" that it must be justified by an "essential state policy").

Lower courts have treated these statements as setting
forth a constitutional standard that embodies Blackstone's
rule. Courts and commentators share close to a consensus
that, during the guilt phase of a trial, a criminal defendant
has a right to remain free of physical restraints that are visible to the jury; that the right has a constitutional dimension;
but that the right may be overcome in a particular instance
by essential state interests such as physical security, escape
prevention, or courtroom decorum. See, e. g., Dyas v. Poole,
309 F. 3d 586, 588-589 (CA9 2002) (per curiam); Harrell v.

1971); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Discovery and
Trial by Jury 15-3.2, pp. 188-191 (3d ed. 1996).

Lower courts have disagreed about the specific procedural
steps a trial court must take prior to shackling, about the
amount and type of evidence needed to justify restraints, and
about what forms of prejudice might warrant a new trial,
but they have not questioned the basic principle. They have
emphasized the importance of preserving trial court discretion (reversing only in cases of clear abuse), but they have
applied the limits on that discretion described in Holbrook,
Allen, and the early English cases. In light of this precedent, and of a lower court consensus disapproving routine
shackling dating back to the 19th century, it is clear that
this Court's prior statements gave voice to a principle deeply
embedded in the law. We now conclude that those statements identify a basic element of the "due process of law"
protected by the Federal Constitution. Thus, the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the use of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination,
in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a
state interest specific to a particular trial. Such a determination may of course take into account the factors that courts
have traditionally relied on in gauging potential security
problems and the risk of escape at trial.

Opinion of the Court

III
We here consider shackling not during the guilt phase of
an ordinary criminal trial, but during the punishment phase
of a capital case. And we must decide whether that change
of circumstance makes a constitutional difference. To do so,
we examine the reasons that motivate the guilt-phase constitutional rule and determine whether they apply with similar
force in this context.

A

Judicial hostility to shackling may once primarily have reflected concern for the suffering--the "tortures" and "torments"--that "very painful" chains could cause. Krauskopf,
supra, at 351, 353 (internal quotation marks omitted); see
also Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 154, n. 4 (1992)
(Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing English cases curbing the use
of restraints). More recently, this Court's opinions have not
stressed the need to prevent physical suffering (for not all
modern physical restraints are painful). Instead they have
emphasized the importance of giving effect to three fundamental legal principles.

First, the criminal process presumes that the defendant is
innocent until proved guilty. Coffin v. United States, 156
U. S. 432, 453 (1895) (presumption of innocence "lies at the
foundation of the administration of our criminal law"). Visible shackling undermines the presumption of innocence and
the related fairness of the factfinding process. Cf. Estelle,
supra, at 503. It suggests to the jury that the justice system itself sees a "need to separate a defendant from the community at large." Holbrook, supra, at 569; cf. State v. Roberts, 86 N. J. Super., at 162, 206 A. 2d, at 202 ("[A] defendant
`ought not be brought to the Bar in a contumelious Manner;
as with his Hands tied together, or any other Mark of Ignominy and Reproach . . . unless there be some Danger of a
Rescous [rescue] or Escape' " (quoting 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas

Opinion of the Court
of the Crown, ch. 28, $ 1, p. 308 (1716-1721) (section onarraignments))).

Second, the Constitution, in order to help the accused se-cure a meaningful defense, provides him with a right to
counsel. See, e. g., Amdt. 6; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.335, 340-341 (1963). The use of physical restraints diminishes that right. Shackles can interfere with the accused's
"ability to communicate" with his lawyer. Allen, 397 U. S.,at 344. Indeed, they can interfere with a defendant's ability

to participate in his own defense, say, by freely choosingwhether to take the witness stand on his own behalf.
Cf. Cranburne's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 222 (K. B. 1696) ("Look
you, keeper, you should take off the prisoners irons when
they are at the bar, for they should stand at their ease when
they are tried" (footnote omitted)); People v. Harrington, 42
Cal., at 168 (shackles "impos[e] physical burdens, pains, and
restraints . . . , . . . ten[d] to confuse and embarrass" defendants' "mental faculties," and thereby tend "materially to
abridge and prejudicially affect his constitutional rights").

Third, judges must seek to maintain a judicial process that
is a dignified process. The courtroom's formal dignity,
which includes the respectful treatment of defendants, reflects the importance of the matter at issue, guilt or innocence, and the gravity with which Americans consider any
deprivation of an individual's liberty through criminal punishment. And it reflects a seriousness of purpose that helps
to explain the judicial system's power to inspire the confidence and to affect the behavior of a general public whose
demands for justice our courts seek to serve. The routine
use of shackles in the presence of juries would undermine
these symbolic yet concrete objectives. As this Court has
said, the use of shackles at trial "affront[s]" the "dignity and
decorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to
uphold." Allen, supra, at 344; see also Trial of Christopher
Layer, 16 How. St. Tr., at 99 (statement of Mr. Hungerford)
("[T]o have a man plead for his life" in shackles before

544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
632 DECK v. MISSOURI

Opinion of the Court
"a court of justice, the highest in the kingdom for criminalmatters, where the king himself is supposed to be personally

present," undermines the "dignity of the Court").There will be cases, of course, where these perils of shackling are unavoidable. See Allen, supra, at 344. We do notunderestimate the need to restrain dangerous defendants to
prevent courtroom attacks, or the need to give trial courtslatitude in making individualized security determinations.
We are mindful of the tragedy that can result if judges arenot able to protect themselves and their courtrooms. But
given their prejudicial effect, due process does not permitthe use of visible restraints if the trial court has not taken
account of the circumstances of the particular case.

B
The considerations that militate against the routine use ofvisible shackles during the guilt phase of a criminal trial

apply with like force to penalty proceedings in capital cases.This is obviously so in respect to the latter two considerations mentioned, securing a meaningful defense and main-taining dignified proceedings. It is less obviously so in respect to the first consideration mentioned, for the defendant'sconviction means that the presumption of innocence no
longer applies. Hence shackles do not undermine the jury'seffort to apply that presumption.

Nonetheless, shackles at the penalty phase threaten re-lated concerns. Although the jury is no longer deciding between guilt and innocence, it is deciding between life anddeath. That decision, given the " `severity' " and " `finality' "
of the sanction, is no less important than the decision aboutguilt.

Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 732 (1998) (quot-ing Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357 (1977)).

Neither is accuracy in making that decision any less criti-cal. The Court has stressed the "acute need" for reliable
decisionmaking when the death penalty is at issue. Monge,
supra, at 732 (citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)

544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

633Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)
Opinion of the Court
(plurality opinion)). The appearance of the offender duringthe penalty phase in shackles, however, almost inevitably implies to a jury, as a matter of common sense, that court au-thorities consider the offender a danger to the community--
often a statutory aggravator and nearly always a relevantfactor in jury decisionmaking, even where the State does not
specifically argue the point. Cf. Brief for Respondent 25-27.
It also almost inevitably affects adversely the jury's percep-tion of the character of the defendant. See

Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 900 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurringin judgment) (character and propensities of the defendant

are part of a "unique, individualized judgment regarding the
punishment that a particular person deserves"). And it
thereby inevitably undermines the jury's ability to weigh
accurately all relevant considerations--considerations that
are often unquantifiable and elusive--when it determines
whether a defendant deserves death. In these ways, the use
of shackles can be a "thumb [on] death's side of the scale."
Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 532 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (through control of
a defendant's appearance, the State can exert a "powerful
influence on the outcome of the trial").

Given the presence of similarly weighty considerations, we
must conclude that courts cannot routinely place defendants
in shackles or other physical restraints visible to the jury
during the penalty phase of a capital proceeding. The constitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It permits a judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take
account of special circumstances, including security concerns,
that may call for shackling. In so doing, it accommodates
the important need to protect the courtroom and its occupants. But any such determination must be case specific;
that is to say, it should reflect particular concerns, say, special security needs or escape risks, related to the defendant
on trial.

634 DECK v. MISSOURI

Opinion of the Court

IV
Missouri claims that the decision of its high court meetsthe Constitution's requirements in this case. It argues that

the Missouri Supreme Court properly found: (1) that the rec-ord lacks evidence that the jury saw the restraints; (2) that
the trial court acted within its discretion; and, in any event,(3) that the defendant suffered no prejudice. We find these
arguments unconvincing.The first argument is inconsistent with the record in this
case, which makes clear that the jury was aware of theshackles. See App. 58-59 (Deck's attorney stated on the
record that "Mr. Deck [was] shackled in front of the jury"(emphasis added)); id., at 59 (trial court responded that "him
being shackled takes any fear out of their minds"). The ar-gument also overstates the Missouri Supreme Court's holding. The court said: "Trial counsel made no record of theextent of the jury's awareness of the restraints throughout
the penalty phase, and Appellant does not claim that the re-straints impeded him from participating in the proceedings."
136 S. W. 3d, at 485 (emphasis added). This statement doesnot suggest that the jury was unaware of the restraints.
Rather, it refers to the degree of the jury's awareness, andhence to the kinds of prejudice that might have occurred.

The second argument--that the trial court acted withinits discretion--founders on the record's failure to indicate
that the trial judge saw the matter as one calling for discre-tion. The record contains no formal or informal findings.
Cf. supra, at 632 (requiring a case-by-case determination).The judge did not refer to a risk of escape--a risk the State
has raised in this Court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37--or athreat to courtroom security. Rather, he gave as his reason
for imposing the shackles the fact that Deck already "hasbeen convicted." App. 58. While he also said that the
shackles would "tak[e] any fear out of " the juror's "minds,"he nowhere explained any special reason for fear.

Id., at 59.Nor did he explain why, if shackles were necessary, he chose

Thomas, J., dissenting
not to provide for shackles that the jury could not see--ap-parently the arrangement used at trial. If there is an exceptional case where the record itself makes clear that there areindisputably good reasons for shackling, it is not this one.

The third argument fails to take account of this Court'sstatement in Holbrook that shackling is "inherently prejudicial." 475 U. S., at 568. That statement is rooted in ourbelief that the practice will often have negative effects,
but--like "the consequences of compelling a defendant towear prison clothing" or of forcing him to stand trial while
medicated--those effects "cannot be shown from a trial tran-script."

Riggins, supra, at 137. Thus, where a court, with-out adequate justification, orders the defendant to wear

shackles that will be seen by the jury, the defendant neednot demonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due process
violation. The State must prove "beyond a reasonabledoubt that the [shackling] error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman v. California,386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967).

V
For these reasons, the judgment of the Missouri SupremeCourt is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

Carman Deck was convicted of murdering and robbing anelderly couple. He stood before the sentencing jury not as
an innocent man, but as a convicted double murderer androbber. Today this Court holds that Deck's due process
rights were violated when he appeared at sentencing in legirons, handcuffs, and a belly chain. The Court holds that
such restraints may only be used where the use is " `justifiedby an essential state interest' " that is "specific to the defend544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ant on trial," ante, at 624, and that is supported by specificfindings by the trial court. Tradition--either at English

common law or among the States--does not support this con-clusion. To reach its result, the Court resurrects an old rule
the basis for which no longer exists. It then needlessly ex-tends the rule from trials to sentencing. In doing so, the
Court pays only superficial heed to the practice of States andgives conclusive force to errant dicta sprinkled in a trio of
this Court's cases. The Court's holding defies common senseand all but ignores the serious security issues facing our
courts. I therefore respectfully dissent.

Carman Deck and his sister went to the home of Zelmaand James Long on a summer evening in 1996. After waiting for nightfall, Deck and his sister knocked on the door ofthe Longs' home, and when Mrs. Long answered, they asked
for directions. Mrs. Long invited them in, and she andMr. Long assisted them with directions. When Deck moved
toward the door to leave, he drew a pistol, pointed it at theLongs, and ordered them to lie face down on their bed. The
Longs did so, offering up money and valuables throughoutthe house and all the while begging that he not harm them.

After Deck finished robbing their house, he stood at theedge of their bed, deliberating for 10 minutes over whether
to spare them. He ignored their pleas and shot them eachtwice in the head. Deck later told police that he shot the
Longs because he thought that they would be able torecognize him.

Deck was convicted of the murders and robbery of theLongs and sentenced to death. The death sentence was
overturned on appeal. Deck then had another sentencinghearing, at which he appeared in leg irons, a belly chain, and
handcuffs. At the hearing, the jury heard evidence ofDeck's numerous burglary and theft convictions and his assistance in a jailbreak by two prisoners.

Thomas, J., dissenting
On resentencing, the jury unanimously found six aggravat-ing factors: Deck committed the murders while engaged in

the commission of another unlawful homicide; Deck mur-dered each victim for the purpose of pecuniary gain; each
murder involved depravity of mind; each murder was com-mitted for the purpose of avoiding a lawful arrest; each murder was committed while Deck was engaged in a burglary;and each murder was committed while Deck was engaged
in a robbery. The jury recommended, and the trial courtimposed, two death sentences.

Deck sought postconviction relief from his sentence, as-serting, among other things, that his due process and equal
protection rights were violated by the trial court's require-ment that he appear in shackles. The Missouri Supreme
Court rejected that claim. 136 S. W. 3d 481 (2004) (en banc).The court reasoned that "there was a risk that [Deck] might
flee in that he was a repeat offender and evidence from theguilt phase of his trial indicated that he killed his two victims
to avoid being returned to custody," and thus it could notconclude that the trial court had abused its discretion. Id.,

My legal obligation is not to determine the wisdom or thedesirability of shackling defendants, but to decide a purely
legal question: Does the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment preclude the visible shackling of a defendant? Therefore, I examine whether there is a deeplyrooted legal principle that bars that practice. Medina v.
California, 505 U. S. 437, 446 (1992); Apprendi v. New Jer-sey, 530 U. S. 466, 500 (2000) (

Thomas, J., concurring); seealso
Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 102-106 (1999)(
Thomas, J., dissenting). As I explain below, although theEnglish common law had a rule against trying a defendant

in irons, the basis for the rule makes clear that it should notbe extended by rote to modern restraints, which are dissimilar in certain essential respects to the irons that gave rise to

the rule. Despite the existence of a rule at common law,state courts did not even begin to address the use of physical

restraints until the 1870's, and the vast majority of statecourts would not take up this issue until the 20th century,
well after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.Neither the earliest case nor the more modern cases reflect
a consensus that would inform our understanding of the re-quirements of due process. I therefore find this evidence
inconclusive. A

English common law in the 17th and 18th centuries recog-nized a rule against bringing the defendant in irons to the
bar for trial. See, e. g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries onthe Laws of England 317 (1769); 3 Coke, Institutes of

the Laws of England *34 (hereinafter Coke). This rulestemmed from none of the concerns to which the Court
points, ante, at 630-633--the presumption of innocence, the
right to counsel, concerns about decorum, or accuracy in de-cisionmaking. Instead, the rule ensured that a defendant

was not so distracted by physical pain during his trial thathe could not defend himself. As one source states, the rule
prevented prisoners from "any Torture while they ma[de]their defence, be their Crime never so great." J. Kelyng, A
Report of Divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown 10 (1708).1
This concern was understandable, for the irons of that periodwere heavy and painful. In fact, leather strips often lined

the irons to prevent them from rubbing away a defendant's

1 See Coke *34 ("If felons come in judgement to answer, . . . they shall
be out of irons, and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not take
away any manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer, but at their
free will"); Cranburne's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 222 (K. B. 1696) (prisoners
"should stand at their ease when they are tried"); The Conductor Generalis 403 (J. Parker ed. 1801) (reciting same); cf. ibid. ("[t]hat where the law
requires that a prisoner should be kept in salva & arcta custodia, yet that
must be without pain or torment to the prisoner").

skin. T. Gross, Manacles of the World: A Collector's Guide
to International Handcuffs, Leg Irons and other Miscellaneous Shackles and Restraints 25 (1997). Despite Coke's admonition that "[i]t [was] an abuse that prisoners be chained
with irons, or put to any pain before they be attained," Coke
*34, suspected criminals often wore irons during pretrial
confinement, J. Langbein, The Origins of Adversary Criminal
Trial 50, and n. 197 (2003) (hereinafter Langbein). For example, prior to his trial in 1722 for treason, Christopher
Layer spent his confinement in irons. Layer's counsel urged
that his irons be struck off, for they allowed him to "sleep
but in one posture." Trial of Christopher Layer, 16 How.
St. Tr. 94, 98 (K. B. 1722).

The concern that felony defendants not be in severe pain
at trial was acute because, before the 1730's, defendants were
not permitted to have the assistance of counsel at trial, with
an early exception made for those charged with treason.
Langbein 170-172. Instead, the trial was an " `accused
speaks' " trial, at which the accused defended himself. The
accused was compelled to respond to the witnesses, making
him the primary source of information at trial. Id., at 48;
see also Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 823-824 (1975).
As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 626, the rule against
shackling did not extend to arraignment.2 A defendant remained in irons at arraignment because "he [was] only called
upon to plead by advice of his counsel"; he was not on trial,

2 When arraignment and trial occurred on separate occasions, the defendant could be brought to his arraignment in irons. Trial of Christopher Layer, 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 97 (K. B. 1722) (defendant arraigned in
irons); King v. Waite, 1 Leach 28, 36, 168 Eng. Rep. 117, 120 (K. B. 1743)
(fetters could not be removed until the defendant had pleaded); but cf. R.
Burns, Abridgment, or the American Justice 37 (1792) ("The prisoner on
his arraignment . . . must be brought to the bar without irons and all
manner of shackles or bonds, unless there be a danger of escape, and then
he may be brought with irons").

where he would play the main role in defending himself.Trial of Christopher Layer, supra, at 100 (emphasis added).

A modern-day defendant does not spend his pretrial con-finement wearing restraints. The belly chain and handcuffs
are of modest, if not insignificant, weight. Neither they northe leg irons cause pain or suffering, let alone pain or suffering that would interfere with a defendant's ability to assistin his defense at trial. And they need not interfere with a
defendant's ability to assist his counsel--a defendant remainsfree to talk with counsel during trial, and restraints can be
employed so as to ensure that a defendant can write to hiscounsel during the trial. Restraints can also easily be removed when a defendant testifies, so that any concerns abouttestifying can be ameliorated. Modern restraints are therefore unlike those that gave rise to the traditional rule.The Court concedes that modern restraints are nothing
like the restraints of long ago, ante, at 630, and even thatthe rule at common law did not rest on any of the "three
fundamental legal principles" the Court posits to support itsnew rule, ibid. Yet the Court treats old and modern restraints as similar for constitutional purposes merely be-cause they are both types of physical restraints. This logical leap ignores that modern restraints do not violate theprinciple animating the common-law rule. In making this
leap, the Court strays from the appropriate legal inquiry ofexamining common-law traditions to inform our understanding of the Due Process Clause.

B
In the absence of a common-law rule that applies tomodern-day restraints, state practice is also relevant to determining whether a deeply rooted tradition supports theconclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process
Clause limits shackling. See Morales, 527 U. S., at 102-106(

Thomas, J., dissenting). The practice among the States,however, does not support, let alone require, the conclusion

that shackling can be done only where "particular con-cerns . . . related to the defendant on trial" are articulated as

findings in the record. Ante, at 633. First, state practiceis of modern, not longstanding, vintage. The vast majority
of States did not address the issue of physical restraints ondefendants during trial until the 20th century. Second, the
state cases--both the earliest to address shackling and even
the later cases--reflect substantial differences that under-mine the contention that the Due Process Clause so limits

the use of physical restraints. Third, state- and lowerfederal-court cases decided after

Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S.
337 (1970), Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S. 501 (1976), and Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986), are not evidence of
a current consensus about the use of physical restraints.
Such cases are but a reflection of the dicta contained in
Allen, Estelle, and Holbrook.

California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Harrington,42 Cal. 165 (1871), "seems to have been the first case in this

country where this ancient rule of the common law was con-sidered and enforced." State v. Smith, 11 Ore. 205, 208, 8
P. 343 (1883). The practice in the United States is thus ofcontemporary vintage. State practice that was only nascent
in the late 19th century is not evidence of a consistent unbro-ken tradition dating to the common law, as the Court suggests. Ante, at 626-627. The Court does not even attemptto account for the century of virtual silence between the
practice established at English common law and the emer-gence of the rule in the United States. Moreover, the belated and varied state practice is insufficient to warrant theconclusion that shackling of a defendant violates his due
process rights. See Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal.,
Fourth Appellate Dist., 528 U. S. 152, 159 (2000) (where nohistory of a right to appeal much before the 20th century,

no historical support for a right to self-representation onappeal).

2
The earliest state cases reveal courts' divergent views ofvisible shackling, undermining the notion that due process

cabins shackling to cases in which "particular concerns . . .related to the defendant on trial" are supported by findings
on the record. Ante, at 633.The Supreme Court of the New Mexico Territory held that
great deference was to be accorded the trial court's decisionto put the defendant in shackles, permitting a reviewing
court to presume that there had been a basis for doing so ifthe record lay silent. Territory v. Kelly, 2 N. M. 292, 304-

reason whatever" for shackling was the decision to shackle adefendant erroneous. Ibid.; see State v. Allen, 45 W. Va. 65,

2d 77, 82 (1979). The Alabama Supreme Court also left theissue to the trial court's discretion and went so far as to
bar any appeal from the trial court's decision to restrain thedefendant.

Faire v. State, 58 Ala. 74, 80-81 (1877); see Poev. State, 78 Tenn. 673, 677 (1882) (decision to manacle a defendant during trial "left to the sound discretion of the trialcourt" and subject to abuse-of-discretion standard of review).
Mississippi concluded that the decision to shackle a defend-ant "may be safely committed to courts and sheriffs, whose
acts are alike open to review in the courts and at the ballotbox."

6 Lee v. State, 51 Miss. 566, 574 (1875), overruled on

other grounds, Wingo v. State, 62 Miss. 311 (1884).By contrast, California, Missouri, Washington, and Oregon

adopted more restrictive approaches. In People v. Harrington, supra, the California Supreme Court held that shacklinga defendant "without evident necessity" of any kind violated

the common-law rule as well as state law and was prejudicialto the defendant.

Id., at 168-169. A few years later, the
Missouri courts took an even more restrictive view, conclud-ing that the use of shackles or other such restraints was permitted only if warranted by the defendant's conduct "at thetime of the trial."

State v. Kring, 64 Mo. 591, 593 (1877); see
State v. Smith, supra, at 207-208, 8 P., at 343 (following
Kring and Harrington without discussion); State v. Williams, 18 Wash. 47, 50-51, 50 P. 580, 581-582 (1897) (adopting
Kring's test).

6 Pennsylvania first addressed the question of the shackling of a defendant in the context of a grand jury proceeding. It too concluded that
deference was required, finding that the appropriate security for the defendant's transport was best left to the officers guarding him. Commonwealth v. Weber, supra, at 165, 31 A., at 484.

Texas took an intermediate position. The Texas Court ofAppeals relied on Kring, and at the same time deferred to

the decision made by the sheriff to bring the defendant intothe courtroom in shackles. See Rainey v. State, 20 Tex. Ct.
App. 455, 472 (1886); see also Parker v. Territory, 5 Ariz.283, 287-288, 52 P. 361, 363 (1898) (following Harrington but
permitting the shackling of a defendant at arraignmentbased on the crime for which he had been arrested as well
as the reward that had been offered for his recapture).Thus, in the late 19th century States agreed that generally
defendants ought to come to trial unfettered, but they dis-agreed over the breadth of discretion to be afforded trial
courts. A bare majority of States required that trial courtsand even jailers be given great leeway in determining when
a defendant should be restrained; a minority of States se-verely constrained such discretion, in some instances by limiting the information that could be considered; and an evensmaller set of States took an intermediate position. While
the most restrictive view adopted by States is perhaps con-sistent with the rule Deck seeks, the majority view is flatly
inconsistent with requiring a State to show, and for a trialcourt to set forth, findings of an " `essential state interest' "
"specific to the defendant on trial" before shackling a defend-ant. Ante, at 624. In short, there was no consensus that
supports elevating the rule against shackling to a federalconstitutional command.

3
The modern cases provide no more warrant for the Court's
approach than do the earliest cases. The practice in the20th century did not resolve the divisions among States that

emerged in the 19th century. As more States addressed theissue, they continued to express a general preference that
defendants be brought to trial without shackles. They con-tinued, however, to disagree about the latitude to be given
trial courts. Many deferred to the judgment of the trial

The majority permits courts to continue to rely on thesefactors, which are undeniably probative of the need for

shackling, as a basis for shackling a defendant both at trialand at sentencing. Ante, at 629. In accepting these traditional factors, the Court rejects what has been adopted byfew States--that courts may consider only a defendant's conduct at the trial itself or other information demonstratingthat it is a relative certainty that the defendant will engage
in disruptive or threatening conduct at his trial. See Statev.

Coursolle, 255 Minn. 384, 389, 97 N. W. 2d 472, 477 (1959)(defining "immediate necessity" to be demonstrated only by

the defendant's conduct "at the time of the trial"); State v.Finch, 137 Wash. 2d 792, 850, 975 P. 2d 967, 1001 (1999) (en

92 S. W. 869, 872 (1906); but see 136 S. W. 3d, at 485 (casebelow) (appearing to have abandoned this test).

A number of those traditional factors were present in thiscase. Here, Deck killed two people to avoid arrest, a fact to
which he had confessed. Evidence was presented that Deckhad aided prisoners in an escape attempt. Moreover, a jury

15 See, e. g., Frye v. Commonwealth, 231 Va., at 381, 345 S. E. 2d, at 276
(permitting consideration of a "defendant's temperament"); De Wolf v.

and to the defendant himself").

hundred and twenty-five pounds").

had found Deck guilty of two murders, the facts of which not
only make this crime heinous but also demonstrate a propensity for violence. On this record, and with facts found by a
jury, the Court says that it needs more. Since the Court
embraces reliance on the traditional factors supporting the
use of visible restraints, its only basis for reversing is the
requirement of specific on-the-record findings by the trial
judge. This requirement is, however, inconsistent with the
traditional discretion afforded to trial courts and is unsupported by state practice. This additional requirement of
on-the-record findings about that which is obvious from the
record makes little sense to me.

4
In recent years, more of a consensus regarding the use of
shackling has developed, with many courts concluding that
shackling is inherently prejudicial. But rather than being
firmly grounded in deeply rooted principles, that consensus
stems from a series of ill-considered dicta in Illinois v. Allen,
397 U. S. 337 (1970), Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S. 501 (1976),
and Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986).

In Allen, the trial court had removed the defendant from
the courtroom until the court felt he could conform his conduct to basic standards befitting a court proceeding. 397
U. S., at 340-341. This Court held that removing the defendant did not violate his due process right to be present
for his trial. In dicta, the Court suggested alternatives to
removal, such as citing the defendant for contempt or binding and gagging him. Id., at 344. The Court, however, did
express some revulsion at the notion of binding and gagging
a defendant. Ibid. Estelle and Holbrook repeated Allen's
dicta. Estelle, supra, at 505; Holbrook, supra, at 568. The
Court in Holbrook went one step further than it had in
Allen, describing shackling as well as binding and gagging
in dicta as "inherently prejudicial." 475 U. S., at 568.

preting this Court's dicta, not reaching their own independ-ent consensus about the content of the Due Process Clause.

More important, these decisions represent recent practice,which does not determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment, as properly and traditionally interpreted, i. e., as astatement of law, not policy preferences, embodies a right to
be free from visible, painless physical restraints at trial.

III
Wholly apart from the propriety of shackling a defendantat trial, due process does not require that a defendant remain free from visible restraints at the penalty phase of acapital trial. Such a requirement has no basis in tradition
or even modern state practice. Treating shackling at sen-tencing as inherently prejudicial ignores the commonsense
distinction between a defendant who stands accused and adefendant who stands convicted.

A
There is no tradition barring the use of shackles or otherrestraints at sentencing. Even many modern courts have

concluded that the rule against visible shackling does notapply to sentencing. See,

e. g., State v. Young, 853 P. 2d 327,350 (Utah 1993); Duckett v. State, 104 Nev. 6, 11, 752 P. 2d

752, 755 (1988) (per curiam); State v. Franklin, 97 OhioSt. 3d 1, 18-19, 776 N. E. 2d 26, 46-47 (2002); but see Bello
v. State, 547 So. 2d 914, 918 (Fla. 1989) (applying rule againstshackling at sentencing, but suggesting that "lesser showing
of necessity" may be appropriate). These courts have re-jected the suggestion that due process imposes such limits
because they have understood the difference between a man
of judicial proceedings); State v. Wilson, 406 N. W. 2d, at 449, n. 1 (relying
in part on Holbrook to hold that visible shackling is inherently prejudicial,
overruling prior decision that refused to presume prejudice); State v. Madsen, 57 P. 3d 1134, 1136 (Utah App. 2002) (relying on Holbrook for the
proposition that shackling is inherently prejudicial).

accused and a man convicted. See, e. g., Young, supra, at350; Duckett, supra, at 11, 752 P. 2d, at 755.

This same understanding is reflected even in the guilt-innocence phase. In instances in which the jury knows that
the defendant is an inmate, though not yet convicted of thecrime for which he is on trial, courts have frequently held
that the defendant's status as inmate ameliorates any preju-dice that might have flowed from the jury seeing him in
handcuffs.18 The Court's decision shuns such common sense.

B
In the absence of a consensus with regard to the use ofvisible physical restraints even in modern practice, we

should not forsake common sense in determining what dueprocess requires. Capital sentencing jurors know that the
defendant has been convicted of a dangerous crime. It

knew that the prisoner and two witnesses were all inmates, no prejudice

strains credulity to think that they are surprised at the sightof restraints. Here, the jury had already concluded that

there was a need to separate Deck from the community atlarge by convicting him of double murder and robbery.
Deck's jury was surely aware that Deck was jailed; jurorsknow that convicted capital murderers are not left to roam
the streets. It blinks reality to think that seeing a convicted capital murderer in shackles in the courtroom couldimport any prejudice beyond that inevitable knowledge.

Jurors no doubt also understand that it makes sense for acapital defendant to be restrained at sentencing. By sentencing, a defendant's situation is at its most dire. He no
longer may prove himself innocent, and he faces either life
without liberty or death. Confronted with this reality, a defendant no longer has much to lose--should he attempt escape and fail, it is still lengthy imprisonment or death that
awaits him. For any person in these circumstances, the reasons to attempt escape are at their apex. A defendant's best
opportunity to do so is in the courtroom, for he is otherwise
in jail or restraints. See Westman, Handling the Problem
Criminal Defendant in the Courtroom: The Use of Physical
Restraints and Expulsion in the Modern Era, 2 San Diego
Justice J. 507, 526-527 (1994) (hereinafter Westman).

In addition, having been convicted, a defendant may be
angry. He could turn that ire on his own counsel, who has
failed in defending his innocence. See, e. g., State v. Forrest,
168 N. C. App. 614, 626, 609 S. E. 2d 241, 248-249 (2005)
(defendant brutally attacked his counsel at sentencing). Or,
for that matter, he could turn on a witness testifying at his
hearing or the court reporter. See, e. g., People v. Byrnes,
33 N. Y. 2d 343, 350, 308 N. E. 2d 435, 438 (1974) (defendant
lunged at witness during trial); State v. Harkness, 252 Kan.
510, 516, 847 P. 2d 1191, 1197 (1993) (defendant attacked court
reporter at arraignment). Such thoughts could well enter
the mind of any defendant in these circumstances, from the
most dangerous to the most docile. That a defendant now

Thomas, J., dissenting
convicted of his crimes appears before the jury in shacklesthus would be unremarkable to the jury. To presume that

such a defendant suffers prejudice by appearing in handcuffsat sentencing does not comport with reality.

IV
The modern rationales proffered by the Court for itsnewly minted rule likewise fail to warrant the conclusion

that due process precludes shackling at sentencing. More-over, though the Court purports to be mindful of the tragedy
that can take place in a courtroom, the stringent rule itadopts leaves no real room for ensuring the safety of the
courtroom. A

Although the Court offers the presumption of innocence asa rationale for the modern rule against shackling at trial, it
concedes the presumption has no application at sentencing.
Ante, at 632. The Court is forced to turn to the far moreamorphous need for "accuracy" in sentencing. Ibid. It is

true that this Court's cases demand reliability in the fact-finding that precedes the imposition of a sentence of death.
Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 732 (1998). But shack-les may undermine the factfinding process only if seeing a
convicted murderer in them is prejudicial. As I haveexplained, this farfetched conjecture defies the reality of
sentencing.The Court baldly asserts that visible physical restraints
could interfere with a defendant's ability to participate in hisdefense.

Ante, at 631. I certainly agree that shackleswould be impermissible if they were to seriously impair a

defendant's ability to assist in his defense, Riggins v. Ne-vada, 504 U. S. 127, 154, n. 4 (1992) (

Thomas, J., dissenting),but there is no evidence that shackles do so. Deck does not

argue that the shackles caused him pain or impaired his men-tal faculties. Nor does he argue that the shackles prevented
him from communicating with his counsel during trial.

544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

655Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)
Thomas, J., dissenting
Counsel sat next to him; he remained fully capable of speak-ing with counsel. Likewise, Deck does not claim that he was

unable to write down any information he wished to conveyto counsel during the course of the trial. Had the shackles
impaired him in that way, Deck could have sought to have atleast one of his hands free to make it easier for him to write.
Courts have permitted such arrangements. See, e. g., People v. Alvarez, 14 Cal. 4th 155, 191, 926 P. 2d 365, 386 (1996);
State v. Jimerson, 820 S. W. 2d 500, 502 (Mo. App. 1991).

The Court further expresses concern that physical re-straints might keep a defendant from taking the stand on his

own behalf in seeking the jury's mercy. Ante, at 631. But
this concern is, again, entirely hypothetical. Deck makes no
claim that, but for the physical restraints, he would have
taken the witness stand to plead for his life. And under the
rule the Court adopts, Deck and others like him need make
no such assertion, for prejudice is presumed absent a showing by the government to the contrary. Even assuming this
concern is real rather than imagined, it could be ameliorated
by removing the restraints if the defendant wishes to take
the stand. See, e. g., De Wolf v. State, 96 Okla. Cr. 382, 383,
256 P. 2d 191, 193 (App. 1953) (leg irons removed from defendant in capital case when he took the witness stand). Instead, the Court says, the concern requires a categorical rule
that the use of visible physical restraints violates the Due
Process Clause absent a demanding showing. The Court's
solution is overinclusive.

The Court also asserts the rule it adopts is necessary to
protect courtroom decorum, which the use of shackles would
offend. Ante, at 631-632. This courtroom decorum rationale misunderstands this Court's precedent. No decision of
this Court has ever intimated, let alone held, that the protection of the "courtroom's formal dignity," ante, at 631, is an
individual right enforceable by criminal defendants. Certainly, courts have always had the inherent power to ensure
that both those who appear before them and those who ob544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
656 DECK v. MISSOURI

Thomas, J., dissenting
serve their proceedings conduct themselves appropriately.See,

e. g., Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 540-541 (1965).
The power of the courts to maintain order, however, is nota right personal to the defendant, much less one of constitutional proportions. Far from viewing the need for decorumas a right the defendant can invoke, this Court has relied
on it to limit the conduct of defendants, even when their
constitutional rights are implicated. This is why a defend-ant who proves himself incapable of abiding by the most

basic rules of the court is not entitled to defend himself, Faretta v. California, 422 U. S., at 834-835, n. 46, or to remain
in the courtroom, see Allen, 397 U. S., at 343. The concern
for courtroom decorum is not a concern about defendants, let
alone their right to due process. It is a concern about society's need for courts to operate effectively.

Wholly apart from the unwarranted status the Court accords "courtroom decorum," the Court fails to explain the
affront to the dignity of the courts that the sight of physical
restraints poses. I cannot understand the indignity in having a convicted double murderer and robber appear before
the court in visible physical restraints. Our Nation's judges
and juries are exposed to accounts of heinous acts daily, like
the brutal murders Deck committed in this case. Even outside the courtroom, prisoners walk through courthouse halls
wearing visible restraints. Courthouses are thus places in
which members of the judiciary and the public come into frequent contact with defendants in restraints. Yet, the Court
says, the appearance of a convicted criminal in a belly chain
and handcuffs at a sentencing hearing offends the sensibilities of our courts. The courts of this Nation do not have
such delicate constitutions.

Finally, the Court claims that "[t]he appearance of the offender during the penalty phase in shackles . . . almost inevitably implies to a jury, as a matter of common sense, that
court authorities consider the offender a danger to the community--often a statutory aggravator and nearly always a

Thomas, J., dissenting
relevant factor in jury decisionmaking." Ante, at 633. Thisargument is flawed. It ignores the fact that only relatively

recently have the penalty and guilt phases been conductedseparately. That the historical evidence reveals no consensus prohibiting visible modern-day shackles during capitaltrials suggests that there is similarly no consensus prohibiting shackling during capital sentencing. Moreover, con-cerns about a defendant's dangerousness exist at the guilt
phase just as they exist at the penalty phase--jurors willsurely be more likely to convict a seemingly violent defendant of murder than a seemingly placid one. If neither com-mon law nor modern state cases support the Court's position
with respect to the guilt phase, I see no reason why the factthat a defendant may be perceived as a future danger would
support the Court's position with respect to the penaltyphase.

B
The Court expresses concern for courtroom security, butits concern rings hollow in light of the rule it adopts. The

need for security is real. Judges face the possibility that adefendant or his confederates might smuggle a weapon into
court and harm those present, or attack with his bare hands.For example, in 1999, in Berks County, Pennsylvania, a "defendant forced his way to the bench and beat the judge un-conscious." Calhoun, Violence Toward Judicial Officials, 576
Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sci-ence 54, 61 (2001). One study of Pennsylvania judges projected that over a 20-year career, district justices had a 31percent probability of being physically assaulted one or more
times. See Harris, Kirschner, Rozek, & Weiner, Violence inthe Judicial Workplace: One State's Experience, 576 Annals
of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 38,42 (2001). Judges are not the only ones who face the risk
of violence. Sheriffs and courtroom bailiffs face the secondhighest rate of homicide in the workplace, a rate which is 15
times higher than the national average. Faust & Raffo,

91, 93-94 (2001); Weiner et al., Safe and Secure: Protecting
Judicial Officials, 36 Court Review 26, 27 (Winter 2000).

The problem of security may only be worsening. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), the nature of
the prisoners in the federal system has changed: "[T]here
are more ` hard-core tough guys' and more multipledefendant cases," making the work of the federal marshals
increasingly difficult. GAO, Federal Judicial Security: Comprehensive Risk-Based Program Should Be Fully Implemented 21 (July 1994). Security issues are particularly
acute in state systems, in which limited manpower and resources often leave judges to act as their own security. See
Harris, supra, at 46. Those resources further vary between
rural and urban areas, with many rural areas able to supply
only minimal security. Security may even be at its weakest
in the courtroom itself, for there the defendant is the least
restrained. Westman 526.

In the face of this real danger to courtroom officials and
bystanders, the Court limits the use of visible physical restraints to circumstances "specific to a particular trial," ante,
at 629, i. e., "particular concerns . . . related to the defendant on trial," ante, at 633. Confining the analysis to trialspecific circumstances precludes consideration of limits on
the security resources of courts. Under that test, the particulars of a given courthouse (being nonspecific to any particular defendant) are irrelevant, even if the judge himself is
the only security, or if a courthouse has few on-duty officers
standing guard at any given time, or multiple exits. Forbidding courts from considering such circumstances fails to accommodate the unfortunately dire security situation faced by
this Nation's courts.

INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 04-5928. Argued March 28, 2005--Decided May 23, 2005
Petitioner Mexican national sought federal habeas review of his state capital murder conviction, claiming that Texas had not notified him of his
right to consular access as required by the Vienna Convention. The
District Court denied relief. In declining to grant petitioner a certificate of appealibility, the Fifth Circuit gave no effect to an intervening
International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that United States courts
must reconsider petitioner's Vienna Convention claim. After this
Court granted certiorari, President George W. Bush issued a memorandum stating that the United States would discharge its international
obligations under the ICJ judgment by "having State courts give effect
to" it. Relying on this memorandum and the ICJ judgment, petitioner
filed a state habeas application shortly before oral argument here.

Held: The writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted. The

state proceeding may give petitioner the review and reconsideration of
his Vienna Convention claim that he now seeks in this proceeding. In
addition, merits briefing in this case has revealed several threshold issues that could independently preclude federal habeas relief.

courts must reconsider petitioner Jose' Medelli'n's claim forrelief under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,

Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S.No. 6820, without regard to procedural default doctrines; and
second, whether a federal court should give effect, as amatter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation,
to the ICJ's judgment. 543 U. S. 1032 (2004). After we
granted certiorari, Medelli'n filed an application for a writ ofhabeas corpus in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in part upon a memorandum from President George W.Bush that was issued after we granted certiorari. This
state-court proceeding may provide Medelli'n with the very
reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that he now
seeks in the present proceeding. The merits briefing in this
case also has revealed a number of hurdles Medelli'n must
surmount before qualifying for federal habeas relief in this
proceeding, based on the resolution of the questions he has
presented here. For these reasons we dismiss the writ as
improvidently granted. See Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown,
511 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1994) (per curiam); The Monrosa v.
Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U. S. 180, 183-184 (1959);
Goins v. United States, 306 U. S. 622 (1939).

Medelli'n, a Mexican national, confessed to participating in
the gang rape and murder of two girls in 1993. He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal. Medelli'n then filed a
state habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time that
Texas failed to notify him of his right to consular access as
required by the Vienna Convention. The state trial court
rejected this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
summarily affirmed.

Medelli'n then filed this federal habeas corpus petition,
again raising the Vienna Convention claim. The District
Court denied the petition. Subsequently, while Medelli'n's
application to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for
a certificate of appealability was pending, see 28 U. S. C.

$ 2253(c), the ICJ issued its decision in Case Concerning
Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004
I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the Republicof Mexico had alleged violations of the Vienna Convention

with respect to Medelli'n and other Mexican nationals facingthe death penalty in the United States. The ICJ determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed individually
enforceable rights, that the United States had violated thoserights, and that the United States must "provide, by means

of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convic-tions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals" to
determine whether the violations "caused actual prejudice,"
without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.
Id., |||| 121-122, 153(a).

The Court of Appeals denied Medelli'n's application for a
certificate of appealability. It did so based on Medelli'n's
procedural default, see Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 375
(1998) (per curiam), and its prior holdings that the Vienna
Convention did not create an individually enforceable right,
see, e. g., United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243 F. 3d 192, 195
(CA5 2001). 371 F. 3d 270 (CA5 2004). While acknowledging the existence of the ICJ's Avena judgment, the court
gave no dispositive effect to that judgment.

More than two months after we granted certiorari, and a
month before oral argument in this case, President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United States would
discharge its international obligations under the Avena judgment by "having State courts give effect to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases
filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that decision."
George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General
(Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 9a. Relying on this memorandum and the Avena
judgment as separate bases for relief that were not available
at the time of his first state habeas corpus action, Medelli'n
filed a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus

Per Curiam
just four days before oral argument here. That state pro-ceeding may provide Medelli'n with the review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ re-quired, and that Medelli'n now seeks in this proceeding.
This new development, as well as the factors discussedbelow, leads us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.1

There are several threshold issues that could independ-ently preclude federal habeas relief for Medelli'n, and thus

render advisory or academic our consideration of the ques-tions presented. These issues are not free from doubt.

First, even accepting, arguendo, the ICJ's construction ofthe Vienna Convention's consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be cognizable in a federalhabeas proceeding. In

Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339 (1994),
this Court recognized that a violation of federal statutoryrights ranked among the "nonconstitutional lapses we have

held not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding" unless
they meet the "fundamental defect" test announced in our
decision in Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962).
512 U. S., at 349 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 355-356
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
In order for Medelli'n to obtain federal habeas relief, Medelli'n
must therefore establish that Reed does not bar his treaty
claim.

Second, with respect to any claim the state court "adjudicated on the merits," habeas relief in federal court is available only if such adjudication "was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as

1 Of course Medelli'n, or the State of Texas, can seek certiorari in this
Court from the Texas courts' disposition of the state habeas corpus application. In that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an opportunity to review the Texas courts' treatment of the President's memorandum and Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.
U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), unencumbered by the
issues that arise from the procedural posture of this action.

determined by the Supreme Court." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1);see

Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 22-27 (2002) (per curiam). The state habeas court, which disposed of the casebefore the ICJ rendered its judgment in

Avena, arguably
"adjudicated on the merits" three claims. It found that theVienna Convention did not create individual, judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural default rules
barred Medelli'n's consular access claim. Finally, and per-haps most importantly, the state trial court found that Medelli'n "fail[ed] to show that he was harmed by any lack ofnotification to the Mexican consulate concerning his arrest
for capital murder; [Medelli'n] was provided with effectivelegal representation upon [his] request; and [his] constitutional rights were safeguarded." App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.2Medelli'n would have to overcome the deferential standard
with regard to all of these findings before obtaining federalhabeas relief on his Vienna Convention claim.

3

Third, a habeas corpus petitioner generally cannot enforce
a "new rule" of law. Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).

2 The Federal District Court reviewing that finding observed:
"Medelli'n's allegations of prejudice are speculative. The police officers
informed Medelli'n of his right to legal representation before he confessed
to involvement in the murders. Medelli'n waived his right to advisement
by an attorney. Medelli'n does not challenge the voluntary nature of his
confession. There is no indication that, if informed of his consular rights,
Medelli'n would not have waived those rights as he did his right to counsel.
Medelli'n fails to establish a `causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation and [his] statements.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-85a
(brackets in original).

3 In Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam), we addressed

the claim that Virginia failed to notify a Paraguayan national of his Vienna
Convention right to consular access. In denying various writs, motions,
and stay applications, we noted that the Vienna Convention "arguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest";
that Virginia's procedural default doctrine applied to the Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful Vienna Convention claimant likely must
demonstrate prejudice. Id., at 375-377. At the time of our Breard decision, however, we confronted no final ICJ adjudication.

666 MEDELLIN v. DRETKE

Per Curiam
Before relief could be granted, then, we would be obliged todecide whether or how the Avena judgment bears on our

ordinary "new rule" jurisprudence.Fourth, Medelli'n requires a certificate of appealability in
order to pursue the merits of his claim on appeal. 28U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(1). A certificate of appealability may be
granted only where there is "a substantial showing of thedenial of a

constitutional right." $ 2253(c)(2) (emphasisadded). To obtain the necessary certificate of appealability

to proceed in the Court of Appeals, Medelli'n must demon-strate that his allegation of a treaty violation could satisfy
this standard. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483(2000).

Fifth, Medelli'n can seek federal habeas relief only onclaims that have been exhausted in state court. See 28
U. S. C. $$ 2254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3). To gain relief based on thePresident's memorandum or ICJ judgments, Medelli'n would
have to show that he exhausted all available state-courtremedies.

4

In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medelli'n with the review he seeks pursuant to the
Avena judgment and the President's memorandum, and the
potential for review in this Court once the Texas courts haveheard and decided Medelli'n's pending action, we think it

would be unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hin4 On March 8, 2005, Medelli'n filed a successive state habeas action based
on Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, $ 5(a)(1) (Vernon 2005), claiming that both the President's memorandum and the Avena judgment independently require the Texas court to grant review and reconsideration of
his Vienna Convention claim. See Subsequent Application for PostConviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte Medelli'n, Trial Cause Nos.

granted.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Scalia joins as
to Part II, concurring.

Petitioner Jose' Medelli'n, a Mexican national, was arrested,
detained, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in Texas
without being informed of rights accorded him under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970]
21 U. S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The Convention
called for prompt notice of Medelli'n's arrest to the Mexican consul. Medelli'n could then seek consular advice and
assistance.

After unsuccessful challenges to his conviction and sentence, first in state court, later in federal court, Medelli'n
sought this Court's review. His petition for certiorari,
which this Court granted, rests primarily on a judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March
31, 2004: Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Avena). Medelli'n's petition also draws support from an ICJ judgment of
the same order earlier rendered against the United States:
LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment
of June 27) (LaGrand). The ICJ held in Avena that the
failure to accord Vienna Convention rights to Medelli'n and
other similarly situated Mexican nationals necessitated review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences
by United States courts. Further, the ICJ specified, procedural default doctrines could not be invoked to bar the required review and reconsideration. Medelli'n sought certiorari on two questions: (1) Are courts in the United States
bound by the Avena judgment; (2) Should courts in the
United States give effect to the Avena and LaGrand judg544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

On February 28, 2005, President Bush announced:

"[T]he United States will discharge its international ob-ligations under the decision of the International Court

of Justice in [Avena], by having State courts give effectto the decision in accordance with general principles of
comity." Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb.28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as

Medelli'n thereupon moved to stay further proceedings inthis Court pending his pursuit of remedies in Texas court,
as contemplated by the President's Memorandum. I wouldgrant Medelli'n's stay motion as the most conservative among
courses the Court might take. That "least change" meas-ure, however, has not garnered majority support.

this action," ante, at 664, n. 1. The former course wouldinvite the Fifth Circuit to conduct proceedings rival to those
recently launched in state court, or to put the case on hold,a cautionary measure this Court itself is unwilling to take.
The latter would leave nothing pending here, but would en-able this Court ultimately to resolve, clearly and cleanly, the

II
For the reasons stated below, I join the Court's electionto dismiss the writ as improvidently granted in light of the

President's Memorandum and the state-court proceeding in-stituted in accordance with that Memorandum. I do so recognizing that this Court would have jurisdiction to reviewthe final judgment in the Texas proceedings, and at that
time, to rule definitively on "the Nation's obligation underthe judgment of the ICJ if that should prove necessary."

Circuit leaving unresolved a bewildering array of questions.See

contentious preliminary issues clog final determination ofMedelli'n's claim for federal habeas relief based on the ICJ's
judgments, action by the Texas courts could render the en-tire array of questions moot. See

post, at 692 (Souter, J.,

occasion to proceed under the federal habeas petition.").Further, at odds with the President's determination to

"give effect to the [Avena] decision in accordance with gen-eral principles of comity," President's Memorandum, and in
conspicuous conflict with the law of judgments, see Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws $ 98 (1988); Restatement

(1986); Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 17 (1980), the

Enforcement of Foreign Judgments: Analysis and Proposed
Federal Statute $ 2, Comment d, p. 38 (2005) ("[A] judgment

instructions to the Court of Appeals on which of the severalquestions the dissenters would remit to that court comes
first, which others "should be part of " the COA determina-tion,

post, at 682 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), and which aremeet for adjudication only if, as, or when a COA is granted.

The participation of a federal court in the fray at this point,moreover, risks disturbance of, or collision with, the proceeding Medelli'n has commenced in Texas. The principal dis-sent appears ultimately to acknowledge that concern by observing that the Fifth Circuit might "hold the case on itsdocket until Medelli'n's successive petition was resolved in
state court." Post, at 690 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); see also

2 The principal dissent maintains that the second question on which we
granted certiorari asks "whether and what weight [short of binding effect]
American courts should give to Avena," in the course of independently
interpreting the treaty, "perhaps for sake of uniform treaty interpretation." Post, at 684 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); see post, at 684-685, and
n. 2 (same). Significantly, Medelli'n chose not to break out for discrete
review in this Court questions underlying and subsumed in the ICJ's judgments in Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), and LaGrand,
2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27), i. e., whether the Vienna Convention "creates a judicially enforceable individual right" and whether it
"sometimes requires state procedural default rules to be set aside so that
the treaty can be given `full effect,' " post, at 673 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Nor does Medelli'n's invocation of "international comity," Brief for
Petitioner 45, or his plea for "uniform treaty interpretation," id., at 48,
seek this Court's independent interpretation of the Convention. Instead,
he urges that comity is accorded, and uniformity achieved, by recognizing
as authoritative the ICJ's interpretation as elaborated in successive judgments against the United States. See id., at 49 ("Given its consent to
the ICJ's jurisdiction, the United States should treat as authoritative any
interpretation or application of the Convention by that court."); see also
Reply Brief 16 (observing that the United States "agreed that the ICJ
would have final authority to resolve disputes over the treaty's interpretation and application" (emphasis added)).

post, at 692 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 694 (Breyer,J., dissenting). But given this Court's unwillingness to put

the case on hold here, one might ask what justifies parkingthe case, instead, in the Court of Appeals.

The per curiam opinion which I join rests on two comple-mentary grounds. First, the Texas proceeding "may provide Medelli'n with the very reconsideration of his Vienna
Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceed-ing."

Ante, at 662. Second, the instant proceeding comes
to us freighted with formidable threshold issues, ante, at664-666, that deter definitive answers to the questions presented in the petition for certiorari.Petitioner's recent filing in the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals raises two discrete bases for relief that were not
previously available for presentation to a state forum: the
ICJ's Avena judgment and the President's Memorandum.
See Subsequent Application for Post-Conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte Medelli'n, Trial Cause Nos. 67,5429
and 67,5430 (Tex. Crim. App.), p. 13 (filed Mar. 24, 2005)
("President Bush's determination and the Avena Judgment
constitute two separate sources of binding federal law.").
The Texas courts are now positioned immediately to adjudicate these cleanly presented issues in the first instance. In
turn, it will be this Court's responsibility, at the proper time
and if need be, to provide the ultimate answers.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Jose' Ernesto Medelli'n offered proof to the Court of Appeals that reasonable jurists would find debatable or wrong
the District Court's disposition of his claim that Texas violated his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations and that he is thereby entitled to review and reconsideration of his conviction and sentence. Three specific
issues deserve further consideration: (1) whether the International Court of Justice's judgment in Medelli'n's favor, Case

Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), is binding

on American courts; (2) whether Article 36(1)(b) of the Con-vention creates a judicially enforceable individual right; and
(3) whether Article 36(2) of the Convention sometimes re-quires state procedural default rules to be set aside so that
the treaty can be given "full effect." Accordingly, I wouldvacate the denial of a certificate of appealability and remand
for resolution of these issues.The Court dismisses the writ (and terminates federal proceedings) on the basis of speculation: Medelli'n might obtainrelief in new state court proceedings--because of the President's recent memorandum about whose constitutionality theCourt remains rightfully agnostic, or he

might be unable tosecure ultimate relief in federal court--because of questions

about whose resolution the Court is likewise, rightfully, un-decided. These tentative predictions are not, in my view,
reason enough to avoid questions that are as compelling nowas they were when we granted a writ of certiorari, and that
remain properly before this Court. It seems to me unsoundto avoid questions of national importance when they are
bound to recur. I respectfully dissent.

scid=31. In Avena, the ICJ determined that the UnitedStates had breached its obligation to inform 51 Mexican nationals, all sentenced to death in this country, of their rightto consular notification. Medelli'n is just one of them. 2004
I. C. J. No. 128, || 106. His case thus presents, and the Courtin turn avoids, questions that will inevitably recur.

Jose' Ernesto Medelli'n told the officers who arrested himin Texas that he was born in Laredo, Mexico. App. JA15.
He also told the Harris County Pretrial Services that he isnot an American citizen. App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a.
Nonetheless, Medelli'n was arrested, detained, tried, con-victed, and sentenced to death without ever being informed
that he could contact the Mexican consul. Mexican consularauthorities only became aware of Medelli'n's predicament
some six weeks after his conviction was affirmed, when hewrote them a letter from Texas' death row. Since coming
into contact with his consul, Medelli'n has maintained thatTexas authorities violated his rights under the Convention
and has sought (among other relief) an evidentiary hearingto determine whether he was prejudiced by the violation.

First, Medelli'n filed a state application for a writ of habeascorpus. The Texas trial court denied relief, reasoning in relevant part:

"13. Based on the applicant's lack of objection at trialto the alleged failure to inform him of his rights under

the Vienna Convention, the applicant is procedurallybarred from presenting his habeas claim that the alleged
violation of the Vienna Convention violated his constitu-tional rights.

"15. In the alternative, the applicant, as a private in-dividual, lacks standing to enforce the provisions of the

as contracts among nations; thus, offended nation, notindividual, must seek redress for violation of sovereign

interests)." Id., at 55a-56a.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.Medelli'n next petitioned for habeas relief in the United

States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.While that petition was pending, the ICJ announced its interpretation of Article 36 in a case that Germany hadbrought against the United States after Arizona failed to
advise two German capital defendants about consular notifi-cation.

LaGrand, supra. Consistent with Medelli'n's ownarguments about the Convention's meaning, the ICJ decided

in LaGrand that the treaty confers individual rights and re-quires that state procedural default rules sometimes give
way when foreign national defendants raise Vienna Conven-tion claims. See

id., at 490-491, 497-498. Medelli'n arguedto the District Court that the ICJ's interpretation of Article

36 was definitive, persuasive, and should control the resolu-tion of his claim. Rejecting these and other arguments, the
District Court denied relief.Medelli'n then sought to obtain a certificate of appealability
(COA) from the United States Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c). A COA may issue only if
the applicant has demonstrated that "reasonable juristscould debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the
petition should have been resolved in a different manner [inthe district court] or that the issues presented were ` "adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further." ' "
Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000) (quoting Bare-foot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 893, n. 4 (1983)).

Meanwhile, Mexico had initiated proceedings in the ICJagainst the United States on grounds that 54 Mexican capital
defendants, including Medelli'n, had been denied their ViennaConvention rights. See Avena, supra. The ICJ's decision
in Avena issued while Medelli'n's application for a COA waspending. Repeating the construction it had given to Article

O'Connor, J., dissenting
36 in LaGrand, the ICJ decided that Medelli'n and 50 otherswere entitled to review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences because the United States, through vari-ous individual States, had violated their Vienna Convention
rights. Avena, supra, || 153. The Court of Appeals notedthe ICJ's pronouncements in LaGrand and Avena, and nonetheless concluded that Medelli'n's treaty claim lacked the req-uisite merit for a COA.

We granted certiorari on two questions. First, does
Avena have preclusive effect in our courts? Second, if ourcourts are not bound to apply Avena as a rule of decision,

must they give the ICJ's decision effect for sake of uniformtreaty interpretation or comity? These questions refer to
substantial, debatable issues in Medelli'n's Vienna Conven-tion claim. I would therefore vacate the denial of a COA
and remand for further proceedings.

II

A

At every step, the federal courts must evaluate Medelli'n'sVienna Convention claim through the framework of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),which controls the process by which a state prisoner may
obtain federal habeas relief. And wherever the Convention,which has been in continuous force since 1969, conflicts with
this subsequently enacted statute, the statute must govern.
Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion); seealso Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194 (1888).

At the outset, Texas and the United States argue thatAEDPA, 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c), precludes ruling for Medelli'n
no matter how meritorious his Vienna Convention claim maybe. According to $ 2253(c)(2), a COA may issue "only if the
applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of aconstitutional right." Texas maintains that prisoners may
only appeal district courts' adverse decisions involving con-stitutional rights--that Congress did not use the word "con544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
stitutional" in the statute as shorthand for all of the federalclaims traditionally heard in habeas. But see 1 R. Hertz &

J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure448-449 (4th ed. 2001). See also

Slack, supra, at 483 (noting
Congress' substitution of " `constitutional' " for " `federal' " inthe standard for obtaining a certificate of probable cause--

the COA's predecessor--without saying if the change is
meaningful).Texas concedes that it raised this objection for the first

time in its merits brief to this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.Normally this Court will not decide a question raised at this
stage. See Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 645-
646 (1992). But Texas contends that this is a nonwaivable
jurisdictional objection. So we must start with the question
of whether it actually is an objection that cannot be waived.
It is true that the COA is jurisdictional in the sense that it
is a "gateway" device. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322,
337 (2003). By obliging applicants to make a threshold
showing before their cases are aired out on appeal, the COA
serves an important screening function and conserves the
resources of appellate courts. To that end, the existence of
a COA is jurisdictional insofar as a prisoner cannot appeal
in habeas without one. See id., at 335-336. Accordingly, a
federal court must verify that a COA has issued before hearing the merits of a habeas appeal.

It does not follow, however, that courts must raise and
decide predicate arguments about the validity of a COA independently, without prompting from the parties, even when
ordinary waiver rules would apply, as they must with true
jurisdictional arguments. If that were so, an appellate
court, presiding over an appeal after the district court had
issued a COA, would always be required to check that a
"substantial showing" had been made and a cognizable right
asserted--even in the absence of controversy between the
parties. We have never imposed such a rule, and it would
undermine the efficiency of the COA process. Cf. Young v.

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

679Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 799 (CA7 1997). Predicate con-siderations for a COA--whether a "substantial showing" has

been made or a "constitutional right" asserted--are not thesorts of considerations that remain open for review throughout the entire case. Compare Peguero v. United States, 526U. S. 23 (1999) (considering whether a violation of Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2) provided a basis for collateral relief), with Brief for United States in Peguero v.
United States, O. T. 1998, No. 97-9217, p. 6, n. 5 (arguing that

$ 2253(c) deprived the Court of jurisdiction because a consti-tutional right was not at stake). Thus, because Texas did

not argue below that a treaty-based claim cannot support an
application for a COA, it cannot raise the argument now.

Texas also adverts to another AEDPA provision, 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d), which it says is fatal to Medelli'n's treaty
claim. The statute provides that a writ of habeas corpus
shall not issue on behalf of a person in state custody with
respect to any claim "adjudicated on the merits in State
court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--(1)
resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."
Whether Medelli'n's claim clears these hurdles is an appropriate consideration for an appellate court contemplating
whether to grant a COA, and for this Court reviewing the
denial of a COA. See Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 349-350
(Scalia, J., concurring) ("A circuit justice or judge must
deny a COA . . . if all reasonable jurists would conclude that
a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars
relief "); see also id., at 336 (majority opinion).

The Texas court's disposition of Medelli'n's Vienna Convention claim is not entitled to deference under $ 2254(d), and
thus should not constrain a final decision in federal court
about whether he deserves habeas relief. The Texas court
gave two reasons for dismissing the claim. First, it applied
its procedural default rule to Medelli'n's assertion of right

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
680 MEDELLIN v. DRETKE

O'Connor, J., dissenting
under the Vienna Convention. See supra, at 675. In sodoing, it did not adjudicate the merits of the relevant federal

question--whether, under Article 36(2), the treaty overridesstate procedural default rules. Second, the Texas court appears to have reasoned that private individuals (as opposedto offended nations) can never enforce any treaty in court.
See supra, at 675-676. This reasoning is "contrary to" ourprecedents and, therefore, is not entitled to deference in subsequent federal proceedings. "A state-court decision willcertainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if
the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governinglaw set forth in our cases."

Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.362, 405 (2000); see also Brown v. Payton, ante, at 141. The

Texas court's blanket rule plainly contradicts our governinglaw, for it is axiomatic that, while treaties are compacts between nations, "a treaty may also contain provisions whichconfer certain rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of
the nations residing in the territorial limits of the other,which partake of the nature of municipal law, and which are
capable of enforcement as between private parties in thecourts of the country."

Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580,598 (1884). The Texas court neither asked nor answered the

right question: whether an individual can bring a claim underthis particular treaty. Accordingly, any consideration of
Medelli'n's Vienna Convention claim for habeas relief in fed-eral court--including his assertion that Avena provides a
binding rule of decision--must proceed de novo. See Wil-liams, supra, at 406.

B
The Court catalogs a number of other, nonjurisdictionalquestions that, in its view, justify dismissing the case because they could preclude ultimate habeas relief for Medelli'n.
Ante, at 664-666. Apparently the Court agrees that itwould be impossible or imprudent to decide these questions

today. It seems odd to me to leave them undecided and yetto rely on them as reason to avoid the weighty questions that

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

681Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
are undeniably properly before us. Given the posture ofthis case, our modest task is to decide only whether Medelli'n

has presented claims worthy of a COA, and the majoritypoints to issues outside the scope of that inquiry. Anyway,
it is not our practice generally, when remanding a case to thelower courts after resolving discrete questions, to canvass
all of the possible permutations of what could happen before
a final resolution. Thus, while the Court points to questionsthat are, of course, important, none ought to detain us here.

First, Texas and the United States have made no mentionof

Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339 (1994), and Hill v. United
States, 368 U. S. 424 (1962), depriving Medelli'n of an opportunity to discuss their applicability to his case--a complicated
question. Second, while Texas did argue in its certiorari
papers that Medelli'n had already received a prejudice analysis in state habeas, see Brief in Opposition 14-16, it abandoned this argument in its brief on the merits. See United
States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S.
843, 855, n. 3 (1996) (the Court does not address abandoned
arguments). Here, Texas argues that Medelli'n cannot show
prejudice in a future proceeding, not that he has already
failed to show prejudice or that the state court thought (not
unreasonably) that the Vienna Convention had been satisfied
by its prejudice analysis. See Brief for Respondent 16-17.
Moreover, Medelli'n has maintained an unfulfilled request for
an evidentiary hearing about prejudice. The ICJ, for its
part, appears to believe that Medelli'n has yet to receive the
prejudice analysis that the Vienna Convention requires; otherwise, it would not have ruled--after the state habeas proceedings had concluded--that the United States must still
provide "review and reconsideration" of his sentence to determine if he suffered "actual prejudice." Avena, 2004
I. C. J. No. 128, |||| 121-122, 153. Third, the Court is correct
to observe that, before obtaining relief, Medelli'n would have
to contend with Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). The
Court of Appeals never discussed Teague's applicability to

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
682 MEDELLIN v. DRETKE

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Medelli'n's case. Whether Teague bars relief for Medelli'n isitself a highly debatable question that should be part of a

proper COA analysis upon remand.

III
"While a COA ruling is not the occasion for a ruling onthe merit of petitioner's claim,"

Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 331,some assessment of Medelli'n's arguments is necessary to explain why the COA's denial should be vacated.

A
The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention providesthat "[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory juris-diction of the International Court of Justice." Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes,Apr. 24, 1963, Art. I, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 326, T. I. A. S. No. 6820
(hereinafter Optional Protocol). The United States wasparty to the Optional Protocol until recently. See Letter
from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, to Kofi A. Annan,Secretary-General of the United Nations (Mar. 7, 2005) (notifying the Secretary-General that the United States herebywithdraws from the Optional Protocol). And the ICJ decided LaGrand and Avena pursuant to the Optional Proto-col's grant of authority. The first question on which we
granted certiorari asks whether American courts are nowbound to follow the ICJ's decision in

Avena when decidingVienna Convention claims.
1

1 The Court suggests that Medelli'n's reliance on Avena may be a distinct
claim, and that he may not have properly exhausted it in state court.
Ante, at 666. But Medelli'n has maintained a single claim throughout the
state and federal habeas proceedings--that Texas violated his rights
under the Vienna Convention and that he is entitled to a remedy for that
violation. Pointing to Avena as a rule of decision for the adjudication of
that claim is akin to pointing to a new decision from this Court to bolster

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

683Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
If Medelli'n is right to say that they must, then the DistrictCourt's resolution of his Vienna Convention claim is not

merely debatable, but wrong in result and in reasoning. Interms of result, the ICJ made clear that it would be improper
to dismiss Medelli'n's claim, for once the United States hadcommitted "internationally wrongful acts," the necessary
"remedy to make good these violations should consist in anobligation on the United States to permit review and reconsideration of [the 51 Mexican] nationals' cases by the UnitedStates courts."

Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, || 121. TheICJ's reasoning is also irreconcilable with the District

Court's. The ICJ specified that the Convention confersrights on individual defendants, and that applying state procedural default rules to prevent them from vindicating theirrights violates the treaty, for the treaty requires that its purposes be given " `full effect.' " Id., |||| 106, 113.Medelli'n argues that once the United States undertakes a
substantive obligation (as it did in the Vienna Convention),and at the same time undertakes to abide by the result of a
specified dispute resolution process (as it did by submittingto the ICJ's jurisdiction through the Optional Protocol), it is
bound by the rules generated by that process no less than itis by the treaty that is the source of the substantive obligation. In other words, because Avena was decided on theback of a self-executing treaty, see

infra, at 686, it must begiven effect in our domestic legal system just as the treaty

itself must be. Medelli'n asserts, at bottom, that Avena, likea treaty, has the status of supreme law of the land.

On the other hand, Texas and the United States argue thatthe issue turns in large part on how to interpret Article 94(1)
of the United Nations Charter, which provides that "[e]achMember of the United Nations undertakes to comply with

an existent claim for relief. In neither case has petitioner made a new
claim as opposed to a new argument supporting his pending claim.
Cf. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534-535 (1992).

the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case
to which it is a party." 59 Stat. 1051. They maintain that
the charter imposes an international duty only on our political branches. A contrary result could deprive the Executive
of necessary discretion in foreign relations, and may improperly displace this Court's responsibilities to an international
body. For his part, Medelli'n says that Article 94(1) cannot
answer the question of whether, under domestic law and the
Supremacy Clause, our courts are bound to comply with the
international obligation reflected in Avena.

The Court of Appeals passed on whether it was bound by
Avena, and decided that the issue was not worthy of a COA.
In so doing, it noted some conflict between Avena and our
decision in Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 376 (1998) (per
curiam). How to resolve that conflict is a difficult question.
Reasonable jurists can vigorously disagree about whether
and what legal effect ICJ decisions have in our domestic
courts, and about whether Medelli'n can benefit from such
effect in this posture. The Court of Appeals should have
granted a COA and given the issue further consideration.

B
We also granted certiorari on a second, alternative question that asks whether and what weight American courts
should give to Avena, perhaps for sake of uniform treaty
interpretation, even if they are not bound to follow the ICJ's
decision. That question can only be answered by holding up
the Avena interpretation of the treaty against the domestic
court's own conclusions, and then deciding how and to what
extent the two should be reconciled. See Olympic Airways
v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 660-661 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 404 (1985). Accordingly, the second question presented encompassed two other
issues, both pressed and passed upon below, that are themselves debatable and thus grounds for a COA: whether the

Vienna Convention creates judicially enforceable rights andwhether it sometimes trumps state procedural default rules.

2

This Court has remarked that Article 36 of the ViennaConvention "arguably confers on an individual the right to

consular assistance following arrest." Breard, supra, at376. The United States maintains, on the contrary, that Article 36 does not give foreign nationals a judicially enforceable right to consular access. On that theory, a detainedforeign national may

never complain in court--even in the
course of a trial or on direct review--about a State's failureto "inform the person concerned without delay of his rights

under" Article 36. 21 U. S. T., at 101. The complainantmust be the sending state, and any remedy is political, diplomatic, or between the states in international law.When called upon to interpret a treaty in a given case or
controversy, we give considerable weight to the ExecutiveBranch's understanding of our treaty obligations. See

Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961); Charlton v. Kelly,
229 U. S. 447, 468 (1913). But a treaty's meaning is not be2 Justice Ginsburg gives an unduly narrow construction to the second
question presented. It asks: "[S]hould a court in the United States give
effect to the judgments in Avena and LaGrand"? Brief for Petitioner i.
This question cannot be read to ask for " `effect' " to be given in the strict
sense of the law of judgments, ante, at 670-671 (Ginsburg, J., concurring):
Because Medelli'n was not a beneficiary of the judgment in LaGrand Case
(F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27), a case between
Germany and the United States, the judgment in LaGrand cannot be enforced as to Medelli'n. What he asks is that American courts reach the
same interpretation of the Vienna Convention as did the body charged
with adjudicating international disputes arising out of the Convention--in
part for the sake of "uniform treaty interpretation." Brief for Petitioner
i. This understanding of the second question takes account, as it should,
of the fact that the correct, independent interpretation of the Vienna Convention was the central question in the habeas proceedings below. Moreover, it is consistent with the practical way we decide what is "fairly included" in a question presented. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a); City of
Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., ante, at 213, n. 6; Ballard v.
Commissioner, ante, at 47, n. 2.

yond debate once the Executive has interpreted it. Cf., e. g.,
Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U. S. 122, 136 (1989)
(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (observing that theCourt was rejecting a view of the Warsaw Convention that

had consistently been adopted by the Executive Branch andhad been pressed by the United States in that case);

Perkins
v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325, 328, 337-342 (1939) (declining to adopt
Executive's treaty interpretation); Johnson v. Browne, 205U. S. 309, 319-321 (1907) (same);

De Lima v. Bidwell, 182
U. S. 1, 181, 194-199 (1901) (same).Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations

is, as the United States recognizes, a self-executing treaty.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26. Chief Justice
Marshall explained that a self-executing treaty is domestic
law. It "operates of itself," as "a rule for the Court," "equivalent to an act of the legislature." Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet.
253, 314 (1829). Because the Convention is self-executing,
then, its guarantees are susceptible to judicial enforcement
just as the provisions of a statute would be. See Head
Money Cases, 112 U. S., at 598-599 ("A treaty, then, is a law
of the land as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions
prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or
subject may be determined. And when such rights are of a
nature to be enforced in a court of justice, that court resorts
to the treaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it
would to a statute"); see generally L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution 206-209 (2d ed.
1996).

To ascertain whether Article 36 confers a right on individuals, we first look to the treaty's text as we would with a
statute's. United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S. 655,
663 (1992); Air France, supra, at 397. Article 36(1)(b) entails three different obligations for signatory host countries.
Their competent authorities shall (1) inform the consul of
its nationals' detentions, (2) forward communication from a
detained national to his consulate, and (3) "inform the person

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
concerned without delay of his rights under this subparagraph." 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). Of these,
the third exclusively concerns the detained individual, and itis the only obligation expressed in the language of rights.

If Article 36(1) conferred no rights on the detained individ-ual, its command to "inform" the detainee of "his rights"
might be meaningless. Other provisions in the treaty appear to refer back to individual rights. See Art. 36(1)(a),
ibid.; Art. 36(2), ibid.

To be sure, the questions of whether a treaty is self-executing and whether it creates private rights and remedies

are analytically distinct. If Article 36(1)(b) imposed only
two obligations on signatory countries--to notify the consul
and forward correspondence--then Medelli'n could not invoke the treaty as a source of personal rights by virtue of
its self-executing character. But the treaty goes further--
imposing an obligation to inform the individual of his rights
in the treaty. And if a statute were to provide, for example,
that arresting authorities "shall inform a detained person
without delay of his right to counsel," I question whether
more would be required before a defendant could invoke that
statute to complain in court if he had not been so informed.

This Court has repeatedly enforced treaty-based rights of
individual foreigners, allowing them to assert claims arising
from various treaties. These treaties, often regarding reciprocity in commerce and navigation, do not share any special
magic words. Their rights-conferring language is arguably
no clearer than the Vienna Convention's is, and they do not
specify judicial enforcement. See, e. g., Asakura v. Seattle,
265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924) (allowing Japanese national to bring
a claim under a United States-Japan treaty requiring that
" `citizens or subjects of each of the [two countries] shall have
liberty . . . to carry on trade' " in the other's territory, and
holding that a local licensing ordinance for pawnbrokers
could not be applied to the Japanese petitioner without violating the treaty's guarantee); Kolovrat, supra, at 191-192,

and n. 6 (sustaining Yugoslavians' claim against enforcementof Oregon inheritance law limiting their right to inherit,

when United States-Serbia Treaty promised that " `[i]n allthat concerns the right of acquiring, possessing or disposing
of every kind of property . . . citizens of [each country in theother] shall enjoy the rights which the respective laws grant
in each of these states to the subjects of the most favored
nation' ").Likewise, the United States acknowledges with approval

that other provisions of the Vienna Convention, which relateto consular privileges and immunities, have been the source
of judicially enforced individual rights. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 26, n. 7 (citing Risk v. Halvorsen,
936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991) (deciding whether Article 43
of the Vienna Convention defeated jurisdiction under 28
U. S. C. $ 1351 over defendant consular officials), and Gerritsen v. de la Madrid Hurtado, 819 F. 2d 1511, 1515-1516 (CA9
1987) (same)). Although Article 43 is phrased in terms of
courts' jurisdiction, its violations could theoretically also be
vindicated exclusively in political and diplomatic processes,
but have not been. See Art. 43(1), 21 U. S. T., at 104 ("Consular officers and consular employees shall not be amenable
to the jurisdiction of the judicial or administrative authorities of the receiving State in respect of acts performed in
the exercise of consular functions"); see also Kolovrat, 366
U. S., at 193; Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483, 487
(1880).

There are plausible arguments for the Government's construction of Article 36. See generally Choctaw Nation v.
United States, 318 U. S. 423, 431-432 (1943) (looking to extrinsic sources for treaty interpretation). The preamble to
the Vienna Convention, for example, states that "the purpose
of such privileges and immunities [contained in the treaty] is
not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts on behalf of their respective States." 21 U. S. T., at 79. Moreover, State Depart544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ment and congressional statements contemporaneous withthe treaty's ratification say or indicate that the Convention

would not require significant departures from existing prac-tice. See

United States v. Li, 206 F. 3d 56, 64-65 (CA1 2000);
but see id., at 73-75 (Torruella, C. J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). The United States interprets such

statements to mean that the political branches did not contemplate a role for the treaty in ordinary criminal proceed-ings. See Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 21-22.
The Government also asserts that the State Department'sprevious litigation behavior in Article 36 cases is consistent

with the Executive's treaty interpretation presented here.
Id., at 22-23; see also Li, supra, at 64. I would allow fuller
consideration of this issue upon the granting of a COA.

Of course, even if the Convention does confer individual
rights, there remains the question of whether such rights
can be forfeited according to state procedural default rules.
Article 36(2) of the treaty provides: "The rights referred to
in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity
with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject
to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations
must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which
the rights accorded under this Article are intended." 21
U. S. T., at 101. Medelli'n contends that this provision requires that state procedural default rules sometimes be set
aside so that the treaty can be given "full effect." Ibid. In
Breard, in the course of denying a stay of imminent execution and accompanying petitions, we concluded that the petitioner had defaulted his Article 36 claim by failing to raise
it in state court prior to seeking collateral relief in federal
court. 523 U. S., at 375-376. Subsequently in Avena, as
explained above, the ICJ interpreted Article 36(2) differently. 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, |||| 112-113. In the past the
Court has revisited its interpretation of a treaty when
new international law has come to light. See United States
v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51, 89 (1833). Even if Avena is not

Souter, J., dissenting
itself a binding rule of decision in this case, it may at leastbe occasion to return to the question of Article 36(2)'s implications for procedural default.Again, I would not decide that question today. All that is
required of Medelli'n now is to show that his case is debat-able. He has done at least that much. Because of the COA
posture, we cannot, and I would not, construe Article 36 de-finitively here. I would conclude only that Medelli'n's arguments about the treaty themselves warrant a COA.

IV
For the reasons explained, I would vacate the Court ofAppeals' decision to deny Medelli'n a COA with which to

proceed, and remand for further proceedings. After wegranted certiorari in this case, the President informed his
Attorney General that the United States would discharge itsobligations under the Avena judgment "by having State
courts give effect to the decision." George W. Bush, Memo-randum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9a. Medelli'n hassince filed a successive petition in state court. It is possible
that the Texas court will grant him relief on the basis ofthe President's memorandum. On remand, the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit may have wished to considerthat possibility when scheduling further federal proceedings,
and to hold the case on its docket until Medelli'n's successivepetition was resolved in state court. See

Landis v. NorthAmerican Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936).

Justice Souter, dissenting.
After the Court of Appeals denied the certificate of ap-pealability (COA) necessary for Medelli'n to appeal the District Court's denial of his claim for relief under the ViennaConvention on Consular Relations, we granted certiorari on
two questions bearing on the order barring further appeal:(1) whether the judgment of the International Court of Jus544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

691Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)
Souter, J., dissenting
tice (ICJ) in Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of
Mar. 31) (Avena), supporting petitioner's right to litigate aclaimed violation of the Convention, and to litigate free of

state and federal procedural bars, is preclusive in our domes-tic courts; and (2) whether

Avena and the ICJ's earlier judgment in LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466
(Judgment of June 27), are at least entitled to enforcementfor the sake of comity or uniform treaty interpretation.

Prior to argument here, the President advised the AttorneyGeneral that the United States would discharge its international obligations under the Avena judgment "by having
State courts give effect to the decision." Memorandum for
the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 9a. Medelli'n accordingly
has gone back to state court in Texas to seek relief on the
basis of the Avena judgment and the President's determination. Since action by the Texas courts could render moot
the questions on which we granted certiorari (not to mention
the subsidiary issues spotted in the per curiam and dissenting opinions), I think the best course for this Court would
be to stay further action for a reasonable time as the Texas
courts decide what to do; that way we would not wipe out
the work done in this case so far, and we would not decide
issues that may turn out to require no action. We would,
however, remain in a position to address promptly the Nation's obligation under the judgment of the ICJ if that should
prove necessary.

Because a majority of the Court does not agree to a stay,
I think the next best course would be to take up the questions on which certiorari was granted, to the extent of their
bearing on the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that there
was no room for reasonable disagreement, meriting a COA,
about Medelli'n's right to relief under the Convention. The
Court of Appeals understandably thought itself constrained
by our decision in Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
curiam), which the court viewed as binding until this Courtsaid otherwise. It is of course correct to face the possibility

of saying otherwise today, since Medelli'n's case now presentsa Vienna Convention claim in the shadow of a final ICJ judgment that may be entitled to considerable weight, if not preclusive effect. This case is therefore not Breard, and the
Court of Appeals should be free to take a fresh look.

That is one of several reasons why I join Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion, but I do so subject to caveats. We
should not at this point limit the scope of proceedings on
remand; the issues outlined in Part III-B of Justice O'Connor's opinion are implicated here by Medelli'n's request that
domestic courts defer to the ICJ for the sake of uniform
treaty interpretation. Whether these issues would be open
for consideration by the Court of Appeals in their own right,
independent of the ICJ's judgment, is not before us here, nor
should our discussion of them and other matters in Part III
be taken as limiting the enquiry by the Court of Appeals,
were a remand possible. I would, however, limit further
proceedings by providing that the Court of Appeals should
take no further action until the anticipated Texas litigation
responding to the President's position had run its course,
since action in the Texas courts might remove any occasion
to proceed under the federal habeas petition. Taking Justice O'Connor's proposed course subject to this limitation
would eliminate the risk of further unnecessary federal rulings, but would retain federal jurisdiction and the option
to act promptly, which petitioner deserves after litigating
this far.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

I agree with Justice Ginsburg that, in light of recent
developments, this Court should simply grant Medelli'n's motion for a stay. See ante, at 668 (concurring opinion); see

544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

693Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)
Breyer, J., dissenting
also ante, at 691 (Souter, J., dissenting). But, in the absence of majority support for a stay, I would vacate the Fifth
Circuit's judgment and remand the case rather than simply
dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. I join Justice
O'Connor's dissent, for she would do the same. See ante,
at 677, 690.

For one thing, Medelli'n's legal argument that "American
courts are now bound to follow the ICJ's decision in Avena"
is substantial, and the Fifth Circuit erred in holding the contrary. Ante, at 682 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see 371 F. 3d
270, 279-280 (2004). By vacating its judgment and remanding the case, we would remove from the books an erroneous
legal determination that we granted certiorari to review.

Nor would a remand "invite the Fifth Circuit to conduct
proceedings rival to those" unfolding in the Texas courts.
Ante, at 668 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). Rather, I should
expect the Fifth Circuit to recognize two practical circumstances that favor its entering a stay. See ante, at 690
(O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also ante, at 692 (Souter,
J., dissenting).

First, the President has decided that state courts should
follow Avena. See Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31); George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 9a. And that fact permits Medelli'n to argue in the Texas courts that the President's determination--taken together with (1) the self-executing nature
of the treaty, (2) the Nation's signature on the Optional Protocol, (3) the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) determination that the United States give Medelli'n (and 50 other
Mexican nationals) "judicial," i. e., court, "review and reconsideration" of their Convention-based claims, "by means of
[the United States'] own choosing," and (4) the United
States' "undertak[ing]" in the United Nations Charter to

Breyer, J., dissenting
comply with ICJ judgments--requires Texas to follow the
Avena decision in Medelli'n's case. Avena, supra, |||| 138-
143, 153(9) (emphasis added); Charter of the United Nations,
Art. 94.1, 59 Stat. 1051; cf. Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 237
(1796) (treaties "superior to the Constitution and laws of any
individual state" (emphasis deleted)); Sale v. Haitian Centers
Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 188 (1993) (President possesses
"unique responsibility" for the conduct of "foreign . . . affairs"); see also American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S.
396, 414-416 (2003) (President has a degree of independent
authority to pre-empt state law); Tex. Code Crim. Proc.
Ann., Arts. 11.01, 11.071 (Vernon 2005) (Texas courts possess
jurisdiction to hear Medelli'n's claims).

Second, several Members of this Court have confirmed
that the federal questions implicated in this case are important, thereby suggesting that further review here after the
Texas courts reach their own decisions may well be appropriate. See ante, at 672 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (it is
"this Court's responsibility" to address and resolve any significant legal ICJ-related issues that may arise in the statecourt proceedings).

The first consideration means that Medelli'n's claims when
considered in state court are stronger than when considered
in federal court--and suggests the very real possibility of
his victory in state court. The second consideration means
that a loss in state court would likely be followed by review
in this Court. Taken together they mean that, by staying
the case on remand, the Fifth Circuit could well avoid the
need for any further federal proceedings, or at least obtain
additional guidance from this Court before taking further
action. Given these practical circumstances, it seems to me
unlikely that, were we to remand this case, the Fifth Circuit
would move forward on its own, rather than stay its hand
until the conclusion of proceedings in the state courts and
possibly here.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 04-368. Argued April 27, 2005--Decided May 31, 2005
As Enron Corporation's financial difficulties became public, petitioner, Enron's auditor, instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant to
its document retention policy. Petitioner was indicted under 18 U. S. C.

$$ 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B), which make it a crime to "knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e] another person . . . with intent to . . . cause" that
person to "withhold" documents from, or "alter" documents for use in,
an "official proceeding." The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the
Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the District Court's jury instructions properly conveyed the meaning of "corruptly persuades" and
"official proceeding" in $ 1512(b); that the jury need not find any consciousness of wrongdoing in order to convict; and that there was no
reversible error.

Held: The jury instructions failed to convey properly the elements of a

"corrup[t] persua[sion]" conviction under $ 1512(b). Pp. 703-708.

(a) This Court's traditional restraint in assessing federal criminal
statutes' reach, see, e. g., United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600, is
particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the conviction--
"persua[sion]"--is by itself innocuous. Even "persuad[ing]" a person
"with intent to . . . cause" that person to "withhold" testimony or documents from the Government is not inherently malign. Under ordinary
circumstances, it is not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy, even though the
policy, in part, is created to keep certain information from others, including the Government. Thus, $ 1512(b)'s "knowingly . . . corruptly persuades" phrase is key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the
situation presented here. The Government suggests that "knowingly"
does not modify "corruptly persuades," but that is not how the statute
most naturally reads. "[K]nowledge" and "knowingly" are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness, and "corrupt"
and "corruptly" with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. Joining
these meanings together makes sense both linguistically and in the statutory scheme. Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to
"knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]." And limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows $ 1512(b) to reach

Syllabus
only those with the level of culpability usually required to impose criminal liability. See Aguilar, supra, at 602. Pp. 703-706.

(b) The jury instructions failed to convey the requisite consciousness
of wrongdoing. Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required. For example, the jury was told that, even if petitioner
honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could
convict. The instructions also diluted the meaning of "corruptly" such
that it covered innocent conduct. The District Court based its instruction on the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for $ 1503, which defined "corruptly" as "knowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent
to subvert or undermine the integrity" of a proceeding. However, the
court agreed with the Government's insistence on excluding "dishonestly" and adding the term "impede" to the phrase "subvert or undermine," so the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner intended to
"subvert, undermine, or impede" governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.
These changes were significant. "[D]ishonest[y]" was no longer necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply "impede[d]" the Government's factfinding ability. "Impede" has
broader connotations than "subvert" or even "undermine," and many of
these connotations do not incorporate any "corrupt[ness]" at all. Under
the dictionary definition of "impede," anyone who innocently persuades
another to withhold information from the Government "get[s] in the way
of the progress of" the Government. With regard to such innocent conduct, the "corruptly" instructions did no limiting work whatsoever.
The instructions also led the jury to believe that it did not have to find
any nexus between the "persua[sion]" to destroy documents and any
particular proceeding. In resisting any nexus element, the Government
relies on $ 1512(e)(1), which states that an official proceeding "need not
be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense." It is,
however, quite another thing to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen. A "knowingly . . . corrup[t] persaude[r]" cannot be someone who
persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy
when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material. Cf. Aguilar, supra,
at 599-600. Pp. 706-708.

Opinion of the Court
Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben argued the cause forthe United States. With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Clement, Acting Assistant Attorney GeneralKeeney, Kannon K. Shanmugam, Sangita K. Rao, Andrew
Weissmann, and Matthew W. Friedrich.*

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

As Enron Corporation's financial difficulties became publicin 2001, petitioner Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor,
instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant toits document retention policy. A jury found that this action
made petitioner guilty of violating 18 U. S. C. $$ 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B). These sections make it a crime to "knowingly us[e] intimidation or physical force, threate[n], or cor-ruptly persuad[e] another person . . . with intent to . . . cause"
that person to "withhold" documents from, or "alter" docu-ments for use in, an "official proceeding."

1 The Court of

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. We hold that thejury instructions failed to convey properly the elements of a

"corrup[t] persua[sion]" conviction under $ 1512(b), and there-fore reverse.

Enron Corporation, during the 1990's, switched its busi-ness from operation of natural gas pipelines to an energy
conglomerate, a move that was accompanied by aggressiveaccounting practices and rapid growth. Petitioner audited

gagement team" for Enron was headed by David Duncan.Beginning in 2000, Enron's financial performance began to

suffer, and, as 2001 wore on, worsened.2 On August 14,2001, Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's Chief Executive Officer
(CEO), unexpectedly resigned. Within days, Sherron Wat-kins, a senior accountant at Enron, warned Kenneth Lay,
Enron's newly reappointed CEO, that Enron could "implodein a wave of accounting scandals." Brief for United States
2. She likewise informed Duncan and Michael Odom, one ofpetitioner's partners who had supervisory responsibility
over Duncan, of the looming problems.On August 28, an article in the Wall Street Journal suggested improprieties at Enron, and the SEC opened an in-formal investigation. By early September, petitioner had
formed an Enron "crisis-response" team, which includedNancy Temple, an in-house counsel.

3 On October 8, petitioner retained outside counsel to represent it in any litiga-tion that might arise from the Enron matter. The next day,

Temple discussed Enron with other in-house counsel. Hernotes from that meeting reflect that "some SEC investigation" is "highly probable." Id., at 3.On October 10, Odom spoke at a general training meeting
attended by 89 employees, including 10 from the Enron en2 During this time, petitioner faced problems of its own. In June 2001,
petitioner entered into a settlement agreement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) related to its audit work of Waste Management, Inc. As part of the settlement, petitioner paid a massive fine. It
also was censured and enjoined from committing further violations of the
securities laws. In July 2001, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging improprieties by Sunbeam Corporation, and petitioner's lead partner
on the Sunbeam audit was named.

3 A key accounting problem involved Enron's use of "Raptors," which

were special purpose entities used to engage in "off-balance-sheet" activities. Petitioner's engagement team had allowed Enron to "aggregate" the
Raptors for accounting purposes so that they reflected a positive return.
This was, in the words of petitioner's experts, a "black-and-white" violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Brief for United

e-mailed Odom, suggesting that he " `remin[d] the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy.' "
Brief for United States 6.

On October 16, Enron announced its third quarter results.
That release disclosed a $1.01 billion charge to earnings.5
The following day, the SEC notified Enron by letter that it
had opened an investigation in August and requested certain
information and documents. On October 19, Enron forwarded a copy of that letter to petitioner.

4 The firm's policy called for a single central engagement file, which
"should contain only that information which is relevant to supporting our
work." App. JA-45. The policy stated that, "[i]n cases of threatened
litigation, . . . no related information will be destroyed." Id., at JA-44.
It also separately provided that, if petitioner is "advised of litigation or
subpoenas regarding a particular engagement, the related information
should not be destroyed. See Policy Statement No. 780--Notification of
Litigation." Id., at JA-65 (emphasis deleted). Policy Statement No. 780
set forth "notification" procedures for whenever "professional practice litigation against [petitioner] or any of its personnel has been commenced,
has been threatened or is judged likely to occur, or when governmental or
professional investigations that may involve [petitioner] or any of its personnel have been commenced or are judged likely." Id., at JA-29 to
JA-30.

5 The release characterized the charge to earnings as "non-recurring."

Brief for United States 6, n. 4. Petitioner had expressed doubts about
this characterization to Enron, but Enron refused to alter the release.
Temple wrote an e-mail to Duncan that "suggested deleting some language
that might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading." App.

Opinion of the Court
On the same day, Temple also sent an e-mail to a member
of petitioner's internal team of accounting experts and
attached a copy of the document policy. On October 20, the
Enron crisis-response team held a conference call, during
which Temple instructed everyone to "[m]ake sure to follow
the [document] policy." Brief for United States 7 (brackets
in original). On October 23, Enron CEO Lay declined to
answer questions during a call with analysts because of "potential lawsuits, as well as the SEC inquiry." Ibid. After
the call, Duncan met with other Andersen partners on the
Enron engagement team and told them that they should ensure team members were complying with the document
policy. Another meeting for all team members followed,
during which Duncan distributed the policy and told everyone to comply. These, and other smaller meetings, were followed by substantial destruction of paper and electronic
documents.

On October 26, one of petitioner's senior partners circulated a New York Times article discussing the SEC's response to Enron. His e-mail commented that "the problems
are just beginning and we will be in the cross hairs. The
marketplace is going to keep the pressure on this and is
going to force the SEC to be tough." Id., at 8. On October
30, the SEC opened a formal investigation and sent Enron a
letter that requested accounting documents.

Throughout this time period, the document destruction
continued, despite reservations by some of petitioner's managers.6 On November 8, Enron announced that it would

the best time in the world for you guys to be shredding a bunch of stuff."
Brief for United States 9. On October 31, David Stulb, a forensics investigator for petitioner, met with Duncan. During the meeting, Duncan
picked up a document with the words "smoking gun" written on it and
began to destroy it, adding "we don't need this." Ibid. Stulb cautioned
Duncan on the need to maintain documents and later informed Temple
that Duncan needed advice on the document retention policy.

issue a comprehensive restatement of its earnings and
assets. Also on November 8, the SEC served Enron and
petitioner with subpoenas for records. On November 9,
Duncan's secretary sent an e-mail that stated: "Per Dave--
No more shredding. . . . We have been officially served for
our documents." Id., at 10. Enron filed for bankruptcy less
than a month later. Duncan was fired and later pleaded
guilty to witness tampering.

In March 2002, petitioner was indicted in the Southern
District of Texas on one count of violating $$ 1512(b)(2)(A)
and (B). The indictment alleged that, between October 10
and November 9, 2001, petitioner "did knowingly, intentionally and corruptly persuade . . . other persons, to wit:
[petitioner's] employees, with intent to cause" them to withhold documents from, and alter documents for use in, "official
proceedings, namely: regulatory and criminal proceedings
and investigations." App. JA-139. A jury trial followed.
When the case went to the jury, that body deliberated for
seven days and then declared that it was deadlocked. The
District Court delivered an "Allen charge," Allen v. United
States, 164 U. S. 492 (1896), and, after three more days of
deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The District Court denied petitioner's motion for a judgment of
acquittal.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 374
F. 3d, at 284. It held that the jury instructions properly
conveyed the meaning of "corruptly persuades" and "official
proceeding"; that the jury need not find any consciousness
of wrongdoing; and that there was no reversible error. Because of a split of authority regarding the meaning of

$ 1512(b), we granted certiorari.7 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).

Opinion of the Court
Chapter 73 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides
criminal sanctions for those who obstruct justice. Sections
1512(b)(2)(A) and (B), part of the witness tampering provisions, provide in relevant part:

"Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force,
threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to . . . cause or induce
any person to . . . withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding [or] alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an object with
intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for
use in an official proceeding . . . shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both."

In this case, our attention is focused on what it means to
"knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]" another person "with
intent to . . . cause" that person to "withhold" documents from, or "alter" documents for use in, an "official
proceeding."

"We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the
reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to
the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473
U. S. 207 (1985), and out of concern that `a fair warning
should be given to the world in language that the common
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a
certain line is passed,' McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S.
25, 27 (1931)." United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600
(1995).

Such restraint is particularly appropriate here, where the
act underlying the conviction--"persua[sion]"--is by itself
innocuous. Indeed, "persuad[ing]" a person "with intent
to . . . cause" that person to "withhold" testimony or documents from a Government proceeding or Government official

is not inherently malign.8 Consider, for instance, a motherwho suggests to her son that he invoke his right against compelled self-incrimination, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, or a wifewho persuades her husband not to disclose marital confidences, see Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S. 40 (1980).Nor is it necessarily corrupt for an attorney to "persuad[e]" a client "with intent to . . . cause" that client to"withhold" documents from the Government. In

UpjohnCo. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383 (1981), for example, we

held that Upjohn was justified in withholding documents thatwere covered by the attorney-client privilege from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). See id., at 395. No one wouldsuggest that an attorney who "persuade[d]" Upjohn to take
that step acted wrongfully, even though he surely intendedthat his client keep those documents out of the IRS' hands.

"Document retention policies," which are created in partto keep certain information from getting into the hands of
others, including the Government, are common in business.See generally Chase, To Shred or Not to Shred: Document
Retention Policies and Federal Obstruction of Justice Stat-utes, 8 Ford. J. Corp. & Fin. L. 721 (2003). It is, of course,
not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to com-ply with a valid document retention policy under ordinary
circumstances.Acknowledging this point, the parties have largely focused
their attention on the word "corruptly" as the key to whatmay or may not lawfully be done in the situation presented
here. Section 1512(b) punishes not just "corruptly per-suad[ing]" another, but "

knowingly . . . corruptly per-suad[ing]" another. (Emphasis added.) The Government

suggests that "knowingly" does not modify "corruptly per8 Section 1512(b)(2) addresses testimony, as well as documents. Section
1512(b)(1) also addresses testimony. Section 1512(b)(3) addresses "persuade[rs]" who intend to prevent "the communication to a law enforcement
officer or judge of the United States of information" relating to a federal
crime.

suades," but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.It provides the mens rea--"knowingly"--and then a list of

acts--"uses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or cor-ruptly persuades." We have recognized with regard to similar statutory language that the mens rea at least appliesto the acts that immediately follow, if not to other elements down the statutory chain. See United States v. XCitement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 68 (1994) (recognizingthat the "most natural grammatical reading" of 18 U. S. C.

$$ 2252(a)(1) and (2) "suggests that the term `knowingly'modifies only the surrounding verbs: transports, ships, receives, distributes, or reproduces"); see also Liparota v.United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985). The Government suggests that it is "questionable whether Congress wouldemploy such an inelegant formulation as `knowingly . . .
corruptly persuades.' " Brief for United States 35, n. 18.Long experience has not taught us to share the Government's doubts on this score, and we must simply interpretthe statute as written.

The parties have not pointed us to another interpretationof "knowingly . . . corruptly" to guide us here.

9 In any

event, the natural meaning of these terms provides a clearanswer. See

Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144-145(1995). "[K]nowledge" and "knowingly" are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness.See Black's Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter
Black's); Webster's Third New International Dictionary1252-1253 (1993) (hereinafter Webster's 3d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1981) (herein-after Am. Hert.). "Corrupt" and "corruptly" are normally
associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. SeeBlack's 371; Webster's 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299-300. Joining
these meanings together here makes sense both linguisti9 The parties have pointed us to two other obstruction provisions, 18
U. S. C. $$ 1503 and 1505, which contain the word "corruptly." But these
provisions lack the modifier "knowingly," making any analogy inexact.

Opinion of the Court
cally and in the statutory scheme. Only persons consciousof wrongdoing can be said to "knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]." And limiting criminality to persuaders consciousof their wrongdoing sensibly allows $ 1512(b) to reach only
those with the level of "culpability . . . we usually requirein order to impose criminal liability."

United States v.
Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 602; see also Liparota v. United States,
supra, at 426.The outer limits of this element need not be explored here

because the jury instructions at issue simply failed to conveythe requisite consciousness of wrongdoing. Indeed, it is
striking how little culpability the instructions required.
For example, the jury was told that, "even if [petitioner] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful, you
may find [petitioner] guilty." App. JA-213. The instructions also diluted the meaning of "corruptly" so that it covered innocent conduct. Id., at JA-212.

The parties vigorously disputed how the jury would be
instructed on "corruptly." The District Court based its instruction on the definition of that term found in the Fifth
Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for $ 1503. This pattern instruction defined "corruptly" as " `knowingly and dishonestly,
with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity' " of a proceeding. Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 3 (emphasis
deleted). The Government, however, insisted on excluding
"dishonestly" and adding the term "impede" to the phrase
"subvert or undermine." Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted). The District Court agreed over petitioner's objections, and the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner
intended to "subvert, undermine, or impede" governmental
factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce
the document retention policy. App. JA-212.

These changes were significant. No longer was any type
of "dishonest[y]" necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was
enough for petitioner to have simply "impede[d]" the Government's factfinding ability. As the Government conceded

Opinion of the Court
at oral argument, " `[i]mpede' " has broader connotationsthan " `subvert' " or even " `[u]ndermine,' " see Tr. of Oral

Arg. 38, and many of these connotations do not incorporateany "corrupt[ness]" at all. The dictionary defines "impede"
as "to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of "or "hold up" or "detract from." Webster's 3d 1132. By
definition, anyone who innocently persuades another to with-hold information from the Government "get[s] in the way of
the progress of " the Government. With regard to such in-nocent conduct, the "corruptly" instructions did no limiting
work whatsoever.The instructions also were infirm for another reason.
They led the jury to believe that it did not have to find anynexus between the "persua[sion]" to destroy documents and
any particular proceeding.10 In resisting any type of nexuselement, the Government relies heavily on $ 1512(e)(1), which
states that an official proceeding "need not be pending orabout to be instituted at the time of the offense." It is, however, one thing to say that a proceeding "need not be pendingor about to be instituted at the time of the offense," and

10 We disagree with the Government's suggestion that petitioner's
"nexus" argument is not preserved or that it is only subject to plain-error
review for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
30(d). Petitioner plainly argued for, and objected to the instructions' lack
of, a nexus requirement. See, e. g., Record 425 (arguing for a "nexus" and
explaining that "it is insufficient for the government to show that the
defendant intended to affect some hypothetical future federal proceeding"); id., at 931-932, 938; Tr. 4339-4345 (May 25, 2002). In so doing, it
reasonably relied on language in United States v. Shively, 927 F. 2d 804,
812-813 (CA5 1991). Although the instruction petitioner proposed, based
on Shively, does not mirror the nexus requirement it now proposes, its
actions were sufficient to satisfy Rule 30(d). This argument also was preserved in the Court of Appeals, which recognized that petitioner was challenging "the concreteness of the defendant's expectation[s] of a proceeding." 374 F. 3d 281, 298 (CA5 2004); see United States v. Williams, 504
U. S. 36, 41-42 (1992). However, the Court of Appeals did not address,
and petitioner did not preserve, its argument that informal inquiries are
not covered by the statute. See ibid.

Opinion of the Court
quite another to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen.A "knowingly . . . corrup[t] persaude[r]" cannot be someone

who persuades others to shred documents under a documentretention policy when he does not have in contemplation
any particular official proceeding in which those documentsmight be material.

We faced a similar situation in Aguilar, supra. Respond-ent Aguilar lied to a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent
in the course of an investigation and was convicted of " `cor-ruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, and impede [a] . . .
grand jury investigation' " under $ 1503. 515 U. S., at 599.All the Government had shown was that Aguilar had uttered
false statements to an investigating agent "who might ormight not testify before a grand jury."

Id., at 600. We heldthat $ 1503 required something more--specifically, a "nexus"

between the obstructive act and the proceeding. Id., at599-600. "[I]f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding," we ex-plained, "he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct."

Id.,at 599.

For these reasons, the jury instructions here were flawedin important respects. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

CUTTER et al. v. WILKINSON, DIRECTOR, OHIODEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND

CORRECTION, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 03-9877. Argued March 21, 2005--Decided May 31, 2005
Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of

2000 (RLUIPA or Act), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2), provides in part:
"No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution," unless the
burden furthers "a compelling governmental interest," and does so by
"the least restrictive means." Petitioners, current and former inmates
of Ohio state institutions, allege, inter alia, that respondent prison officials violated $ 3 by failing to accommodate petitioners' exercise of their
"nonmainstream" religions in a variety of ways. Respondents moved
to dismiss that claim, arguing, among other things, that $ 3, on its face,
improperly advances religion in violation of the First Amendment's
Establishment Clause. Rejecting that argument, the District Court
stated that RLUIPA permits safety and security--undisputedly compelling state interests--to outweigh an inmate's claim to a religious accommodation. On the thin record before it, the court could not find that
enforcement of RLUIPA, inevitably, would compromise prison security.
Reversing on interlocutory appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that $ 3 impermissibly advances religion by giving greater protection to religious
rights than to other constitutionally protected rights, and suggested
that affording religious prisoners superior rights might encourage prisoners to become religious.

Held: Section 3 of RLUIPA, on its face, qualifies as a permissible accommodation that is not barred by the Establishment Clause. Pp. 719-726.

(a) Foremost, $ 3 is compatible with the Establishment Clause because it alleviates exceptional government-created burdens on private
religious exercise. See, e. g., Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village
School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 705. Furthermore, the Act on its
face does not founder on shoals the Court's prior decisions have identified: Properly applying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of
the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries, see Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U. S. 703; and they must
be satisfied that the Act's prescriptions are and will be administered
neutrally among different faiths, see Kiryas Joel, 512 U. S. 687. "[T]he

`exercise of religion' often involves not only belief and profession but
the performance of . . . physical acts [such as] assembling with others
for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and
wine . . . ." Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.
Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877. Section 3 covers state-run institutions--
mental hospitals, prisons, and the like--in which the government exerts a degree of control unparalleled in civilian society and severely disabling to private religious exercise. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1(a); $ 1997.
RLUIPA thus protects institutionalized persons who are unable freely
to attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent on the
government's permission and accommodation for exercise of their religion. But the Act does not elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institution's need to maintain order and safety. An accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other
significant interests. See Caldor, 472 U. S., at 709-710. There is no
reason to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately
balanced way, with particular sensitivity to security concerns. While
the Act adopts a "compelling interest" standard, $ 2000cc-1(a), "[c]ontext
matters" in the application of that standard, see Grutter v. Bollinger,
539 U. S. 306, 327. Lawmakers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of
the urgency of discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions
and anticipated that courts would apply the Act's standard with due
deference to prison administrators' experience and expertise. Finally,
RLUIPA does not differentiate among bona fide faiths. It confers no
privileged status on any particular religious sect. Cf. Kiryas Joel, 512
U. S., at 706. Pp. 719-724.

(b) The Sixth Circuit misread this Court's precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as impermissibly advancing religion by giving
greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, counsels otherwise.
There, in upholding against an Establishment Clause challenge a provision exempting religious organizations from the prohibition against
religion-based employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Court held that religious accommodations need
not "come packaged with benefits to secular entities." Id., at 338.
Were the Court of Appeals' view correct, all manner of religious accommodations would fall. For example, Ohio could not, as it now does,

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and InstitutionalizedPersons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA or Act), 114 Stat. 804, 42

U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2), provides in part: "No govern-ment shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution,"unless the burden furthers "a compelling governmental interest," and does so by "the least restrictive means." Plain-tiffs below, petitioners here, are current and former inmates
of institutions operated by the Ohio Department of Rehabili-tation and Correction and assert that they are adherents of
"nonmainstream" religions: the Satanist, Wicca, and Asatrureligions, and the Church of Jesus Christ Christian.

"in a variety of different ways, including retaliating anddiscriminating against them for exercising their nontraditional faiths, denying them access to religious litera-ture, denying them the same opportunities for group
worship that are granted to adherents of mainstreamreligions, forbidding them to adhere to the dress and
appearance mandates of their religions, withholding reli-gious ceremonial items that are substantially identical
to those that the adherents of mainstream religions arepermitted, and failing to provide a chaplain trained in
their faith." Brief for United States 5.
For purposes of this litigation at its current stage, respond-ents have stipulated that petitioners are members of bona

dismiss petitioners' complaints, but the Court of Appeals re-versed that determination. The appeals court held, as the
prison officials urged, that the portion of RLUIPA applicableto institutionalized persons, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1, violates
the Establishment Clause. We reverse the Court of Ap-peals' judgment.

Opinion of the Court
Id., at 718 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York,397 U. S. 664, 669 (1970)). "At some point, accommodation

may devolve into `an unlawful fostering of religion.' " Cor-poration of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 334-335 (1987)(quoting Hobbie, 480 U. S., at 145). But $ 3 of RLUIPA, we
hold, does not, on its face, exceed the limits of permissiblegovernment accommodation of religious practices.

I
A

RLUIPA is the latest of long-running congressional effortsto accord religious exercise heightened protection from

government-imposed burdens, consistent with this Court'sprecedents. Ten years before RLUIPA's enactment, the
Court held, in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resourcesof Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 878-882 (1990), that the First
Amendment's Free Exercise Clause does not inhibit enforce-ment of otherwise valid laws of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct. In particular, we ruledthat the Free Exercise Clause did not bar Oregon from enforcing its blanket ban on peyote possession with no allow-ance for sacramental use of the drug. Accordingly, the
State could deny unemployment benefits to persons dis-missed from their jobs because of their religiously inspired
peyote use. Id., at 874, 890. The Court recognized, how-ever, that the political branches could shield religious exercise through legislative accommodation, for example, bymaking an exception to proscriptive drug laws for sacramental peyote use. Id., at 890.Responding to

Smith, Congress enacted the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488,

42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb et seq. RFRA "prohibits `[g]overnment'from `substantially burden[ing]' a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applica-bility unless the government can demonstrate the burden `(1)

is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.' " City of Boerne v. Flores, 521
U. S. 507, 515-516 (1997) (quoting $ 2000bb-1; brackets in
original). "[U]niversal" in its coverage, RFRA "applie[d]
to all Federal and State law," id., at 516 (quoting former

$ 2000bb-3(a)), but notably lacked a Commerce Clause underpinning or a Spending Clause limitation to recipients of federal funds. In City of Boerne, this Court invalidated RFRA
as applied to States and their subdivisions, holding that the
Act exceeded Congress' remedial powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 532-536.2

Congress again responded, this time by enacting RLUIPA.
Less sweeping than RFRA, and invoking federal authority
under the Spending and Commerce Clauses, RLUIPA targets two areas: Section 2 of the Act concerns land-use regulation, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc; 3 $ 3 relates to religious exercise
by institutionalized persons, $ 2000cc-1. Section 3, at issue
here, provides that "[n]o [state or local] government shall
impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a
person residing in or confined to an institution," unless the
government shows that the burden furthers "a compelling
governmental interest" and does so by "the least restrictive
means." $ 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2). The Act defines "religious
exercise" to include "any exercise of religion, whether or not
compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief."

$ 2000cc-5(7)(A). Section 3 applies when "the substantial
burden [on religious exercise] is imposed in a program or

2 RFRA, Courts of Appeals have held, remains operative as to the Federal Government and federal territories and possessions. See O'Bryan v.
Bureau of Prisons, 349 F. 3d 399, 400-401 (CA7 2003); Guam v. Guerrero,
290 F. 3d 1210, 1220-1222 (CA9 2002); Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F. 3d 950,
958-960 (CA10 2001); In re Young, 141 F. 3d 854, 858-863 (CA8 1998).
This Court, however, has not had occasion to rule on the matter.

3 Section 2 of RLUIPA is not at issue here. We therefore express no

view on the validity of that part of the Act.

(2). "A person may assert a violation of [RLUIPA] as aclaim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government." $ 2000cc-2(a).Before enacting $ 3, Congress documented, in hearings
spanning three years, that "frivolous or arbitrary" barriersimpeded institutionalized persons' religious exercise. See
146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) ( joint statement ofSen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA) (hereinafter

even though it provided Kosher food." Hearing on Protecting Religious

Across the country, Jewish inmates complained that prison officials refused
to provide sack lunches, which would enable inmates to break their fasts
after nightfall. Id., at 39 (statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director

there "was [a] nearly yearly battle over the Catholic use of Sacramental

cure redress for inmates who encountered undue barriers totheir religious observances, Congress carried over from

RFRA the "compelling governmental interest"/"least re-strictive means" standard. See id., at 16698. Lawmakers
anticipated, however, that courts entertaining complaintsunder $ 3 would accord "due deference to the experience and
expertise of prison and jail administrators." Id., at 16699(quoting S. Rep. No. 103-111, p. 10 (1993)).

B
Petitioners initially filed suit against respondents assert-ing claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

After RLUIPA's enactment, petitioners amended their com-plaints to include claims under $ 3. Respondents moved to
dismiss the statutory claims, arguing, inter alia, that $ 3 vio-lates the Establishment Clause. 221 F. Supp. 2d, at 846.
Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(a), the United States inter-vened in the District Court to defend RLUIPA's constitutionality. 349 F. 3d 257, 261 (CA6 2003).

Adopting the report and recommendation of the Magis-trate Judge, the District Court rejected the argument that

$ 3 conflicts with the Establishment Clause. 221 F. Supp.2d, at 846-848. As to the Act's impact on a prison's staff and
general inmate population, the court stated that RLUIPA
"permits safety and security--which are undisputedly com-pelling state interests--to outweigh an inmate's claim to a

religious accommodation." Id., at 848. On the thin recordbefore it, the court declined to find, as respondents had
urged, that enforcement of RLUIPA, inevitably, would com-promise prison security.

On interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b),the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Citing

at 612-613 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We resolve
this case on other grounds.

7 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress' legislative

powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the Tenth
Amendment. The District Court rejected respondents' challenges under
the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839-849
(SD Ohio 2002), and the Tenth Amendment, id., at 850-851, and declined to
reach the Commerce Clause question, id., at 838-839. The Sixth Circuit,
having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did
not rule on respondents' further arguments. See 349 F. 3d 257, 259-260,
269 (2003). Respondents renew those arguments in this Court. They
also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment
Clauses, the States' choices are not subject to congressional oversight.
See Brief for Respondents 9, 25-33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310,
322 (CA4 2003). Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by
the Court of Appeals, and mindful that we are a court of review, not of

Sixth Circuit.

II

A

The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment provide:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The first
of the two Clauses, commonly called the Establishment
Clause, commands a separation of church and state. The
second, the Free Exercise Clause, requires government respect for, and noninterference with, the religious beliefs and
practices of our Nation's people. While the two Clauses express complementary values, they often exert conflicting
pressures. See Locke, 540 U. S., at 718 ("These two
Clauses . . . are frequently in tension."); Walz, 397 U. S., at
668-669 ("The Court has struggled to find a neutral course
between the two Religion Clauses, both of which are cast in
absolute terms, and either of which, if expanded to a logical
extreme, would tend to clash with the other.").

Our decisions recognize that "there is room for play in the
joints" between the Clauses, id., at 669, some space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause
nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause. See, e. g.,
Smith, 494 U. S., at 890 ("[A] society that believes in the negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected
to be solicitous of that value in its legislation . . . ."); Amos,
483 U. S., at 329-330 (Federal Government may exempt secular nonprofit activities of religious organizations from Title
VII's prohibition on religious discrimination in employment);
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 422 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The constitutional obligation of `neutrality' is not
so narrow a channel that the slightest deviation from an absolutely straight course leads to condemnation." (citation
omitted)). In accord with the majority of Courts of Appeals
that have ruled on the question, see supra, at 718 and this

Opinion of the Court
page, we hold that $ 3 of RLUIPA fits within the corridorbetween the Religion Clauses: On its face, the Act qualifies

as a permissible legislative accommodation of religion that isnot barred by the Establishment Clause.

Foremost, we find RLUIPA's institutionalized-personsprovision compatible with the Establishment Clause because
it alleviates exceptional government-created burdens on pri-vate religious exercise. See

Board of Ed. of Kiryas JoelVillage School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 705 (1994)

(government need not "be oblivious to impositions that legit-imate exercises of state power may place on religious belief
and practice"); Amos, 483 U. S., at 349 (O'Connor, J., concur-ring in judgment) (removal of government-imposed burdens
on religious exercise is more likely to be perceived "as anaccommodation of the exercise of religion rather than as a
Government endorsement of religion"). Furthermore, theAct on its face does not founder on shoals our prior decisions
have identified: Properly applying RLUIPA, courts musttake adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries, see Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U. S. 703 (1985); and they must besatisfied that the Act's prescriptions are and will be administered neutrally among different faiths, see Kiryas Joel, 512U. S. 687.

"[T]he `exercise of religion' often involves not only beliefand profession but the performance of . . . physical acts [such

as] assembling with others for a worship service [or] partici-pating in sacramental use of bread and wine . . . ." Smith,
494 U. S., at 877. Section 3 covers state-run institutions--mental hospitals, prisons, and the like--in which the government exerts a degree of control unparalleled in civilian soci8 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious
observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate's
devotional accessories. See, e. g., Charles v. Verhagen, 348 F. 3d 601, 605
(CA7 2003) (overturning prohibition on possession of Islamic prayer oil but
leaving inmate-plaintiff with responsibility for purchasing the oil).

ety and severely disabling to private religious exercise. 42
U. S. C. $ 2000cc-1(a); $ 1997; see Joint Statement 16699 ("Institutional residents' right to practice their faith is at the
mercy of those running the institution.").9 RLUIPA thus
protects institutionalized persons who are unable freely to
attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent
on the government's permission and accommodation for exercise of their religion.10

9 See, e. g., ibid. (prison's regulation prohibited Muslim prisoner from
possessing ritual cleansing oil); Young v. Lane, 922 F. 2d 370, 375-376
(CA7 1991) (prison's regulation restricted wearing of yarmulkes); Hunafa
v. Murphy, 907 F. 2d 46, 47-48 (CA7 1990) (noting instances in which Jewish and Muslim prisoners were served pork, with no substitute available).

10 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes

beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise. The Act,
they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to "get religion,"
and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA. Brief for Respondents 15-17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 ("One effect of RLUIPA is to induce
prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute's
benefits."). While some accommodations of religious observance, notably
the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners
seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as "benefits." For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its
kosher diet "a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional
supplement--each and every meal." Protecting Religious Freedom, pt.
3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).

The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already
facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths. The State provides
chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly
for worship. See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services
Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation
and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include "facilitating the delivery
of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout . . . Ohio"); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction,

722 CUTTER v. WILKINSON

Opinion of the Court
We note in this regard the Federal Government's accom-modation of religious practice by members of the military.

See, e. g., 10 U. S. C. $ 3073 (referring to Army chaplains);Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F. 2d 223, 225-229 (CA2 1985) (describing the Army chaplaincy program). In Goldman v. Wein-berger, 475 U. S. 503 (1986), we held that the Free Exercise
Clause did not require the Air Force to exempt an OrthodoxJewish officer from uniform dress regulations so that he
could wear a yarmulke indoors. In a military community,the Court observed, "there is simply not the same [individual] autonomy as there is in the larger civilian community."
Id., at 507 (brackets in original; internal quotation marksomitted). Congress responded to Goldman by prescribing

that "a member of the armed forces may wear an item ofreligious apparel while wearing the uniform," unless "the
wearing of the item would interfere with the performance[of] military duties [or] the item of apparel is not neat and
conservative." 10 U. S. C. $ 774(a)-(b).We do not read RLUIPA to elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institution's need to maintainorder and safety. Our decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override othersignificant interests. In

Caldor, the Court struck down aConnecticut law that "arm[ed] Sabbath observers with an

absolute and unqualified right not to work on whatever daythey designate[d] as their Sabbath." 472 U. S., at 709. We
held the law invalid under the Establishment Clause becauseit "unyielding[ly] weigh[ted]" the interests of Sabbatarians

See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327 (2003).11 Law-makers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of the urgency of
discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions.See, e. g., 139 Cong. Rec. 26190 (1993) (remarks of Sen.
Hatch). They anticipated that courts would apply the Act'sstandard with "due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing neces-sary regulations and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration of costsand limited resources." Joint Statement 16699 (quoting

faiths. In Kiryas Joel, we invalidated a state law thatcarved out a separate school district to serve exclusively a

11 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of
the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials' confiscation of his white
supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression
rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rationalrelationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987).
A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar
withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect
of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA's
compelling-interest standard. 349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter,
240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)). Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government's countervailing compelling interest
in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison
security and order. Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402-403
(ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature
advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v. Sullivan,
896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis. 1995) (same).

12 State prison officials make the first judgment about whether to

provide a particular accommodation, for a prisoner may not sue under
RLUIPA without first exhausting all available administrative remedies.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-2(e) (nothing in RLUIPA "shall be construed to
amend or repeal the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995"); $ 1997e(a)

community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar Hasidim.
We held that the law violated the Establishment Clause, 512
U. S., at 690, in part because it "single[d] out a particular
religious sect for special treatment," id., at 706 (footnote
omitted). RLUIPA presents no such defect. It confers no
privileged status on any particular religious sect, and singles
out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment.

B
The Sixth Circuit misread our precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as "impermissibly advancing religion by
giving greater protection to religious rights than to other
constitutionally protected rights." 349 F. 3d, at 264. Our
decision in Amos counsels otherwise. There, we upheld
against an Establishment Clause challenge a provision exempting "religious organizations from Title VII's prohibition
against discrimination in employment on the basis of religion." 483 U. S., at 329. The District Court in Amos, reasoning in part that the exemption improperly "single[d] out
religious entities for a benefit," id., at 338, had "declared the
statute unconstitutional as applied to secular activity," id.,
at 333. Religious accommodations, we held, need not "come
packaged with benefits to secular entities." Id., at 338;
see Madison, 355 F. 3d, at 318 ("There is no requirement
that legislative protections for fundamental rights march in
lockstep.").

Were the Court of Appeals' view the correct reading of
our decisions, all manner of religious accommodations would
fall. Congressional permission for members of the military
to wear religious apparel while in uniform would fail, see 10
U. S. C. $ 774, as would accommodations Ohio itself makes.
Ohio could not, as it now does, accommodate "traditionally

Court, noting the underdeveloped state of the record, con-cluded: A finding "that it is

factually impossible to providethe kind of accommodations that RLUIPA will require without significantly compromising prison security or the levelsof service provided to other inmates" cannot be made at this
juncture. Id., at 848 (emphasis added).13 We agree."For more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons
has managed the largest correctional system in the Nationunder the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA
without compromising prison security, public safety, or theconstitutional rights of other prisoners." Brief for United

13 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak
their illicit and often violent conduct. The instant case was considered
below on a motion to dismiss. Thus, the parties' conflicting assertions on
this matter are not before us. It bears repetition, however, that prison
security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials' expertise in this area. See supra, at 722-723. Further,
prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner's religiosity,
asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic. Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice
is "central" to a prisoner's religion, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000cc-5(7)(A), the
Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner's professed
religiosity. Cf. Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437, 457 (1971) (" `[T]he
"truth" of a belief is not open to question'; rather, the question is whether
the objector's beliefs are `truly held.' " (quoting United States v. Seeger,

Should inmate requests for religious accommodations be-come excessive, impose unjustified burdens on other institutionalized persons, or jeopardize the effective functioning ofan institution, the facility would be free to resist the imposition. In that event, adjudication in as-applied challengeswould be in order.

to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute "must
have a secular legislative purpose," "its principal or primary effect must
be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion," and it "must not foster
an excessive government entanglement with religion." 403 U. S., at 612-
613 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the first and second
prongs, RLUIPA--and, indeed, any accommodation of religion--might
well violate the Clause. Even laws disestablishing religion might violate

The Establishment Clause provides that "Congress shallmake no law respecting an establishment of religion."

Amdt. 1. As I have explained, an important function of theClause was to "ma[ke] clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments." Elk Grove Unified School
Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50 (2004) (opinion concurringin judgment). The Clause, then, "is best understood as a

the Clause. Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and
thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well "strengthen and revitalize"
religion and so fail the second. McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &
Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206-2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

2 The Court dismisses the parties' arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals
did not address the issue. Ante, at 718, n. 7. The parties' contentions on
this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which
asks "[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting
[RLUIPA]." Pet. for Cert. i. Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25-33; Reply
Brief for Petitioners 12-16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would
be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News
Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 119, n. 9 (2001).

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment
Clause, it may well exceed Congress' authority under either the Spending
Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.
600, 613 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a Spending
Clause condition on a State's receipt of funds to be "Necessary and
Proper" to the expenditure of the funds, there must be "some obvious,
simple, and direct relation" between the condition and the expenditure of
the funds); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 587 (1995) (Thomas, J.,
concurring) ("The Constitution not only uses the word `commerce' in a
narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support
the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that `substantially affect' interstate commerce"). The Court, however, properly
declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

(Scalia, J., dissenting). Ohio contends that this federalismunderstanding of the Clause prevents federal oversight of
state choices within the " `play in the joints' " between theFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses.

Locke v. Davey,540 U. S. 712, 718-719 (2004). In other words, Ohio asserts

that the Clause protects the States from federal interferencewith otherwise constitutionally permissible choices regarding religious policy. In Ohio's view, RLUIPA intrudes onsuch state policy choices and hence violates the Clause.

Ohio's vision of the range of protected state authorityoverreads the Clause. Ohio and its amici contend that, even
though "States can no longer establish preferred churches"because the Clause has been incorporated against the States
through the Fourteenth Amendment,3 "Congress is as unableas ever to contravene constitutionally permissible

Statechoices regarding religious policy." Brief for Respondents

26 (emphasis added); Brief for Commonwealth of Virginiaet al. as Amici Curiae 6-13. That is not what the Clause
says. The Clause prohibits Congress from enacting legisla-tion "respecting an establishment of religion" (emphasis
added); it does not prohibit Congress from enacting legisla-tion "respecting religion" or "taking cognizance of religion."

3 Ohio claims the benefit of the federalism aspect of the Clause, yet simultaneously adheres to the view that the Establishment Clause was incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Brief
for Respondents 25-26. These positions may be incompatible. The text
and history of the Clause may well support the view that the Clause is
not incorporated against the States precisely because the Clause shielded
state establishments from congressional interference. Elk Grove Unified
School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50-51 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring
in judgment). I note, however, that a state law that would violate the
incorporated Establishment Clause might also violate the Free Exercise
Clause. Id., at 53, n. 4, 54, n. 5.

Lee, supra, at 640-641 (Scalia, J.,dissenting); McConnell 2131; L. Levy, The Establishment

Clause: Religion and the First Amendment 10 (2d ed. 1994).To proscribe Congress from making laws "respecting an establishment of religion," therefore, was to forbid legislationrespecting coercive state establishments, not to preclude
Congress from legislating on religion generally.History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show
that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Governmentout of the field of religion. Ohio points to, among other
things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Consti-tution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: "There is not a
shadow of right in the general government to intermeddlewith religion. Its least interference with it would be a most
flagrant usurpation." General Defense of the Constitution(June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130
(R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, & J. Sisson eds. 1977).Ohio also relies on James Iredell's statement discussing the
Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina RatifyingConvention:

"[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere inthe establishment of any religion whatsoever . . . . Is
there any power given to Congress in matters of reli544US2 Unit: $U52 [11-06-07 15:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gion? Can they pass a single act to impair our religiousliberties? If they could, it would be a just cause of

alarm . . . . If any future Congress should pass an actconcerning the religion of the country, it would be an act
which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitu-tion, and which the people would not obey." Debate in
North Carolina Ratifying Convention (July 30, 1788), in5 Founders' Constitution 90 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987).
These quotations do not establish the Framers' beliefsabout the scope of the Establishment Clause. Instead, they

demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have be-lieved that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated powergave it that authority. Ohio's Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.See n. 2, supra.

In any event, Ohio has not shown that the EstablishmentClause codified Madison's or Iredell's view that the Federal
Government could not legislate regarding religion. An un-enacted version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite. It provided that"Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing
the rights of conscience." 1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); seealso

Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 96-97 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The words ultimately adopted, "Con-gress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," "identified a position from which [Madison] had oncesought to distinguish his own," Hamburger, Separation of
Church and State, at 106. Whatever he thought of thosewords, "he clearly did not mind language less severe than
that which he had [previously] used." Ibid. The version ofthe Clause finally adopted is narrower than Ohio claims.

Nor does the other historical evidence on which Ohio re-lies--Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution--
prove its theory. Leaving aside the problems with relying

on this source as an indicator of the original understanding,see U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 856

(1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting), it is unpersuasive in its ownright. Justice Story did say that "the whole power over the
subject of religion is left exclusively to the state govern-ments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions." Commentaries on theConstitution of the United States 702-703 (1833) (reprinted
1987). In context, however, his statement concerned onlyCongress' inability to legislate with respect to religious
establishment. See id., at 701 ("The real object of theamendment was . . . to prevent any national ecclesiastical
establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclu-sive patronage of the national government");

id., at 702 ("[I]twas deemed advisable to exclude from the national government all power to act upon the subject . . . . It was impossi-ble, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if thenational government were left free to create a religious
establishment").In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lackshistorical provenance, at least based on the history of which
I am aware. Even when enacting laws that bind the Statespursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church andstate, or steer clear of the subject of religion. It need only
refrain from making laws "respecting an establishment ofreligion"; it must not interfere with a state establishment
of religion. For example, Congress presumably could notrequire a State to establish a religion any more than it could
preclude a State from establishing a religion.

II
On its face--the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial chal-lenge--RLUIPA is not a law "respecting an establishment of

religion." RLUIPA provides, as relevant: "No governmentshall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise

of a person residing in or confined to an institution, . . . evenif the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of theburden on that person," first, "further[s] a compelling governmental interest," and second, "is the least restrictive
means of furthering that compelling governmental interest."42 U. S. C. $$ 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2). This provision does not

prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since noState has established (or constitutionally could establish,
given an incorporated Clause) a religion. Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force
a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes
supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious
sect over another. It is a law respecting religion, but not
one respecting an establishment of religion.

In addition, RLUIPA's text applies to all laws passed by
state and local governments, including "rule[s] of general applicability," ibid., whether or not they concern an establishment of religion. State and local governments obviously
have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let
alone establishments thereof. Numerous applications of
RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment
Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.
See United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 314 (2005)
(Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).

It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States' receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA. $ 2000cc-
1(b)(1) ("This section applies in any case in which . . . the
substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that
receives Federal financial assistance"). As noted above,
n. 2, supra, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.

TORY et al. v. COCHRAN
certiorari to the court of appeal of california,second appellate district

No. 03-1488. Argued March 22, 2005--Decided May 31, 2005
In a state-law defamation action filed by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr.,

a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner
Craft and others, had, inter alia, falsely claimed that Cochran owed
him money, picketed Cochran's office with signs containing insults and
obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from
such libelous and slanderous activity. Because Tory indicated that he
would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court
permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other
things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about
Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari. After oral argument,
Cochran's counsel informed the Court of Cochran's death, moved to substitute Cochran's widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be
dismissed as moot. Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied
that the case was moot.

Held: Cochran's widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not

moot. Despite Cochran's death, the injunction remains in effect.
Nothing in its language says to the contrary. Cochran's counsel argues
that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no
source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon
Cochran's death. As this Court understands that law, a person cannot
definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has
ruled that it is. Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues
significantly to restrain petitioners' speech, thus presenting an ongoing
federal controversy. Cochran's death, however, makes it unnecessary
for this Court to explore petitioners' basic claims. Rather, the Court
need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale. Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to
pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much
diminished or have disappeared altogether. Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking
plausible justification. Pp. 736-739.

Vacated and remanded.

Johnnie Cochran brought a state-law defamation actionagainst petitioner Ulysses Tory. The state trial court determined that Tory (with the help of petitioner Ruth Craft andothers) had engaged in unlawful defamatory activity. It
found, for example, that Tory, while claiming falsely thatCochran owed him money, had complained to the local bar
association, had written Cochran threatening letters de-manding $10 million, had picketed Cochran's office holding
up signs containing various insults and obscenities; and, witha group of associates, had pursued Cochran while chanting
similar threats and insults. App. 38, 40-41. The court con-cluded that Tory's claim that Cochran owed him money was
without foundation, that Tory engaged in a continuous pat-tern of libelous and slanderous activity, and that Tory had

used false and defamatory speech to "coerce" Cochran intopaying "amounts of money to which Tory was not entitled"

as a "tribute" or a "premium" for "desisting" from this libel-ous and slanderous activity.

Id., at 39, 42-43.
After noting that Tory had indicated that he would con-tinue to engage in this activity in the absence of a court

order, the Superior Court issued a permanent injunction.
The injunction, among other things, prohibited Tory, Craft,and their "agents" or "representatives" from "picketing,"

from "displaying signs, placards or other written or printedmaterial," and from "orally uttering statements" about
Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., and about Cochran's law firm in "anypublic forum."

Id., at 34.
Tory and Craft appealed. The California Court of Appealaffirmed. Tory and Craft then filed a petition for a writ of

certiorari, raising the following question:

"Whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an ad-mitted public figure, violates the First Amendment."

agreeing to the substitution of Ms. Cochran. But they de-nied that the case was moot.

We agree with Tory and Craft that the case is not moot.Despite Johnnie Cochran's death, the injunction remains
in effect. Nothing in its language says to the contrary.
Cochran's counsel tells us that California law does not recognize a "cause of action for an injury to the memory of a
deceased person's reputation," see Kelly v. Johnson Pub. Co.,
160 Cal. App. 2d 718, 325 P. 2d 659 (1958), which circumstance, counsel believes, "moots" a "portion" of the injunc544US2 Unit: $U53 [03-10-06 19:19:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion (the portion "personal to Cochran"). Respondent's Sug-gestion of Death, etc., 4 (emphasis added). But counsel adds

that "[t]he [i]njunction continues to be necessary, valid andenforceable."

Id., at 9. The parties have not identified, nor
have we found, any source of California law that saysthe injunction here

automatically becomes invalid upon
Cochran's death, not even the portion personal to Cochran.
Counsel also points to the "value of " Cochran's "law prac-tice" and adds that his widow has an interest in enforcing

the injunction. Id., at 11-12. And, as we understand Cali-fornia law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is. See
Mason v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 60 Cal.
App. 2d 587, 591, 141 P. 2d 475, 477-478 (1943) ("[W]here the
party served believes" a court order "invalid he should take
the proper steps to have it dissolved"); People v. Gonzalez,
12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P. 2d 1366, 1375 (1996) ("[A] person
subject to a court's injunction may elect whether to challenge the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is
issued, or to reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a contempt of court"). Given the uncertainty of California law, we take it as a given that the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners'
speech, presenting an ongoing federal controversy. See,
e. g., Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486-487 (1965);
NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432-433 (1963). Consequently, we need not, and we do not, dismiss this case as
moot. Cf. Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U. S. 561, 569 (1984)
(case not moot in part because it appears from "terms" of
the injunction that it is "still in force" and "unless set aside
must be complied with").

At the same time, Johnnie Cochran's death makes it unnecessary, indeed unwarranted, for us to explore petitioners'
basic claims, namely, (1) that the First Amendment forbids the issuance of a permanent injunction in a defamation
case, at least when the plaintiff is a public figure, and (2) that

738 TORY v. COCHRAN

Opinion of the Court
the injunction (considered prior to Cochran's death) was
not properly tailored and consequently violated the First
Amendment. See Brief for Petitioners ii, iii. Rather, we
need only point out that the injunction, as written, has now
lost its underlying rationale. Since picketing Cochran and
his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech
could no longer achieve the objectives that the trial court
had in mind (i. e., coercing Cochran to pay a "tribute" for
desisting in this activity), the grounds for the injunction are
much diminished, if they have not disappeared altogether.
Consequently the injunction, as written, now amounts to an
overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible
justification. See Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S.
539, 559 (1976) ("[P]rior restraints on speech and publication
are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on
First Amendment rights"); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 390
(1973) (a prior restraint should not "swee[p]" any "more
broadly than necessary"). As such, the Constitution forbids
it. See Carroll v. President and Comm'rs of Princess
Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 183-184 (1968) (An "order" issued in
"the area of First Amendment rights" must be "precis[e]"
and narrowly "tailored" to achieve the "pin-pointed objective" of the "needs of the case"); see also Board of Airport
Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569,
575, 577 (1987) (regulation prohibiting "all `First Amendment
activities' " substantially overbroad).

We consequently grant the motion to substitute Sylvia
Dale Mason Cochran for Johnnie Cochran as respondent.
We vacate the judgment of the California Court of Appeal,
and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion. If, as the Cochran supplemental brief
suggests, injunctive relief may still be warranted, any appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief. We express
no view on the constitutional validity of any such new re544US2 Unit: $U53 [03-10-06 19:19:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
lief, tailored to these changed circumstances, should it beentered.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently
granted. We granted the writ, as the Court notes, to decide

"[w]hether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a def-amation action, preventing all future speech about an

admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment."Pet. for Cert. i;

ante, at 736.

Whether or not Johnnie Cochran's death moots this case, itcertainly renders the case an inappropriate vehicle for resolving the question presented. The Court recognizes this,
ante, at 737-738, but nevertheless vacates the judgment
below, ante, at 738. It does so only after deciding, as it mustto exercise jurisdiction, that in light of the uncertainty in

California law, the case is not moot. Ante, at 736-737;
ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989) (when
a case coming from a state court becomes moot, this Court
"lack[s] jurisdiction and thus also the power to disturb thestate court's judgment"); see also

City News & Novelty, Inc.
v. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283-284 (2001).In deciding the threshold mootness issue, a complicated

problem in its own right, the Court strains to reach the valid-ity of the injunction after Cochran's death. Whether the
injunction remains valid in these changed circumstances isneither the reason we took this case nor an important question, but merely a matter of case-specific error correction.Petitioners remain free to seek relief on both constitutional
and state-law grounds in the California courts. And, if the
injunction is invalid, they need not obey it: California does
not recognize the "collateral bar" rule, and thus permits collateral challenges to injunctions in contempt proceedings.

740 TORY v. COCHRAN

Thomas, J., dissenting
People v. Gonzalez, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P. 2d 1366, 1375(1996) (a person subject to an injunction may challenge "the

constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued,or . . . reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction
is charged as a contempt of court"). The California courtscan resolve the matter and, given the new state of affairs,
might very well adjudge the case moot or the injunction in-valid on state-law grounds rather than the constitutional
grounds the Court rushes to embrace. As a prudential mat-ter, the better course is to avoid passing unnecessarily on
the constitutional question. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297U. S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).

The Court purports to save petitioners the uncertainty ofpossible enforcement of the injunction, and thereby to prevent any chill on their First Amendment rights, by vacatingthe judgment below. But what the Court gives with the left
hand it takes with the right, for it only invites further litiga-tion by pronouncing that "injunctive relief may still be warranted," conceding that "any appropriate party remains freeto ask for such relief," and "express[ing] no view on the constitutional validity of any such new relief." Ante, at 738-739. What the Court means by "any appropriate party" is
unclear. Perhaps the Court means Sylvia Dale Mason Coch-ran, Cochran's widow, who has taken his place in this suit.
Or perhaps it means the Cochran firm, which has never beena party to this case, but may now (if "appropriate") intervene
and attempt to enjoin the defamation of a now-deceasedthird party. The Court's decision invites the doubts it seeks
to avoid. Its decision is unnecessary and potentially self-defeating. The more prudent course is to dismiss the writ
as improvidently granted. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.

In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heldthat respondent Derrick Quintero was entitled to federal habeas

Thomas, J., dissenting936
relief from his state-court conviction for escaping from prison.Because the Court of Appeals failed to follow this Court's decision
in Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685 (2002), I would grant the warden'spetition for certiorari and reverse.

Respondent was convicted in Kentucky state court of escapingfrom prison with two other inmates. The jury to which the Commonwealth tried him included seven members who had served ona jury that had convicted one of the other escapees, Billy Hall.
Respondent's trial counsel represented Hall at Hall's trial, whichwas held on October 16, 1989. Final Brief for Petitioner/Appellee
in No. 99-6724 (CA6), p. 7.Respondent was tried almost two months later, on December
11, together with the other escapee, James Blanton. Respondentand Blanton both admitted their factual guilt; their only defense
was that the escape was a necessary "choice of evils," becausethey were in imminent danger of physical harm while in prison.
Pet. for Cert. 5. The trial judge rejected that defense as a mat-ter of law and declined to submit it to the jury. Respondent did
not object to the composition of the jury on the ground that itcontained jurors who had participated in Hall's trial and therefore,
as a matter of state law, forfeited any claim of error based onthat ground.

Respondent sought federal habeas relief, claiming that the trialhad infringed his constitutional right to an impartial jury. Respondent argued that his counsel's failure to object to the composi-tion of the jury was ineffective assistance of counsel, thereby
excusing his forfeiture of the jury-bias claim. The Court of Ap-peals agreed and excused the procedural default, holding that
counsel's failure to object constituted per se ineffective assistanceof counsel under United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648 (1984).
Quintero v. Bell, 256 F. 3d 409, 413-415 (CA6 2001). Cronicestablished that certain failings of counsel justify a per se presumption of ineffectiveness, see 466 U. S., at 658-659, notwith-standing the general rule that to demonstrate ineffectiveness, a
defendant must show that his counsel's performance was bothdeficient and prejudicial, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.
668, 687 (1984).The Court of Appeals did not claim that counsel's failure to
object to the composition of the jury fell into one of the threecategories of error that Cronic recognized. See Cone, supra, at
695-696 (discussing Cronic's three categories). Instead, it rea544ORD Unit: $PT1 [11-08-07 06:50:07] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

Thomas, J., dissenting 544 U. S.
soned that Cronic applied because the biased jury was a "struc-tural error" exempt from harmless-error analysis, depriving the
trial of " `its character as a confrontation between adversaries.' "Quintero, supra, at 415 (quoting Cronic, supra, at 657). Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the state-courttrial had violated respondent's constitutional right to an impartial
jury, and affirmed the District Court's decision to grant respond-ent a conditional writ of habeas corpus. Quintero, supra, at
412-413, 416.We granted the warden's petition for certiorari, vacated the
Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded the case in light ofBell v. Cone, supra. Bell v. Quintero, 535 U. S. 1109 (2002). In
Cone, we reversed a Sixth Circuit decision that had misappliedCronic. Cone involved a habeas petitioner who had been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. At the penaltyphase of petitioner's trial, petitioner's lawyer called the jury's
attention to mitigating evidence that had been presented to itduring the guilt phase of the trial, showing petitioner's disturbed
mental state and drug addiction. 535 U. S., at 691. Neverthe-less, the Court of Appeals concluded that counsel had failed to
subject the case to " `meaningful adversarial testing' " at the pen-alty phase--one of the three recognized examples of Cronic error,
see 535 U. S., at 695-696--because counsel had failed to presentadditional mitigating evidence, and because counsel had waived
final argument. Cone v. Bell, 243 F. 3d 961, 979 (2001) (quotingCronic, supra, at 656). We reversed, reasoning:

"When we spoke in Cronic of the possibility of presumingprejudice based on an attorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case, we indicated that the attorney's failure mustbe complete. We said `if counsel entirely fails to subject
the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.'Cronic, supra, at 659 (emphasis added). Here, respondent's
argument is not that his counsel failed to oppose the prosecu-tion throughout the sentencing proceeding as a whole, but
that his counsel failed to do so at specific points. For pur-poses of distinguishing between the rule of Strickland and
that of Cronic, this difference is not of degree but of kind."535 U. S., at 696-697.

After we vacated and remanded its judgment in light of Cone,the Court of Appeals in the decision below again held that re544ORD Unit: $PT1 [11-08-07 06:50:07] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

Thomas, J., dissenting936
spondent's attorney had committed Cronic error. It reasonedthat "counsel's acquiescence in allowing seven jurors who had
convicted [respondent's] co-conspirators to sit in judgment of hiscase surely amounted to an abandonment of `meaningful adversarial testing' throughout the proceeding," and therefore was per seineffective assistance of counsel under Cronic. 368 F. 3d 892, 893
(CA6 2004) (quoting Cronic, supra, at 659; emphasis in original).For this reason, the Court of Appeals found the present case
distinguishable from Cone, once again excused respondent's proce-dural default, and reinstated its previous opinion and judgment.
368 F. 3d, at 893.The Court of Appeals committed the same error we corrected
in Cone. It held that respondent's counsel failed to subject hiscase to meaningful adversarial testing. Yet our decision in Cone
makes clear that for a court to "presum[e] prejudice based on anattorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case, . . . the attorney's
failure must be complete." 535 U. S., at 697; accord, Florida v.Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 190 (2004); French v. Jones, 332 F. 3d 430,
439 (CA6 2003). Here, counsel's failure was far from complete.Respondent's attorney extensively questioned the veniremen for
prior knowledge and bias, put on a necessity defense, cross-examined the Commonwealth's witnesses, made numerous motions and objections, and delivered a closing statement.* As in

Thomas, J., dissenting 544 U. S.
Cone, "respondent's argument is not that his counsel failed tooppose the prosecution throughout the [case] as a whole, but that
his counsel failed to do so at specific points"--namely, at the spe-cific point of jury selection. 535 U. S., at 697. The notion that
this discrete error amounts to a complete failure of meaningfuladversarial testing is flatly inconsistent with Cone's analysis,
though it does resemble the reasoning of the lone Cone dissenter.See id., at 716-717 (opinion of

Stevens, J.) (concluding that whenan error "concern[s] `points' that encompass all of counsel's fundamental duties at a capital sentencing proceeding . . . counsel hasfailed `entirely' " (emphasis in original)).

The Court of Appeals' holding also rests on a confusion--theidea that the presence of a structural error, by itself, is necessarily related to counsel's deficient performance and warrants a pre-sumption of prejudice. The Cronic presumption is based on the
notion that certain "circumstances . . . are so likely to prejudicethe accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular
case is unjustified." 466 U. S., at 658. Those exceptional circum-stances encompass instances in which counsel's poor performance
caused the defendant prejudice, not any prejudicial circumstancewhatsoever. See Cone, supra, at 695-696 (enumerating examples
of Cronic error, all involving circumstances related to whethercounsel's assistance was ineffective). Yet there is no close correlation between counsel's performance and whether a trial wasinfected with structural error, much less one so close as to justify
a presumption that counsel was ineffective. For example, evencompetent counsel may fail to object to a biased trial judge or to
the exclusion of grand jurors on the basis of the defendant's race.The structural nature of these defects, see Tumey v. Ohio, 273
U. S. 510, 535 (1927); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 262 (1986),says only that a serious error infected the trial, not that the error
resulted from counsel's ineffective assistance.The Court of Appeals' reasoning equally would apply even if
counsel's failure to object to the biased jurors were blameless andthe quality of his assistance high. See Quintero, 256 F. 3d, at
415. Even a competent defense lawyer may not have known thatthe jurors had served previously, for example, if the veniremen

were not forthcoming at voir dire. It is no answer to say thatit is obvious that counsel in this case should have objected to the
composition of the jury; the whole point of the Cronic presump-tion is to presume ineffectiveness without inquiring on a case-bycase, error-by-error basis into the wisdom of counsel's actual per-formance (and any resulting prejudice) under Strickland. The
fact that respondent had a potentially biased jury may well be aserious trial error. But it is not an error that warrants the per
se conclusion that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective.It is also far from clear on the present record that counsel's
failure to object to the biased nature of the jury was blameworthy.The Court of Appeals based its holding that counsel was ineffective on the implicit supposition that he knew that the seven jurorshad previously served, yet failed to object to their presence.
Quintero, supra, at 415. That assumption is not clearly correct.Almost two months elapsed between the trial of respondent's
coescapee, Billy Hall, and respondent's trial. Respondent's coun-sel was a public defender, and in the shuffle of a heavy caseload
may well have forgotten the names and faces of the seven jurorswho had served previously. Moreover, counsel extensively questioned the veniremen about possible bias, asked that veniremenbe disqualified because they had prior knowledge of the case, and
moved for a mistrial on the ground that the entire jury wastainted by pretrial publicity. See supra, at 939-940, n. Counsel's concern with these sources of jury bias is hard to squarewith the hypothesis that he knew that seven members of respondent's jury had served on Hall's jury, yet ignored such an obvioussource of jury bias. In any event, counsel's performance may
well have been deficient, but this lingering factual uncertaintyillustrates the danger of presuming--over a decade after the fact
and based on nothing more than a federal appellate court's read-ing of the cold record--that counsel's failure to object was per se
constitutionally ineffective.

* * *The Court of Appeals' decision is one of three Sixth Circuit

judgments that we vacated and remanded in light of Cone. SeeQuintero, 535 U. S. 1109; Mason v. Mitchell, 536 U. S. 901 (2002);
Jones v. French, 535 U. S. 1109 (2002). In all three, the SixthCircuit reinstated its previous opinion and again ordered the writs

325 F. 3d 732, 742-744 (2003) (again finding Cronic error); Frenchv. Jones, 332 F. 3d, at 436-439 (same). In Cone itself, the Sixth
Circuit reinstated its order affirming the grant of the writ, albeiton grounds independent of Cronic. See Cone v. Bell, 359 F. 3d
785, 799 (2004). These decisions were all dubious applications ofthis Court's precedents. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U. S. 447, 459-460

denial of certiorari). But in view of this series of questionableapplications of our precedent, especially of our first Cone opinion,
I would correct the Court of Appeals' latest error. I thereforerespectfully dissent.

Justice Stevens, respecting the denial of certiorari.
On several occasions in the past, I have found it appropriate toemphasize the fact that a denial of certiorari is not a ruling on

the merits of any issue raised by the petition.1 This is a casethat raises significant constitutional questions regarding the President's intrasession appointment of Judge William H. Pryor, Jr.,to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which occurred

1 See, e. g., Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. Cincinnati,
525 U. S. 943 (1998) (opinion of Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari);Brown v. Texas, 522 U. S. 940, 942 (1997) (same); Barber v. Tennessee, 513

U. S. 1184 (1995) (same); cf. Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 227 (1950)(Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("Nothing is more basic to the functioning of
this Court than an understanding that denial of certiorari is occasioned by avariety of reasons which precludes the implication that were the case here
the merits would go against the petitioner"); Maryland v. Baltimore RadioShow, 338 U. S. 912, 917-918 (1950) (opinion of Frankfurter, J., respecting
denial of certiorari).

during the 11-day President's Day break between February 12and 23, 2004.

2 However, this is also a case in which, as the Government has urged in its response, there are valid prudentialconcerns supporting the decision to deny certiorari. Those considerations include the fact that the particular type of appoint-ment in question is "the first such appointment of an Article III
judge" in nearly a half century,3 that petitioners seek review ofan interlocutory order,

4 and the fact that the Court of Appeals did

"not view the question of the constitutionality of Judge Pryor'sappointment as affecting jurisdiction."

5 Moreover, the court's citation to our decision in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868(1991), suggests that it viewed Judge Pryor's participation in the

decision of otherwise properly constituted three-judge panels asirrelevant to those panels' power to enter a valid judgment. See
387 F. 3d 1220, 1222, n. 1 (CA11 2004) (en banc).I agree that there are legitimate prudential reasons for denying
certiorari in this somewhat unusual case. That being said, itwould be a mistake to assume that our disposition of this petition
constitutes a decision on the merits of whether the President hasthe constitutional authority to fill future Article III vacancies,
such as vacancies on this Court, with appointments made absentconsent of the Senate during short intrasession "recesses."

Temporary stay heretofore entered is vacated. Justice Souterwould grant the application for stay of execution.

Because the State has not disputed the merits of petitioner'schallenge to the chemical protocol used by Missouri to carry out
lethal injections, I would grant the stay for the reasons statedin Judge Bye's dissenting opinion. 408 F. 3d 1027 (CA8 2005).
Assuming the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 applies, see94 Stat. 352, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a), the State conceded
at oral argument before the District Court that there is no avail-able remedy that the petitioner has failed to invoke.

PART III. JURISDICTION ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI
Rule 10. Considerations Governing Review onCertiorari

Review on a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, butof judicial discretion. A petition for a writ of certiorari will
be granted only for compelling reasons. The following, al-though neither controlling nor fully measuring the Court's
discretion, indicate the character of the reasons the Courtconsiders:

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1080 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT

(a) a United States court of appeals has entered a de-cision in conflict with the decision of another United

States court of appeals on the same important matter;has decided an important federal question in a way that
conflicts with a decision by a state court of last resort;or has so far departed from the accepted and usual
course of judicial proceedings, or sanctioned such a de-parture by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of
this Court's supervisory power;(b) a state court of last resort has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with thedecision of another state court of last resort or of a
United States court of appeals;(c) a state court or a United States court of appeals
has decided an important question of federal law thathas not been, but should be, settled by this Court, or
has decided an important federal question in a way thatconflicts with relevant decisions of this Court.

A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when theasserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or the
misapplication of a properly stated rule of law.
Rule 11. Certiorari to a United States Court of AppealsBefore Judgment

A petition for a writ of certiorari to review a case pendingin a United States court of appeals, before judgment is entered in that court, will be granted only upon a showing thatthe case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to requireimmediate determination in this Court. See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2101(e).
Rule 12. Review on Certiorari: How Sought; Parties

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Rule, the peti-tioner shall file 40 copies of a petition for a writ of certiorari,

prepared as required by Rule 33.1, and shall pay the Rule38(a) docket fee.

of certiorari prepared as required by Rule 33.2, togetherwith an original and 10 copies of the motion for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis. A copy of the motion shall pre-cede and be attached to each copy of the petition. An inmate confined in an institution, if proceeding in forma pauperis and not represented by counsel, need file only an
original petition and motion.3. Whether prepared under Rule 33.1 or Rule 33.2, the

petition shall comply in all respects with Rule 14 and shall

4. Parties interested jointly, severally, or otherwise in ajudgment may petition separately for a writ of certiorari; or
any two or more may join in a petition. A party not shownon the petition as joined therein at the time the petition is
filed may not later join in that petition. When two or morejudgments are sought to be reviewed on a writ of certiorari
to the same court and involve identical or closely related
questions, a single petition for a writ of certiorari coveringall the judgments suffices. A petition for a writ of certiorari

may not be joined with any other pleading, except that anymotion for leave to proceed

in forma pauperis shall be
attached.5. No more than 30 days after a case has been placed on

the docket, a respondent seeking to file a conditional cross-petition (

i. e., a cross-petition that otherwise would be untimely) shall file, with proof of service as required by Rule29, 40 copies of the cross-petition prepared as required by

Rule 33.1, except that a cross-petitioner proceeding in forma
pauperis under Rule 39 shall comply with Rule 12.2. The
cross-petition shall comply in all respects with this Rule and
Rule 14, except that material already reproduced in the ap544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1082 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
pendix to the opening petition need not be reproduced again.A cross-petitioning respondent shall pay the Rule 38(a)

docket fee or submit a motion for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis. The cover of the cross-petition shall indicate
clearly that it is a conditional cross-petition. The cross-petition then will be placed on the docket, subject to the

provisions of Rule 13.4. It is the cross-petitioner's duty tonotify all cross-respondents promptly, on a form supplied by
the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the cross-petitionwas placed on the docket, and the docket number of the
cross-petition. The notice shall be served as required by
Rule 29. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari may notbe joined with any other pleading, except that any motion

for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall be attached.The time to file a conditional cross-petition will not be
extended.6. All parties to the proceeding in the court whose judgment is sought to be reviewed are deemed parties entitledto file documents in this Court, unless the petitioner notifies
the Clerk of this Court in writing of the petitioner's beliefthat one or more of the parties below have no interest in the
outcome of the petition. A copy of such notice shall beserved as required by Rule 29 on all parties to the proceeding below. A party noted as no longer interested may remain a party by notifying the Clerk promptly, with serviceon the other parties, of an intention to remain a party. All

parties other than the petitioner are considered respondents,but any respondent who supports the position of a petitioner
shall meet the petitioner's time schedule for filing docu-ments, except that a response supporting the petition shall
be filed within 20 days after the case is placed on the docket,and that time will not be extended. Parties who file no document will not qualify for any relief from this Court.7. The clerk of the court having possession of the record
shall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it. In any document filed with this Court,
a party may cite or quote from the record, even if it has
not been transmitted to this Court. When requested by the

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1083RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit the record, or anypart of it, the clerk of the court having possession of the

record shall number the documents to be certified and shalltransmit therewith a numbered list specifically identifying
each document transmitted. If the record, or stipulated por-tions, have been printed for the use of the court below, that
printed record, plus the proceedings in the court below, maybe certified as the record unless one of the parties or the
Clerk of this Court requests otherwise. The record mayconsist of certified copies, but if the lower court is of the
view that original documents of any kind should be seen bythis Court, that court may provide by order for the transport, safekeeping, and return of such originals.
Rule 13. Review on Certiorari: Time for Petitioning

1. Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for a writof certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a state court of last resort or a United Statescourt of appeals (including the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) is timely when it is filed withthe Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of the
judgment. A petition for a writ of certiorari seeking reviewof a judgment of a lower state court that is subject to discretionary review by the state court of last resort is timelywhen it is filed with the Clerk within 90 days after entry of
the order denying discretionary review.2. The Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari that is jurisdictionally out of time. See, e. g., 28U. S. C. $ 2101(c).

3. The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runsfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be
reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (orits equivalent under local practice). But if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, or ifthe lower court appropriately entertains an untimely petition for rehearing or sua sponte considers rehearing, thetime to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties
(whether or not they requested rehearing or joined in the

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1084 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
petition for rehearing) runs from the date of the denial ofrehearing or, if rehearing is granted, the subsequent entry

of judgment.4. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is timely when
it is filed with the Clerk as provided in paragraphs 1, 3, and5 of this Rule, or in Rule 12.5. However, a conditional
cross-petition (which except for Rule 12.5 would be untimely)will not be granted unless another party's timely petition for
a writ of certiorari is granted.5. For good cause, a Justice may extend the time to file a
petition for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding 60days. An application to extend the time to file shall set out
the basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgmentsought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and any
order respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons whyan extension of time is justified. The application must be
filed with the Clerk at least 10 days before the date the peti-tion is due, except in extraordinary circumstances. For the
time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules 21,22, 30, and 33.2. An application to extend the time to file a
petition for a writ of certiorari is not favored.
Rule 14. Content of a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari

1. A petition for a writ of certiorari shall contain, in theorder indicated:

(a) The questions presented for review, expressed con-cisely in relation to the circumstances of the case, without
unnecessary detail. The questions should be short andshould not be argumentative or repetitive. If the petitioner
or respondent is under a death sentence that may be affectedby the disposition of the petition, the notation "capital case"
shall precede the questions presented. The questions shallbe set out on the first page following the cover, and no other
information may appear on that page. The statement of anyquestion presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary
question fairly included therein. Only the questions set outin the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered

The motion shall follow, insofar as applicable, the form for abrief in opposition prescribed by Rule 15, and shall comply

in all respects with Rule 21.7. The Clerk will distribute the jurisdictional statement to
the Court for its consideration upon receiving an expresswaiver of the right to file a motion to dismiss or to affirm or,
if no waiver or motion is filed, upon the expiration of thetime allowed for filing. If a motion to dismiss or to affirm

Court for its consideration no less than 10 days after the
motion is filed.

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1095RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
Court under paragraph 7 of this Rule will not be deferredpending its receipt. Forty copies shall be filed, except that

an appellant proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule 39,including an inmate of an institution, shall file the number of
copies required for a petition by such a person under Rule12.2. The brief shall be served as required by Rule 29.

9. If a cross-appeal has been docketed, distribution of bothjurisdictional statements will be deferred until the crossappeal is due for distribution under this Rule.10. Any party may file a supplemental brief at any time
while a jurisdictional statement is pending, calling attention
to new cases, new legislation, or other intervening matternot available at the time of the party's last filing. A supplemental brief shall be restricted to new matter and shall fol-low, insofar as applicable, the form for a brief in opposition
prescribed by Rule 15. Forty copies shall be filed, exceptthat a party proceeding

including an inmate of an institution, shall file the number ofcopies required for a petition by such a person under Rule

12.2. The supplemental brief shall be served as required byRule 29.

11. The clerk of the district court shall retain possessionof the record until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it. See Rule 12.7.

12. After considering the documents distributed underthis Rule, the Court may dispose summarily of the appeal on

the merits, note probable jurisdiction, or postpone consider-ation of jurisdiction until a hearing of the case on the merits.
If not disposed of summarily, the case stands for briefing andoral argument on the merits. If consideration of jurisdiction
is postponed, counsel, at the outset of their briefs and at oralargument, shall address the question of jurisdiction. If the
record has not previously been filed in this Court, the Clerkof this Court will request the clerk of the court in possession
of the record to certify and transmit it.

13. If the Clerk determines that a jurisdictional statement
submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not
comply with this Rule or with Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerk

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1096 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
will return it with a letter indicating the deficiency. If acorrected jurisdictional statement is received no more than

60 days after the date of the Clerk's letter, its filing will bedeemed timely.

Rule 19. Procedure on a Certified Question

1. A United States court of appeals may certify to thisCourt a question or proposition of law on which it seeks instruction for the proper decision of a case. The certificateshall contain a statement of the nature of the case and the
facts on which the question or proposition of law arises.Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, and
they shall be stated separately and with precision. The cer-tificate shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2 and shall
be signed by the clerk of the court of appeals.2. When a question is certified by a United States court
of appeals, this Court, on its own motion or that of a party,may consider and decide the entire matter in controversy.
See 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(2).3. When a question is certified, the Clerk will notify the
parties and docket the case. Counsel shall then enter theirappearances. After docketing, the Clerk will submit the
certificate to the Court for a preliminary examination to de-termine whether the case should be briefed, set for argument, or dismissed. No brief may be filed until the prelimi-nary examination of the certificate is completed.

4. If the Court orders the case briefed or set for argument,the parties will be notified and permitted to file briefs. The
Clerk of this Court then will request the clerk of the courtin possession of the record to certify and transmit it. Any
portion of the record to which the parties wish to direct theCourt's particular attention should be printed in a joint appendix, prepared in conformity with Rule 26 by the appellantor petitioner in the court of appeals, but the fact that any
part of the record has not been printed does not prevent theparties or the Court from relying on it.

5. A brief on the merits in a case involving a certifiedquestion shall comply with Rules 24, 25, and 33.1, except that

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1097RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
the brief for the party who is the appellant or petitioner
below shall be filed within 45 days of the order requiring
briefs or setting the case for argument.

Rule 20. Procedure on a Petition for an ExtraordinaryWrit

1. Issuance by the Court of an extraordinary writ authorized by 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a) is not a matter of right, but of
discretion sparingly exercised. To justify the granting of
any such writ, the petition must show that the writ will be
in aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction, that exceptional
circumstances warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained in
any other form or from any other court.

2. A petition seeking a writ authorized by 28 U. S. C.

$ 1651(a), $ 2241, or $ 2254(a) shall be prepared in all respects
as required by Rules 33 and 34. The petition shall be captioned "In re [name of petitioner]" and shall follow, insofar
as applicable, the form of a petition for a writ of certiorari
prescribed by Rule 14. All contentions in support of the
petition shall be included in the petition. The case will be
placed on the docket when 40 copies of the petition are filed
with the Clerk and the docket fee is paid, except that a petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule 39, including an inmate of an institution, shall file the number of copies
required for a petition by such a person under Rule 12.2,
together with a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, a copy of which shall precede and be attached to each
copy of the petition. The petition shall be served as required by Rule 29 (subject to subparagraph 4(b) of this Rule).

3. (a) A petition seeking a writ of prohibition, a writ of
mandamus, or both in the alternative shall state the name
and office or function of every person against whom relief is
sought and shall set out with particularity why the relief
sought is not available in any other court. A copy of the
judgment with respect to which the writ is sought, including
any related opinion, shall be appended to the petition to544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1098 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
gether with any other document essential to understandingthe petition.

(b) The petition shall be served on every party to the pro-ceeding with respect to which relief is sought. Within 30
days after the petition is placed on the docket, a party shallfile 40 copies of any brief or briefs in opposition thereto,
which shall comply fully with Rule 15. If a party named asa respondent does not wish to respond to the petition, that
party may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter.All persons served are deemed respondents for all purposes
in the proceedings in this Court.

4. (a) A petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus shallcomply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2242,

and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of$ 2242, which requires a statement of the "reasons for not
making application to the district court of the district inwhich the applicant is held." If the relief sought is from the
judgment of a state court, the petition shall set out specifi-cally how and where the petitioner has exhausted available
remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes withinthe provisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must showthat exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the
Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot
be obtained in any other form or from any other court. Thiswrit is rarely granted.

(b) Habeas corpus proceedings, except in capital cases, are
ex parte, unless the Court requires the respondent to show
cause why the petition for a writ of habeas corpus should notbe granted. A response, if ordered, or in a capital case, shall

comply fully with Rule 15. Neither the denial of the peti-tion, without more, nor an order of transfer to a district court
under the authority of 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(b), is an adjudicationon the merits, and therefore does not preclude further application to another court for the relief sought.

5. The Clerk will distribute the documents to the Court
for its consideration when a brief in opposition under subparagraph 3(b) of this Rule has been filed, when a response

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1099RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
under subparagraph 4(b) has been ordered and filed, whenthe time to file has expired, or when the right to file has been

expressly waived.6. If the Court orders the case set for argument, the Clerk
will notify the parties whether additional briefs are required,when they shall be filed, and, if the case involves a petition
for a common-law writ of certiorari, that the parties shallprepare a joint appendix in accordance with Rule 26.

PART V. MOTIONS AND APPLICATIONS
Rule 21. Motions to the Court

1. Every motion to the Court shall clearly state its pur-pose and the facts on which it is based and may present legal

Justice concerned if an individual Justice has authority togrant the sought relief.

2. The original and two copies of any application ad-dressed to an individual Justice shall be prepared as required
by Rule 33.2, and shall be accompanied by proof of serviceas required by Rule 29.

3. An application shall be addressed to the Justice allottedto the Circuit from which the case arises. When the Circuit
Justice is unavailable for any reason, the application ad-dressed to that Justice will be distributed to the Justice then
available who is next junior to the Circuit Justice; the turnof the Chief Justice follows that of the most junior Justice.

4. A Justice denying an application will note the denialthereon. Thereafter, unless action thereon is restricted by
law to the Circuit Justice or is untimely under Rule 30.2,the party making an application, except in the case of an
application for an extension of time, may renew it to anyother Justice, subject to the provisions of this Rule. Except

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1101RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
when the denial is without prejudice, a renewed application
is not favored. Renewed application is made by a letter to

5. A Justice to whom an application for a stay or for bail
is submitted may refer it to the Court for determination.

6. The Clerk will advise all parties concerned, by appropriately speedy means, of the disposition made of an
application.

Rule 23. Stays

1. A stay may be granted by a Justice as permitted by law.
2. A party to a judgment sought to be reviewed may present to a Justice an application to stay the enforcement of
that judgment. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(f).

3. An application for a stay shall set out with particularity
why the relief sought is not available from any other court
or judge. Except in the most extraordinary circumstances,
an application for a stay will not be entertained unless the

opinion, if any, and a copy of the order, if any, of the court
or judge below denying the relief sought, and shall set out
specific reasons why a stay is justified. The form and content of an application for a stay are governed by Rules 22
and 33.2.

1. A brief on the merits for a petitioner or an appellantshall comply in all respects with Rules 33.1 and 34 and shall

contain in the order here indicated:(a) The questions presented for review under Rule 14.1(a).
The questions shall be set out on the first page following thecover, and no other information may appear on that page.
The phrasing of the questions presented need not be identi-cal with that in the petition for a writ of certiorari or the
jurisdictional statement, but the brief may not raise addi-tional questions or change the substance of the questions
already presented in those documents. At its option, how-ever, the Court may consider a plain error not among the
questions presented but evident from the record and other-wise within its jurisdiction to decide.

(b) A list of all parties to the proceeding in the courtwhose judgment is under review (unless the caption of the
case in this Court contains the names of all parties). Anyamended corporate disclosure statement as required by Rule
29.6 shall be placed here.(c) If the brief exceeds five pages, a table of contents and
a table of cited authorities.(d) Citations of the official and unofficial reports of the
opinions and orders entered in the case by courts and admin-istrative agencies.

(e) A concise statement of the basis for jurisdiction in thisCourt, including the statutory provisions and time factors on
which jurisdiction rests.(f) The constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, ordinances, and regulations involved in the case, set out verba-tim with appropriate citation. If the provisions involved are
lengthy, their citation alone suffices at this point, and theirpertinent text, if not already set out in the petition for a

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1103RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or an appendix to
either document, shall be set out in an appendix to the brief.

(g) A concise statement of the case, setting out the facts
material to the consideration of the questions presented,
with appropriate references to the joint appendix, e. g., App.
12, or to the record, e. g., Record 12.

(h) A summary of the argument, suitably paragraphed.
The summary should be a clear and concise condensation of
the argument made in the body of the brief; mere repetition
of the headings under which the argument is arranged is
not sufficient.

(i) The argument, exhibiting clearly the points of fact and
of law presented and citing the authorities and statutes relied on.

( j) A conclusion specifying with particularity the relief
the party seeks.

2. A brief on the merits for a respondent or an appellee
shall conform to the foregoing requirements, except that
items required by subparagraphs 1(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g)
of this Rule need not be included unless the respondent or
appellee is dissatisfied with their presentation by the opposing party.

3. A brief on the merits may not exceed the page limitations specified in Rule 33.1(g). An appendix to a brief may
include only relevant material, and counsel are cautioned not
to include in an appendix arguments or citations that properly belong in the body of the brief.

4. A reply brief shall conform to those portions of this
Rule applicable to the brief for a respondent or an appellee,
but, if appropriately divided by topical headings, need not
contain a summary of the argument.

5. A reference to the joint appendix or to the record set
out in any brief shall indicate the appropriate page number.
If the reference is to an exhibit, the page numbers at which
the exhibit appears, at which it was offered in evidence, and
at which it was ruled on by the judge shall be indicated, e. g.,
Pl. Exh. 14, Record 199, 2134.

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1104 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT

Time to File

1. The petitioner or appellant shall file 40 copies of the
brief on the merits within 45 days of the order granting the
writ of certiorari, noting probable jurisdiction, or postponing
consideration of jurisdiction. Any respondent or appellee

4. The time periods stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
Rule may be extended as provided in Rule 30. An application to extend the time to file a brief on the merits is not
favored. If a case is advanced for hearing, the time to file
briefs on the merits may be abridged as circumstances require pursuant to an order of the Court on its own motion or
that of a party.

5. A party wishing to present late authorities, newly enacted legislation, or other intervening matter that was not

petitioner or appellant, within 45 days after entry of theorder granting the writ of certiorari, noting probable jurisdiction, or postponing consideration of jurisdiction, shall file40 copies of a joint appendix, prepared as required by Rule
33.1. The joint appendix shall contain: (1) the relevantdocket entries in all the courts below; (2) any relevant pleadings, jury instructions, findings, conclusions, or opinions; (3)the judgment, order, or decision under review; and (4) any
other parts of the record that the parties particularly wish tobring to the Court's attention. Any of the foregoing items
already reproduced in a petition for a writ of certiorari, ju-risdictional statement, brief in opposition to a petition for a
writ of certiorari, motion to dismiss or affirm, or any appen-dix to the foregoing, that was prepared as required by Rule
33.1, need not be reproduced again in the joint appendix.The petitioner or appellant shall serve three copies of the
joint appendix on each of the other parties to the proceedingas required by Rule 29.

2. The parties are encouraged to agree on the contents ofthe joint appendix. In the absence of agreement, the petitioner or appellant, within 10 days after entry of the ordergranting the writ of certiorari, noting probable jurisdiction,
or postponing consideration of jurisdiction, shall serve on therespondent or appellee a designation of parts of the record
to be included in the joint appendix. Within 10 days afterreceiving the designation, a respondent or appellee who considers the parts of the record so designated insufficient shallserve on the petitioner or appellant a designation of additional parts to be included in the joint appendix, and the

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1106 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
petitioner or appellant shall include the parts so designated.If the Court has permitted the respondent or appellee to

proceed in forma pauperis, the petitioner or appellant mayseek by motion to be excused from printing portions of the
record the petitioner or appellant considers unnecessary. Inmaking these designations, counsel should include only those
materials the Court should examine; unnecessary designa-tions should be avoided. The record is on file with the Clerk
and available to the Justices, and counsel may refer in briefsand in oral argument to relevant portions of the record not
included in the joint appendix.

3. When the joint appendix is filed, the petitioner or appel-lant immediately shall file with the Clerk a statement of the

cost of printing 50 copies and shall serve a copy of the state-ment on each of the other parties as required by Rule 29.
Unless the parties agree otherwise, the cost of producingthe joint appendix shall be paid initially by the petitioner or
appellant; but a petitioner or appellant who considers thatparts of the record designated by the respondent or appellee
are unnecessary for the determination of the issues pre-sented may so advise the respondent or appellee, who then
shall advance the cost of printing the additional parts, unlessthe Court or a Justice otherwise fixes the initial allocation of
the costs. The cost of printing the joint appendix is taxed
as a cost in the case, but if a party unnecessarily causes mat-ter to be included in the joint appendix or prints excessive

copies, the Court may impose these costs on that party.4. (a) On the parties' request, the Clerk may allow preparation of the joint appendix to be deferred until after thebriefs have been filed. In that event, the petitioner or appellant shall file the joint appendix no more than 14 daysafter receiving the brief for the respondent or appellee.
The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this Rule shall befollowed, except that the designations referred to therein
shall be made by each party when that party's brief is
served. Deferral of the joint appendix is not favored.

(b) If the deferred method is used, the briefs on the merits
may refer to the pages of the record. In that event, the

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES

1107RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
joint appendix shall include in brackets on each page thereofthe page number of the record where that material may be

found. A party wishing to refer directly to the pages of thejoint appendix may serve and file copies of its brief prepared
as required by Rule 33.2 within the time provided by Rule25, with appropriate references to the pages of the record.
In that event, within 10 days after the joint appendix is filed,copies of the brief prepared as required by Rule 33.1 containing references to the pages of the joint appendix in place of,or in addition to, the initial references to the pages of the
record, shall be served and filed. No other change may be
made in the brief as initially served and filed, except thattypographical errors may be corrected.

5. The joint appendix shall be prefaced by a table of con-tents showing the parts of the record that it contains, in the
order in which the parts are set out, with references to thepages of the joint appendix at which each part begins. The
relevant docket entries shall be set out after the table ofcontents, followed by the other parts of the record in chronological order. When testimony contained in the reporter'stranscript of proceedings is set out in the joint appendix, the
page of the transcript at which the testimony appears shallbe indicated in brackets immediately before the statement
that is set out. Omissions in the transcript or in any other
document printed in the joint appendix shall be indicated byasterisks. Immaterial formal matters (

e. g., captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments) shall be omitted. A questionand its answer may be contained in a single paragraph.

6. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the joint appendixmay be contained in a separate volume or volumes suitably
indexed. The transcript of a proceeding before an adminis-trative agency, board, commission, or officer used in an action
in a district court or court of appeals is regarded as an ex-hibit for the purposes of this paragraph.

7. The Court, on its own motion or that of a party, may
dispense with the requirement of a joint appendix and may
permit a case to be heard on the original record (with such
copies of the record, or relevant parts thereof, as the Court

544US2RULE 10-18-07 17:10:25 PGT * USRULES
1108 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
may require) or on the appendix used in the court below, ifit conforms to the requirements of this Rule.

in advance of each argument session for the convenience ofcounsel and the information of the public.

3. The Court, on its own motion or that of a party, mayorder that two or more cases involving the same or related
questions be argued together as one case or on such otherterms as the Court may prescribe.

Rule 28. Oral Argument

1. Oral argument should emphasize and clarify the writtenarguments in the briefs on the merits. Counsel should assume that all Justices have read the briefs before oral argu-ment. Oral argument read from a prepared text is not
favored.2. The petitioner or appellant shall open and may conclude
the argument. A cross-writ of certiorari or cross-appealwill be argued with the initial writ of certiorari or appeal as
one case in the time allowed for that one case, and the Courtwill advise the parties who shall open and close.

3. Unless the Court directs otherwise, each side is allowedone-half hour for argument. Counsel is not required to use
all the allotted time. Any request for additional time toargue shall be presented by motion under Rule 21 no more
than 15 days after the petitioner's or appellant's brief on themerits is filed, and shall set out specifically and concisely why
the case cannot be presented within the half-hour limitation.Additional time is rarely accorded.

of substance for rebuttal.6. Oral argument will not be allowed on behalf of any
party for whom a brief has not been filed.7. By leave of the Court, and subject to paragraph 4 of
this Rule, counsel for an amicus curiae whose brief has beenfiled as provided in Rule 37 may argue orally on the side of
a party, with the consent of that party. In the absence ofconsent, counsel for an

amicus curiae may seek leave of theCourt to argue orally by a motion setting out specifically and

concisely why oral argument would provide assistance tothe Court not otherwise available. Such a motion will be
granted only in the most extraordinary circumstances.

by any other applicable federal statute.

judgment is directed to be entered. Interest in cases aris-ing in a court of the United States is allowed at the interest
rate authorized by law.2. When a petition for a writ of certiorari, an appeal,
or an application for other relief is frivolous, the Courtmay award the respondent or appellee just damages, and

4. In a case involving a certified question, costs are equallydivided unless the Court otherwise orders, except that if the
Court decides the whole matter in controversy, as permittedby Rule 19.2, costs are allowed as provided in paragraphs 1
and 2 of this Rule.5. To the extent permitted by 28 U. S. C. $ 2412, costs
under this Rule are allowed for or against the United Statesor an officer or agent thereof, unless expressly waived or
unless the Court otherwise orders.6. When costs are allowed in this Court, the Clerk will

shall be served as required by Rule 29. The petition shallbe presented together with certification of counsel (or of a

1128 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
by counsel). A copy of the certificate shall follow and be
attached to each copy of the petition. A petition for rehearing is not subject to oral argument and will not be granted
except by a majority of the Court, at the instance of a Justice
who concurred in the judgment or decision.

2. Any petition for the rehearing of an order denying a
petition for a writ of certiorari or extraordinary writ shall
be filed within 25 days after the date of the order of denial
and shall comply with all the form and filing requirements of
paragraph 1 of this Rule, including the payment of the filing
fee if required, but its grounds shall be limited to intervening
circumstances of a substantial or controlling effect or to
other substantial grounds not previously presented. The
petition shall be presented together with certification of
counsel (or of a party unrepresented by counsel) that it is
restricted to the grounds specified in this paragraph and that
it is presented in good faith and not for delay; one copy of
the certificate shall bear the signature of counsel (or of a
party unrepresented by counsel). The certificate shall be

submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not
comply with this Rule or Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerk will
return it with a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected
petition for rehearing received no more than 15 days after
the date of the Clerk's letter will be deemed timely.

3. In a case on review from any court of the United States,
as defined by 28 U. S. C. $ 451, a formal mandate does not

opinion or order of this Court and a certified copy of the

and signed by this Court's Clerk, will provide for costs if
any are awarded. In all other respects, the provisions of

reference to the Court, will enter an order of dismissal.

2. (a) A petitioner or appellant may file a motion to dismiss the case, with proof of service as required by Rule 29,
tendering to the Clerk any fees due and costs payable. No
more than 15 days after service thereof, an adverse party
may file an objection, limited to the amount of damages and
costs in this Court alleged to be payable or to showing that
the moving party does not represent all petitioners or appellants. The Clerk will not file any objection not so limited.

(b) When the objection asserts that the moving party does
not represent all the petitioners or appellants, the party
moving for dismissal may file a reply within 10 days, after

1130 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT

which time the matter will be submitted to the Court forits determination.

(c) If no objection is filed--or if upon objection going onlyto the amount of damages and costs in this Court, the party
moving for dismissal tenders the additional damages andcosts in full within 10 days of the demand therefor--the
Clerk, without further reference to the Court, will enter anorder of dismissal. If, after objection as to the amount of
damages and costs in this Court, the moving party does notrespond by a tender within 10 days, the Clerk will report
the matter to the Court for its determination.3. No mandate or other process will issue on a dismissal
under this Rule without an order of the Court.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

IN CHAMBERS

MULTIMEDIA HOLDINGS CORP., dba FIRST COAST
NEWS v. CIRCUIT COURT OF FLORIDA, ST. JOHNS

COUNTY

on application for stay
No. 04A773. Decided April 15, 2005
An application to stay two Florida Circuit Court orders on the ground that

they restrict applicant television network from publishing transcripts of
grand jury proceedings is denied. The first order, issued after the
court discovered that copies of a transcript had been released to the
press in apparent violation of Fla. Stat. $ 905.27, directed that no party
could further disclose the transcript's contents to a person not authorized by that law. The second order denied applicant's motion to intervene and set the first order aside as an unconstitutional prior restraint;
noted that the order applied only to the parties; and concluded that
applicant was not restrained from publishing the materials, though to
do so might constitute further violations of the law. The State Court
of Appeal denied review. The record here does not sufficiently establish that applicant is enjoined by or otherwise subject to the orders or
that any threat to applicant is real or substantial. Assuming that the
first order constituted a prior restraint, any chilling effect it had on
speech was substantially diminished by the second order, which indicates that the court directed its order only to the parties to the action
and which forecloses interpreting the first order to put applicant on
notice that future publication would place it in contempt. Nor is applicant's fear of prosecution well founded. Since the state attorney, not
the judge, has the authority to prosecute violations of the Florida law,
the court's orders are not a prerequisite to prosecution. Applicant has
not demonstrated that prosecution is any more likely because of the
orders, and the State has suggested that it will not prosecute further
publication of the transcript.

1302 MULTIMEDIA HOLDINGS CORP. v. CIRCUIT COURT

OF FLA., ST. JOHNS CTY.

Opinion in Chambers

Justice Kennedy, Circuit Justice.
This is an application for a stay of orders of the Seventh
Judicial Circuit Court of St. Johns County, Florida. The applicant, First Coast News, alleges the orders restrict its publication of the contents of transcripts of grand jury proceedings held in a criminal prosecution for murder. First Coast
News is a local television network that has been covering the
prosecution. For reasons to be discussed, the application is
denied.

I

Two orders are at issue. The first was entered July 30,
2004. It states the court had discovered that copies of the
transcript of certain testimony before the grand jury had
been released to members of the press as well as to investigators from the St. Johns County Sheriff 's Office, in apparent
violation of Fla. Stat. $ 905.27 (2003). Section 905.27 generally prohibits the disclosure of grand jury testimony, with
certain exceptions. As relevant here, the order directs that
"[n]o party shall further disclose the contents of the transcript of testimony before the Grand Jury to any person not
authorized by F. S. 905.27(2)." Order Sealing Transcript,
etc., in No. 04001748 CF (Fla. Cir. Ct., July 30, 2004), p. 2,
App. in Support of Stay Application, Tab 5 (hereinafter July
30 Order). It further provides that "[a]ll persons who have
obtained a copy of the transcript are placed on notice that
any broadcast, publication, disclosure or communication of
the contents of this transcript is a violation of F. S. 905.27,
punishable as a misdemeanor in addition to constituting
grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court." Ibid. Applicant alleges it received a copy of this order from the court.
See Application to Stay Prior Restraint Order 3.

Applicant moved to intervene and set aside the July 30
Order as an unconstitutional prior restraint. This appears
to have prompted the trial court to enter a second order.

1303Cite as: 544 U. S. 1301 (2005)
Opinion in Chambers
The order, entered August 9, 2004, notes that "[a]t no point
in the Court's [July 30 Order] is [applicant] precluded or restrained from publishing matters which are public record,
nor is [applicant] enjoined or restrained from broadcasting
matters in this case. The [July 30 Order] clearly provides
that the parties to this action are enjoined from further disclosing the contents of the transcript of testimony before the
Grand Jury to any person not authorized by F. S. 905.27(2).
The parties to this action are the State of Florida . . . and
defense counsel." Order on Motion to Intervene, etc., in
No. CF04-1478 (Fla. Cir. Ct., Aug. 9, 2004), pp. 1-2, App. in
Support of Stay Application, Tab 10 (hereinafter Aug. 9
Order). The court declined to hold a hearing on applicant's
motion because "the Court's order does not enjoin the [applicant] from publishing or broadcasting materials that it
wishes to publish or broadcast, but rather solely points out
that so to do might constitute further violations of criminal
law." Id., at 2. The court denied applicant's motion to intervene and its motion to set aside the July 30 Order.

Applicant sought review in the Fifth District Court of Appeal of Florida, which denied, without comment, applicant's
"Emergency Petition for Writ of Certiorari." On the basis
that the Fifth District Court of Appeal's denial is not appealable to the Florida Supreme Court, see Fla. Rule App.
Proc. 9.030(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2005), applicant filed with me as Circuit Justice an application for a stay of the orders, urging
that they operate as a prior restraint in violation of the First
and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The application for a stay is denied. It is not sufficiently established on this record that applicant is enjoined
by or otherwise subject to the orders in question or that any
threat to it is real or substantial; hence it is unlikely that,
despite indications that a prior restraint may have been imposed at the time of the first order, four Members of the
Court would vote to grant certiorari.

1304 MULTIMEDIA HOLDINGS CORP. v. CIRCUIT COURT

OF FLA., ST. JOHNS CTY.

Opinion in Chambers

II
Applicant argues that the orders operate as a prior re-straint because they threaten prosecution for future disclosures of the transcript and for contempt of court for anyfuture publication. Specifically, the July 30 Order, at 2,
places "[a]ll persons who have obtained a copy of the tran-script . . . on notice that any broadcast, publication, disclosure
or communication of the contents of this transcript is a viola-tion of F. S. 905.27, punishable as a misdemeanor in addition
to constituting grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court."This would apply to applicant, as it fell within the class of
persons who had obtained a copy of the transcript.A threat of prosecution or criminal contempt against a specific publication raises special First Amendment concerns,for it may chill protected speech much like an injunction
against speech by putting that party at an added risk of lia-bility. The court's first order was not accompanied by notice
or hearing or any other of the usual safeguards of the judicialprocess. It bears many of the marks of a prior restraint.
See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58 (1963).The first order is of further concern because it singles out
this applicant and could be interpreted to place it on noticethat publication of grand jury testimony in the underlying
case could subject it to prosecution or place it in contempt ofcourt. Assuming that order constituted a prior restraint,
however, any chilling effect it had on speech was substantially diminished by the court's second order.That second order indicates that the court was directing

its order only to the conduct of those who are parties to theunderlying action. Applicant is not a party. See Aug. 9
Order, at 1 ("The Court's order clearly provides that theparties to this action are enjoined . . . ");

id., at 2 ("[T]he
Court's order does not enjoin the movant [applicant] in thiscase . . . "). In this respect the orders themselves, by their

terms, do not prohibit speech by this applicant.

544US1 Unit: UIC3 [10-18-07 17:04:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

1305Cite as: 544 U. S. 1301 (2005)
Opinion in Chambers
In addition, the second order forecloses interpreting the
first order to put applicant on notice that future publication
would place it in contempt. It notes that "the Court's order
does not enjoin [applicant] from publishing or broadcasting
materials that it wishes to . . . but rather solely points out
that so to do might constitute further violations of criminal
law." Ibid.

To the extent the court's orders might suggest a particular
animus toward applicant, that, too, has abated by virtue of
the fact that the judge who entered them has retired from
judicial service.

Applicant argues that aside from the possibility of being
held in contempt, it fears prosecution by virtue of the orders.
Although it is true that "[p]eople do not lightly disregard
public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings," Bantam Books, supra, at 68, there is no suggestion that the judge who entered the orders here could institute such a proceeding. In Florida, it does not appear that
the court may itself institute a prosecution for a violation of
Fla. Stat. $ 905.27 (2003). The decision to charge and prosecute is an executive responsibility, and the state attorney has
complete discretion in deciding whether and how to do so.
See State v. Bloom, 497 So. 2d 2, 3 (Fla. 1986) (citing Fla.
Const., Art. II, $ 3). See also State v. Johns, 651 So. 2d 1227,
1228 (Fla. App. 1995) ("The decision of whether to prosecute
for a criminal offense is a function of the executive authority,
not the trial court"). The court's orders are thus not a prerequisite to prosecution, nor does the application demonstrate that prosecution is any more likely because of them.
If prosecutors deemed applicant's future publication to constitute a violation of Fla. Stat. $ 905.27 (2003), they would be
free to prosecute applicant with or without the court's orders. The court recognized as much when it stated in its
Aug. 9 Order, at 2, that "[t]he question of whether the publication or broadcast of this information is a crime, is one

Opinion in Chambers

which must be left up to further investigation and properprosecution."

Although the State has not guaranteed applicant immunityfrom prosecution for future publication of the transcript, it
has suggested that further publication will not be prose-cuted. See State's Response to Application to Stay Prior
Restraint Order 4-5 ("Because the State Attorney did notbelieve that Petitioner violated the grand jury secrecy statute . . . further publication of the grand jury transcript wouldnot have resulted in prosecution").

True, informal procedures undertaken by officials and de-signed to chill expression can constitute a prior restraint.
See Bantam Books, supra. Warnings from a court haveadded weight, and this too has a bearing on whether there
is a prior restraint. If it were to be shown that even thesecond order might give a reporter or television station singled out earlier any real cause for concern, the case for inter-vention would be stronger. It appears, however, that any
threat once implicit in the court's first order is much dimin-ished. The two orders, issued by a judge no longer in office,
appear to have been isolated phenomena, not a regular orcustomary practice. Cf. ibid. Under these circumstances,
in my view, there is no reasonable probability this Courtwould grant a writ of certiorari. See Graves v. Barnes, 405
U. S. 1201, 1203 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers). The appli-cation for a stay of the orders pending the filing of a petition
for a writ of certiorari is denied. It is so ordered.

of Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260--that government regulation of private property "effects a [compensable] taking if [it] does not
substantially advance legitimate state interests"--which was used to
strike down a Hawaii statute limiting rent that oil companies could charge
dealers leasing their service stations is not an appropriate test for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking. Lingle
v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., p. 528.

1. Armed Career Criminal Act--Enhanced sentences for firearm possession.--Inquiry under Act--which mandates an enhanced sentence for a
felon possessing a firearm after three prior convictions for, inter alia,
violent felonies--to determine whether a prior guilty plea to burglary defined by a nongeneric state statute necessarily admitted elements of generic offense is limited to terms of charging document, to terms of a plea
agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which
defendant confirmed factual basis for plea, or to some comparable judicial
record. Shepard v. United States, p. 13.

2. Convicted felons--Firearm possession.--Title 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1),
which forbids a felon "convicted in any court" from possessing a firearm,
applies only to convictions entered in a domestic court, not to foreign convictions. Small v. United States, p. 385.

3. Elements of "corrup[t] persuas[ion]" conviction--Jury instructions.--At petitioner auditor's trial for destroying documents relating to
Enron Corporation's financial difficulties, jury instructions failed to convey properly elements of a conviction under 18 U. S. C. $$ 1512(b)(2)(A)
and (B), which prohibit "knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[ing] another
person . . . with intent to . . . cause" that person to "withhold" documents
from, or "alter" documents for use in, an "official proceeding." Arthur
Andersen LLP v. United States, p. 696.

4. Wire fraud--Foreign government's tax revenue.--A plot to defraud
a foreign government of tax revenue violates federal wire fraud statute,
and a prosecution for such fraud does not derogate from common-law revenue rule barring courts from enforcing foreign sovereigns' tax laws. Pasquantino v. United States, p. 349.

1. Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996--Capital
murder--Mitigation evidence.--Ninth Circuit's decision to affirm District
Court's grant of habeas relief to respondent state prisoner, on ground that
jury instructions at penalty phase of his capital case had not permitted
consideration of all mitigation evidence, was contrary to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(1)'s limits on federal habeas review. Brown v. Payton, p. 133.

2. Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1966--Statute of
limitations.-- Petitioner's federal habeas petition is barred by AEDPA's
statute of limitations because it was filed beyond deadline and is not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling for time his untimely state postconviction petition was pending. Pace v. DiGuglielmo, p. 408.

3. Mixed petitions--Federal district court authority to stay petition.--
A federal district court has discretion to stay a mixed habeas petition to
allow a petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to a state court in
first instance and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition. Rhines v. Weber, p. 269.

4. Statute of limitations--Enhanced sentence--Underlying conviction
vacated.--Where a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on
ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since
been vacated, 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, || 6(4)'s 1-year limitations period begins to
run when petitioner receives notice of order vacating prior conviction,
provided that he has sought it with due diligence in state court after entry
of judgment in federal case in which sentence was enhanced. Johnson v.
United States, p. 295.

HAWAII. See Constitutional Law, VII.
IMMIGRATION. See Constitutional Law, VI.
INDIANS.

Tribes' ancient sovereignty--Federal Indian law and equity practice.--Given longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central New
York State and its inhabitants, regulatory authority over area constantly
exercised by State and its municipalities for 200 years, and respondent
Tribe's long delay in seeking relief against parties other than United
States, standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice preclude Tribe from unilaterally reviving its ancient sovereignty, in whole or
in part, by reacquiring parcels of land within its historic reservation
through open-market purchases. City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation
of N. Y., p. 197.

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. See Bankruptcy.
INJUNCTIONS.

Party's death--Continuing rationale for injunction.--Cochran's widow
is substituted as respondent; but injunction prohibiting petitioners from,
e. g., picketing Cochran's law firm has lost its rationale because they can
no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting this activity. Tory v. Cochran, p. 734.

INTERSTATE COMMERCE. See Constitutional Law, I.

Federal district courts--Rooker-Feldman doctrine.--Doctrine precludes federal district court jurisdiction only in cases of same kind as
Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, and District of Columbia

losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered
before federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district
court review and rejection of those judgments. Exxon Mobil Corp. v.
Saudi Basic Industries Corp., p. 280.

Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act--Farmers' claims

petitioner farmers' defective design, defective manufacture, negligent
testing, and breach of express warranty claims against respondent pesticide producer were not premised on such requirements and are thus not
pre-empted; while their fraud and negligent-failure-to-warn claims are
based on common-law rules that qualify as labeling and packaging requirements, Court of Appeals should resolve in first instance whether those
claims are pre-empted. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, p. 431.
