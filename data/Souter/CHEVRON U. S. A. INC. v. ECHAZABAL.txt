A regulation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission authorizes refusal to hire an individual because hisperformance on the job would endanger his own health,owing to a disability. The question in this case is whetherthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 328,42 U. S. C. $ 12101et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V), permits theregulation.1 We hold that it does.IBeginning in 1972, respondent Mario Echazabal workedfor independent contractors at an oil refinery owned by petitioner Chevron U. S. A. Inc. Twice he applied for a job di-rectly with Chevron, which offered to hire him if he couldpass the company's physical examination. See 42 U. S. C.$ 12112(d)(3) (1994 ed.). Each time, the exam showed liverabnormality or damage, the cause eventually being identifiedas Hepatitis C, which Chevron's doctors said would be aggravated by continued exposure to toxins at Chevron's refinery.In each instance, the company withdrew the offer, and thesecond time it asked the contractor employing Echazabaleither to reassign him to a job without exposure to harmfulchemicals or to remove him from the refinery altogether.The contractor laid him off in early 1996.Echazabal filed suit, ultimately removed to federal court,claiming, among other things, that Chevron violated theAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA or Act) in refusing to1 We do not consider the further issue passed upon by the Ninth Circuit,which held that the respondent is a " `qualified individual' " who "can perform the essential functions of the employment position," 42 U. S. C.$ 12111(8) (1994 ed.). 226 F. 3d 1063, 1072 (2000). That issue will onlyresurface if the Circuit concludes that the decision of respondent's employer to exclude him was not based on the sort of individualized medicalenquiry required by the regulation, an issue on which the District Courtgranted summary judgment for petitioner and which we leave to the NinthCircuit for initial appellate consideration if warranted.536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN77Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the Courthire him, or even to let him continue working in the plant,because of a disability, his liver condition.2 Chevron defended under a regulation of the Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission (EEOC) permitting the defense that aworker's disability on the job would pose a "direct threat" tohis health, see 29 CFR $ 1630.15(b)(2) (2001). Although twomedical witnesses disputed Chevron's judgment that Echaza-bal's liver function was impaired and subject to further damage under the job conditions in the refinery, the DistrictCourt granted summary judgment for Chevron. It heldthat Echazabal raised no genuine issue of material fact as towhether the company acted reasonably in relying on its owndoctors' medical advice, regardless of its accuracy.On appeal, the Ninth Circuit asked for briefs on a threshold question not raised before, whether the EEOC's regula-tion recognizing a threat-to-self defense,ibid., exceeded thescope of permissible rulemaking under the ADA. 226 F. 3d1063, 1066, n. 3 (2000). The Circuit held that it did and re-versed the summary judgment. The court rested its position on the text of the ADA itself in explicitly recognizingan employer's right to adopt an employment qualificationbarring anyone whose disability would place others in theworkplace at risk, while saying nothing about threats to thedisabled employee himself. The majority opinion reasonedthat "by specifying only threats to `other individuals in theworkplace,' the statute makes it clear that threats to otherpersons--including the disabled individual himself--are notincluded within the scope of the [direct threat] defense," id.,at 1066-1067, and it indicated that any such regulation wouldunreasonably conflict with congressional policy against pa-ternalism in the workplace,id., at 1067-1070. The courtwent on to reject Chevron's further argument that Echaza2 Chevron did not dispute for purposes of its summary-judgment motionthat Echazabal is "disabled" under the ADA, and Echazabal did not arguethat Chevron could have made a " `reasonable accommodation.'

American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F. 3d 446, 447 (1996),and raised tension with the Seventh Circuit case of Koshinski v. Decatur Foundry, Inc., 177 F. 3d 599, 603 (1999). Wegranted certiorari, 534 U. S. 991 (2001), and now reverse.IISection 102 of the ADA, 104 Stat. 328, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101et seq., prohibits "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability . . . in regardto" a number of actions by an employer, including "hiring."42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a). The statutory definition of "discriminat[ion]" covers a number of things an employer might do toblock a disabled person from advancing in the workplace,such as "using qualification standards . . . that screen outor tend to screen out an individual with a disability."$ 12112(b)(6). By that same definition, ibid., as well as byseparate provision, $ 12113(a), the Act creates an affirmativedefense for action under a qualification standard "shown tobe job-related for the position in question and . . . consistentwith business necessity." Such a standard may include"a requirement that an individual shall not pose a directthreat to the health or safety of other individuals in theworkplace," $ 12113(b), if the individual cannot perform thejob safely with reasonable accommodation, $ 12113(a). Byregulation, the EEOC carries the defense one step further,in allowing an employer to screen out a potential workerwith a disability not only for risks that he would pose toothers in the workplace but for risks on the job to his ownhealth or safety as well: "The term `qualification standard'may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN79Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the Courta direct threat to the health or safety of the individual orothers in the workplace." 29 CFR $ 1630.15(b)(2) (2001).Chevron relies on the regulation here, since it says a jobin the refinery would pose a "direct threat" to Echazabal'shealth. In seeking deference to the agency, it argues thatnothing in the statute unambiguously precludes such a defense, while the regulation was adopted under authorityexplicitly delegated by Congress, 42 U. S. C. $ 12116, andafter notice-and-comment rulemaking. See United States v.Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 227 (2001); Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,842-844 (1984). Echazabal, on the contrary, argues that asa matter of law the statute precludes the regulation, whichhe claims would be an unreasonable interpretation even ifthe agency had leeway to go beyond the literal text.AAs for the textual bar to any agency action as a matterof law, Echazabal says that Chevron loses on the thresholdquestion whether the statute leaves a gap for the EEOC tofill. See id., at 843-844. Echazabal recognizes the generality of the language providing for a defense when a plaintiffis screened out by "qualification standards" that are "jobrelated and consistent with business necessity" (and reason-able accommodation would not cure the difficulty posed byemployment). 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a). Without more, thoseprovisions would allow an employer to turn away someonewhose work would pose a serious risk to himself. That pos-sibility is said to be eliminated, however, by the further specification that " `qualification standards' may include a re-quirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat tothe health or safety of other individuals in the workplace."$ 12113(b); see also $ 12111(3) (defining "direct threat" interms of risk to others). Echazabal contrasts this provisionwith an EEOC regulation under the Rehabilitation Act of1973, 87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 701 et seq., ante536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN80 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABALOpinion of the Courtdating the ADA, which recognized an employer's right toconsider threats both to other workers and to the threatening employee himself. Because the ADA defense provisionrecognizes threats only if they extend to another, Echazabalreads the statute to imply as a matter of law that threats tothe worker himself cannot count.The argument follows the reliance of the Ninth Circuit ma-jority on the interpretive canon,expressio unius est exclusioalterius, "expressing one item of [an] associated group orseries excludes another left unmentioned." United Statesv. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65 (2002). The rule is fine when itapplies, but this case joins some others in showing whenit does not. See, e. g., ibid.; United Dominion Industries,Inc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 836 (2001); Pauley v.BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 703 (1991).The first strike against the expression-exclusion rule hereis right in the text that Echazabal quotes. Congress included the harm-to-others provision as an example of legit-imate qualifications that are "job-related and consistent withbusiness necessity." These are spacious defensive catego-ries, which seem to give an agency (or in the absence ofagency action, a court) a good deal of discretion in settingthe limits of permissible qualification standards. That discretion is confirmed, if not magnified, by the provision that"qualification standards" falling within the limits of job relation and business necessity "may include" a veto on thosewho would directly threaten others in the workplace. Farfrom supporting Echazabal's position, the expansive phrasingof "may include" points directly away from the sort of exclusive specification he claims. United States v. New YorkTelephone Co., 434 U. S. 159, 169 (1977); Federal Land Bankof St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941).33 In saying that the expansive textual phrases point in the direction ofagency leeway we do not mean that the defense provisions place no limiton agency rulemaking. Without deciding whether all safety-related qualification standards must satisfy the ADA's direct-threat standard, see Al536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN81Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the CourtJust as statutory language suggesting exclusiveness ismissing, so is that essential extrastatutory ingredient of anexpression-exclusion demonstration, the series of terms fromwhich an omission bespeaks a negative implication. Thecanon depends on identifying a series of two or more termsor things that should be understood to go hand in hand,which is abridged in circumstances supporting a sensibleinference that the term left out must have been meant to beexcluded. E. Crawford, Construction of Statutes 337 (1940)(expressio unius " `properly applies only when in the naturalassociation of ideas in the mind of the reader that which isexpressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to thatwhich is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmativeinference' " (quoting State ex rel. Curtis v. De Corps, 134Ohio St. 295, 299, 16 N. E. 2d 459, 462 (1938))); United Statesv. Vonn, supra.Strike two in this case is the failure to identify any suchestablished series, including both threats to others andthreats to self, from which Congress appears to have madea deliberate choice to omit the latter item as a signal of theaffirmative defense's scope. The closest Echazabal comes isthe EEOC's rule interpreting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 701et seq., a precursorof the ADA. That statute excepts from the definition of aprotected "qualified individual with a handicap" anyone whowould pose a "direct threat to the health or safety of otherindividuals," but, like the later ADA, the Rehabilitationbertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U. S. 555, 569-570, n. 15 (1999), we assume that some such regulations are implicitly precluded by the Act'sspecification of a direct-threat defense, such as those allowing "indirect"threats of "insignificant" harm. This is so because the definitional anddefense provisions describing the defense in terms of "direct" threats of"significant" harm, 42 U. S. C. $$ 12113(b), 12111(3), are obviously intendedto forbid qualifications that screen out by reference to general categoriespretextually applied. See infra, at 85-86, and n. 5. Recognizing the "indirect" and "insignificant" would simply reopen the door to pretext byway of defense.536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN82 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABALOpinion of the CourtAct says nothing about threats to self that particular em-ployment might pose. 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(b). The EEOCnonetheless extended the exception to cover threat-to-selfemployment, 29 CFR $ 1613.702(f ) (1990), and Echazabal argues that Congress's adoption only of the threat-to-othersexception in the ADA must have been a deliberate omission of the Rehabilitation Act regulation's tandem term ofthreat-to-self, with intent to exclude it.But two reasons stand in the way of treating the omissionas an unequivocal implication of congressional intent. Thefirst is that the EEOC was not the only agency interpretingthe Rehabilitation Act, with the consequence that its regulation did not establish a clear, standard pairing of threats toself and others. While the EEOC did amplify upon the textof the Rehabilitation Act exclusion by recognizing threats toself along with threats to others, three other agencies adopting regulations under the Rehabilitation Act did not. See28 CFR $ 42.540(l)(1) (1990) (Department of Justice), 29 CFR$ 32.3 (1990) (Department of Labor), and 45 CFR $ 84.3(k)(1)(1990) (Department of Health and Human Services).4 Itwould be a stretch, then, to say that there was a standardusage, with its source in agency practice or elsewhere, thatconnected threats to others so closely to threats to self thatleaving out one was like ignoring a twin.Even if we put aside this variety of administrative experience, however, and look no further than the EEOC's Rehabil4 In fact, we have said that the regulations issued by the Department ofHealth and Human Services, which had previously been the regulationsof the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are of "particularsignificance" in interpreting the Rehabilitation Act because "HEW wasthe agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 794," prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities by recipients of federalfunds. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U. S. 184, 195 (2002).Unfortunately for Echazabal's argument, the congruence of the ADA withthe HEW regulations does not produce an unequivocal statement of congressional intent.536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN83Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the Courtitation Act regulation pairing self and others, the congres-sional choice to speak only of threats to others would still beequivocal. Consider what the ADA reference to threats toothers might have meant on somewhat different facts. Ifthe Rehabilitation Act had spoken only of "threats to health"and the EEOC regulation had read that to mean threats toself or others, a congressional choice to be more specific inthe ADA by listing threats to others but not threats to selfwould have carried a message. The most probable readingwould have been that Congress understood what a failureto specify could lead to and had made a choice to limit thepossibilities. The statutory basis for any agency rulemaking under the ADA would have been different from itsbasis under the Rehabilitation Act and would have indicateda difference in the agency's rulemaking discretion. Butthese are not the circumstances here. Instead of makingthe ADA different from the Rehabilitation Act on the pointat issue, Congress used identical language, knowing full wellwhat the EEOC had made of that language under the earlierstatute. Did Congress mean to imply that the agency hadbeen wrong in reading the earlier language to allow it torecognize threats to self, or did Congress just assumethat the agency was free to do under the ADA what it hadalready done under the earlier Act's identical language?There is no way to tell. Omitting the EEOC's reference toself-harm while using the very language that the EEOChad read as consistent with recognizing self-harm is equivocal at best. No negative inference is possible.There is even a third strike against applying theexpression-exclusion rule here. It is simply that there is noapparent stopping point to the argument that by specifyinga threat-to-others defense Congress intended a negativeimplication about those whose safety could be considered.When Congress specified threats to others in the workplace,for example, could it possibly have meant that an employercould not defend a refusal to hire when a worker's disability536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN84 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABALOpinion of the Courtwould threaten others outside the workplace? If TyphoidMary had come under the ADA, would a meat packer havebeen defenseless if Mary had sued after being turned away?See 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(d). Expressio unius just fails towork here. BSince Congress has not spoken exhaustively on threats toa worker's own health, the agency regulation can claim adherence under the rule in Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, so longas it makes sense of the statutory defense for qualificationstandards that are "job-related and consistent with businessnecessity." 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a). Chevron's reasons forcalling the regulation reasonable are unsurprising: moralconcerns aside, it wishes to avoid time lost to sickness, excessive turnover from medical retirement or death, litigationunder state tort law, and the risk of violating the nationalOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590,as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 651et seq. Although Echazabalclaims that none of these reasons is legitimate, focusing onthe concern with OSHA will be enough to show that theregulation is entitled to survive.Echazabal points out that there is no known instance ofOSHA enforcement, or even threatened enforcement, againstan employer who relied on the ADA to hire a worker willingto accept a risk to himself from his disability on the job. InEchazabal's mind, this shows that invoking OSHA policy andpossible OSHA liability is just a red herring to excuse covertdiscrimination. But there is another side to this. The textof OSHA itself says its point is "to assure so far as possibleevery working man and woman in the Nation safe andhealthful working conditions," $ 651(b), and Congress specifically obligated an employer to "furnish to each of his em-ployees employment and a place of employment which arefree from recognized hazards that are causing or are likelyto cause death or serious physical harm to his employees," $ 654(a)(1). Although there may be an open question536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN85Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the Courtwhether an employer would actually be liable under OSHAfor hiring an individual who knowingly consented to the particular dangers the job would pose to him, see Brief forUnited States et al. as Amici Curiae 19, n. 7, there is nodenying that the employer would be asking for trouble: hisdecision to hire would put Congress's policy in the ADA, adisabled individual's right to operate on equal terms withinthe workplace, at loggerheads with the competing policy ofOSHA, to ensure the safety of "each" and "every" worker.Courts would, of course, resolve the tension if there wereno agency action, but the EEOC's resolution exemplifies thesubstantive choices that agencies are expected to make whenCongress leaves the intersection of competing objectivesboth imprecisely marked but subject to the administrativeleeway found in 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a).Nor can the EEOC's resolution be fairly called unreasonable as allowing the kind of workplace paternalism the ADAwas meant to outlaw. It is true that Congress had paternalism in its sights when it passed the ADA, see $ 12101(a)(5)(recognizing "overprotective rules and policies" as a form ofdiscrimination). But the EEOC has taken this to mean thatCongress was not aiming at an employer's refusal to placedisabled workers at a specifically demonstrated risk, but wastrying to get at refusals to give an even break to classes ofdisabled people, while claiming to act for their own good inreliance on untested and pretextual stereotypes.5 Its regu5 Echazabal's contention that the Act's legislative history is to the contrary is unpersuasive. Although some of the comments within the legislative history decry paternalism in general terms, see, e. g., H. R. Rep.No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 72 (1990) ("It is critical that paternalistic concernsfor the disabled person's own safety not be used to disqualify an otherwisequalified applicant"); ADA Conf. Rep., 136 Cong. Rec. 17377 (1990) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) ("[A]n employer could not use as an excuse for nothiring a person with HIV disease the claim that the employer was simply`protecting the individual' from opportunistic diseases to which the individual might be exposed"), those comments that elaborate actually expressthe more pointed concern that such justifications are usually pretextual,536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN86 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABALOpinion of the Courtlation disallows just this sort of sham protection, throughdemands for a particularized enquiry into the harms the employee would probably face. The direct threat defense mustbe "based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies onthe most current medical knowledge and/or the best avail-able objective evidence," and upon an expressly "individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safelyperform the essential functions of the job," reached afterconsidering, among other things, the imminence of the riskand the severity of the harm portended. 29 CFR $ 1630.2(r)(2001). The EEOC was certainly acting within the reason-able zone when it saw a difference between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risksto the employee himself, even if the employee would take hischances for the sake of getting a job.6rooted in generalities and misperceptions about disabilities. See, e. g.,H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, at 74 ("Generalized fear about risks from theemployment environment, such as exacerbation of the disability caused bystress, cannot be used by an employer to disqualify a person with a disability"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 28 (1989) ("It would also be a violation todeny employment to an applicant based on generalized fears about thesafety of the applicant . . . . By definition, such fears are based on averages and group-based predictions. This legislation requires individualized assessments").Similarly, Echazabal points to several of our decisions expressing concern under Title VII, which like the ADA allows employers to defendotherwise discriminatory practices that are "consistent with business necessity," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(k), with employers adopting rules that exclude women from jobs that are seen as too risky. See, e. g., Dothardv. Rawlinson, 433 U. S. 321, 335 (1977); Automobile Workers v. JohnsonControls, Inc., 499 U. S. 187, 202 (1991). Those cases, however, are besidethe point, as they, like Title VII generally, were concerned with paternalistic judgments based on the broad category of gender, while the EEOC hasrequired that judgments based on the direct threat provision be made onthe basis of individualized risk assessments.6 Respect for this distinction does not entail the requirement, as Echazabal claims, that qualification standards be "neutral," stating what the jobrequires, as distinct from a worker's disqualifying characteristics. Brieffor Respondent 26. It is just as much business necessity for skyscraper536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN87Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)Opinion of the CourtFinally, our conclusions that some regulation is permissi-ble and this one is reasonable are not open to Echazabal'sobjection that they reduce the direct threat provision to"surplusage," see Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 698 (1995). The merefact that a threat-to-self defense reasonably falls within thegeneral "job related" and "business necessity" standard doesnot mean that Congress accomplished nothing with its explicit provision for a defense based on threats to others.The provision made a conclusion clear that might otherwisehave been fought over in litigation or administrative rule-making. It did not lack a job to do merely because theEEOC might have adopted the same rule later in applyingthe general defense provisions, nor was its job any less responsible simply because the agency was left with the optionto go a step further. A provision can be useful even withoutcongressional attention being indispensable.Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court ofAppeals and remand the case for proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
