Jefferson did not collect or remitthe sales taxes for tickets it had sold in Oklahoma for bustravel from Oklahoma to other States, although it did collectand remit the taxes for all tickets it had sold in Oklahomafor travel that originated and terminated within that State.After Jefferson filed for bankruptcy protection on October27, 1989, petitioner, Oklahoma Tax Commission, filed proofof claims in Bankruptcy Court for the uncollected taxes fortickets for interstate travel sold by Jefferson.2 Jeffersoncited the Commerce Clause in objecting to the claims, andargued that the tax imposes an undue burden on interstatecommerce by permitting Oklahoma to collect a percentage ofthe full purchase price of all tickets for interstate bus travel,even though some of that value derives from bus travelthrough other States. The tax also presents the danger ofmultiple taxation, Jefferson claimed, because any other Statethrough which a bus travels while providing the services soldin Oklahoma will be able to impose taxes of their own uponJefferson or its passengers for use of the roads.The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Jefferson, the DistrictCourt affirmed, and so did the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Eighth Circuit.In re Jefferson Lines, Inc., 15including railroads both steam and electric, motor transportation companies, taxicab companies, pullman car companies, airlines, and other meansof transportation for hire."

Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34, 44 (1927) (dissenting opinion).In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with JusticeStone's opinion inWestern Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,303 U.

The Court had no trouble rejecting the claimthat the "mere formation of the contract between persons indifferent states" insulated the receipts from taxation, Western Live Stock, 303 U.

This nice distinction was abandoned priorto the New Jersey Bell case in Philadelphia & Southern S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U.

Themore "vexed question," however, was one that today wewould call a question of apportionment: whether the inter-state circulation of the journal barred taxation of receiptsfrom advertisements enhanced in value by the journal's widedissemination.Id., at 254. After rebuffing any such chal-lenge on the ground that the burden on interstate commercewas "too remote and too attenuated" in the light of analogoustaxation of railroad property, id., at 259, Justice Stone provided an "added reason" for sustaining the tax:"So far as the value contributed to appellants' New Mex-ico business by circulation of the magazine interstate istaxed, it cannot again be taxed elsewhere any more thanthe value of railroad property taxed locally. The tax isnot one which in form or substance can be repeated byother states in such manner as to lay an added burdenon the interstate distribution of the magazine." Id., at260.The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of thecommerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even thoughit increases the cost of doing the business." Id., at 254.Soon after Western Live Stock, the Court expressly restedthe invalidation of an unapportioned gross receipts tax onthe ground that it violated the prohibition against multipletaxation:"The vice of the statute as applied to receipts frominterstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure,without apportionment, receipts derived from activitiesin interstate commerce; and that the exaction is of sucha character that if lawful it may in substance be laid tothe fullest extent by States in which the goods are soldas well as those in which they are manufactured."

Henneford, 305 U. S.434, 438-439 (1939).After a brief resurgence of the old absolutism that pro-scribed all taxation formally levied upon interstate commerce, see Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946); SpectorMotor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), theCourt returned toWestern Live Stock's multiple taxationrule in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), and we categorically abandonedthe latter-day formalism when Complete Auto Transit, Inc.v.Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), overruled Spector and Freeman. In Complete Auto, a business engaged in transport-ing cars manufactured outside the taxing State to dealerswithin it challenged a franchise tax assessed equally on allgross income derived from transportation for hire within theState. The taxpayer's challenge resting solely on the factthat the State had taxed the privilege of engaging in an in-terstate commercial activity was turned back, and in sustaining the tax, we explicitly returned to our prior decisions that"considered not the formal language of the tax statutebut rather its practical effect, and have sustained a taxagainst Commerce Clause challenge when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with thetaxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminateagainst interstate commerce, and is fairly related to theservices provided by the State." 430 U. S., at 279.Since then, we have often applied, and somewhat refined,what has come to be known as Complete Auto's four-parttest. See, e. g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989) (taxon telephone calls); D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S.24 (1988) (use tax); Container Corp. of America v. FranchiseTax Bd., 463 U.

JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIIIAIt has long been settled that a sale of tangible goods hasa sufficient nexus to the State in which the sale is consummated to be treated as a local transaction taxable by thatState. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309U. S. 33 (1940) (upholding tax on sale of coal shipped intotaxing State by seller). So, too, in addressing the interstateprovision of services, we recently held that a State in whichan interstate telephone call originates or terminates has therequisite Commerce Clause nexus to tax a customer's pur-chase of that call as long as the call is billed or charged to aservice address, or paid by an addressee, within the taxingState.Goldberg, supra, at 263. Oklahoma's tax falls com-fortably within these rules. Oklahoma is where the ticketis purchased, and the service originates there. These factsare enough for concluding that "[t]here is `nexus' aplentyhere." See D. H. Holmes, supra, at 33. Indeed, the tax-payer does not deny Oklahoma's substantial nexus to the instate portion of the bus service, but rather argues that nexusto the State is insufficient as to the portion of travel outsideits borders. This point, however, goes to the second prongofComplete Auto, to which we turn.BThe difficult question in this case is whether the tax isproperly apportioned within the meaning of the secondprong of Complete Auto's test, "the central purpose [ofwhich] is to ensure that each State taxes only its fair shareof an interstate transaction." Goldberg, supra, at 260-261.This principle of fair share is the lineal descendant of Western Live Stock's prohibition of multiple taxation, which isthreatened whenever one State's act of overreaching combines with the possibility that another State will claim itsfair share of the value taxed: the portion of value by which514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT185Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the Courtone State exceeded its fair share would be taxed again by aState properly laying claim to it.For over a decade now, we have assessed any threat ofmalapportionment by asking whether the tax is "internallyconsistent" and, if so, whether it is "externally consistent" aswell. See Goldberg, supra, at 261; Container Corp., supra,at 169. Internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every otherState would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. This test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax,but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to seewhether its identical application by every State in the Unionwould place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate. A failure of internal consistency shows as a matter of law that a State is attemptingto take more than its fair share of taxes from the interstatetransaction, since allowing such a tax in one State wouldplace interstate commerce at the mercy of those remainingStates that might impose an identical tax. See Gwin,White & Prince, 305 U. S., at 439. There is no failure of itin this case, however. If every State were to impose a taxidentical to Oklahoma's, that is, a tax on ticket sales withinthe State for travel originating there, no sale would be subject to more than one State's tax.External consistency, on the other hand, looks not to thelogical consequences of cloning, but to the economic justification for the State's claim upon the value taxed, to discoverwhether a State's tax reaches beyond that portion of valuethat is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State. See Goldberg, supra, at 262; Container Corp.,supra, at 169-170. Here, the threat of real multiple taxation(though not by literally identical statutes) may indicate aState's impermissible overreaching. It is to this less tidyworld of real taxation that we turn now, and at length.514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT186 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Court1The very term "apportionment" tends to conjure up alloca-tion by percentages, and where taxation of income from interstate business is in issue, apportionment disputes haveoften centered around specific formulas for slicing a taxablepie among several States in which the taxpayer's activitiescontributed to taxable value. InMoorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair,437 U. S. 267 (1978), for example, we considered whetherIowa could measure an interstate corporation's taxable in-come by attributing income to business within the State " `inthat proportion which the gross sales made within the statebear to the total gross sales.' "Id., at 270. We held that itcould. In Container Corp., we decided whether Californiacould constitutionally compute taxable income assignable toa multijurisdictional enterprise's in-state activity by apportioning its combined business income according to a formula"based, in equal parts, on the proportion of [such] business'total payroll, property, and sales which are located in thetaxing State." 463 U. S., at 170. Again, we held that itcould. Finally, in Central Greyhound, we held that NewYork's taxation of an interstate bus line's gross receipts wasconstitutionally limited to that portion reflecting miles trav-eled within the taxing jurisdiction. 334 U. S., at 663.In reviewing sales taxes for fair share, however, we havehad to set a different course. A sale of goods is most readilyviewed as a discrete event facilitated by the laws and ameni-ties of the place of sale, and the transaction itself does notreadily reveal the extent to which completed or anticipatedinterstate activity affects the value on which a buyer istaxed. We have therefore consistently approved taxation ofsales without any division of the tax base among differentStates, and have instead held such taxes properly measura-ble by the gross charge for the purchase, regardless of anyactivity outside the taxing jurisdiction that might have pre-ceded the sale or might occur in the future. See,e. g., Mc-Goldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., supra.514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT187Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the CourtSuch has been the rule even when the parties to a salescontract specifically contemplated interstate movement ofthe goods either immediately before, or after, the transfer ofownership. See,e. g., Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept.of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986) (upholding sales tax on airplane fuel); State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Pacific States CastIron Pipe Co., 372 U. S. 605 (1963) (per curiam) (upholdingtax on sale that contemplated purchaser's interstate ship-ment of goods immediately after sale). The sale, we held,was "an activity which . . . is subject to the state taxingpower" so long as taxation did not "discriminat[e]" againstor "obstruc[t]" interstate commerce, Berwind-White, 309U. S., at 58, and we found a sufficient safeguard against therisk of impermissible multiple taxation of a sale in the factthat it was consummated in only one State. As we put it inBerwind-White, a necessary condition for imposing the taxwas the occurrence of "a local activity, delivery of goodswithin the State upon their purchase for consumption."Ibid. So conceived, a sales tax on coal, for example, couldnot be repeated by other States, for the same coal was notimagined ever to be delivered in two States at once. Conversely, we held that a sales tax could not validly be imposedif the purchaser already had obtained title to the goods asthey were shipped from outside the taxing State into thetaxing State by common carrier. McLeod v. J. E. DilworthCo., 322 U. S. 327 (1944). The out-of-state seller in that case"was through selling" outside the taxing State. Id., at 330.In other words, the very conception of the common sales taxon goods, operating on the transfer of ownership and possession at a particular time and place, insulated the buyer fromany threat of further taxation of the transaction.In deriving this rule covering taxation to a buyer on salesof goods we were not, of course, oblivious to the possibilityof successive taxation of related events up and down thestream of commerce, and our cases are implicit with the understanding that the Commerce Clause does not forbid the514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT188 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtactual assessment of a succession of taxes by different Stateson distinct events as the same tangible object flows along.Thus, it is a truism that a sales tax to the buyer does notpreclude a tax to the seller upon the income earned from asale, and there is no constitutional trouble inherent in theimposition of a sales tax in the State of delivery to the customer, even though the State of origin of the thing sold mayhave assessed a property or severance tax on it. SeeBerwind-White, 309 U. S., at 53; cf. Commonwealth EdisonCo. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981) (upholding severancetax on coal mined within the taxing State). In light of thissettled treatment of taxes on sales of goods and other succes-sive taxes related through the stream of commerce, it is fairto say that because the taxable event of the consummatedsale of goods has been found to be properly treated asunique, an internally consistent, conventional sales tax haslong been held to be externally consistent as well.2A sale of services can ordinarily be treated as a local stateevent just as readily as a sale of tangible goods can be located solely within the State of delivery. Cf. Goldberg v.Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989). Although our decisional law onsales of services is less developed than on sales of goods, onecategory of cases dealing with taxation of gross sales re-ceipts in the hands of a seller of services supports the viewthat the taxable event is wholly local. Thus we have heldthat the entire gross receipts derived from sales of servicesto be performed wholly in one State are taxable by thatState, notwithstanding that the contract for performance ofthe services has been entered into across state lines withcustomers who reside outside the taxing State. WesternLive Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938). So,too, as we have already noted, even where interstate circulation contributes to the value of magazine advertising pur-chased by the customer, we have held that the CommerceClause does not preclude a tax on its full value by the State514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT189Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the Courtof publication. Id., at 254, 258-259. And where the services are performed upon tangible items retrieved from anddelivered to out-of-state customers, the business performingthe services may be taxed on the full gross receipts fromthe services, because they were performed wholly within thetaxing State. Department of Treasury of Ind. v. IngramRichardson Mfg. Co. of Ind., 313 U. S. 252 (1941). Interstateactivity may be essential to a substantial portion of the valueof the services in the first case and essential to performanceof the services in the second, but sales with at least partialperformance in the taxing State justify that State's taxationof the transaction's entire gross receipts in the hands of theseller. On the analogy sometimes drawn between sales andgross receipts taxes, see International Harvester Co. v. Department of Treasury, 322 U. S. 340, 347-348 (1944); but seeNorton Co. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 340 U. S. 534,537 (1951), there would be no reason to suppose that a different apportionment would be feasible or required when thetax falls not on the seller but on the buyer.Cases on gross receipts from sales of services include onefalling into quite a different category, however, and it is onthis decision that the taxpayer relies for an analogy said tocontrol the resolution of the case before us. In 1948, theCourt decided Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334U. S. 653, striking down New York's gross receipts tax ontransportation services imposed without further apportionment on the total receipts from New York sales of bus services, almost half of which were actually provided by carriagethrough neighboring New Jersey and Pennsylvania. TheCourt held the statute fatally flawed by the failure to apportion taxable receipts in the same proportions that milestraveled through the various States bore to the total. Thesimilarity of Central Greyhound to this case is, of course,striking, and on the assumption that the economic significance of a gross receipts tax is indistinguishable from a taxon sales the Court of Appeals held that a similar mileage514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT190 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtapportionment is required here, see 15 F. 3d, at 92-93, as thetaxpayer now argues.We, however, think that Central Greyhound provides thewrong analogy for answering the sales tax apportionmentquestion here. To be sure, the two cases involve the identi-cal services, and apportionment by mileage per State isequally feasible in each. But the two diverge crucially inthe identity of the taxpayers and the consequent opportunities that are understood to exist for multiple taxation of thesame taxpayer.Central Greyhound did not rest simply onthe mathematical and administrative feasibility of a mileageapportionment, but on the Court's express understandingthat the seller-taxpayer was exposed to taxation by New Jersey and Pennsylvania on portions of the same receipts thatNew York was taxing in their entirety. The Court thus understood the gross receipts tax to be simply a variety of taxon income, which was required to be apportioned to reflectthe location of the various interstate activities by which itwas earned. This understanding is presumably the reasonthat the Central Greyhound Court said nothing about thearguably local character of the levy on the sales transaction.5 Instead, the Court heeded Berwind-White's warn-ing about "[p]rivilege taxes requiring a percentage of thegross receipts from interstate transportation," which "if sus-tained, could be imposed wherever the interstate activityoccurs . . . ." 309 U. S., at 45-46, n. 2.Here, in contrast, the tax falls on the buyer of the services,who is no more subject to double taxation on the sale of theseservices than the buyer of goods would be. The taxableevent comprises agreement, payment, and delivery of someof the services in the taxing State; no other State can claimto be the site of the same combination. The economic activ-ity represented by the receipt of the ticket for "consumption"in the form of commencement and partial provision of the5 Although New York's tax reached the gross receipts only from ticketsales within New York State, 334 U. S., at 664, 666 (Murphy, J., dissenting),the majority makes no mention of this fact.514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT191Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the Courttransportation thus closely resembles Berwind-White's "de-livery of goods within the State upon their purchase for consumption," id., at 58, especially given that full "consumption"or "use" of the purchased goods within the taxing State hasnever been a condition for taxing a sale of those goods. Al-though the taxpayer seeks to discount these resemblancesby arguing that sale does not occur until delivery is made,nothing in our case law supports the view that when deliveryis made by services provided over time and through space aseparate sale occurs at each moment of delivery, or wheneach State's segment of transportation State by State is com-plete. The analysis should not lose touch with the commonunderstanding of a sale, see Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 262; thecombined events of payment for a ticket and its delivery forpresent commencement of a trip are commonly understoodto suffice for a sale.In sum, the sales taxation here is not open to the doubletaxation analysis on which Central Greyhound turned, andthat decision does not control. Before we classify the Okla-homa tax with standard taxes on sales of goods, and withthe taxes on less complicated sales of services, however, twoquestions may helpfully be considered.3Although the sale with partial delivery cannot be dupli-cated as a taxable event in any other State, and multipletaxation under an identical tax is thus precluded, is therea possibility of successive taxation so closely related to thetransaction as to indicate potential unfairness of Oklahoma'stax on the full amount of sale? And if the answer to thatquestion is no, is the very possibility of apportioning by mile-age a sufficient reason to conclude that the tax exceeds thefair share of the State of sale?aThe taxpayer argues that anything but a Central Greyhound mileage apportionment by State will expose it to the514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT192 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtsame threat of multiple taxation assumed to exist in thatcase: further taxation, that is, of some portion of the valuealready taxed, though not under a statute in every respectidentical to Oklahoma's. But the claim does not hold up.The taxpayer has failed to raise any specter of successivetaxes that might require us to reconsider whether an internally consistent tax on sales of services could fail the ex-ternal consistency test for lack of further apportionment (aresult that no sales tax has ever suffered under our cases).If, for example, in the face of Oklahoma's sales tax, Texaswere to levy a sustainable, apportioned gross receipts tax onthe Texas portion of travel from Oklahoma City to Dallas,interstate travel would not be exposed to multiple taxationin any sense different from coal for which the producer maybe taxed first at point of severance by Montana and the cus-tomer may later be taxed upon its purchase in New York.The multiple taxation placed upon interstate commerce bysuch a confluence of taxes is not a structural evil that flowsfrom either tax individually, but it is rather the "accidentalincident of interstate commerce being subject to two different taxing jurisdictions." Lockhart 75; See Moorman Mfg.Co., 437 U. S., at 277.66 Any additional gross receipts tax imposed upon the interstate bus linewould, of course, itself have to respect well-understood constitutionalstrictures. Thus, for example, Texas could not tax the bus company onthe full value of the bus service from Oklahoma City to Dallas when theticket is sold in Oklahoma, because that tax would, among other things,be internally inconsistent. And if Texas were to impose a tax upon thebus company measured by the portion of gross receipts reflecting in-statetravel, it would have to impose taxes on intrastate and interstate journeysalike. In the event Texas chose to limit the burden of successive taxesattributable to the same transaction by combining an apportioned grossreceipts tax with a credit for sales taxes paid to Texas, for example, itwould have to give equal treatment to service into Texas purchased subject to a sales tax in another State, which it could do by granting a creditfor sales taxes paid to any State. See, e. g., Henneford v. Silas MasonCo., 300 U. S. 577, 583-584 (1937) (upholding use tax which provided creditfor sales taxes paid to any State); Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT193Cite as: 514 U.

Since ause tax, or some equivalent on the consumption of services,is generally levied to compensate the taxing State for itsReily, 373 U. S. 64, 70 (1963) ("[E]qual treatment for in-state and out-ofstate taxpayers similarly situated is the condition precedent for a validuse tax on goods imported from out-of-state"); Maryland v. Louisiana,451 U. S. 725, 759 (1981) (striking down Louisiana's "first use" tax on imported gas because "the pattern of credits and exemptions allowed underthe . . . statute undeniably violates this principle of equality"); Tyler PipeIndustries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 240-248 (1987) (striking down Washington's gross receipts wholesaling tax exempting in-state, but not out-of-state, manufacturers); see also BostonStock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 331-332 (1977).Although we have not held that a State imposing an apportioned grossreceipts tax that grants a credit for sales taxes paid in state must alsoextend such a credit to sales taxes paid out of state, see, e. g., Halliburton,supra, at 77 (Brennan, J., concurring); Silas Mason, supra, at 587; see alsoWilliams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14, 21-22 (1985), we have noted that equality of treatment of interstate and intrastate activity has been the commontheme among the paired (or "compensating") tax schemes that havepassed constitutional muster, see, e. g., Boston Stock Exchange, supra, at331-332. We have indeed never upheld a tax in the face of a substantiated charge that it provided credits for the taxpayer's payment of in-statetaxes but failed to extend such credit to payment of equivalent out-of-statetaxes. To the contrary, in upholding tax schemes providing credits fortaxes paid in state and occasioned by the same transaction, we have oftenpointed to the concomitant credit provisions for taxes paid out of state assupporting our conclusion that a particular tax passed muster because ittreated out-of-state and in-state taxpayers alike. See, e. g., Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 74 (1993); D. H. Holmes Co. v.McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988) ("The . . . taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, for it provides a credit against its use tax for sales taxes that havebeen paid in other States"); General Trading Co. v. State Tax Comm'n ofIowa, 322 U. S. 335 (1944); Silas Mason, supra, at 584. A general requirement of equal treatment is thus amply clear from our precedent. We express no opinion on the need for equal treatment when a credit is allowedfor payment of in- or out-of-state taxes by a third party. See Darnell v.Indiana, 226 U. S. 390 (1912).514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT194 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtincapacity to reach the corresponding sale, it is commonlypaired with a sales tax, see, e. g., D. H. Holmes, 486 U. S., at31; Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S.318, 331-332 (1977); Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S.577 (1937), being applicable only when no sales tax has beenpaid or subject to a credit for any such tax paid. Since anyuse tax would have to comply with Commerce Clause requirements, the tax scheme could not apply differently togoods and services purchased out of state from those purchased domestically. Presumably, then, it would not applywhen another State's sales tax had previously been paid, orwould apply subject to credit for such payment. In eitherevent, the Oklahoma ticket purchaser would be free frommultiple taxation.True, it is not Oklahoma that has offered to provide acredit for related taxes paid elsewhere, but in taxing salesOklahoma may rely upon use-taxing States to do so. Thisis merely a practical consequence of the structure of usetaxes as generally based upon the primacy of taxes on sales,in that use of goods is taxed only to the extent that theirprior sale has escaped taxation. Indeed the District ofColumbia and 44 of the 45 States that impose sales anduse taxes permit such a credit or exemption for similartaxes paid to other States. See 2 Hellerstein & Hellerstein|| 18.08, p. 18-48; 1 All States Tax Guide || 256 (1994). Asone state court summarized the provisions in force:"These credit provisions create a national system underwhich the first state of purchase or use imposes the tax.Thereafter, no other state taxes the transaction unlessthere has been no prior tax imposed . . . or if the taxrate of the prior taxing state is less, in which case thesubsequent taxing state imposes a tax measured onlyby the differential rate." KSS Transportation Corp. v.Baldwin, 9 N. J. Tax 273, 285 (1987).514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT195Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe case of threatened multiple taxation where a sales taxis followed by a use tax is thus distinguishable from the caseof simultaneous sales taxes considered in Goldberg, wherewe were reassured to some degree by the provision of acredit in the disputed tax itself for similar taxes placed uponthe taxpayer by other States. SeeGoldberg, 488 U. S., at264 ("To the extent that other States' telecommunicationstaxes pose a risk of multiple taxation, the credit provisioncontained in the [t]ax [a]ct operates to avoid actual multipletaxation"). In that case, unlike the sales and use schemesposited for the sake of argument here, each of the competingsales taxes would presumably have laid an equal claim onthe taxpayer's purse.bFinally, Jefferson points to the fact that in this case, unlikethe telephone communication tax at issue inGoldberg, Okla-homa could feasibly apportion its sales tax on the basis ofmileage as we required New York's gross receipts tax to doinCentral Greyhound. Although Goldberg indeed notedthat "[a]n apportionment formula based on mileage or someother geographic division of individual telephone calls wouldproduce insurmountable administrative and technologicalbarriers," 488 U. S., at 264-265, and although we agree thatno comparable barriers exist here, we nonetheless reject theidea that a particular apportionment formula must be usedsimply because it would be possible to use it. We havenever required that any particular apportionment formula ormethod be used, and when a State has chosen one, an object-ing taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate by " `clear andcogent evidence,' " that " `the income attributed to the Stateis in fact out of all appropriate proportions to the businesstransacted . . . in that State, or has led to a grossly distortedresult.' " Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 170, quoting Moorman Mfg. Co., 437 U. S., at 274 (internal quotation marksomitted; citations omitted). That is too much for Jefferson514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT196 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtto bear in this case. It fails to show that Oklahoma's tax onthe sale of transportation imputes economic activity to theState of sale in any way substantially different from thatimputed by the garden-variety sales tax, which we have perennially sustained, even though levied on goods that havetraveled in interstate commerce to the point of sale or thatwill move across state lines thereafter. See, e. g., WardairCanada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986);McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309 U. S. 33(1940); State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Pacific States Cast IronPipe Co., 372 U. S. 605 (1963); see also Western Live Stock,303 U. S., at 259 (upholding tax where measure of the tax"include[s] the augmentation attributable to the [interstate]commerce in which [the object of the tax] is employed");Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 262 (upholding tax upon the purchaseof an interstate telephone call which had "many of the characteristics of a sales tax . . . [e]ven though such a retail pur-chase is not a purely local event since it triggers simultaneous activity in several States"). Nor does Oklahoma's taxraise any greater threat of multiple taxation than those salestaxes that have passed muster time and again. There isthus no reason to leave the line of longstanding precedentand lose the simplicity of our general rule sustaining salestaxes measured by full value, simply to carve out an excep-tion for the subcategory of sales of interstate transportationservices. We accordingly conclude that Oklahoma's tax onticket sales for travel originating in Oklahoma is externallyconsistent, as reaching only the activity taking place withinthe taxing State, that is, the sale of the service. Cf.id., at261-262; Container Corp., supra, at 169-170.77 Justice Breyer would reject review of the tax under general salestax principles in favor of an analogy between sales and gross receiptstaxes which, in the dissent's view, are without "practical difference," post,at 204. Although his dissenting opinion rightly counsels against the adoption of purely formal distinctions, economic equivalence alone has similarlynot been (and should not be) the touchstone of Commerce Clause jurispru514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT197Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the CourtCWe now turn to the remaining two portions of CompleteAuto's test, which require that the tax must "not discrimi-nate against interstate commerce," and must be "fairly related to the services provided by the State." 430 U. S., at279. Oklahoma's tax meets these demands.A State may not "impose a tax which discriminates againstinterstate commerce . . . by providing a direct commercialadvantage to local business." Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S., at 458; see alsoAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266,269 (1987). Thus, States are barred from discriminatingagainst foreign enterprises competing with local businesses,see, e. g., id., at 286, and from discriminating against commer-cial activity occurring outside the taxing State, see, e. g., Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318(1977). No argument has been made that Oklahoma disdence. Our decisions cannot be reconciled with the view that two taxesmust inevitably be equated for purposes of constitutional analysis by virtue of the fact that both will ultimately be "pass[ed] . . . along to thecustomer" or calculated in a similar fashion, ibid. Indeed, were that tobe the case, we could not, for example, dismiss successive taxation of theextraction, sale, and income from the sale of coal as consistent with theCommerce Clause's prohibition against multiple taxation.Justice Breyer's opinion illuminates the difference between his viewand our own in its suggestion, post, at 206, that our disagreement turnson differing assessments of the force of competing analogies. His analogyto Central Greyhound derives strength from characterizing the tax asfalling on "interstate travel," post, at 207, or "transportation," post, at 202.Our analogy to prior cases on taxing sales of goods and services derivesforce from identifying the taxpayer in categorizing the tax and from thevalue of a uniform rule governing taxation on the occasion of what isgenerally understood as a sales transaction. The significance of the taxpayer's identity is, indeed, central to the Court's longstanding recognitionof structural differences that permit successive taxation as an incident ofmultiple taxing jurisdictions. The decision today is only the latest example of such a recognition and brings us as close to simplicity as the conceptual distinction between sales and income taxation is likely to allow.514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT198 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Opinion of the Courtcriminates against out-of-state enterprises, and there is nomerit in the argument that the tax discriminates against interstate activity.The argument proffered by Jefferson andamicus Greyhound Lines is largely a rewriting of the apportionment challenge rejected above, and our response needs no reiterationhere. See Brief for Respondent 40; Brief for GreyhoundLines, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 20-27. Jefferson takes theadditional position, however, that Oklahoma discriminatesagainst out-of-state travel by taxing a ticket "at the full 4%rate" regardless of whether the ticket relates to "a routeentirely within Oklahoma" or to travel "only 10 percentwithin Oklahoma." Brief for Respondent 40. In makingthe same point, amicus Greyhound invokes our decision inScheiner, which struck down Pennsylvania's flat tax on alltrucks traveling in and through the State as "plainly discriminatory." 483 U. S., at 286. But that case is not on point.In Scheiner, we held that a flat tax on trucks for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's roads discriminated against interstate travel, by imposing a cost per mile upon out-of-statetrucks far exceeding the cost per mile borne by local trucksthat generally traveled more miles on Pennsylvania roads.Ibid. The tax here differs from the one in Scheiner, however, by being imposed not upon the use of the State's roads,but upon "the freedom of purchase." McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S., at 330. However complementary thegoals of sales and use taxes may be, the taxable event forone is the sale of the service, not the buyer's enjoyment orthe privilege of using Oklahoma's roads. Since Oklahomafacilitates purchases of the services equally for intrastateand interstate travelers, all buyers pay tax at the same rateon the value of their purchases. See D. H. Holmes, 486U. S., at 32; cf. Scheiner, supra, at 291 ("[T]he amount ofPennsylvania's . . . taxes owed by a trucker does not varydirectly . . . with some . . . proxy for value obtained fromthe State"). Thus, even if dividing Oklahoma sales taxes by514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Opinion of the Courtin-state miles to be traveled produces on average a higherfigure when interstate trips are sold than when the sale is ofa wholly domestic journey, there is no discrimination againstinterstate travel; miles traveled within the State simply arenot a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon the par-ties to a sales transaction. As with a tax on the sale oftangible goods, the potential for interstate movement afterthe sale has no bearing on the reason for the sales tax. See,e. g., Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477U. S. 1 (1986) (upholding sales tax on airplane fuel); cf.Com-monwealth Edison Co., 453 U. S., at 617-619 (same for severance tax). Only Oklahoma can tax a sale of transportationto begin in that State, and it imposes the same duty onequally valued purchases regardless of whether the purchaseprompts interstate or only intrastate movement. There isno discrimination against interstate commerce.DFinally, the Commerce Clause demands a fair relationbetween a tax and the benefits conferred upon the taxpayerby the State. See Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 266-267; D. H.Holmes, supra, at 32-34; Commonwealth Edison, supra, at621-629. The taxpayer argues that the tax fails this finalprong because the buyer's only benefits from the taxingState occur during the portion of the journey that takesplace in Oklahoma. The taxpayer misunderstands the import of this last requirement.The fair relation prong ofComplete Auto requires no de-tailed accounting of the services provided to the taxpayer onaccount of the activity being taxed, nor, indeed, is a Statelimited to offsetting the public costs created by the taxedactivity. If the event is taxable, the proceeds from the taxmay ordinarily be used for purposes unrelated to the taxableevent. Interstate commerce may thus be made to pay itsfair share of state expenses and " `contribute to the cost ofproviding all governmental services, including those serv514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT200 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v.

' "Goldberg, supra, at 267, quoting Commonwealth Edison,supra, at 627, n. 16 (emphasis in original). The bus terminalmay not catch fire during the sale, and no robbery there maybe foiled while the buyer is getting his ticket, but police andfire protection, along with the usual and usually forgottenadvantages conferred by the State's maintenance of a civi-lized society, are justifications enough for the imposition of atax. See Goldberg, supra, at 267. Complete Auto's fourthcriterion asks only that the measure of the tax be reasonablyrelated to the taxpayer's presence or activities in the State.SeeCommonwealth Edison, supra, at 626, 629. What wehave already said shows that demand to be satisfied here.The tax falls on the sale that takes place wholly inside Okla-homa and is measured by the value of the service purchased.IVOklahoma's tax on the sale of transportation services doesnot contravene the Commerce Clause. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is reversed, accordingly, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion. It is so ordered.Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.I agree with the Court's conclusion that Oklahoma's salestax does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce. See ante, at 198-199. That seems to me the mostwe can demand to certify compliance with the "negativeCommerce Clause"--which is "negative" not only because itnegates state regulation of commerce, but also because itdoes not appear in the Constitution.

Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977). Under the real Commerce Clause ("The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," U. S. Const.,Art. I, $ 8), it is for Congress to make the judgment thatinterstate commerce must be immunized from certain sortsof nondiscriminatory state action--a judgment that may embrace (as ours ought not) such imponderables as how much"value [is] fairly attributable to economic activity within thetaxing State," and what constitutes "fair relation betweena tax and the benefits conferred upon the taxpayer by theState." Ante, at 185, 199 (emphases added). See TylerPipe, supra, at 259. I look forward to the day when Complete Auto will take its rightful place in Part II of the Court'sopinion, among the other useless and discarded tools of ournegative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.Despite the Court's lucid and thorough discussion of therelevant law, I am unable to join its conclusion for one simplereason. Like the judges of the Court of Appeals, I believethe tax at issue here and the tax that this Court held unconstitutional in Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334U. S. 653 (1948), are, for all relevant purposes, identical.Both cases involve taxes imposed upon interstate bus transportation. In neither case did the State apportion the taxto avoid taxing that portion of the interstate activity performed in other States. And, I find no other distinguishingfeatures. Hence, I would hold that the tax before us violates the Constitution for the reasons this Court set forth inCentral Greyhound.514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT202 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Breyer, J., dissentingCentral Greyhound considered a tax imposed by the Stateof New York on utilities doing business in New York--a taxcalled " `[e]mergency tax on the furnishing of utility services.' " Id., at 664 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (quoting NewYork Tax Law $ 186-a). That tax was equal to "two percentum" of "gross income," defined to include "receipts received . . . by reason of any sale . . . made" in New York.334 U. S., at 664. The New York taxing authorities had applied the tax to gross receipts from sales (in New York) ofbus transportation between New York City and cities in upstate New York over routes that cut across New Jersey andPennsylvania. Id., at 654. The out-of-state portion of thetrips accounted for just over 40 percent of total mileage.Id., at 660.Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Central GreyhoundCourt that "it is interstate commerce which the State isseeking to reach," id., at 661; that the "real question [is]whether what the State is exacting is a constitutionally fairdemand . . . for that aspect of the interstate commerce towhich the State bears a special relation," ibid.; and that by"its very nature an unapportioned gross receipts tax makesinterstate transportation bear more than `a fair share of thecost of the local government whose protection it enjoys,' "id., at 663 (quoting Freeman v.

Thisbeing so, to allow New York to impose a tax on the grossreceipts for the entire mileage--on the 57.47% withinNew York as well as the 42.53% without--would subjectinterstate commerce to the unfair burden of being taxedas to portions of its revenue by States which give pro514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 514 U.

S., at 662.The Court essentially held that the tax lacked what itwould later describe as "external consistency." ContainerCorp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 169(1983). That is to say, the New York law violated the Commerce Clause because it tried to tax significantly more than"that portion of the revenues from the interstate activitywhich reasonably reflects the in-state component of the ac-tivity being taxed."Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 262(1989).The tax before us bears an uncanny resemblance to theNew York tax. The Oklahoma statute (as applied to"[t]ransportation . . . by common carriers") imposes an"excise tax" of 4% on "the gross receipts or gross proceedsof each sale" made in Oklahoma. Okla. Stat., Tit. 68,$ 1354(1)(C) (Supp. 1988) (emphasis added). The New Yorkstatute imposed a 2% tax on the "receipts received . . . byreasonof any sale . . . made" in New York. See supra, at202 (emphasis added). Oklahoma imposes its tax on thetotal value of trips of which a large portion may take placein other States. New York imposed its tax on the totalvalue of trips of which a large portion took place in otherStates. New York made no effort to apportion the taxto reflect the comparative cost or value of the in-state andout-of-state portions of the trips. Neither does Oklahoma.Where, then, can one find a critical difference?Not in the language of the two statutes, which differs onlyslightly. Oklahoma calls its statute an "excise tax" and "lev-ie[s]" the tax "upon all sales" of transportation. New Yorkcalled its tax an "[e]mergency tax on . . . services" and leviedthe tax on " `gross income,' " defined to include " `receipts . . .of any sale.' " This linguistic difference, however, is not sig-nificant. As the majority properly recognizes, purely formaldifferences in terminology should not make a constitutionaldifference. Ante, at 183. In both instances, the State im514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT204 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Breyer, J., dissentingposes the tax on gross receipts as measured by sales. Bothtaxes, then, would seem to have the same practical effect onthe, inherently interstate, bus transportation activity. IftheCentral Greyhound Court was willing to look throughNew York's formal labels ("[e]mergency tax on . . . services";"gross income" tax) to the substance (a tax on gross receiptsfrom sales), why should this Court not do the same?The majority sees a number of reasons why the result hereshould be different from that inCentral Greyhound, but Ido not think any is persuasive. First, the majority pointsout that the New York law required a seller, the bus company, to pay the tax, whereas the Oklahoma law says thatthe "tax . . . shall be paid by the consumer or user to thevendor." Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 1361(A) (Supp. 1988). Thisdifference leads the majority to characterize the former as a"gross receipts" tax and the latter as a constitutionally distinguishable "sales tax." This difference, however, seemsmore a formal, than a practical difference. The Oklahomalaw makes the bus company ("the vendor") and "each principal officer . . . personally liable" for the tax, whether or notthey collect it from the customer. Ibid. Oklahoma (as faras I can tell) has never tried to collect the tax directly froma customer. And, in any event, the statute tells the customer to pay the tax, not to the State, but "to the vendor."Ibid. The upshot is that, as a practical matter, in respect toboth taxes, the State will calculate the tax bill by multiplying the rate times gross receipts from sales; the bus companywill pay the tax bill; and, the company will pass the tax alongto the customer.Second, the majority believes that this case presents a significantly smaller likelihood than did Central Greyhound thatthe out-of-state portions of a bus trip will be taxed both "byStates which give protection to those portions, as well as[by] . . . a State which does not." Central Greyhound, 334U. S., at 662. There is at least a hint in the Court's opinionthat this is so because the "taxable event" to which the Okla514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Breyer, J., dissentinghoma tax attaches is not the interstate transportation of pas-sengers but the sale of a bus ticket (combined, perhaps, withtransportation to the state line). See ante, at 190 ("The tax-able event comprises agreement, payment, and delivery ofsome of the services in the taxing State . . ."). Thus, themajority suggests that a tax on transportation (as opposedto the sale of a bus ticket) by a different State might be"successive," ante, at 192, but is not "double taxation" in aconstitutionally relevant way,ante, at 191; see ante, at 190("[N]o other State can claim to be the site of the same combi-nation"). I concede that Oklahoma could have a tax of thekind envisioned, namely, one that would tax the bus companyfor the privilege of selling tickets. But, whether or not sucha tax would pass constitutional muster should depend uponits practical effects. To suggest that the tax here is constitutional simply because it lends itself to recharacterizing thetaxable event as a "sale" is to ignore economic reality. Because the sales tax is framed as a percentage of the ticketprice, it seems clear that the activity Oklahoma intends totax is the transportation of passengers--not some other kindof conduct (like selling tickets).In any event, the majority itself does not seem to believethat Oklahoma is taxing something other than bus transportation; it seems to acknowledge the risk of multiple taxation.The Court creates an ingenious set of constitutionally basedtaxing rules in footnote 6--designed to show that any otherState that imposes, say, a gross receipts tax on its share ofbus ticket sales would likely have to grant a credit for theOklahoma sales tax (unless it forced its own citizens to payboth a sales tax and a gross receipts tax). But, one mighthave said the same in Central Greyhound. Instead of enforcing its apportionment requirement, the Court could havesimply said that once one State, like New York, imposes agross receipts tax on "receipts received . . . by reason of anysale . . . made" in that State, any other State, trying to taxthe gross receipts of its share of bus ticket sales, might have514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT206 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.Breyer, J., dissentingto give some kind of credit. The difficulties with this ap-proach lie in its complexity and our own inability to foreseeall the ways in which other States might effectively tax theirown portion of the journey now (also) taxed by Oklahoma.Under the Court's footnote rules, is not a traveler who buysa ticket in Oklahoma still threatened with a duplicative taxby a State that doesnot impose a sales tax on transportation(and thus, would not have to offer a credit for the sales taxpaid in Oklahoma)? Even if that were not so, the constitutional problem would remain, namely, that Oklahoma is im-posing an unapportioned tax on the portion of travel outsidethe State, just as did New York.Finally, the majority finds support in Goldberg v. Sweet,488 U. S. 252 (1989), a case in which this Court permittedIllinois to tax interstate telephone calls that originated, orterminated, in that State. However, the Goldberg Courtwas careful to distinguish "cases [dealing] with the movement of large physical objects over identifiable routes, whereit was practicable to keep track of the distance actually traveled within the taxing State," id., at 264, and listed CentralGreyhound as one of those cases, 488 U. S., at 264. Telephone service, the Goldberg Court said, differed from movement of the kind at issue in Central Greyhound, in that, atleast arguably, the service itself is consumed wholly withinone State, or possibly two--those in which the call is chargedto a service address or paid by an addressee. 488 U. S., at263. Regardless of whether telephones and buses are morealike than different, the Goldberg Court did not purport tomodify Central Greyhound, nor does the majority. In anyevent, the Goldberg Court said, the tax at issue credited taxpayers for similar taxes assessed by other States. 488 U. S.,at 264.Ultimately, I may differ with the majority simply becauseI assess differently the comparative force of two competinganalogies. The majority finds determinative this Court'scase law concerning sales taxes applied to the sale of goods,514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT207Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)Breyer, J., dissentingwhich cases, for example, permit one State to impose a sever-ance tax and another a sales tax on the same physical item(say, coal). In my view, however, the analogy to sales taxesis not as strong as the analogy to the tax at issue in CentralGreyhound. After all, the tax before us is not a tax imposedupon a product that was made in a different State or wasconsumed in a different State or is made up of ingredientsthat come from a different State or has itself moved in interstate commerce. Rather, it is a tax imposed upon interstatetravel itself--the very essence of interstate commerce.And, it is a fairly obvious effort to tax more than "that por-tion" of the "interstate activity['s]" revenue "which reasonably reflects the in-state component." Goldberg v. Sweet,supra, at 262. I would reaffirm the Central Greyhoundprinciple, even if doing so requires different treatment forthe inherently interstate service of interstate transportation,and denies the possibility of having a single, formal consti-tutional rule for all self-described "sales taxes." The Courtof Appeals wrote that this "is a classic instance of an unap-portioned tax" upon interstate commerce.In re JeffersonLines, Inc., 15 F. 3d 90, 93 (CA8 1994). In my view, that isright.

Decided April 17, 1995Since 1987, pro se petitioner Whitaker has filed 24 claims for relief, including 18 petitions for certiorari, all of which have been denied without recorded dissent. Earlier this Term, this Court directed the Clerkof the Court not to accept further petitions for extraordinary writs fromWhitaker in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33, In reWhitaker, 513 U. S. 1, 2, and warned Whitaker about his frequent filingpatterns with respect to petitions for writ of certiorari, ibid.Held: Pursuant to this Court's Rule 39.8, Whitaker is denied leave toproceed in forma pauperis in the instant case, and the Clerk is instructed not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from himin noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee andsubmits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33. Like other similarorders this Court has issued, see, e. g., In re Sassower, 510 U.

Pursuant to Rule39.8, we deny petitioner's request to proceedin forma pau-peris.* Petitioner is allowed until May 8, 1995, to pay thedocketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitionin compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasonsexplained below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to*Rule 39.8 provides: "If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari,jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ, as the casemay be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leaveto proceed in forma pauperis."514us1$40H 06-11-98 18:18:53 PAGES OPINPGT209Cite as: 514 U.

Since 1987, hehas filed 24 petitions for relief, including 6 petitions forextraordinary relief and 18 petitions for certiorari. Fifteenof the twenty-four petitions have been filed in the last fourTerms, and we have denied all 24 petitions without recordeddissent. We also have denied petitioner leave to proceedin forma pauperis pursuant to Rule 39.8 of this Court forthe last three petitions in which he has sought extraordinaryrelief. See In re Whitaker, 513 U. S. 1 (1994); In re Whitaker, 511 U. S. 1105 (1994); In re Whitaker, 506 U. S. 983(1992). And earlier this Term, we directed the Clerk ofthe Court "not to accept any further petitions for extraordinary writs from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless hepays the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submitshis petition in compliance with Rule 33." 513 U. S., at 2.Though we warned petitioner at that time about his "frequent filing patterns with respect to petitions for writ ofcertiorari," ibid., we limited our sanction to petitions for extraordinary writs.We now find it necessary to extend that sanction to petitions for certiorari filed by petitioner. In what appears tobe an attempt to circumvent this Court's prior order, petitioner has labeled his instant petition a "petition for writ ofcertiorari" even though it would seem to be more aptlytermed a "petition for an extraordinary writ": He arguesthat the California Supreme Court erred in denying his petition for review of a California Court of Appeals orderwhich denied his petition for writ of mandate/prohibitionseeking to compel a California trial judge to make a particular ruling in a civil action filed by petitioner. And the legalarguments petitioner makes in his instant "petition for writof certiorari" are, just as those made in his previous 18 pe514us1$40H 06-11-98 18:18:53 PAGES OPINPGT210 WHITAKER v.

As we told petitioner ear-lier this Term, "[t]he goal of fairly dispensing justice . . .is compromised when the Court is forced to devote its lim-ited resources to the processing of repetitious and frivolousrequests." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).Petitioner's abuse of petitions for certiorari has occurredonly in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly. This order therefore will not prevent petitioner fromfiling a petition for certiorari to challenge criminal sanctionsthat might be imposed upon him. But like other similar or-ders we have issued, seeIn re Sassower, 510 U. S. 4 (1993);Day v. Day, 510 U. S. 1 (1993); Demos v. Storrie, 507 U. S.290 (1993); Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,506 U. S. 1 (1992), this order will allow the Court to devoteits limited resources to the claims of petitioners who havenot abused our process. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, dissenting.A simple denial would adequately serve the laudable goalof conserving the Court's "limited resources."Ante thispage. See generally In re Whitaker, 513 U.

Argued November 30, 1994--Decided April 18, 1995In a 1987 civil action, petitioners alleged that in 1983 and 1984 respondentscommitted fraud and deceit in the sale of stock in violation of $ 10(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission. The District Court dismissed the actionwith prejudice following this Court's decision in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 364, which requiredthat suits such as petitioners' be commenced within one year after thediscovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three yearsafter such violation. After the judgment became final, Congress enacted $ 27A(b) of the 1934 Act, which provides for reinstatement on motion of any action commenced pre-Lampf but dismissed thereafter astime barred, if the action would have been timely filed under applicablepre-Lampf state law. Although finding that the statute's terms required that petitioners' ensuing $ 27A(b) motion be granted, the DistrictCourt denied the motion on the ground that $ 27A(b) is unconstitutional.The Court of Appeals affirmed.Held: Section 27A(b) contravenes the Constitution's separation of powersto the extent that it requires federal courts to reopen final judgmentsentered before its enactment. Pp. 215-240.(a) Despite respondents' arguments to the contrary, there is no reasonable construction on which $ 27A(b) does not require federal courtsto reopen final judgments in suits dismissed with prejudice by virtue ofLampf. Pp. 215-217.(b) Article III establishes a "judicial department" with the "provinceand duty . . . to say what the law is" in particular cases and controversies. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. The Framers craftedthis charter with an expressed understanding that it gives the FederalJudiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to decide themconclusively, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article IIIhierarchy. Thus, the Constitution forbids the Legislature to interferewith courts' final judgments. Pp. 219-225.(c) Section 27A(b) effects a clear violation of the foregoing principleby retroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final judgments. This Court's decisions have uniformly provided fair warningthat retroactive legislation such as $ 27A(b) exceeds congressional pow514us1$41z 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT212 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Syllabusers. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S.Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113. Petitioners are correct that when a new lawmakes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply it inreviewing judgments still on appeal, and must alter the outcome accordingly. However, once a judgment has achieved finality in the highestcourt in the hierarchy, the decision becomes the last word of the judicialdepartment with regard to the particular case or controversy, and Congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicableto that case was in fact something other than it was. It is irrelevantthat $ 27A(b) reopens (or directs the reopening of) final judgments in awhole class of cases rather than in a particular suit, and that the finaljudgments so reopened rested on the bar of a statute of limitationsrather than on some other ground. Pp. 225-230.(d) Apart from $ 27A(b), the Court knows of no instance in whichCongress has attempted to set aside the final judgment of an Article IIIcourt by retroactive legislation. Fed. Rule Civ.

The complaint alleged that in 1983 and1984 respondents had committed fraud and deceit in the saleof stock in violation of $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We applied that holding to the plaintiff-respondentsin Lampf itself, found their suit untimely, and reinstateda summary judgment previously entered in favor of thedefendant-petitioners. Ibid. On the same day we decidedJames B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529(1991), in which a majority of the Court held, albeit in different opinions, that a new rule of federal law that is applied tothe parties in the case announcing the rule must be appliedas well to all cases pending on direct review. See Harper v.Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 92 (1993). Thejoint effect of Lampf and Beam was to mandate applicationof the 1-year/3-year limitations period to petitioners' suit.The District Court, finding that petitioners' claims were untimely under the Lampf rule, dismissed their action withprejudice on August 13, 1991. Petitioners filed no appeal;the judgment accordingly became final 30 days later. See28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V);Griffith v. Kentucky,479 U.

Roadway Express, Inc., 511U. S. 298, 312-313 (1994); see also id., at 313, n. 12. Butrespondents' argument confuses the question of what the lawin fact was on June 19, 1991, with the distinct question ofwhat $ 27A means by its reference to what the law was. Wethink it entirely clear that it does not mean the law enunciated in Lampf, for two independent reasons. First, Lampfprovides a uniform, national statute of limitations (instead ofusing the applicable state limitations period, as lower federalcourts had previously done. SeeLampf, 501 U. S., at 354,and n. 1). If the statute referred to that law, its referenceto the "laws applicable in the jurisdiction" (emphasis added)would be quite inexplicable. Second, if the statute refers tothe law enunciated in Lampf, it is utterly without effect, aresult to be avoided if possible. American Nat. Red Crossv. S. G., 505 U. S. 247, 263-264 (1992); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 46.06 (Sands rev. 4th ed.1984). It would say, in subsection (a), that the limitationsperiod is what the Supreme Court has held to be the limitations period; and in subsection (b), that suits dismissed asuntimely under Lampf which were timely under Lampf (anull set) shall be reinstated. To avoid a constitutional question by holding that Congress enacted, and the Presidentapproved, a blank sheet of paper would indeed constitute"disingenuous evasion." George Moore Ice Cream Co. v.Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 379 (1933).2 Since respondents' reading of the statute would avoid a constitutionalquestion of undoubted gravity, we think it prudent to entertain the argument even though respondents did not make it in the Sixth Circuit. Ofcourse the Sixth Circuit did decide (against respondents) the point towhich the argument was directed. See 1 F. 3d 1487, 1490 (1993) ("Thestatute's language is plain and unambiguous. . . . [It] commands the Federalcourts to reinstate cases which those courts have dismissed").514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT217Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the CourtAs an alternative reason why $ 27A(b) does not require thereopening of final judgments, respondents suggest that thesubsection applies only to cases still pending in the federalcourts when $ 27A was enacted. This has only half the defect of the first argument, for it makes only half of $ 27Apurposeless--$ 27A(b). There is no need to "reinstate" actions that are still pending; $ 27A(a) (the new statute of limi-tations) could and would be applied by the courts of appeals.On respondents' reading, the only consequence of $ 27A(b)would be the negligible one of permitting the plaintiff in thepending appeal from a statute-of-limitations dismissal to re-turnimmediately to the district court, instead of waiting forthe court of appeals' reversal. To enable $ 27A(b) to achievesuch an insignificant consequence, one must disregard thelanguage of the provision, which refers generally to suits"dismissed as time barred." It is perhaps arguable that thisdoesnot include suits that are not yet finally dismissed, i. e.,suits still pending on appeal; but there is no basis for thecontention that it includes only those. In short, there is noreasonable construction on which $ 27A(b) does not requirefederal courts to reopen final judgments in suits dismissedwith prejudice by virtue ofLampf.IIIRespondents submit that $ 27A(b) violates both the sepa-ration of powers and the Due Process Clause of the FifthAmendment.3 Because the latter submission, if correct,might dictate a similar result in a challenge to state legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment, the former is thenarrower ground for adjudication of the constitutional questions in the case, and we therefore consider it first. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). We conclude that in $ 27A(b) Congress has exceededits authority by requiring the federal courts to exercise3 "No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, withoutdue process of law."

Const., Art.III, $ 1, in a manner repugnant to the text, structure, andtraditions of Article III.Our decisions to date have identified two types of legislation that require federal courts to exercise the judicial powerin a manner that Article III forbids. The first appears inUnited States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), where we refusedto give effect to a statute that was said "[to] prescribe rulesof decision to the Judicial Department of the government incases pending before it." Id., at 146. Whatever the precisescope ofKlein, however, later decisions have made clear thatits prohibition does not take hold when Congress "amend[s]applicable law." Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc., 503U. S. 429, 441 (1992). Section 27A(b) indisputably does setout substantive legal standards for the Judiciary to apply,and in that sense changes the law (even if solely retroactively). The second type of unconstitutional restrictionupon the exercise of judicial power identified by past casesis exemplified by Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), whichstands for the principle that Congress cannot vest review ofthe decisions of Article III courts in officials of the ExecutiveBranch. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948). Yet under anyapplication of $ 27A(b) only courts are involved; no officialsof other departments sit in direct review of their decisions.Section 27A(b) therefore offends neither of these previouslyestablished prohibitions.We think, however, that $ 27A(b) offends a postulate of Article III just as deeply rooted in our law as those we havementioned. Article III establishes a "judicial department"with the "province and duty . . . to say what the law is" inparticular cases and controversies. Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch 137, 177 (1803). The record of history shows thatthe Framers crafted this charter of the judicial departmentwith an expressed understanding that it gives the FederalJudiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to de514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT219Cite as: 514 U.

Easterbrook, Presidential Review, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 905,926 (1990). By retroactively commanding the federal courtsto reopen final judgments, Congress has violated this funda-mental principle.AThe Framers of our Constitution lived among the ruins ofa system of intermingled legislative and judicial powers,which had been prevalent in the colonies long before theRevolution, and which after the Revolution had producedfactional strife and partisan oppression. In the 17th and18th centuries colonial assemblies and legislatures functioned as courts of equity of last resort, hearing original ac-tions or providing appellate review of judicial judgments.G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787,pp. 154-155 (1969). Often, however, they chose to correctthe judicial process through special bills or other enactedlegislation. It was common for such legislation not to prescribe a resolution of the dispute, but rather simply to setaside the judgment and order a new trial or appeal.

Thus, as described in our discussion of Hayburn's Case, supra, at 218,such legislation bears not on the problem of interbranchreview but on the problem of finality of judicial judgments.The vigorous, indeed often radical, populism of the revolutionary legislatures and assemblies increased the frequencyof legislative correction of judgments.

SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Court(1983) (Powell, J., concurring). "The period 1780-1787 . . .was a period of `constitutional reaction' " to these developments, "which . . . leaped suddenly to its climax in the Phila-delphia Convention." E. Corwin, The Doctrine of JudicialReview 37 (1914). Voices from many quarters, official aswell as private, decried the increasing legislative interfer-ence with the private-law judgments of the courts. In 1786,the Vermont Council of Censors issued an "Address of theCouncil of Censors to the Freemen of the State of Vermont"to fulfill the council's duty, under the State Constitution of1784, to report to the people " `whether the legislative andexecutive branches of government have assumed to them-selves, or exercised, other or greater powers than they areentitled to by the Constitution.' " Vermont State Papers1779-1786, pp. 531, 533 (Slade ed. 1823). A principal methodof usurpation identified by the censors was "[t]he instances. . . of judgments being vacated by legislative acts." Id., at540. The council delivered an opinion"that the General Assembly, in all the instances wherethey have vacated judgments, recovered in due courseof law, (except where the particular circumstances of thecase evidently made it necessary to grant a new trial)have exercised a power not delegated, or intended to bedelegated, to them, by the Constitution. . . . It supercedes the necessity of any other law than the pleasureof the Assembly, and of any other court than themselves:for it is an imposition on the suitor, to give him the trouble of obtaining, after several expensive trials, a finaljudgment agreeably to the known established laws ofthe land; if the Legislature, by a sovereign act, can interfere, reverse the judgment, and decree in such manner,as they, unfettered by rules, shall think proper." Ibid.So too, the famous report of the Pennsylvania Council ofCensors in 1784 detailed the abuses of legislative interference with the courts at the behest of private interests and514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT221Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtfactions. As the General Assembly had (they wrote) madea custom of "extending their deliberations to the cases ofindividuals," the people had "been taught to consider an ap-plication to the legislature, as a shorter and more certainmode of obtaining relief from hardships and losses, than theusual process of law." The censors noted that because "fa-vour and partiality have, from the nature of public bodies ofmen, predominated in the distribution of this relief . . . [t]hesedangerous procedures have been too often recurred to, sincethe revolution." Report of the Committee of the Council ofCensors 6 (Bailey ed. 1784).This sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislativefrom the judicial power, prompted by the crescendo of legislative interference with private judgments of the courts, triumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Constitution.See Corwin, The Progress of Constitutional Theory Betweenthe Declaration of Independence and the Meeting of the Philadelphia Convention, 30 Am. Hist. Rev. 511, 514-517 (1925).The Convention made the critical decision to establish a judicial department independent of the Legislative Branch byproviding that "the judicial Power of the United States shallbe vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courtsas the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."Before and during the debates on ratification, Madison, Jefferson, and Hamilton each wrote of the factional disordersand disarray that the system of legislative equity hadproduced in the years before the framing; and each thoughtthat the separation of the legislative from the judicial powerin the new Constitution would cure them. Madison's Federalist No. 48, the famous description of the process by which"[t]he legislative department is every where extending thesphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex," referred to the report of the PennsylvaniaCouncil of Censors to show that in that State "cases belonging to the judiciary department [had been] frequently drawnwithin legislative cognizance and determination."

Madison re-lied as well on Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia,which mentioned, as one example of the dangerous concen-tration of governmental powers into the hands of the legislature, that "the Legislature . . . in many instances decidedrights which should have been left to judiciary controversy."Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted).4If the need for separation of legislative from judicial powerwas plain, the principal effect to be accomplished by thatseparation was even plainer. As Hamilton wrote in his exegesis of Article III, $ 1, in The Federalist No. 81:"It is not true . . . that the parliament of Great Britain,or the legislatures of the particular states, can rectifythe exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, inany other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the United States. The theory neither of theBritish, nor the state constitutions, authorises the revisal of a judicial sentence, by a legislative act. . . . Alegislature without exceeding its province cannot reverse a determination once made, in a particular case;though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases."The Federalist No. 81, p. 545 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).The essential balance created by this allocation of authoritywas a simple one. The Legislature would be possessed ofpower to "prescrib[e] the rules by which the duties andrights of every citizen are to be regulated," but the powerof "[t]he interpretation of the laws" would be "the properand peculiar province of the courts."Id., No. 78, at 523, 525.4 Read in the abstract these public pronouncements might be taken, asthe Solicitor General does take them, see Brief for United States 28-30,to disapprove only the practice of having the legislature itself sit as a courtof original or appellate jurisdiction. But against the backdrop of history,that reading is untenable. Many, perhaps a plurality, of the instances oflegislative equity in the period before the framing simply involved dulyenacted laws that nullified judgments so that new trials or judicial rulingson the merits could take place. See supra, at 219.514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT223Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the CourtSee also Corwin, The Doctrine of Judicial Review, at 42.The Judiciary would be, "from the nature of its functions, . . .the [department] least dangerous to the political rights of theconstitution," not because its acts were subject to legislativecorrection, but because the binding effect of its acts was limited to particular cases and controversies. Thus, "thoughindividual oppression may now and then proceed from thecourts of justice, the general liberty of the people can neverbe endangered from that quarter: . . . so long as the judiciaryremains truly distinct from both the legislative and execu-tive." The Federalist No. 78, at 522, 523.Judicial decisions in the period immediately after ratifica-tion of the Constitution confirm the understanding that itforbade interference with the final judgments of courts. InCalder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), the Legislature of Connect-icut had enacted a statute that set aside the final judgmentof a state court in a civil case. Although the issue beforethis Court was the construction of theEx Post Facto Clause,Art. I, $ 10, Justice Iredell (a leading Federalist who hadguided the Constitution to ratification in North Carolina)noted that"the Legislature of [Connecticut] has been in the uniform, uninterrupted, habit of exercising a general super-intending power over its courts of law, by granting newtrials. It may, indeed, appear strange to some of us,that in any form, there should exist a power to grant,with respect to suits depending or adjudged, new rightsof trial, new privileges of proceeding, not previously rec-ognized and regulated by positive institutions . . . . Thepower . . . is judicial in its nature; and whenever it isexercised, as in the present instance, it is an exercise ofjudicial, not of legislative, authority." Id., at 398.The state courts of the era showed a similar understandingof the separation of powers, in decisions that drew little distinction between the federal and state constitutions. To514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT224 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courtchoose one representative example from a multitude: InBates v. Kimball, 2 Chipman 77 (Vt. 1824), a special Act ofthe Vermont Legislature authorized a party to appeal fromthe judgment of a court even though, under the general law,the time for appeal had expired. The court, noting that theunappealed judgment had become final, set itself the question "Have the Legislature power to vacate or annul an exist-ing judgment between party and party?"Id., at 83. Theanswer was emphatic: "The necessity of a distinct and separate existence of the three great departments of government. . . had been proclaimed and enforced by . . . Blackstone,Jefferson and Madison," and had been "sanctioned by thepeople of the United States, by being adopted in terms moreor less explicit, into all their written constitutions." Id., at84. The power to annul a final judgment, the court held(citing Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall., at 410), was "an assumptionof Judicial power," and therefore forbidden.Bates v. Kim-ball, supra, at 90. For other examples, see Merrill v. Sherburne, 1 N. H. 199 (1818) (legislature may not vacate a finaljudgment and grant a new trial);Lewis v. Webb, 3 Greenleaf299 (Me. 1825) (same); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations95-96 (1868) (collecting cases); J. Sutherland, Statutory Con-struction 18-19 (J. Lewis ed. 1904) (same).By the middle of the 19th century, the constitutional equi-librium created by the separation of the legislative power tomake general law from the judicial power to apply that lawin particular cases was so well understood and accepted thatit could survive even Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393(1857). In his First Inaugural Address, President Lincolnexplained why the political branches could not, and need not,interfere with even that infamous judgment:"I do not forget the position assumed by some, that con-stitutional questions are to be decided by the SupremeCourt; nor do I deny that such decisions must be bindingin any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the objectof that suit . . . . And while it is obviously possible that514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT225Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, stillthe evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be over-ruled, andnever become a precedent for other cases, can better beborne than could the evils of a different practice." 4R. Basler, The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 268(1953) (First Inaugural Address 1861).And the great constitutional scholar Thomas Cooley ad-dressed precisely the question before us in his 1868 treatise:"If the legislature cannot thus indirectly control theaction of the courts, by requiring of them a constructionof the law according to its own views, it is very plain itcannot do so directly, by setting aside their judgments,compelling them to grant new trials, ordering the dis-charge of offenders, or directing what particular stepsshall be taken in the progress of a judicial inquiry."Cooley, supra, at 94-95.BSection 27A(b) effects a clear violation of the separation-of-powers principle we have just discussed. It is, of course,retroactive legislation, that is, legislation that prescribeswhat the lawwas at an earlier time, when the act whoseeffect is controlled by the legislation occurred--in this case,the filing of the initial Rule 10b-5 action in the DistrictCourt. When retroactive legislation requires its own application in a case already finally adjudicated, it does no moreand no less than "reverse a determination once made, in aparticular case." The Federalist No. 81, at 545. Our deci-sions stemming fromHayburn's Case--although their pre-cise holdings are not strictly applicable here, see supra, at218--have uniformly provided fair warning that such an actexceeds the powers of Congress. See, e. g., Chicago &Southern Air Lines, Inc., 333 U. S., at 113 ("Judgmentswithin the powers vested in courts by the Judiciary Article514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT226 PLAUT v.

Appx. 697, 700-704 (1864) (opinion of Taney, C.

J.) ("[N]o decision of any courtof the United States can, under any circumstances, . . . beliable to a revision, or even suspension, by the [l]egislatureitself, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to bevested"). See also Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & BelmontBridge Co., 18 How. 421, 431 (1856) ("[I]t is urged, that theact of congress cannot have the effect and operation to annulthe judgment of the court already rendered, or the rightsdetermined thereby . . . . This, as a general proposition, iscertainly not to be denied, especially as it respects adjudication upon the private rights of parties. When they havepassed into judgment the right becomes absolute, and it isthe duty of the court to enforce it"). Today those clearstatements must either be honored, or else proved false.It is true, as petitioners contend, that Congress can alwaysrevise the judgments of Article III courts in one sense:When a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments stillon appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted,and must alter the outcome accordingly. See United Statesv. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801); Landgraf v. USIFilm Products, 511 U. S. 244, 273-280 (1994). Since that is514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtso, petitioners argue, federal courts must apply the "new"law created by $ 27A(b) in finally adjudicated cases as well;for the line that separates lower court judgments that arepending on appeal (or may still be appealed), from lowercourt judgments that are final, is determined by statute, see,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a) (30-day time limit for appeal to fed-eral court of appeals), and so cannot possibly be aconstitutional line. But a distinction between judgments fromwhich all appeals have been forgone or completed, and judgments that remain on appeal (or subject to being appealed),is implicit in what Article III creates: not a batch of unconnected courts, but a judicial department composed of "inferior Courts" and "one supreme Court." Within that hierarchy, the decision of an inferior court is not (unless the timefor appeal has expired) the final word of the department asa whole. It is the obligation of the last court in the hierarchy that rules on the case to give effect to Congress's latestenactment, even when that has the effect of overturning thejudgment of an inferior court, since each court, at everylevel, must "decide according to existing laws." SchoonerPeggy, supra, at 109. Having achieved finality, however, ajudicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy, andCongress may not declare by retroactive legislation that thelaw applicable to that very case was something other thanwhat the courts said it was. Finality of a legal judgment isdetermined by statute, just as entitlement to a governmentbenefit is a statutory creation; but that no more deprives theformer of its constitutional significance for separation-ofpowers analysis than it deprives the latter of its significancefor due process purposes. See, e. g., Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v.Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532 (1985); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S.215 (1976).To be sure, $ 27A(b) reopens (or directs the reopening of)final judgments in a whole class of cases rather than in aparticular suit. We do not see how that makes any differ514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT228 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courtence. The separation-of-powers violation here, if there isany, consists of depriving judicial judgments of the conclusive effect that they had when they were announced, not ofacting in a manner--viz., with particular rather than generaleffect--that is unusual (though, we must note, not impossible) for a legislature. To be sure, a general statute such asthis one may reduce the perception that legislative interference with judicial judgments was prompted by individual fa-voritism; but it is legislative interference with judicial judgments nonetheless. Not favoritism, nor even corruption,butpower is the object of the separation-of-powers prohibition. The prohibition is violated when an individual finaljudgment is legislatively rescinded for even the very best ofreasons, such as the legislature's genuine conviction (supported by all the law professors in the land) that the judgment was wrong; and it is violated 40 times over when 40final judgments are legislatively dissolved.It is irrelevant as well that the final judgments reopenedby $ 27A(b) rested on the bar of a statute of limitations. Therules of finality, both statutory and judge made, treat a dismissal on statute-of-limitations grounds the same way theytreat a dismissal for failure to state a claim, for failure toprove substantive liability, or for failure to prosecute: as ajudgment on the merits. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.41(b); United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87-88(1916). Petitioners suggest, directly or by implication, tworeasons why a merits judgment based on this particularground may be uniquely subject to congressional nullification. First, there is the fact that the length and indeed eventhe very existence of a statute of limitations upon a federalcause of action is entirely subject to congressional control.But virtually all of the reasons why a final judgment on themerits is rendered on a federal claim are subject to congressional control. Congress can eliminate, for example, a particular element of a cause of action that plaintiffs have foundit difficult to establish; or an evidentiary rule that has often514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtexcluded essential testimony; or a rule of offsetting wrong(such as contributory negligence) that has often preventedrecovery. To distinguish statutes of limitations on theground that they are mere creatures of Congress is to distinguish them not at all. The second supposedly distinguishingcharacteristic of a statute of limitations is that it can be ex-tended, without violating the Due Process Clause, after thecause of the action arose and even after the statute itself hasexpired. See,e. g., Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson,325 U. S. 304 (1945). But that also does not set statutes oflimitations apart. To mention only one other broad category of judgment-producing legal rule: Rules of pleading andproof can similarly be altered after the cause of action arises,Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 275, and n. 29,and even, if the statute clearly so requires, after they havebeen applied in a case but before final judgment has beenentered. Petitioners' principle would therefore lead to theconclusion that final judgments rendered on the basis of astringent (or, alternatively, liberal) rule of pleading or proofmay be set aside for retrial under a new liberal (or, alternatively, stringent) rule of pleading or proof. This alone provides massive scope for undoing final judgments and wouldsubstantially subvert the doctrine of separation of powers.The central theme of the dissent is a variant on these arguments. The dissent maintains that Lampf "announced" anew statute of limitations, post, at 246, in an act of "judicial. . . lawmaking," post, at 247, that "changed the law," post, at250. That statement, even if relevant, would be wrong.The point decided in Lampf had never before been addressedby this Court, and was therefore an open question, no matterwhat the lower courts had held at the time. But the moreimportant point is that Lampf as such is irrelevant to thiscase. The dissent itself perceives that "[w]e would have thesame issue to decide had Congress enacted the Lampf rule,"and that the Lampf rule's genesis in judicial lawmakingrather than, shall we say, legislative lawmaking, "should not514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT230 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courtaffect the separation-of-powers analysis." Post, at 247.Just so. The issue here is not the validity or even the sourceof the legal rule that produced the Article III judgments,but rather the immunity from legislative abrogation of thosejudgments themselves. The separation-of-powers questionbefore us has nothing to do withLampf, and the dissent'sattack on Lampf has nothing to do with the question beforeus. CApart from the statute we review today, we know of noinstance in which Congress has attempted to set aside thefinal judgment of an Article III court by retroactive legis-lation. That prolonged reticence would be amazing if suchinterference were not understood to be constitutionally pro-scribed. The closest analogue that the Government hasbeen able to put forward is the statute at issue in UnitedStates v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371 (1980). That law re-quired the Court of Claims, " `[n]otwithstanding any otherprovision of law . . . [to] review on the merits, without re-gard to the defense of res judicata or collateral estoppel,' " aSioux claim for just compensation from the United States--even though the Court of Claims had previously heard andrejected that very claim. We considered and rejectedseparation-of-powers objections to the statute based uponHayburn's Case and United States v. Klein. See 448 U. S.,at 391-392. The basis for our rejection was a line of precedent (starting with Cherokee Nation v. United States, 270U. S. 476 (1926)) that stood, we said, for the proposition that"Congress has the power to waive the res judicata effect ofa prior judgment entered in the Government's favor on aclaim against the United States." Sioux Nation, 448 U. S.,at 397. And our holding was as narrow as the precedent onwhich we had relied: "In sum, . . . Congress' mere waiver ofthe res judicata effect of a prior judicial decision rejectingthe validity of a legal claim against the United States does514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtnot violate the doctrine of separation of powers." Id., at407.5The Solicitor General suggests that even if Sioux Nationis read in accord with its holding, it nonetheless establishesthat Congress may require Article III courts to reopen theirfinal judgments, since "if res judicata were compelled by Article III to safeguard the structural independence of thecourts, the doctrine would not be subject to waiver by anyparty litigant." Brief for United States 27 (citingCommodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 850-851(1986)). But the proposition that legal defenses based upondoctrines central to the courts' structural independencecan never be waived simply does not accord with our cases.Certainly one such doctrine consists of the "judicial Power"to disregard an unconstitutional statute, see Marbury, 1Cranch, at 177; yet none would suggest that a litigant maynever waive the defense that a statute is unconstitutional.See,e. g., G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 414 (1982).What may follow from our holding that the judicial powerunalterably includes the power to render final judgments isnot that waivers of res judicata are always impermissible,but rather that, as many Federal Courts of Appeals haveheld, waivers of res judicata need not always be accepted--that trial courts may in appropriate cases raise the res judi-cata bar on their own motion. See,e. g., Coleman v. Ramada Hotel Operating Co., 933 F. 2d 470, 475 (CA7 1991); Inre Medomak Canning, 922 F. 2d 895, 904 (CA1 1990); Holloway Constr. Co. v. United States Dept. of Labor, 891 F. 2d1211, 1212 (CA6 1989). Waiver subject to the control of the5 The dissent quotes a passage from the opinion saying that Congress" `only was providing a forum so that a new judicial review of the BlackHills claim could take place.' " Post, at 256 (quoting 448 U. S., at 407).That is quite consistent with the res judicata holding. Any party whowaives the defense of res judicata provides a forum for a new judicialreview.514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT232 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courtcourts themselves would obviously raise no issue of separation of powers, and would be precisely in accord with thelanguage of the decision that the Solicitor General reliesupon. We held in Schor that, although a litigant had consented to bring a state-law counterclaim before an Article Itribunal, 478 U. S., at 849, we would nonetheless choose toconsider his Article III challenge, because "when these Article III limitations are at issue, notions of consent and waivercannot be dispositive," id., at 851 (emphasis added). Seealso Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878-879 (1991)(finding a "rare cas[e] in which we should exercise our discretion" to hear a waived claim based on the AppointmentsClause, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2).6Petitioners also rely on a miscellany of decisions upholdinglegislation that altered rights fixed by the final judgments ofnon-Article III courts, see, e. g., Sampeyreac v. UnitedStates, 7 Pet. 222, 238 (1833); Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160(1865), or administrative agencies, Paramino Lumber Co. v.Marshall, 309 U. S. 370 (1940), or that altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts,Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How., at 421. Thesecases distinguish themselves; nothing in our holding todaycalls them into question. Petitioners rely on general statements from some of these cases that legislative annulment offinal judgments is not an exercise of judicial power. Buteven if it were our practice to decide cases by weight of priordicta, we would find the many dicta that reject congressional6 The statute at issue in United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.

The Courtdid not address that point; as far as appears it saw no reason to raise thedefense on its own. Of course the unexplained silences of our decisionslack precedential weight. See, e. g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619,630-631 (1993).514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT233Cite as: 514 U.

We see little resemblance. Rule 60(b),which authorizes discretionary judicial revision of judgmentsin the listed situations and in other " `extraordinary circumstances,' " Liljeberg v.

It says of Sampeyreac that "therelevant judicial power that the [challenged] statute arguably supplantedwas this Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction." Post, at 253. Evenif it were true that the judicial power under discussion was that of thisCourt (which is doubtful), the point could still not possibly constitute aholding, since there was no "supplanted power" at issue in the case. Oneof the principal grounds of decision was that the finality of the territorialcourt's decree had not been retroactively abrogated. The decree hadbeen entered under a previous statute which provided that a decree "shallbe final and conclusive between the parties." Sampeyreac v. UnitedStates, 7 Pet., at 239 (emphasis in original). The asserted basis for reopening was fraud, in that Sampeyreac did not actually exist. We reasoned that "as Sampeyreac was a fictitious person, he was no party to thedecree, and the act [under which the decree had allegedly become final] instrictness does not apply to the case." Ibid.The dissent likewise says of Freeborn that "the `judicial power' to whichthe opinion referred was this Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction."Post, at 255. Once again, even if it was, the point remains dictum. Nofinal judgment was at issue in Freeborn. The challenged statute reachedonly " `cases of appeal or writ of error heretofore prosecuted and nowpending in the supreme court of the United States,' " see post, at 254, n. 7(quoting 13 Stat. 441) (emphasis added). As we have explained, seesupra, at 226, Congress may require (insofar as separation-of-powers limitations are concerned) that new statutes be applied in cases not yet finalbut still pending on appeal.514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT234 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courtconfirms the courts' own inherent and discretionary power,"firmly established in English practice long before the foundation of our Republic," to set aside a judgment whose en-forcement would work inequity.Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 244 (1944). Thus, Rule60(b), and the tradition that it embodies, would be relevantrefutation of a claim that reopening a final judgment is always a denial of property without due process; but they areirrelevant to the claim that legislative instruction to reopenimpinges upon the independent constitutional authority ofthe courts.The dissent promises to provide "[a] few contemporary examples" of statutes retroactively requiring final judgmentsto be reopened, "to demonstrate that [such statutes] are ordinary products of the exercise of legislative power." Post, at256. That promise is not kept. The relevant retroactivity,of course, consists not of the requirement that there be setaside a judgment that has been rendered prior to its beingsetting aside--for example, a statute passed today whichsays that all default judgments rendered in the future maybe reopened within 90 days after their entry. In that sense,all requirements to reopen are "retroactive," and the designation is superfluous. Nothing we say today precludes a lawsuch as that. The finality that a court can pronounce is nomore than what the law in existence at the time of judgmentwill permit it to pronounce. If the law then applicable saysthat the judgment may be reopened for certain reasons, thatlimitation is built into the judgment itself, and its finality isso conditioned. The present case, however, involves a judgment that Congress subjected to a reopening requirementwhich did not exist when the judgment was pronounced.The dissent provides not a single clear prior instance of suchcongressional action.The dissent cites, first, Rule 60(b), which it describes as a"familiar remedial measure." Ibid. As we have just discussed, Rule 60(b) does not provide a new remedy at all, but514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courtis simply the recitation of pre-existing judicial power. Thesame is true of another of the dissent's examples, 28 U. S. C.$ 2255, which provides federal prisoners a statutory motionto vacate a federal sentence. This procedure " `restates,clarifies and simplifies the procedure in the nature of theancient writ of error coram nobis.' " United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 218 (1952) (quoting the 1948 Reviser'sNote to $ 2255). It is meaningless to speak of these statutesas applying "retroactively," since they simply codified judicial practice that pre-existed. Next, the dissent cites theprovision of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940,54 Stat. 1178, 50 U. S. C. App. $ 520(4), which authorizescourts, upon application, to reopen judgments against members of the Armed Forces entered while they were on activeduty. It could not be clearer, however, that this provisionwas not retroactive. It says: "If any judgment shall be rendered in any action or proceeding governed by this sectionagainst any person in military service during the period ofsuch service . . . such judgment may . . . be opened . . . ."(Emphasis added.)The dissent also cites, post, at 258, a provision of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, 82 Stat. 901, 20U. S. C. $ 1415(e)(4)(B) (1988 ed. and Supp. V), which provided for the award of attorney's fees under the Educationfor All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773, 20U. S. C. $ 1411 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). This changedthe law regarding attorney's fees under the Education forAll Handicapped Children Act, after our decision in Smith v.Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984), found such fees to be unavailable. The provision of the Statutes at Large adopting thisamendment to the United States Code specified, in effect,that it would apply not only to proceedings brought after itsenactment, but also to proceedings pending at the time of,or brought after, the decision in Smith. See 100 Stat. 798.The amendment says nothing about reopening final judgments, and the retroactivity provision may well mean noth514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT236 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Opinion of the Courting more than that it applies not merely to new suits commenced after the date of its enactment, but also topreviously filed (but not yet terminated) suits of the specified sort. This interpretation would be consistent with theonly case the dissent cites, which involved a court-enteredconsent decree not yet fully executed. Counsel v. Dow, 849F. 2d 731, 734, 738-739 (CA2 1988). Alternatively, thestatute can perhaps be understood to create a new cause ofaction for attorney's fees attributable to already concludedlitigation. That would create no separation-of-powers problem, and would be consistent with this Court's view that"[a]ttorney's fee determinations . . . are `collateral to the maincause of action' and `uniquely separable from the cause ofaction to be proved at trial.' " Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S., at 277 (quoting White v. New HampshireDept. of Employment Security, 455 U. S. 445, 451-452(1982)).8The dissent's perception that retroactive reopening provisions are to be found all about us is perhaps attributable toits inversion of the statutory presumption regarding retroactivity. Thus, it asserts that Rule 60(b) must be retroactive,since "[n]ot a single word in its text suggests that it does notapply to judgments entered prior to its effective date."8 Even the dissent's scouring the 50 States for support has proved unproductive. It cites statutes from five States, post, at 258-259, nn. 12-13.Four of those statutes involve a virtually identical provision, which permits the state-chartered entity that takes over an insolvent insurance company to apply to have any of the insurer's default judgments set aside.See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 18, $ 4418 (1989); Fla. Stat. $ 631.734 (1984); N. Y.Ins. Law $ 7717 (McKinney Supp. 1995); 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 991.1716(Supp. 1994). It is not at all clear, indeed it seems to us unlikely, thatthese statutes applied retroactively, to judgments that were final beforeenactment of the scheme that created the state-chartered entity. The laststatute involves a discretionary procedure for allowing appeal by pro selitigants, Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-428(C) (Supp. 1994). It is obvious that theprovision did not apply retroactively, to judgments rendered before theprocedures were established.514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT237Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the CourtPost, at 256-257. This reverses the traditional rule, con-firmed only last Term, that statutes donot apply retroactively unless Congress expressly states that they do. SeeLandgraf, supra, at 277-280. The dissent adds that "thetraditional construction of remedial measures . . . support[s]construing [Rule 60(b)] to apply to past as well as futurejudgments."Post, at 257. But reliance on the vaguely remedial purpose of a statute to defeat the presumptionagainst retroactivity was rejected in the companion cases ofLandgraf, see 511 U. S., at 284-286, and n. 37, and Rivers v.Roadway Express, 511 U. S., at 309-313. Cf. Landgraf,supra, at 297 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("This presumption[against retroactive legislation] need not be applied to remedial legislation . . .") (citing Sampeyreac, 7 Pet., at 238).The dissent sets forth a number of hypothetical horriblesflowing from our assertedly "rigid holding"--for example,the inability to set aside a civil judgment that has becomefinal during a period when a natural disaster prevented thetimely filing of a certiorari petition. Post, at 262. That ishorrible not because of our holding, but because the underlying statute itself enacts a "rigid" jurisdictional bar to entertaining untimely civil petitions. Congress could undoubtedly enact prospective legislation permitting, or indeedrequiring, this Court to make equitable exceptions to an otherwise applicable rule of finality, just as district courts dopursuant to Rule 60(b). It is no indication whatever of theinvalidity of the constitutional rule which we announce, thatit produces unhappy consequences when a legislature lacksforesight, and acts belatedly to remedy a deficiency in thelaw. That is a routine result of constitutional rules. See,e. g., Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990) (Ex PostFacto Clause precludes postoffense statutory extension of acriminal sentence); United States Trust Co. of N. Y. v. NewJersey, 431 U. S. 1 (1977) (Contract Clause prevents retroactive alteration of contract with state bondholders); Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.

Security Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78(1982).Finally, we may respond to the suggestion of the concurrence that this case should be decided more narrowly. Theconcurrence is willing to acknowledge only that "sometimesCongress lacks the power under Article I to reopen an other-wise closed court judgment,"post, at 240-241. In the present context, what it considers critical is that $ 27A(b) is"exclusively retroactive" and "appli[es] to a limited numberof individuals." Post, at 241. If Congress had only "pro-vid[ed] some of the assurances against `singling out' thatordinary legislative activity normally provides--say, prospectivity and general applicability--we might have a dif-ferent case."Post, at 243.This seems to us wrong in both fact and law. In pointof fact, $ 27A(b) does not "single out" any defendant for adverse treatment (or any plaintiff for favorable treatment).Rather, it identifies a class of actions (those filed preLampf,timely under applicable state law, but dismissed as timebarred postLampf ) which embraces many plaintiffs and defendants, the precise number and identities of whom we evennow do not know. The concurrence's contention that thenumber of covered defendants "is too small (compared withthe number of similar, uncovered firms) to distinguishmeaningfully the law before us from a similar law aimed ata single closed case," post, at 244 (emphasis added), rendersthe concept of "singling out" meaningless.More importantly, however, the concurrence's point seemsto us wrong in law. To be sure, the class of actions identifiedby $ 27A(b) could have been more expansive (e. g., all actionsthat were or could have been filed pre-Lampf ) and the provision could have been written to have prospective as well asretroactive effect (e. g., "all post-Lampf dismissed actions,plus all future actions under Rule 10b-5, shall be timely ifbrought within 30 years of the injury"). But it escapes us514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT239Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)Opinion of the Courthow this could in any way cause the statute to be any lessan infringement upon the judicial power. The nub of thatinfringement consists not of the Legislature's acting in a par-ticularized and hence (according to the concurrence) nonlegislative fashion; 9 but rather of the Legislature's nullifyingprior, authoritative judicial action. It makes no differencewhatever to that separation-of-powers violation that it is ingross rather than particularized (e. g., "we hereby set asideall hitherto entered judicial orders"), or that it is not accompanied by an "almost" violation of the Bill of AttainderClause, or an "almost" violation of any other constitutionalprovision.Ultimately, the concurrence agrees with our judgmentonly "[b]ecause the law before us embodies risks of the verysort that our Constitution's `separation of powers' prohibitionseeks to avoid." Post, at 246. But the doctrine of separation of powers is a structural safeguard rather than a rem-edy to be applied only when specific harm, or risk of specificharm, can be identified. In its major features (of which theconclusiveness of judicial judgments is assuredly one) it is aprophylactic device, establishing high walls and clear distinc-tions because low walls and vague distinctions will not bejudicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict. It isinteresting that the concurrence quotes twice, and cites with-out quotation a third time, the opinion of Justice Powell in9 The premise that there is something wrong with particularized legislative action is of course questionable. While legislatures usually actthrough laws of general applicability, that is by no means their only legitimate mode of action. Private bills in Congress are still common, andwere even more so in the days before establishment of the Claims Court.Even laws that impose a duty or liability upon a single individual or firmare not on that account invalid--or else we would not have the extensivejurisprudence that we do concerning the Bill of Attainder Clause, including cases which say that it requires not merely "singling out" but alsopunishment, see, e. g., United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 315-318(1946), and a case which says that Congress may legislate "a legitimateclass of one," Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425,472 (1977).514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT240 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.Breyer, J., concurring in judgmentINS v. Chadha, 462 U. S., at 959. But Justice Powell wroteonly for himself in that case. He alone expressed dismaythat "[t]he Court's decision . . . apparently will invalidateevery use of the legislative veto," and opined that "[t]hebreadth of this holding gives one pause." Ibid. It did notgive pause to the six-Justice majority, which put an end tothe long-simmering interbranch dispute that would other-wise have been indefinitely prolonged. We think legislatedinvalidation of judicial judgments deserves the same categor-ical treatment accorded byChadha to congressional invalida-tion of executive action. The delphic alternative suggestedby the concurrence (the setting aside of judgments is allright so long as Congress does not "impermissibly tr[y] toapply, as well as make, the law," post, at 241) simply pro-longs doubt and multiplies confrontation. Separation ofpowers, a distinctively American political doctrine, profitsfrom the advice authored by a distinctively American poet:Good fences make good neighbors.* * *We know of no previous instance in which Congress hasenacted retroactive legislation requiring an Article III courtto set aside a final judgment, and for good reason. The Con-stitution's separation of legislative and judicial powers deniesit the authority to do so. Section 27A(b) is unconstitutionalto the extent that it requires federal courts to reopen finaljudgments entered before its enactment. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.
