A New York statute requires hospitals to collect sur-charges from patients covered by a commercial insurer butnot from patients insured by a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan,and it subjects certain health maintenance organizations(HMO's) to surcharges that vary with the number of Medic-aid recipients each enrolls. N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-c(McKinney 1993). These cases call for us to decide whetherthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq.(1988 ed. and Supp. V), pre-empts the state provisions forsurcharges on bills of patients whose commercial insurancecoverage is purchased by employee health-care plans governed by ERISA, and for surcharges on HMO's insofar astheir membership fees are paid by an ERISA plan. We holdthat the provisions for surcharges do not "relate to" em-ployee benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA's preemption provision, $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), and accord-ingly suffer no pre-emption.IANew York's Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Method-ology (NYPHRM) regulates hospital rates for all in-patientcare, except for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.1N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-c (McKinney 1993).2 Thescheme calls for patients to be charged not for the cost oftheir individual treatment, but for the average cost of treating the patient's medical problem, as classified under one oranother of 794 Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG's).

N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-c(1)(a); see alsoBrief for Petitioners Pataki et al. 4.3 Others, however, arenot. Patients served by commercial insurers providing in-patient hospital coverage on an expense-incurred basis, byself-insured funds directly reimbursing hospitals, and by cer-tain workers' compensation, volunteer firefighters' benefit,ambulance workers' benefit, and no-fault motor vehicle insur-ance funds, must be billed at the DRG rate plus a 13% surcharge to be retained by the hospital.

For the year ending March 31, 1993,moreover, hospitals were required to bill commercially in-sured patients for a further 11% surcharge to be turned overto the State, with the result that these patients were charged24% more than the DRG rate. $ 2807-c(11)(i).New York law also imposes a surcharge on HMO's, whichvaries depending on the number of eligible Medicaid recipients an HMO has enrolled, but which may run as high as9% of the aggregate monthly charges paid by an HMO forits members' in-patient hospital care. $$ 2807-c(2-a)(a) to(2-a)(e).

TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the Court9% surcharge statutes. The New York State Conference ofBlue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Empire Blue Cross andBlue Shield (collectively the Blues), and the Hospital Associa-tion of New York State intervened as defendants, and theNew York State Health Maintenance Organization Confer-ence and several HMO's intervened as plaintiffs. The District Court consolidated the actions and granted summaryjudgment to the plaintiffs.Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 813F. Supp. 996 (SDNY 1993). The court found that althoughthe surcharges "do not directly increase a plan's costs or [a]f-fect the level of benefits to be offered" there could be "littledoubt that the [s]urcharges at issue will have a significanteffect on the commercial insurers and HMOs which do orcould provide coverage for ERISA plans and thus lead, atleast indirectly, to an increase in plan costs."Id., at 1003(footnote omitted). It found that the "entire justification forthe [s]urcharges is premised on that exact result--that the[s]urcharges will increase the cost of obtaining medical insurance through any source other than the Blues to a sufficientextent that customers will switch their coverage to and ensure the economic viability of the Blues." Ibid. (footnoteomitted). The District Court concluded that this effect onchoices by ERISA plans was enough to trigger pre-emptionunder $ 514(a) and that the surcharges were not saved by$ 514(b) as regulating insurance. Id., at 1003-1008. TheDistrict Court accordingly enjoined enforcement of "thosesurcharges against any commercial insurers or HMOs in con-nection with their coverage of . . . ERISA plans." Id., at1012.44 The District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that the injunctive remedy was not prohibited by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C.$ 1341, which provides that federal district courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment . . . of any tax under State law where aplain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."Although these courts considered the surcharges to be taxes, they foundno "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" to exist in state court, sinceERISA $ 502(e), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V), divests statecourts of jurisdiction over such claims. See 813 F. Supp., at 1000-1001;514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT653Cite as: 514 U.

Greater Wash-ington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.

Cuomo,14 F. 3d 708, 718 (1994). In the light of our decision inIngersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 141 (1990),the Court of Appeals abandoned its own prior decision inRebaldo v. Cuomo, 749 F. 2d 133, 137 (1984), cert. denied,472 U. S. 1008 (1985), which had drawn upon the definition ofthe term "State" in ERISA $ 514(c)(2), 29 U. S.

Rejecting thatnarrower approach to ERISA pre-emption, it relied onour statement in Ingersoll-Rand that under the applicable" `broad common-sense meaning,' a state law may `relate to'a benefit plan, and thereby be pre-empted, even if the law isnot specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect isonly indirect." 498 U. S., at 139; see 14 F. 3d, at 718.Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 14 F. 3d 708, 713-714 (CA2 1994). Neitherparty challenges this conclusion and we have no occasion to examine it.Nor do we address the surcharge statute insofar as it applies to selfinsured funds. The trial court's ERISA analysis originally led it to enjoindefendants "from enforcing those surcharges against any commercial insurers or HMOs in connection with their coverage of . . . ERISA plans,"without any further mention of self-insured funds. 813 F. Supp., at 1012.After staying its decision as to the 13% surcharge pending appeal, see id.,at 1012-1015, it ordered all named parties, including the Travelers Insurance Company (which served as fiduciary to a self-insured plan), to paythat surcharge whenever required by state law, see Travelers Ins. Co. v.New York State Health Maintenance Conference, No. 92 Civ. 3999 (SDNYApr. 27, 1993), reprinted in Brief for National Carriers' Conference Committee as Amicus Curiae 29a-31a. The Court of Appeals, in turn, didnot expressly address this application of the surcharge and, accordingly,we leave it for consideration on remand.514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT654 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that thesurcharges were meant to increase the costs of certain insurance and health care by HMO's, and held that this "purpose-[ful] interfer[ence] with the choices that ERISA plans makefor health care coverage . . . is sufficient to constitute [a]`connection with' ERISA plans" triggering pre-emption.Id., at 719. The court's conclusion, in sum, was that "thethree surcharges `relate to' ERISA because they impose asignificant economic burden on commercial insurers andHMOs" and therefore "have an impermissible impact onERISA plan structure and administration." Id., at 721. Inthe light of its conclusion that the surcharge statutes werenot otherwise saved by any applicable exception, the courtheld them pre-empted. Id., at 723. It recognized the apparent conflict between its conclusion and the decision of theThird Circuit in United Wire, Metal and Machine Healthand Welfare Fund v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., 995 F. 2d1179, 1191, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 944 (1993), which held thatNew Jersey's similar ratesetting statute "does not relate tothe plans in a way that triggers ERISA's preemption clause."See 14 F. 3d, at 721, n. 3. We granted certiorari to resolvethis conflict, 513 U. S. 920 (1994), and now reverse andremand. IIOur past cases have recognized that the SupremacyClause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, may entail pre-emption of statelaw either by express provision, by implication, or by a con-flict between federal and state law. SeePacific Gas & Elec.Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 203-204 (1983); Rice v. SantaFe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). And yet, de-spite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence, we have never assumed lightly that Congress has der-ogated state regulation, but instead have addressed claimsof pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congressdoes not intend to supplant state law. See Maryland v.514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT655Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)Opinion of the CourtLouisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). Indeed, in cases likethis one, where federal law is said to bar state action in fieldsof traditional state regulation, see Hillsborough County v.Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 719(1985), we have worked on the "assumption that the historicpolice powers of the States were not to be superseded by theFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purposeof Congress." Rice, supra, at 230. See, e. g., Cipollone v.Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516 (1992); id., at 532-533(Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment inpart, and dissenting in part);Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740 (1985); Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519 (1977); Napier v. Atlantic Coast LineR. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611 (1926).Since pre-emption claims turn on Congress's intent, Cipollone, supra, at 516; Shaw, supra, at 95, we begin as we do inany exercise of statutory construction with the text of theprovision in question, and move on, as need be, to the structure and purpose of the Act in which it occurs. See, e. g.,Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 138. The governing text ofERISA is clearly expansive. Section 514(a) marks for preemption "all state laws insofar as they . . . relate to anyemployee benefit plan" covered by ERISA, and one might beexcused for wondering, at first blush, whether the words oflimitation ("insofar as they . . . relate") do much limiting. If"relate to" were taken to extend to the furthest stretch ofits indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emptionwould never run its course, for "[r]eally, universally, relationsstop nowhere," H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New Yorked., World's Classics 1980). But that, of course, would be toread Congress's words of limitation as mere sham, and toread the presumption against pre-emption out of the lawwhenever Congress speaks to the matter with generality.That said, we have to recognize that our prior attempt toconstrue the phrase "relate to" does not give us much helpdrawing the line here.514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT656 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the CourtIn Shaw, we explained that "[a] law `relates to' an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if ithas a connection with or reference to such a plan." 463U. S., at 96-97. The latter alternative, at least, can be ruledout. The surcharges are imposed upon patients and HMO's,regardless of whether the commercial coverage or membership, respectively, is ultimately secured by an ERISA plan,private purchase, or otherwise, with the consequence thatthe surcharge statutes cannot be said to make "reference to"ERISA plans in any manner. Cf. Greater Washington Bd.of Trade, 506 U. S., at 130 (striking down District of Columbia law that "specifically refers to welfare benefit plans regulated by ERISA and on that basis alone is pre-empted").But this still leaves us to question whether the surchargelaws have a "connection with" the ERISA plans, and here anuncritical literalism is no more help than in trying to construe "relate to." For the same reasons that infinite relations cannot be the measure of pre-emption, neither can infinite connections. We simply must go beyond the unhelpfultext and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as aguide to the scope of the state law that Congress understoodwould survive.AAs we have said before, $ 514 indicates Congress's intentto establish the regulation of employee welfare benefit plans"as exclusively a federal concern." Alessi v. RaybestosManhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523 (1981). We have foundthat in passing $ 514(a), Congress intended"to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subjectto a uniform body of benefits law; the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or betweenStates and the Federal Government . . . , [and to prevent]the potential for conflict in substantive law . . . requiring514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT657Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthe tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the pecu-liarities of the law of each jurisdiction." IngersollRand, 498 U. S., at 142.This objective was described in the House of Representa-tives by a sponsor of the Act, Representative Dent, as beingto "eliminat[e] the threat of conflicting and inconsistent Stateand local regulation." 120 Cong. Rec. 29197 (1974). Senator Williams made the same point, that "with the narrowexceptions specified in the bill, the substantive and enforcement provisions . . . are intended to preempt the field forFederal regulations, thus eliminating the threat of conflictingor inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefitplans." Id., at 29933. The basic thrust of the pre-emptionclause, then, was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in orderto permit the nationally uniform administration of employeebenefit plans.Accordingly inShaw, for example, we had no trouble find-ing that New York's "Human Rights Law, which prohibit[ed]employers from structuring their employee benefit plans ina manner that discriminate[d] on the basis of pregnancy, and[New York's] Disability Benefits Law, which require[d] em-ployers to pay employees specific benefits, clearly `relate[d]to' benefit plans." 463 U. S., at 97. These mandates affect-ing coverage could have been honored only by varying thesubjects of a plan's benefits whenever New York law mighthave applied, or by requiring every plan to provide all beneficiaries with a benefit demanded by New York law if NewYork law could have been said to require it for any one beneficiary. Similarly, Pennsylvania's law that prohibited "plansfrom . . . requiring reimbursement [from the beneficiary] inthe event of recovery from a third party" related to em-ployee benefit plans within the meaning of $ 514(a). FMCCorp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 60 (1990). The law "prohib-it[ed] plans from being structured in a manner requiring reimbursement in the event of recovery from a third party"and "require[d] plan providers to calculate benefit levels in514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT658 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the CourtPennsylvania based on expected liability conditions that dif-fer from those in States that have not enacted similar antisubrogation legislation," thereby "frustrat[ing] plan adminis-trators' continuing obligation to calculate uniform benefitlevels nationwide." Ibid. Pennsylvania employees who re-covered in negligence actions against tortfeasors would, byvirtue of the state law, in effect have been entitled to benefitsin excess of what plan administrators intended to provide,and in excess of what the plan provided to employees inother States. Along the same lines, New Jersey could notprohibit plans from setting workers' compensation paymentsoff against employees' retirement benefits or pensions, because doing so would prevent plans from using a method ofcalculating benefits permitted by federal law. Alessi, supra,at 524. In each of these cases, ERISA pre-empted statelaws that mandated employee benefit structures or theiradministration. Elsewhere, we have held that state lawsproviding alternative enforcement mechanisms also relateto ERISA plans, triggering pre-emption. See IngersollRand, supra. BBoth the purpose and the effects of the New York sur-charge statute distinguish it from the examples just given.The charge differentials have been justified on the groundthat the Blues pay the hospitals promptly and efficiently and,more importantly, provide coverage for many subscriberswhom the commercial insurers would reject as unacceptablerisks. The Blues' practice, called open enrollment, has con-sistently been cited as the principal reason for charge differentials, whether the differentials resulted from voluntary ne-gotiation between hospitals and payers as was the case priorto the NYPHRM system, or were created by the surchargesas is the case now. See,e. g., Charge Differential AnalysisCommittee, New York State Hospital Review and PlanningCouncil, Report (1989), reprinted in Joint Appendix in No.93-7132 (CA2), pp. 702, 705, 706 (J. A. CA2); J.

The Case of the New York Prospective Hos-pital Reimbursement Methodology, 12 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law 391, 402 (1987).5 Since the surcharges are pre-sumably passed on at least in part to those who purchasecommercial insurance or HMO membership, their effects fol-low from their purpose. Although there is no evidence thatthe surcharges will drive every health insurance consumerto the Blues, they do make the Blues more attractive (orless unattractive) as insurance alternatives and thus have anindirect economic effect on choices made by insurance buyers, including ERISA plans.An indirect economic influence, however, does not bindplan administrators to any particular choice and thus func-tion as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself; commercial insurers and HMO's may still offer more attractive packages5 Although respondents argue that the surcharges have become superfluous now that all insurers have become subject to certain open enrollment requirements, see Brief for Respondents Travelers Insurance Co. etal. 6-7, n. 5; 1992 N. Y. Laws, ch. 501, $ 4 (effective Apr. 1, 1993), N. Y. Ins.Law $ 3231 (McKinney Supp. 1995), it is not our responsibility to reviewthe continuing substantive rationale for the surcharges. Even so, the surcharges may well find support in an effort to compensate the Blues for thecurrent makeup of their insurance pool, which presumably continues toreflect their longer history of open enrollment policies. See J. Corcoran,Superintendent of Insurance, Position Paper of New York State InsuranceDepartment on Inpatient Reimbursement Rate Differential ProvidedNon-Profit Insurers 8 (1984) (J. A. CA2, at 679) ("If there is any possibilityof an abrupt abandonment of the current hospital discount, considerationshould be given to the past history of health insurance enrollment in NewYork which has left the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans with a core of uninsurables obtained over the years and the ongoing liability resulting fromthat enrollment").514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT660 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the Courtthan the Blues. Nor does the indirect influence of the sur-charges preclude uniform administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package if a plan wishesto provide one. It simply bears on the costs of benefits andthe relative costs of competing insurance to provide them.It is an influence that can affect a plan's shopping decisions,but it does not affect the fact that any plan will shop for thebest deal it can get, surcharges or no surcharges.There is, indeed, nothing remarkable about surcharges onhospital bills, or their effects on overall cost to the plans andthe relative attractiveness of certain insurers. Rate variations among hospital providers are accepted examples of costvariation, since hospitals have traditionally "attempted tocompensate for their financial shortfalls by adjusting theirprice . . . schedules for patients with commercial health insurance." Thorpe, 12 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law, at394. Charge differentials for commercial insurers, evenprior to state regulation, "varied dramatically across regions, ranging from 13 to 36 percent," presumably reflectingthe geographically disparate burdens of providing for the uninsured. Id., at 400; see id., at 398-399; see also, e. g., Trussell 170 (J. A. CA2, at 664); Bobinski, Unhealthy Federalism:Barriers to Increasing Health Care Access for the Uninsured, 24 U. C. D. L. Rev. 255, 267, and n. 44 (1990).If the common character of rate differentials even in theabsence of state action renders it unlikely that ERISA preemption was meant to bar such indirect economic influencesunder state law, the existence of other common state actionwith indirect economic effects on a plan's costs leaves theintent to pre-empt even less likely. Quality standards, forexample, set by the State in one subject area of hospitalservices but not another would affect the relative cost ofproviding those services over others and, so, of providingdifferent packages of health insurance benefits. Even basicregulation of employment conditions will invariably affectthe cost and price of services.514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT661Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)Opinion of the CourtQuality control and workplace regulation, to be sure, arepresumably less likely to affect premium differentials amongcompeting insurers, but that does not change the fact thatsuch state regulation will indirectly affect what an ERISAor other plan can afford or get for its money. Thus, in theabsence of a more exact guide to intended pre-emption than$ 514, it is fair to conclude that mandates for rate differentialswould not be pre-empted unless other regulation with indi-rect effects on plan costs would be superseded as well. Thebigger the package of regulation with indirect effects thatwould fall on the respondents' reading of $ 514, the less likelyit is that federal regulation of benefit plans was intended toeliminate state regulation of health care costs.Indeed, to read the pre-emption provision as displacing allstate laws affecting costs and charges on the theory that theyindirectly relate to ERISA plans that purchase insurancepolicies or HMO memberships that would cover such services would effectively read the limiting language in $ 514(a)out of the statute, a conclusion that would violate basic principles of statutory interpretation and could not be squaredwith our prior pronouncement that "[p]re-emption does notoccur . . . if the state law has only a tenuous, remote, orperipheral connection with covered plans, as is the case withmany laws of general applicability." District of Columbiav. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S., at 130, n. 1(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). WhileCongress's extension of pre-emption to all "state laws relating to benefit plans" was meant to sweep more broadly than"state laws dealing with the subject matters covered byERISA[,] reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, andthe like," Shaw, 463 U. S., at 98, and n. 19, nothing in thelanguage of the Act or the context of its passage indicatesthat Congress chose to displace general health care regulation, which historically has been a matter of local concern, see Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S., at 719; 1 B. Furrow, T. Greaney,514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT662 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the CourtS. Johnson, T. Jost, & R. Schwartz, Health Law $$ 1-6, 1-23(1995).In sum, cost uniformity was almost certainly not an objectof pre-emption, just as laws with only an indirect economiceffect on the relative costs of various health insurance pack-ages in a given State are a far cry from those "conflictingdirectives" from which Congress meant to insulate ERISAplans. See 498 U. S., at 142. Such state laws leave planadministrators right where they would be in any case, withthe responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for themoney. We therefore conclude that such state laws do notbear the requisite "connection with" ERISA plans to trigger pre-emption. CThis conclusion is confirmed by our decision in Mackey v.Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825(1988), which held that ERISA pre-emption falls short ofbarring application of a general state garnishment statuteto participants' benefits in the hands of an ERISA welfarebenefit plan. We took no issue with the argument of theMackey plan's trustees that garnishment would impose ad-ministrative costs and burdens upon benefit plans, id., at 831,but concluded from the text and structure of ERISA's pre-emption and enforcement provisions that "Congress did notintend to forbid the use of state-law mechanisms of executingjudgments against ERISA welfare benefit plans, even whenthose mechanisms prevent plan participants from receivingtheir benefits."Id., at 831-832. If a law authorizing anindirect source of administrative cost is not pre-empted, itshould follow that a law operating as an indirect source ofmerely economic influence on administrative decisions, ashere, should not suffice to trigger pre-emption either.The commercial challengers counter by invoking the earlier case of Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471U. S. 724 (1985), which considered whether a State couldmandate coverage of specified minimum mental-health-care514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT663Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)Opinion of the Courtbenefits by policies insuring against hospital and surgicalexpenses. Because the regulated policies included thosebought by employee welfare benefit plans, we recognizedthat the law "directly affected" such plans.Id., at 732.Although we went on to hold that the law was ultimatelysaved from pre-emption by the insurance saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), respondents profferthe first steps in our decision as support for their argumentthat all laws affecting ERISA plans through their impact oninsurance policies "relate to" such plans and are pre-emptedunless expressly saved by the statute. The challengers takeMetropolitan Life too far, however.The Massachusetts statute applied not only to " `[a]ny blanket or general policy of insurance . . . or any policy of accidentand sickness insurance' " but also to " `any employees' healthand welfare fund which provide[d] hospital expense and surgical expense benefits.' " 471 U. S., at 730, n. 11. In fact,the State did not even try to defend its law as unrelated toemployee benefit plans for the purpose of $ 514(a). Id., at739. As a result, there was no reason to distinguish withany precision between the effects on insurers that are sufficiently connected with employee benefit plans to "relate to"the plans and those effects that are not. It was enough toaddress the distinction bluntly, saying on the one hand thatlaws like the one in Metropolitan Life relate to plans sincethey "bea[r] indirectly but substantially on all insured benefitplans, . . . requir[ing] them to purchase the mental-healthbenefits specified in the statute when they purchase a certainkind of common insurance policy," ibid., but saying on theother that "laws that regulate only the insurer, or the wayin which it may sell insurance, do not `relate to' benefitplans," id., at 741. Even this basic distinction recognizesthat not all regulations that would influence the cost of insurance would relate to employee benefit plans within the meaning of $ 514(a). If, for example, a State were to regulatesales of insurance by commercial insurers more stringently514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT664 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the Courtthan sales by insurers not for profit, the relative cost of com-mercial insurance would rise; we would nonetheless say, following Metropolitan Life, that such laws "do not `relate to'benefit plans in the first instance." Ibid. And on the sameauthority we would say the same about the basic tax exemp-tion enjoyed by nonprofit insurers like the Blues since thedays long before ERISA, see Marmor, New York's BlueCross and Blue Shield, 1934-1990: The Complicated Politicsof Nonprofit Regulation, 16 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law761, 769 (1991) (tracing New York Blue Cross's special taxtreatment as a prepayment organization back to 1934); 1934N. Y. Laws, ch. 595; and yet on respondents' theory the exemption would necessarily be pre-empted as affecting insur-ance prices and plan costs.In any event, Metropolitan Life cannot carry the weightthe commercial insurers would place on it. The New Yorksurcharges do not impose the kind of substantive coveragerequirement binding plan administrators that was at issue inMetropolitan Life. Although even in the absence of man-dated coverage there might be a point at which an exorbitanttax leaving consumers with a Hobson's choice would betreated as imposing a substantive mandate, no showing hasbeen made here that the surcharges are so prohibitive as toforce all health insurance consumers to contract with theBlues. As they currently stand, the surcharges do not re-quire plans to deal with only one insurer, or to insure againstan entire category of illnesses they might otherwise chooseto leave without coverage.DIt remains only to speak further on a point already raised,that any conclusion other than the one we draw would barany state regulation of hospital costs. The basic DRG system (even without any surcharge), like any other interfer-ence with the hospital services market, would fall on a theory that all laws with indirect economic effects on ERISA514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)Opinion of the Courtplans are pre-empted under $ 514(a). This would be an unsettling result and all the more startling because severalStates, including New York, regulated hospital charges toone degree or another at the time ERISA was passed, see,e. g., Cal. Ins. Code Ann. $ 11505 (West 1972) (nonprofit hospitals); Colo. Rev. Stat. $$ 10-16-130, 10-17-108(2) to 108(3),10-17-119(b) (1973); Conn. Gen.

Laws Ann., ch. 176B, $ 4 (West 1958 and Supp. 1987)(medical service corporations); Health Maintenance Organization Act, 1973 N. J. Laws, ch. 337, $ 8, N. J. Stat.

And yet there is not somuch as a hint in ERISA's legislative history or anywhereelse that Congress intended to squelch these state efforts.Even more revealing is the National Health Planning andResources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA), Pub. L. 93-641, 88 Stat. 2225, $$ 1-3, repealed by Pub. L. 99-660, titleVII, $ 701(a), 100 Stat. 3799, which was adopted by the sameCongress that passed ERISA, and only months later. TheNHPRDA sought to encourage and help fund state responsesto growing health care costs and the widely diverging availability of health services. $ 2, 88 Stat. 2226-2227; see generally National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Centerv.

TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the Courtdevelopment agencies in qualifying States to coordinatedevelopment of health services policy. Id., at 2242-2244.These state agencies, too, would be eligible for federal fund-ing, id., at 2249, including grants "[f]or the purpose of demonstrating the effectiveness of State Agencies regulatingrates for the provision of health care . . . within the State."Ibid. Exemption from ERISA pre-emption is nowherementioned as a prerequisite to the receipt of such funding;indeed, the only legal prerequisite to be eligible for rate reg-ulation grants was "satisfactory evidence that the StateAgency has under State law the authority to carry out rateregulation functions in accordance with this section . . . ."Ibid.The Secretary was required to provide technical assistanceto the designated agencies by promulgating "[a] uniform sys-tem for calculating rates to be charged to health insurersand other health institutions payors by health service in-stitutions." Id., at 2254. Although the NHPRDA placedsubstantive restrictions on the system the Secretary couldestablish, the subject matter (and therefore the scope ofenvisioned state regulation) covers the same ground thatNew York's surcharges tread. The Secretary's system wassupposed to:"(A) [b]e based on an all-inclusive rate for variouscategories of patients . . .

Id., at2254-2255.The last-quoted subsection seems to envision a systemvery much like the one New York put in place, but thesignificant point in any event is that the statute's provisionfor comprehensive aid to state health care rate regulationis simply incompatible with pre-emption of the same byERISA. To interpret ERISA's pre-emption provision asbroadly as respondents suggest would have rendered theentire NHPRDA utterly nugatory, since it would have leftStates without the authority to do just what Congress wasexpressly trying to induce them to do by enacting theNHPRDA. Given that the NHPRDA was enacted afterERISA and by the same Congress, it just makes good senseto reject such an interpretation.66 The history of Medicare regulation makes the same point, confirmingthat Congress never envisioned ERISA pre-emption as blocking statehealth care cost control, but rather meant to encourage and rely on stateexperimentation like New York's. See generally K. Davis, G. Anderson,D. Rowland, & E. Steinberg, Health Care Cost Containment 23-25, 81, 99(1990). Since the time DRG systems were tried out in the 1960's and1970's, Congress has consistently shown its awareness and encouragementof controlled payment alternatives to the federal regulatory scheme. TheSocial Security Amendments of 1967, Pub. L. 90-248, $ 402(a), 81 Stat.930-931, as amended 42 U. S. C. $ 1395b-1, for example, granted the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now Health and Human Services)the authority to waive Medicare rules to allow for physician and hospitalreimbursement according to approved state payment schedules. In theSocial Security Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-603, $ 222(a)(5), 86 Stat.1391, Congress specifically called upon the Secretary to report on prospective reimbursement schemes that had been thus favored already or couldbe in the future. Later on, after the development of all-payor ratesettingschemes like the NYPHRM and New Jersey's Health Care Cost ReductionAct of 1978, 1978 N. J. Laws, ch. 83, Congress's Medicare waiver provisionsevolved to the point of explicit reference to a State's commitment to applyits hospital reimbursement control system to a substantial portion of hospitals and inpatient services statewide. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395ww(c)(1),(c)(5)(A). Indeed, in its Report on the Social Security Amendments of514us3$53M 05-27-98 17:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT668 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.Opinion of the CourtIIIThat said, we do not hold today that ERISA pre-emptsonly direct regulation of ERISA plans, nor could we do thatwith fidelity to the views expressed in our prior opinions onthe matter. See,e. g., Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U. S., at 139;Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47-48 (1987);Shaw, 463 U. S., at 98. We acknowledge that a state lawmight produce such acute, albeit indirect, economic effects,by intent or otherwise, as to force an ERISA plan to adopta certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers, and that such a state law mightindeed be pre-empted under $ 514. But as we have shown,New York's surcharges do not fall into either category; theyaffect only indirectly the relative prices of insurance policies,a result no different from myriad state laws in areas tradi-tionally subject to local regulation, which Congress could notpossibly have intended to eliminate.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
