In Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305 (1982), we con-strued the 1958 version of Treasury Regulation $ 25.2511-1(c) to provide that the disclaimer of a remainder interestin a trust effects a taxable gift unless the disclaimantacts within a reasonable time after learning of the transferthat created the interest. This case presents the questionwhether the rule is the same, under current Treasury Regu-lation $ 25.2511-1(c)(2) (Regulation), when the creation of theinterest (but not the disclaimer) occurred before enactmentof the federal gift tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932.We hold that it is. IIn 1917, Lucius P. Ordway established an irrevocable intervivos family trust, with his wife and their children as pri-mary concurrent life income beneficiaries, to be succeeded byunmarried surviving spouses of the children and by grand-children. The trust was to terminate upon the death of thelast surviving primary income beneficiary, at which time the*Burton G. Ross, Cynthia S. Rosenblatt, and Robert P. Reznick fileda brief for John G. Ordway, Jr., et al. as amici curiae urging affirmance.Geoffrey J. O'Connor filed a brief for the estate of Helen W.

When the trust terminated onJune 27, 1979, the corpus was subject to division into 13equal shares among 12 grandchildren living and the issue ofone who had died. Prior to distribution, on August 23, 1979,one of the grandchildren, Sally Ordway Irvine, filed a disclaimer of five-sixteenths of her interest in the trust principal. Mrs. Irvine had learned of her contingent interest inthe trust at least as early as 1931 when she reached the ageof 21, and she had begun receiving a share of the annual trustincome after her father's death in 1966. Her disclaimer wasnonetheless effective under a Minnesota statute on the booksat the time, which permitted the disclaimer of a future interest at any time within six months of the event finally identifying the disclaimant and causing her interest to become indefeasibly fixed.1 As a result of her disclaimer, each of Mrs.Irvine's five children received one-sixteenth of her share ofthe distributed trust principal.Mrs. Irvine reported the disclaimer in a federal gift taxreturn, but did not treat it as resulting in a taxable gift.The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined on auditthat the disclaimer indirectly transferred property by giftwithin the meaning of Internal Revenue Code of 1986$$ 2501(a)(1) 2 and 2511(a),3 and was not excepted from gift1 Minn.

Mrs. Irvine responded with an amendedreturn treating the disclaimer as a taxable gift, on whichshe paid the resulting tax of $7,468,671, plus $2,086,627.51 inaccrued interest on the deficiency.5 She then claimed a refund of the tax and interest, which the Internal RevenueService denied.4 The following is the relevant text of the 1958 regulation then in effect:"The gift tax also applies to gifts indirectly made. Thus, all transactions whereby property or property rights or interests are gratuitouslypassed or conferred upon another, regardless of the means or device employed, constitute gifts subject to tax.

See 26 U. S. C. $ 2505 (1988 ed. andSupp. IV). That assessment is not at issue here.511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 511 U. S. 224 (1994)Opinion of the CourtAfter Mrs. Irvine's death in 1987, respondents, represent-ing her estate, filed this action for refund of the tax andinterest in the United States District Court for the Districtof Minnesota. The Government continued to maintain thatthe partial disclaimer brought about a transfer subject tofederal gift tax because Mrs. Irvine had not made it, as theRegulation requires, "within a reasonable time after knowl-edge of the [earlier] transfer" that created her interest in thetrust estate. The Government relied on Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305 (1982), in which this Court held that the"transfer" referred to in Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c), 26 CFR$ 25.2511-1(c) (1959) (promulgated in 1958), knowledge ofwhich starts the clock ticking, occurs at the creation of theinterest being disclaimed, not when its extent is finally ascer-tained or it becomes possessory.Jewett, supra, at 311-312.Respondents tried to distinguish Jewett as having dealtwith a trust established in 1939, after the creation of the gifttax by the Revenue Act of 1932 (Act), whereas the Ordwaytrust had been created before the Act, in 1917. Respond-ents also argued that the "reasonable time" limitation didnot apply because the pre-Act, 1917 transfer creating thetrust was not a "taxable transfer" of an interest, absentwhich the Regulation was inapplicable.6 On cross-motions6 The 1958 version of the Regulation was in force throughout the periodfrom Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer to her unsuccessful claim for a refund. Theparties agree, however, that the current (1986) version of the Regulationsupersedes the earlier version and governs this case. See 26 U. S. C.$ 7805(b) (Secretary of the Treasury "may prescribe the extent, if any, towhich any ruling or regulation, relating to the internal revenue laws, shallbe applied without retroactive effect"); Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner, 353 U. S. 180, 184 (1957) (Treasury Regulations may be retroactively applied unless doing so constitutes an abuse of the Secretary'sdiscretion).The relevant regulation is now Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c)(2), 26 CFR$ 25.2511-1(c)(2) (1993), which provides in relevant part:"In the case of taxable transfers creating an interest in the person disclaiming made before January 1, 1977, where the law governing the administration of the decedent's estate gives a beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin aright completely and unqualifiedly to refuse to accept ownership of prop511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT230 UNITED STATES v.

Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245.The District Court cited Ordway v. United States, 89-1USTC || 13,802 (1989), in which the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of Florida had reached thesame conclusion, on virtually identical facts, in a case involving a partial disclaimer by another beneficiary of theOrdway trust.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit reversed. 936 F. 2d 343 (1991). It rejected theview that the Regulation is inapplicable to a trust createdbefore enactment of the gift tax statute simply because theRegulation reaches only " `taxable transfers creating aninterest in the person disclaiming made before January 1,1977.' " Id., at 347 (emphasis in original). The Court ofAppeals held that the transfer creating the trust was "taxerty transferred from a decedent (whether the transfer is effected by thedecedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution), a refusal toaccept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift if the refusal ismade within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of thetransfer. The refusal must be unequivocal and effective under the locallaw. There can be no refusal of ownership of property after its acceptance. In the absence of the facts to the contrary, if a person fails to refuseto accept the transfer to him of ownership of a decedent's property withina reasonable time after learning of the existence of the transfer, he willbe presumed to have accepted the property. Where the local law doesnot permit such a refusal, any disposition by the beneficiary, heir, or nextof-kin whereby ownership is transferred gratuitously to another constitutes the making of a gift by the beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin. In anycase where a refusal is purported to relate to only a part of the property,the determination of whether or not there has been a complete and unqualified refusal to accept ownership will depend on all the facts and circumstances in each particular case, taking into account the recognition andeffectiveness of such a purported refusal under the local law."511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 511 U.

Reg. $ 25.2518-2(c)(3) that " `a taxable transfer occurs when there is acompleted gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless ofwhether a gift tax is imposed on the completed gift.' " 936F. 2d, at 347-348. The court adopted the reasoning of itssister court for the Eleventh Circuit in Ordway v. UnitedStates, 908 F. 2d 890 (1990), which held that a "taxable transfer" occurs within the meaning of the Regulation wheneverthere is " `any transaction in which an interest in property isgratuitously passed or conferred upon another,' even if thattransaction was not subject to the gift tax."Id., at 895(citation omitted). Applying the Regulation, the Court ofAppeals for the Eighth Circuit held that Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was subject to gift tax because she did not make itwithin a reasonable time after she learned of her interest inthe trust. Finally, the divided panel also upheld applicationof the Act against the claim of retroactivity, holding it to beirrelevant that the trust antedated the 1932 enactment of theAct, since the tax was being imposed on the transfer broughtabout by the 1979 disclaimer, not on the inter vivos transferthat created the trust in 1917. 936 F. 2d, at 346.Respondents' suggestion for rehearing en banc wasgranted, however, and the panel opinion was vacated. Unlike the panel, the en banc court affirmed the District Court,holding the Regulation inapplicable because its terms expressly limit its scope to "taxable transfers . . . made beforeJanuary 1, 1977." 981 F. 2d 991 (CA8 1992). The creationof the Ordway trust in 1917 was not a "taxable transfer," thecourt reasoned, because the federal gift tax provisions hadyet to be enacted: "It is fundamental that for a transfer tobe taxable there must be an applicable tax in existence whenthe transfer is made. No such federal tax existed on January 16, 1917, when . . . Mrs. Irvine's interest was created."Id., at 994. Given the inapplicability of the Regulation andits "reasonable time" requirement for tax-free disclaimer, themajority held that state law governed the effect of a dis511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT232 UNITED STATES v. IRVINEOpinion of the Courtclaimer for federal gift tax purposes. See id., at 996 (citingHardenbergh v. Commissioner, 198 F. 2d 63 (CA8), cert. denied, 344 U. S. 836 (1952)); 981 F. 2d, at 998 (concurring opin-ion). Because Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was indisputablyvalid under Minnesota law, the court held that the federalgift tax did not apply. Finally, the majority rejected thepanel's analysis of retroactive application, indicating thattaxation of the transfer effected by the disclaimer would violate the Act's prohibition of retroactive gift taxation. Id.,at 994.In a concurring opinion, id., at 996-998, Judge Loken alsoconcluded the Regulation was inapplicable, not because of itslimitation to "taxable transfers," but because it is limited tointerests in "property transferred from a decedent . . . bythe decedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution,"whereas the Ordway trust came from an inter vivos transfer.Judge Loken shared the majority view, however, that be-cause the Regulation was inapplicable, the federal gift taxconsequences of the disclaimer were a function of state law.The dissent took the position of the majority in the panelopinion, and of the Eleventh Circuit in Ordway v. UnitedStates, supra.

We held in Jewett,supra, at 310, that "the statutory language . . . unquestionably encompasses an indirect transfer, effected by meansof a disclaimer, of a contingent future interest in a trust,"the practical effect of such a transfer being "to reduce theexpected size of [the taxpayer's] taxable estate and to confera gratuitous benefit upon the natural objects of [her]bounty . . . ."Treasury Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c)(1) 9 restates the gift tax'sbroad scope by providing that the tax is payable on "anytransaction in which an interest in property is gratuitouslypassed or conferred upon another, regardless of the meansor device employed . . . ." The Regulation (subsection1(c)(2)), on the other hand, affords an exception to the general rule of taxability, by providing that a disclaimer of property transferred by a decedent's will or the law of descentand distribution does not result in a gift if it is unequivocaland effective under local law, and made "within a reasonabletime after knowledge of the existence of the transfer."

IRVINEOpinion of the Courtalready noted, the Jewett Court held that "the transfer" inthe 1958 version of the Regulation refers to the creation ofthe interest being disclaimed, with the "reasonable time"therefore beginning to run upon knowledge of the creationof the trust. See supra, at 229.IIIAOn one point there cannot be any serious dispute, for it isclear that if the Regulation applies to Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer, her act resulted in taxable gifts. The knowledgeand capacity to act, which are presupposed by the requirement that a tax-free disclaimer be made within a reasonabletime of the disclaimant's knowledge of the transfer of theinterest to her, were present in this instance at least as earlyas Mrs. Irvine's 21st birthday in 1931.10 We need not decidewhether a disclaimer good for gift tax purposes could be re-quired to have been made before enactment of the gift tax,for Mrs. Irvine did not disclaim shortly after enactment ofthe Act, and the timeliness determination in this case wouldbe the same whether the reasonable time was calculatedfrom Mrs. Irvine's first knowledge of the interest (1931) orfrom the enactment of the federal gift tax statute (1932).Moreover, we understand the Government to have concededthat it would not have contested the timeliness of a dis-claimer made within a reasonable time after the enactmentof the Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.The determination of the amount of "reasonable time" thatremained after Mrs. Irvine learned of the interest andreached majority status must be based upon the gift tax'spurpose to curb avoidance of the estate tax.

Jewett,455 U. S., at 310. Accordingly, as the Court said in Jewett," `[a]n important, if not the main, purpose of the gift tax wasto prevent or compensate for avoidance of death taxes bytaxing the gifts of property inter vivos which, but for thegifts, would be subject in its original or converted formto the tax laid upon transfers at death.' " Ibid. (quotingEstate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U. S. 39, 44 (1939)).Hence the capacious language of Internal Revenue Code$$ 2501(a)(1) and 2511(a), which encompasses all gratuitoustransfers of property and property rights of significant value.See supra, at 232-233."[T]he passage of time is crucial to the scheme of the gifttax." Jewett, supra, at 316, n. 17 (internal quotation marksand citation omitted). The opportunity to disclaim, andthereby to avoid gift as well as estate taxation, should notbe so long as to provide a virtually unlimited opportunity toconsider estate planning consequences. While a decision todisclaim even at the earliest opportunity may be made withappreciation of potential estate tax consequences, the passage of time puts the prospective disclaimant in a correspondingly superior position to determine whether her needto enjoy the property (and incur a tax for a subsequent giftof it or an increased estate tax if she retains it) outweighsthe favorable estate and gift tax consequences of a disclaimer. Although there is no bright-line rule for timelinessin the absence of a statute or regulation providing one, Mrs.Irvine's delay for at least 47 years after the clock began running, until she reached age 68, could not possibly be thoughtreasonable. By the date of her disclaimer, Mrs. Irvine wasin a position to make a fairly precise determination of theadvantage to be gained by a transfer diminishing her estate511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT236 UNITED STATES v. IRVINEOpinion of the Courtand its eventual taxation. If her decision were treated astimely, the requirement for a timely election would have nobite at all.BRespondents would avoid this result on two alternativegrounds. They argue first that by its own terms, the Regulation does not apply on the facts of this case, with the consequence that taxability under the Internal Revenue Codeturns on the efficacy of the disclaimer under state law. Second, respondents argue that even if the disclaimer would result in an otherwise taxable transfer in the absence of thegoverning Regulation, the tax on transfer of an interest created by an instrument antedating the enactment of the gifttax statute would be barred by the statutory prohibition ofretroactive application.1The question of the Regulation's applicability under itsown terms need not be resolved here, for the result of itsinapplicability would not be freedom from gift taxation on atheory of borrowed state law or on any other rationale. Thearguments for inapplicability may therefore be shortlystated, each having been raised at one point or another inthe prior litigation of this case.The first argument turns on the Regulation's applicationto disclaimers of interests created by what it terms "taxabletransfers," a phrase that on its face presupposes some sourceof taxability for the transfer. There was, however, no gifttax when the trust, including its remainder interests, wascreated in 1917, and the gift tax provisions of the Act didnot render preenactment transfers taxable.11 The languageis, to say the least, troublesome to the Government's positionthat the Regulation applies. The Government responds to11 See Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245 (nonretroactivity provision).511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT237Cite as: 511 U. S. 224 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe trouble by citing Treas. Reg. $ 25.2518-2(c)(3) 12 (adoptedin 1986, as was the Regulation), which deals with the newregime (not applicable here) for disclaimers of interests cre-ated after December 31, 1976,13 and defines "taxable transfer" for its purposes as covering transfers on which no taxis actually imposed (e. g., because a gift is chargeable againstthe current lifetime exemption, 26 U. S. C. $ 2503(b)). If thisdefinition is thought to beg the question, the Governmentfalls back to the argument that the predecessor regulationwas not limited in application to interests derived from tax-able transfers, and there was no intent in 1986 to narrow thescope covered by the 1958 version of the Regulation in anysuch way.The second argument rests on the Regulation's provisionthat "the transfer" to which it applies is subject to a timely,tax-free disclaimer "whether the transfer is effected by thedecedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution,"but only "where the law governing the administration of thedecedent's estate" gives the recipient of the transferred interest a right to refuse it.14 As against these descriptions ofthe transfer's testamentary character, the text says nothingindicating that a taxable transfer from anyone other than adecedent may create an interest subject to a disclaimer freeof gift tax. If the text is given its strict reading, then, ithas no application to the interest in question here, whichcame into being not from a decedent's transfer by will orfrom application of the law of descent and distribution, but12 Treasury Reg. $ 25.2518-2(c)(3), 26 CFR $ 25.2518-2(c)(3) (1993), provides in relevant part: "With respect to inter vivos transfers, a taxabletransfer occurs when there is a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless of whether a gift tax is imposed on the completed gift."13 Under the new regime, tax-free disclaimers of interests created bypost-1976 transfers may generally be made within nine months after thedisclaimant has learned of the interest and reached the age of 21. See 26U. S. C. $ 2518; Treas. Reg. $$ 25.2518-1, 25.2518-2, 26 CFR $$ 25.2518-1,25.2518-2 (1993).14 See n. 6, supra.511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT238 UNITED STATES v. IRVINEOpinion of the Courtfrom Mr. Ordway's transfer during his lifetime, creating anirrevocable inter vivos trust.152Even assuming the soundness of one or both of these argu-ments that the Regulation is inapposite, however, the disclaimer would not escape federal gift taxation by referenceto state law rules giving effect to the disclaimer as causing atransfer to the beneficiary next in line. Any such reasoningwould run counter to our holding inJewett. In rejecting theargument that the 1958 version of the Regulation was beingapplied retroactively to the taxpayer's disadvantage in thatcase, the Jewett Court repudiated the "assumption that [thetaxpayer] had a `right' to renounce the interest without taxconsequences that was `taken away' by the 1958 Regulation.[The taxpayer] never had such a right." Jewett, 455 U. S.,at 317. Only then did theJewett Court go on to determinethat the disclaimer at issue did not fall within the exemptionfrom the gift tax provided by the Regulation, and was conse-quently taxable. Id., at 312-316. The Court followed thegeneral and longstanding rule in federal tax cases that al-though state law creates legal interests and rights in property, federal law determines whether and to what extentthose interests will be taxed. See,e. g., Burnet v. Harmel,287 U. S. 103, 110 (1932); Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U. S.78, 80-81 (1940); United States v. Mitchell, 403 U. S. 190, 197(1971). The Court put it this way in United States v. Pelzer,312 U. S. 399, 402-403 (1941):"[T]he revenue laws are to be construed in the light oftheir general purpose to establish a nationwide schemeof taxation uniform in its application.

S. 224 (1994)Opinion of the Courtvisions are not to be taken as subject to state control orlimitation unless the language or necessary implicationof the section involved makes its application dependenton state law."Cases like Jewett and this one illustrate as well as any whyit is that state property transfer rules do not translate intofederal taxation rules. Under state property rules, an effec-tive disclaimer of a testamentary gift16 is generally treatedas relating back to the moment of the original transfer of theinterest being disclaimed, having the effect of canceling thetransfer to the disclaimant ab initio and substituting a singletransfer from the original donor to the beneficiary of the disclaimer. See, e. g., Schoonover v. Osborne, 193 Iowa 474,478, 187 N. W. 20, 22 (1922);Seifner v. Weller, 171 S. W. 2d617, 624 (Mo. 1943); Albany Hosp. v. Hanson, 214 N. Y. 435,445, 108 N.

Although a state-law right todisclaim with such consequences might be thought to followfrom the common-law principle that a gift is a bilateral transaction, requiring not only a donor's intent to give, but also adonee's acceptance, see,e. g., Wallace v. Moore, 219 Ga. 137,139, 132 S. E. 2d 37, 39 (1963); Gottstein v. Hedges, 210 Iowa272, 275, 228 N. W. 93, 94 (1929); Pirie v. Le Saulnier, 161Wis. 503, 507, 154 N. W. 993, 994 (1915);Blanchard v.

As to interests created byintestate succession, state laws generally refused to give effect to disclaimers; the traditional rule is that "title to the property of an intestatepasses by force of the rules of law . . . and that those so entitled by lawhave no power to prevent the vesting of title in themselves."

IRVINEOpinion of the Courttant consequence of treating a disclaimer as an ab initio de-feasance is that the disclaimant's creditors are barred fromreaching the disclaimed property. See, e. g., Gottstein v.Hedges, supra. The ab initio disclaimer thus operates asa legal fiction obviating a more straightforward rule defeat-ing the claims of a disclaimant's creditors in the propertydisclaimed.The principles underlying the federal gift tax treatment ofdisclaimers look to different objects, however. As we havealready stated, Congress enacted the gift tax as a supplement to the estate tax and a means of curbing estate taxavoidance. Seesupra, at 234-235. Since the reasons fordefeating a disclaimant's creditors would furnish no reasonsfor defeating the gift tax as well, the Jewett Court was un-doubtedly correct to hold that Congress had not meant toincorporate state-law fictions as touchstones of taxabilitywhen it enacted the Act. Absent such a legal fiction, thefederal gift tax is not struck blind by a disclaimer. Andas we have already stated,supra, at 233, without the excep-tion afforded in the Regulation,17 the gift tax statute provides a general rule of taxability for disclaimers such asMrs. Irvine's.IVPresumably to ward off any attack on the federal gift taxresting on the possibility that its retroactive applicationwould violate due process, see Untermyer v. Anderson, 276U. S. 440 (1928), $ 501(b) of the Act provided that it would"not apply to a transfer made on or before the date of theenactment of this Act [June 6, 1932]." Revenue Act of 1932,ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245. The same provision has insubstance been carried forward to this day.18 Respondentsargue that even if the Regulation applies, or taxation would17 Respondents challenge the Regulation's validity only insofar as itwould allegedly sanction a retroactive application of gift tax. See infra,at 241.18 See 26 U. S. C. $ 2502(b).511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT241Cite as: 511 U. S. 224 (1994)Opinion of the Courtotherwise be authorized, taxation of the transfer followingMrs. Irvine's disclaimer would violate this limitation. Thelanguage that respondents use to frame this claim revealsthe flaw in their position. Respondents argue that "[t]hegovernment's interpretation of the 1986 Regulation to applyto interests created before enactment of the Act [i. e., to re-sult in taxability] would be a retroactive application of theAct clearly contrary to Congressional intent." Brief forRespondents 26. But $ 501 merely prohibited application ofthe gift tax statute to transfers antedating the enactment ofthe Act; it did not prohibit taxation when interests createdbefore the Act were transferred after enactment. Suchpostenactment transfers are all that happened on the occasion of Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer. The critical events, thetransfers of fractional portions of Mrs. Irvine's remainder toher children, occurred after enactment of the gift tax, thoughthe interests transferred were created before that date. Toargue otherwise, that the transfer to be taxed antedated theAct, would be to cling to the legal fiction that the disclaimerrelated back to the moment in 1917 when Lucius P. Ordwayestablished the trust. This fiction may be indulged understate law as a device to regulate creditors' rights, but theJewett Court clearly held that Congress enacted no such fantasy.19 In sum, the retroactivity argument is sufficiently answered by our statement in United States v. Jacobs, 306 U. S.363, 367 (1939), that a tax "does not operate retroactivelymerely because some of the facts or conditions upon whichits application depends came into being prior to the enactment of the tax."19 While respondents do not take the further step of arguing that $ 502should be read to embody the fiction because due process would otherwisebe violated, they do argue that taxation here would violate due processbecause Mrs. Irvine would not have been allowed to make a tax-free disclaimer within a reasonable time after adoption of the Act. But thosefacts are not presented here, as Mrs. Irvine did not disclaim until 1979.See supra, at 235.511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT242 UNITED STATES v.
