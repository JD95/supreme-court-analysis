Last Term, we reiterated the holding of Simmons v. SouthCarolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), that when "a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles thedefendant `to inform the jury of [his] parole ineligibility,either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel.' "Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U. S. 36, 39 (2001) (quotingRamdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 165 (2000) (pluralityopinion)). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held Simmons inapposite for two reasons: state law provided the jury with a third sentencing alternative, and futuredangerousness was not at issue. Each reason was error.IIn 1996, the State of South Carolina indicted petitionerWilliam Kelly for an extraordinarily brutal murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery, and for possession of a knife duringthe commission of a violent crime. The jury convicted Kellyon all charges.The trial then proceeded to a separate sentencing phasecalling for the jury to determine whether any aggravatingfactor had been shown and, if so, to choose between recommendations of death or life imprisonment. The prosecutorbegan by telling the jurors that "I hope you never in yourlives again have to experience what you are experiencingright now. Being some thirty feet away from such a person.Murderer." App. 64. He went on to present testimonythat while in prison, Kelly had made a knife (or shank) andhad taken part in an escape attempt, even to the point ofplanning to draw a female guard into his cell where he wouldhold her hostage. See id., at 129-132, 140-141. The prosecutor's cross-examination of a psychologist brought out evi534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN249Cite as: 534 U. S. 246 (2002)Opinion of the Courtdence of Kelly's sadism at an early age, see id., at 218, andhis inclination to kill anyone who rubbed him the wrong way,see id., at 195.After presentation of this evidence but before closing arguments, Kelly's counsel relied on Simmons in requestingthe judge to instruct the jurors that if Kelly received a sentence of life imprisonment, he would be ineligible for parole.The instruction she sought was a near-verbatim excerpt ofS. C. Code Ann. $ 16-3-20 (2000 Cum. Supp.):" `[L]ife imprisonment' means imprisonment until thedeath of the offender. No person sentenced to life im-prisonment is eligible for parole, community supervision,or any early release program, nor is the person eligibleto receive any work credits, education credits, good con-duct credits, or any other credits that would reduce themandatory life imprisonment required by law." 343S. C. 350, 360, 540 S. E. 2d 851, 856 (2001).The prosecutor objected that "I'm not going to argue futuredangerous[ness]. So that takes it out of Simmons anyhow."App. 245. The defense responded that "the State ha[d]already raised future dangerousness" through presentationof sentencing phase evidence, "calling correctional officers totestify to an escape attempt, to testify to the fact that [Kelly]had possession of a shank, by calling inmates who testifiedto [Kelly's] behavior in the jail . . . [and] his plan to take afemale guard hostage." Ibid. Defense counsel argued thatthe State's cross-examination of the psychologist reinforcedthe other evidentiary indications of Kelly's future dangerousness. Id., at 245-246. The trial court denied the requestedinstruction, saying that the State's evidence went to Kelly'scharacter and characteristics, not to future dangerousness.Id., at 249.The sentencing proceeding then closed with arguments inwhich the prosecutor spoke of Kelly as "the butcher of Bates534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN250 KELLY v. SOUTH CAROLINAOpinion of the Courtburg," "Bloody Billy," and "Billy the Kid." Id., at 267-268.The prosecutor told the jurors that "[Kelly] doesn't have anymental illness. He's intelligent. . . . He's quick-witted.Doesn't that make somebody a little more dangerous--" id.,at 269. Defense counsel interrupted the prosecutor in mid-sentence with an objection, presumably for raising Kelly'sfuture dangerousness. The prosecutor nonetheless went onimmediately, "--for this lady, this crime on January the 5th,doesn't that make him more unpredictable for [the victim]Shirley Shealy."Ibid. Kelly's counsel did not renew herobjection, and the trial court never ruled on the objectionentered.1 The prosecutor continued that "murderers willbe murderers. And he is the cold-blooded one right overthere." Id., at 272.After the closing arguments, the trial judge instructed thejury that in choosing between recommendations of death andlife imprisonment, it should consider the possible presence offive statutory aggravating circumstances, and three possiblestatutory mitigating circumstances. The judge explained"that the terms `life imprisonment' and `death sentence' areto be understood in this ordinary and plain meaning." Id.,at 289. But, in accordance with the earlier ruling, the courtdid not say that under South Carolina law, a convicted mur-derer sentenced to life imprisonment was ineligible for parole, nor did the court instruct that Kelly's future dangerous-ness was not in issue. At the end of the charge, Kelly'scounsel renewed her objection to the court's refusal to giveher requestedSimmons instruction or, in the alternative,to inform the jury that the State had stipulated that futuredangerousness was not in issue in the case. App. 304.1 Although the State Supreme Court referred to this portion of theprosecutor's argument, it did not indicate that defense counsel had objected between the prosecutor's description of Kelly as "dangerous" andhis subsequent characterization of Kelly as dangerous to the victim. 343S. C. 350, 360, 540 S. E. 2d 851, 856 (2001).534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN251Cite as: 534 U. S. 246 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAfter deliberating for 43 minutes, the jury found five statu-tory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubtand returned a recommendation of death, id., at 305-307, towhich the trial court acceded.On appeal to the Supreme Court of South Carolina, Kellyassigned error to the trial court's refusal to instruct that hewould be ineligible for parole under a life sentence. TheState Supreme Court ruled otherwise and gave two alternative grounds for affirming the sentence. First, it followedthe trial court in saying that the State's evidence at sentencing did not raise future dangerousness and so did not triggerSimmons: "[W]e agree with the trial court that the State'sevidence at sentencing did not implicate future dangerousness. . . . In our opinion, the evidence presented by the Statein the penalty phase was designed to show that Kelly wouldnot adapt to prison life . . . ." 343 S. C., at 362, 540 S. E. 2d,at 857. Second, relying on its own ruling in State v. Shafer,340 S. C. 291, 531 S. E. 2d 524 (2000), rev'd, Shafer v. SouthCarolina, 532 U. S. 36 (2001), the state court held thatSimmons had no application to the sentencing regime inplace at Kelly's trial. 343 S. C., at 364, 540 S. E. 2d, at 858.The State Supreme Court committed error on each point.We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 928 (2001), and now reverse.IIWe take the State Supreme Court's reasons out of order,for the second one can be answered with little more thancitation to Shafer, in which we reversed a South Carolinajudgment last Term. The state court said that "Simmons isinapplicable under [South Carolina's] new sentencing schemebecause life without the possibility of parole is not the onlylegally available sentence alternative to death." 343 S. C.,at 364, 540 S. E. 2d, at 858. That statement mistakes therelationship ofSimmons to the state sentencing scheme. Itis true that a defendant charged with murder carrying the534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN252 KELLY v. SOUTH CAROLINAOpinion of the Courtpossibility of a death sentence can, under some circum-stances, receive a sentence less than life imprisonment.But, as we explained in Shafer, under the South Carolinasentencing scheme a jury now makes a sentencing recommendation only if the jurors find the existence of an aggra-vating circumstance. When they do make a recommendation, their only alternatives are death or life without parole.532 U. S., at 49-50.2 We therefore hold, as we did in Shafer,that the state court's reasoning is not to the point.The State Supreme Court's first ground, that Kelly's fu-ture dangerousness was not "at issue," is unsupportable onthe record before us. It is not that the state court failed topose the legal issue accurately, for in considering the applicability of Simmons it asked whether Kelly's future dangerous-ness was "a logical inference from the evidence," or was "injected into the case through the State's closing argument."343 S. C., at 363, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857; see alsoShafer, supra,at 54-55 (whether prosecutor's evidence or argument placedfuture dangerousness in issue);Simmons, 512 U. S., at 165,171 (plurality opinion) (future dangerousness in issue because "State raised the specter of . . . future dangerousnessgenerally" and "advanc[ed] generalized arguments regardingthe [same]"); id., at 174 (Ginsburg, J., concurring); id., at 177(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The error, rather,2 Under South Carolina law, capital jurors first must decide whether theState has proven the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstancebeyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury cannot agree unanimously on thepresence of such a circumstance, it cannot make a sentencing recommendation; the judge is then charged with sentencing the defendant either to lifeimprisonment without parole or to a prison term of at least 30 years.S. C. Code Ann. $$ 16-3-20(B), (C) (2000 Cum. Supp.); State v. Starnes,340 S. C. 312, 328, 531 S. E. 2d 907, 916 (2000). But, if the jury doesunanimously find a statutory aggravating circumstance, it recommendsone of two possible sentences: death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. $$ 16-3-20(A), (B). The jury has no other sentencingoption.534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN253Cite as: 534 U. S. 246 (2002)Opinion of the Courtwas on the facts: the evidence and argument cited by thestate court are flatly at odds with the view that "future dangerousness was not an issue in this case." 343 S. C., at 363,540 S. E. 2d, at 857.The court acknowledged the prosecutor's "[e]vidence thatKelly took part in escape attempts and carried a shank," id.,at 362, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857, and that "he had been caughtcarrying a weapon and planning or participating in escapeattempts," ibid. The court concluded, however, that this evidence was not the sort contemplated by Simmons, that is,evidence demonstrating future danger " `if released fromprison.' " 343 S. C., at 362, n. 8, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857, n. 8(quoting Simmons, supra, at 163) (emphasis added by statecourt). The court saw the evidence as going only to Kelly'slikely behavior in prison, or to his proclivity to escape fromit; the state court said that Kelly was allowed to rebut thisevidence of his inability to adapt to prison life, but thatexplaining parole ineligibility would do nothing to rebut evidence that Kelly was an escape risk. 343 S. C., at 362-363,540 S. E. 2d, at 857.Even if we confine the evidentiary consideration to the evidence discussed by the State Supreme Court, the court's conclusion cannot be accepted. To the extent that it thoughtthat "[e]vidence that Kelly took part in escape attempts andcarried a shank . . . is not the type of future dangerousnessevidence contemplated by Simmons," id., at 362, 540 S. E.2d, at 857, it overlooked that evidence of violent behavior inprison can raise a strong implication of "generalized . . . future dangerousness." Simmons, supra, at 171. (And, ofcourse, the state court's reasoning says nothing about theevidence of the crime, or of Kelly's sadism generally, and hismercurial thirst for vengeance.) A jury hearing evidence ofa defendant's demonstrated propensity for violence reasonably will conclude that he presents a risk of violent behavior,534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN254 KELLY v. SOUTH CAROLINAOpinion of the Courtwhether locked up or free, and whether free as a fugitive oras a parolee.3The fallacy of the State Supreme Court's attempt to por-tray the thrust of the evidence as so unrealistically limitedharks back to a comparable mistake by the trial judge, whospoke of the evidence as going, not to future dangerousness,but "to [Kelly's] character and characteristics." App. 249.The error in trying to distinguishSimmons this way lies infailing to recognize that evidence of dangerous "character"may show "characteristic" future dangerousness, as it didhere. This, indeed, is the fault of the State's more generalargument before us, that evidence of future dangerousnesscounts underSimmons only when the State "introduc[es]evidence for which there is no other possible inference butfuture dangerousness to society." Brief for Respondent 27(emphasis in original). Evidence of future dangerousnessunderSimmons is evidence with a tendency to prove dangerousness in the future; its relevance to that point does notdisappear merely because it might support other inferencesor be described in other terms.43 The Chief Justice's dissent correctly notes that a required instruction on parole eligibility does not bar a prosecutor from arguing dangerousness in prison as a ground for choosing the death penalty. See post,at 261. The plurality acknowledged this possibility in Simmons v. SouthCarolina, 512 U. S. 154, 165, n. 5 (1994) ("[T]he fact that a defendant isparole ineligible does not prevent the State from arguing that the defendant poses a future danger"); see also id., at 177 (O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment) (when the defendant "bring[s] his parole ineligibility to thejury's attention" "the prosecution is free to argue that the defendantwould be dangerous in prison"). But the plurality also recognized thateven if a "State [were] free to argue that the defendant will pose a dangerto others in prison," id., at 165, n. 5, the State was not free to "misleadthe jury by concealing accurate information about the defendant's paroleineligibility," ibid.4 As The Chief Justice says, see post, at 261 (dissenting opinion), itmay well be that the evidence in a substantial proportion, if not all, capitalcases will show a defendant likely to be dangerous in the future. SeeSimmons, supra, at 163 (plurality opinion) (noting that "prosecutors inSouth Carolina, like those in other States that impose the death penalty,534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN255Cite as: 534 U. S. 246 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThe prosecutor accentuated the clear implication of futuredangerousness raised by the evidence and placed the casewithin the four corners of Simmons. He had already ex-pressed his hope that the jurors would "never in [their] livesagain have to experience . . . [b]eing some thirty feet awayfrom such a person" as Kelly. App. 64. The State SupremeCourt made no mention of this, despite its thrust: since thejurors were unlikely to be spending any time in prison, theywould end up 30 feet away from the likes of Kelly only if hegot out of prison, as he might if parole were possible. Theargument thus echoed the one made in Simmons itself, thatthe imposition of the death penalty was an act of "selfdefense." Both statements "implied that petitioner wouldbe let out eventually if the jury did not recommend a deathsentence." 512 U. S., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment) (emphasis in original).And there was more. The state court to be sure con-sidered the prosecutor's comparison of Kelly to a notoriousserial killer, variously calling him a "dangerous" "bloody""butcher." The court nonetheless thought it could somehowcordon off these statements as raising nothing more than acall for retribution. 343 S. C., at 363, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857.But the import of the argument simply cannot be compart-mentalized this way. Characterizations of butchery did goto retribution, but that did not make them any the less argu-ments that Kelly would be dangerous down the road.5 Theyfrequently emphasize a defendant's future dangerousness in their evidenceand argument at the sentencing phase"). But this is not an issue here,nor is there an issue about a defendant's entitlement to instruction on aparole ineligibility law when the State's evidence shows future dangerousness but the prosecutor does not argue it. The only questions in this caseare whether the evidence presented and the argument made at Kelly'strial placed future dangerousness at issue. The answer to each questionis yes, and we need go no further than Simmons in our discussion.5 Nor, as the State Supreme Court thought, was evidence, elicited bythe prosecution, that Kelly "took part in escape attempts," 343 S. C., at362, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857, somehow distinct from indications of dangerousness. It is true that evidence of propensity to escape does not necessarily534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN256 KELLY v. SOUTH CAROLINAOpinion of the Courtcomplemented the prosecutor's submissions that Kelly was"more frightening than a serial killer," App. 260, and that"murderers will be murderers," id., at 272.6 Thus was Kel-ly's jury, like its predecessor in Simmons, invited to infer"that petitioner is a vicious predator who would pose a con-tinuing threat to the community." Simmons, supra, at 176(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).Perhaps because this is so undeniable, the State in its argument before us takes a tack never pursued by the statecourt, in claiming there was no need for instruction on paroleineligibility, because "there is nothing whatsoever to indicatethat the jurors were concerned at all with the possibility of[Kelly's] future release when they decided death was appropriate." Brief for Respondent 47. But it cannot matterthat Kelly's jury did not ask the judge for further instructionon parole eligibility, whereas the Simmons and Shafer juriesdid. SeeShafer, 532 U. S., at 44; Simmons, supra, at 160.A trial judge's duty is to give instructions sufficient to ex-plain the law, an obligation that exists independently of anyquestion from the jurors or any other indication of perplexityon their part. Cf. C. Wright, Federal Practice and Proce-dure $ 485, p. 375 (3d ed. 2000) ("It is the duty of the trialjudge to charge the jury on all essential questions of law,whether requested or not"). Time after time appellatecourts have found jury instructions to be insufficiently clearwithout any record that the jury manifested its confusion;one need look no further than Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782(2001), for a recent example. While the jurors' questionsin Simmons and Shafer confirmed the inadequacy of thecharges in those cases, in each case it was independentlyput future dangerousness at issue, but here, the prosecution proffered evidence of at least one violent escape attempt. The evidence of Kelly's planto take a female guard hostage with a shank underscored a propensity forviolence in addition to a predilection to escape.6 The latter statement, in fact, speaks not to Kelly's past conduct, but tohis future deportment.534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN257Cite as: 534 U. S. 246 (2002)Opinion of the Courtsignificant that "[d]isplacement of `the longstanding practiceof parole availability' remains a relatively recent development [in South Carolina], and `common sense tells us thatmany jurors might not know whether a life sentence carrieswith it the possibility of parole.' " 532 U. S., at 52 (quotingSimmons, supra, at 177-178 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment)).7Nor is there any reason to believe that Kelly's jury wasbetter informed than Simmons's or Shafer's on the matter ofparole eligibility. The State, to be sure, emphasizes defensecounsel's opening statement that the jury's recommendationwould be "the sentence actually imposed and the sentencethat will actually be carried out," Record 1660, as well ascounsel's closing, which stressed that Kelly would be inprison for the rest of his life and would "never see the lightof daylight again," id., at 2060. The State stresses that thejudge told the jury that the terms "life imprisonment" and"death sentence" should be understood in their plain and ordinary meanings. App. 289.But the same things could be said of Shafer, where weexplicitly noted defense counsel's statement to the jury thatShafer would " `die in prison' after `spend[ing] his natural lifethere,' " as well as the trial judge's instructions that " `lifeimprisonment means until the death of the defendant.' " 532U. S., at 52 (emphasis deleted). We found these statementsinadequate to convey a clear understanding of Shafer's parole ineligibility, id., at 53-54,8 and Kelly, no less than Shafer,was entitled to his requested jury instruction.7 Whether this history of penology should suffice to require a Simmonsinstruction regardless of the details of evidence and argument going tofuture dangerousness is a question not raised by this case, in which evidence and argument did place dangerousness in issue.8 If Kelly's counsel had read the law verbatim to the jury with thejudge's manifest approval, that might have sufficed, but the State does notclaim that defense counsel had any such opportunity, and conceded at oralargument that it is "very unlikely" that the trial judge would have permit534US1 Unit: $U14 [04-10-03 16:06:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN258 KELLY v.
