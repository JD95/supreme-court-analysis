We hold that it does not.IWisconsin tried Aaron Lindh on multiple charges of mur-der and attempted murder. In response to his insanity defense, the State called a psychiatrist who had spoken withLindh immediately after the killings but had later, and before Lindh's trial, come under criminal investigation by theState for sexual exploitation of some of his patients. Although, at trial, Lindh tried to ask the psychiatrist aboutthat investigation, hoping to suggest the witness's interestin currying favor with the State, the trial court barred thequestioning. Lindh was convicted.On direct appeal, Lindh claimed a violation of the Confron-tation Clause of the National Constitution, but despite thedenial of relief, Lindh sought neither review in this Courtnor state collateral review. Instead, on July 9, 1992, he fileda habeas corpus application in the United States DistrictCourt, in which he again argued his Confrontation Clauseclaim. When relief was denied in October 1995, Lindhpromptly appealed to the Seventh Circuit. Shortly afteroral argument there, however, the federal habeas statutewas amended, and the Seventh Circuit ordered Lindh's casebe reheard en banc to see whether the new statute appliedto Lindh and, if so, how his case should be treated.The Court of Appeals held that the Act's amendments tochapter 153 of Title 28 generally did apply to cases pendingon the date of enactment. 96 F. 3d 856, 863 (1996). Sincethe court did not read the statute as itself answering thequestions whether or how the newly amended version of$ 2254(d) would apply to pending applications like Lindh's,id., at 861-863, it turned to this Court's recent decision inLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994).Landgraf held that, where a statute did not clearly mandatean application with retroactive effect, a court had to deter521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN324 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courtmine whether applying it as its terms ostensibly indicatedwould have genuinely retroactive effect; if so, the judicialpresumption against retroactivity would bar its application.The Seventh Circuit concluded that applying the new$ 2254(d) to cases already pending would not have genuinelyretroactive effect because it would not attach "new legal consequences" to events preceding enactment, and the courtheld the statute applicable to Lindh's case. 96 F. 3d, at 863-867 (citing Landgraf, supra, at 270). On the authority of thenew statute, the court then denied relief on the merits. 96F. 3d, at 868-877.The Seventh Circuit's decision that the new version of$ 2254(d) applies to pending, chapter 153 cases conflicts withthe holdings of Edens v. Hannigan, 87 F. 3d 1109, 1112, n. 1(CA10 1996), Boria v. Keane, 90 F. 3d 36, 37-38 (CA2 1996)(per curiam), and Jeffries v. Wood, 114 F. 3d 1484 (CA91997). In accord with the Seventh Circuit is the $ 2253(c)case of Hunter v. United States, 101 F. 3d 1565, 1568-1573(CA11 1996) (en banc) (relying on Lindh to hold certainamendments to chapter 153 applicable to pending cases).We granted certiorari limited to the question whether thenew $ 2254(d) applies to Lindh's case, 519 U. S. 1074 (1996),and we now reverse. IIBefore getting to the statute itself, we have to addressWisconsin's argument that whenever a new statute on itsface could apply to the litigation of events that occurred be-fore it was enacted, there are only two alternative sourcesof rules to determine its ultimate temporal reach: either an"express command" from Congress or application of ourLandgraf default rule. In Landgraf, we said:"When a case implicates a federal statute enactedafter the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed thestatute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, ofcourse, there is no need to resort to judicial default521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN325Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)Opinion of the Courtrules. When, however, the statute contains no such ex-press command, the court must determine whether thenew statute would have retroactive effect . . . . If thestatute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clearcongressional intent favoring such a result."Landgraf,supra, at 280.Wisconsin insists that this language means that, in the ab-sence of an express command regarding temporal reach, thisCourt must determine that temporal reach for itself byapplying its judicial default rule governing retroactivity, tothe exclusion of all other standards of statutory interpreta-tion. Brief for Respondent 9-14; see also Hunter v. UnitedStates, supra, at 1569 (suggesting that Landgraf may haveannounced a general clear-statement rule regarding the temporal reach of statutes).Wisconsin's reading, however, ignores context. The language quoted disposed of the question whether the practiceof applying the law as it stands at the time of decision represented a retreat from the occasionally conflicting positionthat retroactivity in the application of new statutes is disfavored. The answer given was no, and the presumptionagainst retroactivity was reaffirmed in the traditional rulerequiring retroactive application to be supported by a clearstatement. Landgraf thus referred to "express command[s]," "unambiguous directive[s]," and the like where itsought to reaffirm that clear-statement rule, but only there.See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S., at 263 ("[U]n-ambiguous directive" is necessary to authorize "retroactiveapplication"); id., at 264 (statutes "will not be construed tohave retroactive effect unless their language requires thisresult" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); id.,at 272-273 ("Requiring clear intent assures that Congressitself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairnessof retroactive application");id., at 286 (finding "no clear evi-dence of congressional intent" to rebut the "presumption521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN326 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courtagainst statutory retroactivity"); id., at 286 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment) (agreeing that "a legislative enactmentaffecting substantive rights does not apply retroactively ab-sent clear statement to the contrary").In determining whether a statute's terms would producea retroactive effect, however, and in determining a statute'stemporal reach generally, our normal rules of constructionapply. AlthoughLandgraf 's default rule would deny appli-cation when a retroactive effect would otherwise result,other construction rules may apply to remove even the possi-bility of retroactivity (as by rendering the statutory provision wholly inapplicable to a particular case), as Lindh ar-gues the recognition of a negative implication would do here.In sum, if the application of a term would be retroactive asto Lindh, the term will not be applied, even if, in the absenceof retroactive effect, we might find the term applicable; if itwould be prospective, the particular degree of prospectivityintended in the Act will be identified in the normal course inorder to determine whether the term does apply to Lindh.IIIThe statute reveals Congress's intent to apply the amend-ments to chapter 153 only to such cases as were filed afterthe statute's enactment (except where chapter 154 otherwisemakes select provisions of chapter 153 applicable to pendingcases). Title I of the Act stands more or less independentof the Act's other titles1 in providing for the revision of federal habeas practice and does two main things. First, in$$ 101-106, it amends $ 2244 and $$ 2253-2255 of chapter 153of Title 28 of the United States Code, governing all habeascorpus proceedings in the federal courts.2 110 Stat. 1217-1 The other titles address such issues as restitution to victims of crime(Title II), various aspects of international terrorism (Titles II, III, IV, VII,VIII), restrictions on various kinds of weapons and explosives (Titles Vand VI), and miscellaneous items (Title IX). See 110 Stat. 1214-1217.2 Section 103 also amends Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of AppellateProcedure. 110 Stat. 1218.521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)Opinion of the Court1221. Then, for habeas proceedings against a State in capi-tal cases, $ 107 creates an entirely new chapter 154 with special rules favorable to the state party, but applicable onlyif the State meets certain conditions, including provisionfor appointment of postconviction counsel in state proceed-ings.3 110 Stat. 1221-1226. In $ 107(c), the Act providesthat "Chapter 154 . . . shall apply to cases pending on or afterthe date of enactment of this Act." 110 Stat. 1226.We read this provision of $ 107(c), expressly applying chap-ter 154 to all cases pending at enactment, as indicating implicitly that the amendments to chapter 153 were assumedand meant to apply to the general run of habeas cases onlywhen those cases had been filed after the date of the Act.The significance of this provision for application to pendingcases becomes apparent when one realizes that when chapter154 is applicable, it will have substantive as well as purelyprocedural effects. If chapter 154 were merely proceduralin a strict sense (say, setting deadlines for filing and disposition, see 28 U. S. C. $$ 2263, 2266 (1994 ed., Supp. II); 110Stat. 1223, 1224-1226), the natural expectation would be thatit would apply to pending cases. Landgraf, supra, at 275(noting that procedural changes "may often be applied insuits arising before their enactment without raising concernsabout retroactivity"). But chapter 154 does more, for in itsrevisions of prior law to change standards of proof and per-suasion in a way favorable to a State, the statute goes beyond "mere" procedure to affect substantive entitlement torelief. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2264(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II); 110 Stat.1223 (incorporating revised legal standard of new $ 2254(d)).Landgraf did not speak to the rules for determining thetemporal reach of such a statute (having no need to do so).While the statute might not have a true retroactive effect,neither was it clearly "procedural" so as to fall within the3 Section 108 further adds a "technical amendment" regarding expertand investigative fees for the defense under 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q). 110Stat. 1226.521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN328 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the CourtCourt's express (albeit qualified) approval of applying suchstatutes to pending cases. Since Landgraf was the Court'slatest word on the subject when the Act was passed, Con-gress could have taken the opinion's cautious statementabout procedural statutes and its silence about the kindof provision exemplified by the new $ 2254(d) as counselingthe wisdom of being explicit if it wanted such a provisionto be applied to cases already pending. While the terms of$ 107(c) may not amount to the clear statement required fora mandate to apply a statute in the disfavored retroactiveway,4 they do serve to make it clear as a general matter that4 In United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34-37 (1992), thisCourt held that the existence of "plausible" alternative interpretationsof statutory language meant that that language could not qualify as an"unambiguous" expression of a waiver of sovereign immunity. And caseswhere this Court has found truly "retroactive" effect adequately authorized by a statute have involved statutory language that was so clear thatit could sustain only one interpretation. See Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 416-420 (1931) (holding that a statutory provision "wasmanifestly intended to operate retroactively according to its terms" wherethe tax statute spelled out meticulously the circumstances that defined theclaims to which it applied and where the alternative interpretation wasabsurd); Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner, 353 U. S. 180, 184(1957) (finding a clear statement authorizing the Commissioner of InternalRevenue to correct tax rulings and regulations "retroactively" where thestatutory authorization for the Commissioner's action spoke explicitly interms of "retroactivity"); United States v. Zacks, 375 U. S. 59, 65-67 (1963)(declining to give retroactive effect to a new substantive tax provision byreopening claims otherwise barred by statute of limitations and observingthat Congress had provided for just this sort of retroactivity for othersubstantive provisions by explicitly creating new grace periods in whichotherwise barred claims could be brought under the new substantive law).Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55-57 (1996) (finding aclear statement of congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity where the federal statute went beyond granting federal jurisdiction to hear a claim and explicitly contemplated "the State" as defendantin federal court in numerous provisions of the Act).Landgraf suggested that the following language from an unenacted precursor of the statute at issue in that case might possibly have qualified asa clear statement for retroactive effect: "[This Act] shall apply to all521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN329Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)Opinion of the Courtchapter 154 applies to pending cases when its terms fit thosecases at the particular procedural points they have reached.(As to that, of course, there may well be difficult issues, andit may be that application of Landgraf 's default rule will benecessary to settle some of them.)The next point that is significant for our purposes is thateverything we have just observed about chapter 154 is trueof changes made to chapter 153. As we have already noted,amended $ 2254(d) (in chapter 153 but applicable to chapter154 cases) governs standards affecting entitlement to relief.If, then, Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure thatchapter 154 be applied to pending cases, it should have beenjust as concerned about chapter 153, unless it had the differ-ent intent that the latter chapter not be applied to the general run of pending cases.Nothing, indeed, but a different intent explains the different treatment. This might not be so if, for example, the twochapters had evolved separately in the congressional process,only to be passed together at the last minute, after chapter154 had already acquired the mandate to apply it to pendingcases. Under those circumstances, there might have been areal possibility that Congress would have intended the samerule of application for each chapter, but in the rough-andtumble no one had thought of being careful about chapter153, whereas someone else happened to think of inserting aproceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment ofthis Act." 511 U. S., at 260 (emphasis added; internal quotation marksomitted). But, even if that language did qualify, its use of the sort ofabsolute language absent from $ 107(c) distinguishes it. Cf. United Statesv. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531-532 (1995) (finding a waiver of sovereignimmunity "unequivocally expressed" in language granting jurisdictionto the courts over "[a]ny civil action against the United States for therecovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously orillegally assessed or collected" (emphasis in Williams; internal quotationmarks omitted)); id., at 541 (Scalia, J., concurring) ("The [clear-statement]rule does not . . . require explicit waivers to be given a meaning that isimplausible . . .").521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN330 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courtprovision in chapter 154. But those are not the circum-stances here. Although chapters 153 and 154 may havebegun life independently and in different Houses of Con-gress,5 it was only after they had been joined together andintroduced as a single bill in the Senate (S. 735) that what isnow $ 107(c) was added.6 Both chapters, therefore, had tohave been in mind when $ 107(c) was added. Nor was thereanything in chapter 154 prior to the addition that made theintent to apply it to pending cases less likely than a similarintent to apply chapter 153. If anything, the contrary istrue, as the discussion of $ 2264(b) will indicate.The insertion of $ 107(c) with its different treatments ofthe two chapters thus illustrates the familiar rule that nega-tive implications raised by disparate provisions are strongestwhen the portions of a statute treated differently hadalready been joined together and were being consideredsimultaneously when the language raising the implicationwas inserted. See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 75 (1995)("The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the strongerthe inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevantrespects . . ."). When $ 107(c) was added, that is, a thoughtful Member of the Congress was most likely to have intendedjust what the later reader sees by inference.The strength of the implication is not diminished bythe one competing explanation suggested, see Brief forRespondent 11-12, which goes as follows. Chapter 154provides for expedited filing and adjudication of habeas5 See 96 F. 3d 856, 861 (CA7 1996). Lindh concedes this much. Brieffor Petitioner 23, n. 15.6 Amendment 1199, offered by Senator Dole on May 25, 1995, added whatwas then $ 607(c) and now is $ 107(c). See 141 Cong. Rec. 14600, 14614(1995). A comparison of S. 735 as it stood on May 1, 1995, and S. 735 asit passed the Senate on June 7, after the substitution of Amendment 1199,reveals that the part of the bill dealing with habeas corpus reform wassubstantially the same before and after the amendment in all ways relevant to our interpretation of $ 107(c).521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN331Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)Opinion of the Courtapplications in capital cases when a State has met certainconditions. In general terms, applications will be expedited(for a State's benefit) when a State has made adequate pro-vision for counsel to represent indigent habeas applicantsat the State's expense. Thus, $ 2261(b) provides that "[t]hischapter is applicable if a State establishes . . . a mechanismfor the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners . . . ."110 Stat. 1221-1222. There is an ambiguity in the provisionjust quoted, the argument runs, for it applies chapter 154to capital cases only where "a State establishes . . . a mechanism," leaving a question whether the chapter would applyif a State had already established such a mechanism beforechapter 154 was passed. The idea is that the present tenseof the word "establishes" might be read to rule out a Statethat already had "established" a mechanism, suggesting thatwhen $ 107(c) was added to provide that the chapter wouldapply to "cases pending" it was meant to eliminate the ambiguity by showing that all pending cases would be treatedalike.This explanation of the significance of $ 107(c) is not, however, very plausible. First, one has to strain to find the ambiguity on which the alternative explanation is supposed torest. Why would a Congress intent on expediting capitalhabeas cases have wanted to disfavor a State that alreadyhad done its part to promote sound resolution of prisoners'petitions in just the way Congress sought to encourage? Itwould make no sense to leave such States on the slowertrack, and it seems unlikely that federal courts would so haveinterpreted $ 2261(b). Second, anyone who had seen suchambiguity lurking could have dispatched it in a far simplerand straightforward fashion than enacting $ 107(c); all thedrafter would have needed to do was to insert three wordsinto $ 2261(b), to make it refer to a State that "establishes orhas established . . . a mechanism." It simply is not plausible521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN332 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courtthat anyone so sensitive as to find the unlikely ambiguitywould be so delphic as to choose $ 107(c) to fix it. Indeed,$ 107(c) would (on the ambiguity hypothesis) be at least asuncertain as the language it was supposed to clarify, since"cases pending" could be read to refer to cases pending inStates that set up their mechanisms only after the effectivedate of the Act. The hypothesis of fixing ambiguity, then,is too remote to displace the straightforward inference thatchapter 153 was not meant to apply to pending cases.Finally, we should speak to the significance of the new$ 2264(b), which Lindh cites as confirming his reading of$ 107(c) of the Act. While $ 2264(b) does not speak to thepresent issue with flawless clarity, we agree with Lindh thatit tends to confirm the interpretation of $ 107(c) that weadopt. Section 2264(b) is a part of the new chapter 154 andprovides that "[f]ollowing review subject to subsections (a),(d), and (e) of $ 2254, the court shall rule on the claims [subject to expedited consideration] before it." 110 Stat. 1223.As we have said before, $ 2254 is part of chapter 153 applyingto habeas cases generally, including cases under chapter 154.Its subsection (a) existed before the Act, simply providingfor a habeas remedy for those held in violation of federal law.Although $ 2254 previously had subsections lettered (d) and(e) (dealing with a presumption of correctness to be accordedstate-court factual findings and the production of state-courtrecords when evidentiary sufficiency is challenged, respectively) the Act eliminated the old (d) and relettered the old(e) as (f); in place of the old (d), it inserted a new (d) followedby a new (e), the two of them dealing with, among otherthings, the adequacy of state factual determinations as bearing on a right to federal relief, and the presumption of correctness to be given such state determinations. 110 Stat.1219. It is to these new provisions (d) and (e), then, that$ 2264(b) refers when it provides that chapter 154 determinations shall be made subject to them.521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN333Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)Opinion of the CourtLeaving aside the reference to $ 2254(a) for a moment,why would Congress have provided specifically in $ 2264(b)that chapter 154 determinations shall be made subject to$$ 2254(d) and (e), given the fact that the latter are part ofchapter 153 and thus independently apply to habeas gen-erally? One argument is that the answer lies in $ 2264(a),which (in expedited capital cases) specially provides an ex-haustion requirement (subject to three exceptions), restricting federal habeas claims to those "raised and decided on themerits in the State courts. . . ." 110 Stat. 1223. See 96F. 3d, at 862-863. The argument assumes (and we will as-sume for the sake of the argument) that in expedited capitalcases, this provision of $ 2264(a) supersedes the require-ments for exhaustion of state remedies imposed as a general matter by $$ 2254(b) and (c).7 The argument then goes7 There are reasons why the position that $ 2264(a) replaces rather thancomplements $$ 2254(b) and (c) is open to doubt: Lindh argues with someforce that to read $ 2264(a) as replacing the exhaustion requirement of$$ 2254(b) and (c) would mean that in important classes of cases (those inthe categories of three $ 2264(a) exceptions), the State would not be ableto insist on exhaustion in the state courts. In cases raising claims ofnewly discovered evidence, for example, the consequence could be that theState could not prevent the prisoner from going directly to federal courtand evading $ 2254(e)'s presumption of correctness of state-court factualfindings as well as $ 2254(d)'s new, highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings. It is true that a State might be perfectly contentwith the prisoner's choice to go straight to federal court in some cases,but the State has been free to waive exhaustion to get that result. TheState has not explained why Congress would have wanted to deprive theStates of the $ 2254 exhaustion tools in chapter 154 cases, and we are hardpressed to come up with a reason, especially considering the Act's apparent general purpose to enhance the States' capacities to control theirown adjudications. It would appear that the State's reading of $ 2264(a)would also eliminate from chapter 154 cases the provisions of $ 2254 thatdefine the exhaustion requirement explicitly as requiring a claim to beraised by any and every available procedure in the State, 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(c), that newly authorize federal courts to deny unexhausted claimson the merits, $ 2254(b)(2), and that newly require a State's waiver of521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN334 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courton, that $ 2264(b) is explicit in applying $$ 2254(d) and (e) tosuch capital cases in order to avoid any suggestion that whenCongress enacted $ 2264(a) to supersede $$ 2254(b) and (c) onexhaustion, Congress also meant to displace the neighboring provisions of $$ 2254(d) and (e) dealing with such thingsas the status of state factual determinations. But we findthis unlikely. First, we find it hard to imagine why anyonewould read a superseding exhaustion rule to address the applicability not just of the other exhaustion requirement butof provisions on the effect of state factual determinations.Anyone who did read the special provision for exhaustionin capital cases to supersede not only the general exhaustionprovisions but evidentiary status and presumption provi-sions as well would have had to assume that Congress couldreasonably have meant to leave the law on expedited capi-tal cases (which is more favorable to the States that fulfillits conditions) without any presumption of the correctnessof relevant state factual determinations. This would not,we think, be a reasonable reading and thus not a readingthat Congress would have feared and addressed through$ 2264(b). We therefore have to find a different function forthe express requirement of $ 2264(b) that chapter 154 determinations be made in accordance with $$ 2254(d) and (e).Continuing on the State's assumption that $ 2264(a) replaces rather than complements $ 2254's exhaustion pro-visions, we can see that the function of providing that$$ 2254(d) and (e) be applicable in chapter 154 cases is, in fact,exhaustion to be shown to be express, $ 2254(b)(3). No explanation forwhy Congress would have wanted to deny the States these advantages isapparent or offered by the parties, which suggests that no such effectswere intended at all but that $ 2264(a) was meant as a supplement torather than a replacement for $$ 2254(b) and (c).Nevertheless, as stated in the text, we assume for the sake of argumentthat the State's understanding of $ 2264(a) as replacing rather than complementing the chapter 153 exhaustion requirements for chapter 154 is thecorrect one. Forceful arguments can be made on each side, and we do notneed to resolve the conflict here.521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 521 U.

If the special provision for applying$$ 2254(d) and (e) in cases under chapter 154 has any utility,then, it must be because subsections (d) and (e) might notapply to all chapter 154 cases; since chapter 154 and the newsections of chapter 153 unquestionably apply alike to casesfiled after the Act took effect, the cases to which subsections(d) and (e) from chapter 153 would not apply without expressprovision must be those cases already pending when the Acttook effect. The utility of $ 2264(b), therefore, is in providing that when a pending case is also an expedited capitalcase subject to chapter 154, the new provisions of $$ 2254(d)and (e) will apply to that case. The provision thus confirmsthat Congress assumed that in the absence of such a provision, $$ 2254(d) and (e) (as new parts of chapter 153) wouldnot apply to pending federal habeas cases.This analysis is itself consistent, in turn, with Congress'sfailure in $ 2264(b) to make any express provision for applying $$ 2254(f ), (g), (h), or (i). Subsections (f) and (g) dealwith producing state-court evidentiary records and theiradmissibility as evidence. Congress would obviously havewanted these provisions to apply in chapter 154 pendingcases, but because they were old provisions, which had already attached to "pending" capital habeas cases (only theirletter designations had been amended), Congress had noneed to make any special provision for their application topending capital habeas cases that might immediately or laterturn out to be covered by chapter 154. Subsections (h) and(i), however, are new; if Congress wanted them to apply tochapter 154 cases from the start it would on our hypotheseshave had to make the same special provision that $ 2264(b)521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN336 LINDH v. MURPHYOpinion of the Courtmade for subsections (d) and (e). But there are reasons whyCongress need not have made any special provisions for subsections (h) and (i) to apply to the "pending" chapter 154cases. Subsections (h) and (i) deal, respectively, with theappointment of counsel for the indigent in the federal proceeding, and the irrelevance to habeas relief of the adequacyof counsel's performance in previous postconviction proceedings. See 110 Stat. 1219-1220. There was no need to makesubsection (h) immediately available to pending cases, capitalor not, because 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) already authorizedappointment of counsel in such cases. And there was noreason to make subsection (i) immediately available for aState's benefit in expedited capital cases, for chapter 154 already dealt with the matter in $ 2261(e), see 110 Stat. 1222.There is, therefore, a good fit of the $ 2264(b) references withthe inference that amendments to chapter 153 were meantto apply only to subsequently filed cases; where there wasa good reason to apply a new chapter 153 provision in thelitigation of a chapter 154 case pending when the Act tookeffect, $ 2264(b) made it applicable, and when there was nosuch reason it did no such thing.There is only one loose end. Section 2254(a) was an oldprovision, without peculiar relevance to chapter 154 cases,but applicable to them without any need for a special provision; as an old provision it was just like the lettered subsections (f) and (g). Why did $ 2264(b) make an express provision for applying it to chapter 154 cases? No answer leapsout at us. All we can say is that in a world of silk pursesand pigs' ears, the Act is not a silk purse of the art of statutory drafting.The upshot is that our analysis accords more coherenceto $$ 107(c) and 2264(b) than any rival we have examined.That is enough. We hold that the negative implication of$ 107(c) is that the new provisions of chapter 153 generally apply only to cases filed after the Act became effective.Because Lindh's case is not one of these, we reverse the521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 521 U.
