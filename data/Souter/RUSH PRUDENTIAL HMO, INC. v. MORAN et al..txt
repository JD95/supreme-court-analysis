Section 4-10 of Illinois's Health Maintenance OrganizationAct, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 (2000), provides recipients of health coverage by such organizations with a rightto independent medical review of certain denials of benefits.The issue in this case is whether the statute, as applied tohealth benefits provided by a health maintenance organization under contract with an employee welfare benefit plan, ispreempted by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29 U. S. C.$ 1001et seq.

Respondent Debra Moran is a beneficiary underone such plan, sponsored by her husband's employer. Rush's"Certificate of Group Coverage," issued to employees whoparticipate in employer-sponsored plans, promises that Rushwill provide them with "medically necessary" services.

Record, Pl. Exh. A, p. 21.As the certificate explains, Rush contracts with physicians"to arrange for or provide services and supplies for medicalcare and treatment" of covered persons. Each covered person selects a primary care physician from those under contract to Rush, while Rush will pay for medical services byan unaffiliated physician only if the services have been "authorized" both by the primary care physician and Rush'smedical director. See id., at 11, 16.In 1996, when Moran began to have pain and numbness inher right shoulder, Dr. Arthur LaMarre, her primary carephysician, unsuccessfully administered "conservative" treatments such as physiotherapy. In October 1997, Dr. LaMarrerecommended that Rush approve surgery by an unaffiliatedspecialist, Dr. Julia Terzis, who had developed an unconventional treatment for Moran's condition. Although Dr. LaMarre said that Moran would be "best served" by that procedure, Rush denied the request and, after Moran's internalappeals, affirmed the denial on the ground that the procedurewas not "medically necessary." 230 F. 3d 959, 963 (CA7536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN361Cite as: 536 U.

Rush instead proposed that Moran undergo standardsurgery, performed by a physician affiliated with Rush.In January 1998, Moran made a written demand for anindependent medical review of her claim, as guaranteed by$ 4-10 of Illinois's HMO Act, 215 Ill.

In the event that the reviewing physician determines the covered service to be medi-cally necessary, the Health Maintenance Organizationshall provide the covered service."The Act defines a "Health Maintenance Organization" as"any organization formed under the laws of this or an-other state to provide or arrange for one or more healthcare plans under a system which causes any part of therisk of health care delivery to be borne by the organization or its providers." Ch. 125, $ 1-2.11 In the health care industry, the term "Health Maintenance Organization" has been defined as "[a] prepaid organized delivery system wherethe organization and the primary care physicians assume some financialrisk for the care provided to its enrolled members. . . .

MORANOpinion of the CourtWhen Rush failed to provide the independent review, Moransued in an Illinois state court to compel compliance with thestate Act. Rush removed the suit to Federal District Court,arguing that the cause of action was "completely preempted"under ERISA. 230 F. 3d, at 964.While the suit was pending, Moran had surgery byDr. Terzis at her own expense and submitted a $94,841.27reimbursement claim to Rush. Rush treated the claim asa renewed request for benefits and began a new inquiry todetermine coverage. The three doctors consulted by Rushsaid the surgery had been medically unnecessary.Meanwhile, the federal court remanded the case back tostate court on Moran's motion, concluding that because Mor-an's request for independent review under $ 4-10 would notrequire interpretation of the terms of an ERISA plan, theclaim was not "completely preempted" so as to permit removal under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441.2 230 F. 3d, at 964. Thestate court enforced the state statute and ordered Rush tosubmit to review by an independent physician. The doctorselected was a reconstructive surgeon at Johns HopkinsMedical Center, Dr. A. Lee Dellon. Dr. Dellon decided thatDr. Terzis's treatment had been medically necessary, basedon the definition of medical necessity in Rush's Certificate oftional usage of that term, but instead is likely to encompass a variety ofdifferent structures (although Illinois does distinguish HMOs from pureinsurers by regulating "traditional" health insurance in a different portionof its insurance laws, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5 (2000)). Except whereotherwise indicated, we use the term "HMO" because that is the termused by the State and the parties; what we intend is simply to describethe structures covered by the Illinois Act.2 In light of our holding today that $ 4-10 is not preempted by ERISA,the propriety of this ruling is questionable; a suit to compel compliancewith $ 4-10 in the context of an ERISA plan would seem to be akin to asuit to compel compliance with the terms of a plan under 29 U. S. C.$ 1132(a)(3). Alternatively, the proper course may have been to bring asuit to recover benefits due, alleging that the denial was improper in theabsence of compliance with $ 4-10. We need not resolve today which ofthese options is more consonant with ERISA.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN363Cite as: 536 U.

S. C. $ 1132(a),as construed by this Court in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.Taylor, 481 U. S. 58 (1987). The District Court treated Mor-an's claim as a suit under ERISA, and denied the claim onthe ground that ERISA preempted Illinois's independent re-view statute.3The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.230 F. 3d 959 (2000). Although it found Moran's state-lawreimbursement claim completely preempted by ERISA so asto place the case in federal court, the Seventh Circuit did notagree that the substantive provisions of Illinois's HMO Actwere so preempted. The court noted that although ERISAbroadly preempts any state laws that "relate to" employeebenefit plans, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), state laws that "regulat[e]3 No party has challenged Rush's status as defendant in this case, despitethe fact that many lower courts have interpreted ERISA to permit suitsunder $ 1132(a) only against ERISA plans, administrators, or fiduciaries.See, e. g., Everhart v. Allmerica Financial Life Ins. Co., 275 F. 3d 751,754-756 (CA9 2001); Garren v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 114 F. 3d186, 187 (CA11 1997); Jass v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 88 F. 3d1482, 1490 (CA7 1996). Without commenting on the correctness of suchholdings, we assume (although the information does not appear in the record) that Rush has failed to challenge its status as defendant because itis, in fact, the plan administrator. This conclusion is buttressed by thefact that the plan's sponsor has granted Rush discretion to interpret theterms of its coverage, and by the fact that one of Rush's challenges to theIllinois statute is based on what Rush perceives as the limits that statuteplaces on fiduciary discretion. Whatever Rush's true status may be, however, it is immaterial to our holding.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtinsurance" are saved from preemption, $ 1144(b)(2)(A). Thecourt held that the Illinois HMO Act was such a law, theindependent review requirement being little different froma state-mandated contractual term of the sort this Court hadheld to survive ERISA preemption. See 230 F. 3d, at 972(citing UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S.358, 375-376 (1999)). The Seventh Circuit rejected the con-tention that Illinois's independent review requirement constituted a forbidden "alternative remedy" under this Court'sholding inPilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41 (1987),and emphasized that $ 4-10 does not authorize any particularform of relief in state courts; rather, with respect to anyERISA health plan, the judgment of the independent reviewer is only enforceable in an action brought underERISA's civil enforcement scheme, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a). 230F. 3d, at 971.Because the decision of the Court of Appeals conflictedwith the Fifth Circuit's treatment of a similar provision ofTexas law inCorporate Health Ins., Inc. v.

Egelhoff, 532 U. S.141 (2001); UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, supra;California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dilling-ham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316 (1997); MetropolitanLife Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985). In try-ing to extrapolate congressional intent in a case like this,when congressional language seems simultaneously to pre-empt everything and hardly anything, we "have no choice"but to temper the assumption that " `the ordinary mean-ing . . . accurately expresses the legislative purpose,' "id.,at 740 (quoting Park 'N Fly v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985)), with the qualification " `that thehistoric police powers of the States were not [meant] to besuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear andmanifest purpose of Congress.' " Travelers, supra, at 655(quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230(1947)).It is beyond serious dispute that under existing precedent$ 4-10 of the Illinois HMO Act "relates to" employee benefitplans within the meaning of $ 1144(a). The state law bears"indirectly but substantially on all insured benefit plans,"Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 739, by requiring them tosubmit to an extra layer of review for certain benefit denialsif they purchase medical coverage from any of the commontypes of health care organizations covered by the state law'sdefinition of HMO. As a law that "relates to" ERISA plansunder $ 1144(a), $ 4-10 is saved from preemption only if italso "regulates insurance" under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). Rush in-sists that the Act is not such a law.AIn Metropolitan Life, we said that in deciding whether alaw "regulates insurance" under ERISA's saving clause, westart with a "common-sense view of the matter," 471 U. S.,536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtat 740, under which "a law must not just have an impacton the insurance industry, but must be specifically directedtoward that industry." Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,supra, at 50. We then test the results of the commonsenseenquiry by employing the three factors used to point to in-surance laws spared from federal preemption under theMcCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 et seq.4 Althoughthis is not the place to plot the exact perimeter of the savingclause, it is generally fair to think of the combined "common-sense" and McCarran-Ferguson factors as parsing the "who"and the "what": when insurers are regulated with respect totheir insurance practices, the state law survives ERISA.Cf. Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S.205, 211 (1979) (explaining that the "business of insurance"is not coextensive with the "business of insurers").1The commonsense enquiry focuses on "primary elementsof an insurance contract[, which] are the spreading and underwriting of a policyholder's risk." Ibid. The Illinoisstatute addresses these elements by defining "health maintenance organization" by reference to the risk that it bears.See 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000) (an HMO"provide[s] or arrange[s] for . . . health care plans under asystem which causes any part of the risk of health care delivery to be borne by the organization or its providers").Rush contends that seeing an HMO as an insurer distortsthe nature of an HMO, which is, after all, a health care pro-vider, too. This, Rush argues, should determine its characterization, with the consequence that regulation of an HMOis not insurance regulation within the meaning of ERISA.4 The McCarran-Ferguson Act requires that the business of insurancebe subject to state regulation, and, subject to certain exceptions, mandatesthat "[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate . . . any lawenacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business ofinsurance . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b).536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN367Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThe answer to Rush is, of course, that an HMO is both: itprovides health care, and it does so as an insurer. Nothingin the saving clause requires an either-or choice betweenhealth care and insurance in deciding a preemption question,and as long as providing insurance fairly accounts for theapplication of state law, the saving clause may apply. Thereis no serious question about that here, for it would ignorethe whole purpose of the HMO-style of organization to con-ceive of HMOs (even in the traditional sense, see n. 1,supra)without their insurance element."The defining feature of an HMO is receipt of a fixed feefor each patient enrolled under the terms of a contract toprovide specified health care if needed." Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211, 218 (2000). "The HMO thus assumesthe financial risk of providing the benefits promised: if a participant never gets sick, the HMO keeps the money regardless, and if a participant becomes expensively ill, the HMOis responsible for the treatment . . . ." Id., at 218-219. TheHMO design goes beyond the simple truism that all contractsare, in some sense, insurance against future fluctuations inprice, R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 104 (4th ed.1992), because HMOs actually underwrite and spread riskamong their participants, see, e. g., R. Shouldice, Introduction to Managed Care 450-462 (1991), a feature distinctive to insurance, see, e. g., SEC v. Variable Annuity LifeIns. Co. of America, 359 U. S. 65, 73 (1959) (underwriting ofrisk is an "earmark of insurance as it has commonly beenconceived of in popular understanding and usage"); RoyalDrug, supra, at 214-215, n. 12 ("[U]nless there is some element of spreading risk more widely, there is no underwritingof risk").So Congress has understood from the start, when thephrase "Health Maintenance Organization" was establishedand defined in the HMO Act of 1973. The Act was intendedto encourage the development of HMOs as a new form ofhealth care delivery system, see S. Rep. No. 93-129, pp. 7-9536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Court(1973), and when Congress set the standards that the newhealth delivery organizations would have to meet to get certain federal benefits, the terms included requirements thatthe organizations bear and manage risk. See, e. g., HealthMaintenance Organization Act of 1973, $ 1301(c), 87 Stat. 916,as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 300e(c); S. Rep. No. 93-129, at 14(explaining that HMOs necessarily bear some of the risk ofproviding service, and requiring that a qualifying HMO "as-sum[e] direct financial responsibility, without benefit of reinsurance, for care . . . in excess of the first five thousand dol-lars per enrollee per year"). The Senate Committee Reportexplained that federally qualified HMOs would be requiredto provide "a basic package of benefits, consistent with existing health insurance patterns," id., at 10, and the very textof the Act assumed that state insurance laws would apply toHMOs; it provided that to the extent state insurance capitalization and reserve requirements were too stringent to permit the formation of HMOs, "qualified" HMOs would be exempt from such limiting regulation. See $ 1311, 42 U. S. C.$ 300e-10. This congressional understanding that it waspromoting a novel form of insurance was made explicit in theSenate Report's reference to the practices of "health insurers to charge premium rates based upon the actual claimsexperience of a particular group of subscribers," thus "raising costs and diminishing the availability of health insurancefor those suffering from costly illnesses," S. Rep. No. 93-129,at 29-30. The federal Act responded to this insurance practice by requiring qualifying HMOs to adopt uniform capitation rates, see $ 1301(b), 42 U. S. C. $ 300e(b), and it wasbecause of that mandate "pos[ing] substantial competitiveproblems to newly emerging HMOs," S. Rep. No. 93-129, at30, that Congress authorized funding subsidies, see $ 1304,42 U. S. C. $ 300e-4. The Senate explanation left no doubtthat it viewed an HMO as an insurer; the subsidy was justified because "the same stringent requirements do not applyto other indemnity or service benefits insurance plans."536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the CourtS. Rep. No. 93-129, at 30. In other words, one year beforeit passed ERISA, Congress itself defined HMOs in part byreference to risk, set minimum standards for managing therisk, showed awareness that States regulated HMOs as insurers, and compared HMOs to "indemnity or service bene-fits insurance plans."This conception has not changed in the intervening years.Since passage of the federal Act, States have been adoptingtheir own HMO enabling Acts, and today, at least 40 of them,including Illinois, regulate HMOs primarily through theStates' insurance departments, see Aspen Health Law andCompliance Center, Managed Care Law Manual 31-32 (Supp.6, Nov. 1997), although they may be treated differently fromtraditional insurers, owing to their additional role as healthcare providers,5 see, e. g., Alaska Ins. Code $ 21.86.010 (2000)(health department reviews HMO before insurance commissioner grants a certificate of authority); Ohio Rev. Code Ann.$ 1742.21 (West 1994) (health department may inspect HMO).Finally, this view shared by Congress and the States haspassed into common understanding. HMOs (broadly defined) have "grown explosively in the past decade and [are]now the dominant form of health plan coverage for privatelyinsured individuals." Gold & Hurley, The Role of ManagedCare "Products" in Managed Care "Plans," in ContemporaryManaged Care 47 (M. Gold ed. 1998). While the originalform of the HMO was a single corporation employing its ownphysicians, the 1980's saw a variety of other types of struc-tures develop even as traditional insurers altered their own5 We have, in a limited number of cases, found certain contracts not tobe part of the "business of insurance" under McCarran-Ferguson, notwithstanding their classification as such for the purpose of state regulation.See, e. g., SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of America, 359 U. S. 65(1959). Even then, however, we recognized that such classifications arerelevant to the enquiry, because Congress, in leaving the "business of insurance" to the States, "was legislating concerning a concept which hadtaken on its coloration and meaning largely from state law, from statepractice, from state usage." Id., at 69.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtplans by adopting HMO-like cost-control measures. SeeWeiner & de Lissovoy, Razing a Tower of Babel: A Taxonomy for Managed Care and Health Insurance Plans, 18 J. ofHealth Politics, Policy and Law 75, 83 (Spring 1993). Thedominant feature is the combination of insurer and provider,see Gold & Hurley, supra, at 47, and "an observer may behard pressed to uncover the differences among products thatbill themselves as HMOs, [preferred provider organizations],or managed care overlays to health insurance," ManagedCare Law Manual,supra, at 1. Thus, virtually all commen-tators on the American health care system describe HMOsas a combination of insurer and provider, and observe thatin recent years, traditional "indemnity" insurance has fallenout of favor. See, e. g., Weiner & de Lissovoy, supra, at 77("A common characteristic of the new managed care planswas the degree to which the roles of insurer and providerbecame integrated"); Gold, Understanding the Roots: HealthMaintenance Organizations in Historical Context, in Contem-porary Managed Care,supra, at 7, 8, 13; Managed Care LawManual, supra, at 1; R. Rosenblatt, S. Law, & S. Rosenbaum,Law and the American Health Care System 552 (1997);Shouldice, Introduction to Managed Care, at 13, 20. Rushcannot checkmate common sense by trying to submergeHMOs' insurance features beneath an exclusive characterization of HMOs as providers of health care.2On a second tack, Rush and its amici dispute that $ 4-10is aimed specifically at the insurance industry. They say thelaw sweeps too broadly with definitions capturing organiza-tions that provide no insurance, and by regulating noninsurance activities of HMOs that do. Rush points out that Illi-nois law defines HMOs to include organizations that causethe risk of health care delivery to be borne by the organi-zation itself, or by "its providers." 215 Ill. Comp. Stat.,ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000). In Rush's view, the reference to "its536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the Courtproviders" suggests that an organization may be an HMOunder state law (and subject to $ 4-10) even if it does notbear risk itself, either because it has "devolve[d]" the risk ofhealth care delivery onto others, or because it has contractedonly to provide "administrative" or other services for self-funded plans. Brief for Petitioner 38.These arguments, however, are built on unsound assump-tions. Rush's first contention assumes that an HMO is nolonger an insurer when it arranges to limit its exposure, aswhen an HMO arranges for capitated contracts to compensate its affiliated physicians with a set fee for each HMOpatient regardless of the treatment provided. Under suchan arrangement, Rush claims, the risk is not borne by theHMO at all. In a similar vein, Rush points out that HMOsmay contract with third-party insurers to protect themselvesagainst large claims.The problem with Rush's argument is simply that a rein-surance contract does not take the primary insurer out ofthe insurance business, cf. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Califor-nia, 509 U. S. 764 (1993) (applying McCarran-Ferguson to adispute involving primary insurers and reinsurers); id., at772-773 ("[P]rimary insurers . . . usually purchase insuranceto cover a portion of the risk they assume from the con-sumer"), and capitation contracts do not relieve the HMO ofits obligations to the beneficiary. The HMO is still bound toprovide medical care to its members, and this is so regardlessof the ability of physicians or third-party insurers to honortheir contracts with the HMO.Nor do we see anything standing in the way of applyingthe saving clause if we assume that the general state definition of HMO would include a contractor that provides onlyadministrative services for a self-funded plan.6 Rush points6 ERISA's "deemer" clause provides an exception to its saving clausethat prohibits States from regulating self-funded plans as insurers. See29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(B); FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61 (1990).Therefore, Illinois's Act would not be "saved" as an insurance law to the536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN372 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v.

Comp.Stat., ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000). See Brief for Petitioner 38.Rush hypothesizes a sort of medical matchmaker, bring-ing together ERISA plans and medical care providers;even if the latter bear all the risks, the matchmaker wouldbe an HMO under the Illinois definition. Rush wouldconclude from this that $ 4-10 covers noninsurers, and so isnot directed specifically to the insurance industry. Ergo,ERISA's saving clause would not apply.It is far from clear, though, that the terms of $ 4-10 wouldeven theoretically apply to the matchmaker, for the require-ment that the HMO "provide" the covered service if the independent reviewer finds it medically necessary seems to as-sume that the HMO in question is a provider, not the merearranger mentioned in the general definition of an HMO.Even on the most generous reading of Rush's argument,however, it boils down to the bare possibility (not the likeli-hood) of some overbreadth in the application of $ 4-10 beyondorthodox HMOs, and there is no reason to think Congresswould have meant such minimal application to noninsurersto remove a state law entirely from the category of insuranceregulation saved from preemption.In sum, prior to ERISA's passage, Congress demonstratedan awareness of HMOs as risk-bearing organizations subjectto state insurance regulation, the state Act defines HMOsby reference to risk bearing, HMOs have taken over muchbusiness formerly performed by traditional indemnity insur-ers, and they are almost universally regulated as insurersunder state law. That HMOs are not traditional "indemextent it applied to self-funded plans. This fact, however, does not bearon Rush's challenge to the law as one that is targeted toward non-riskbearing organizations.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN373Cite as: 536 U.

VariableAnnuity Life Ins. Co. of America, 359 U. S., at 71. Thus,the Illinois HMO Act is a law "directed toward" the insur-ance industry, and an "insurance regulation" under a "commonsense" view. BThe McCarran-Ferguson factors confirm our conclusion.A law regulating insurance for McCarran-Ferguson purposestargets practices or provisions that "ha[ve] the effect oftransferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; . . . [that are]an integral part of the policy relationship between the in-surer and the insured; and [are] limited to entities within theinsurance industry." Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno,458 U. S. 119, 129 (1982). Because the factors are guideposts, a state law is not required to satisfy all threeMcCarran-Ferguson criteria to survive preemption, seeUNUM Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 526 U. S., at 373, and so wefollow our precedent and leave open whether the reviewmandated here may be described as going to a practice that"spread[s] a policyholder's risk." For in any event, the second and third factors are clearly satisfied by $ 4-10.It is obvious enough that the independent review requirement regulates "an integral part of the policy relationshipbetween the insurer and the insured." Illinois adds anextra layer of review when there is internal disagreementabout an HMO's denial of coverage. The reviewer appliesboth a standard of medical care (medical necessity) and char-acteristically, as in this case, construes policy terms. Cf. Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S., at 228-229. The review affectsthe "policy relationship" between HMO and covered personsby translating the relationship under the HMO agreementinto concrete terms of specific obligation or freedom fromduty. Hence our repeated statements that the interpreta-tion of insurance contracts is at the "core" of the business of536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtinsurance. E. g., SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U. S.453, 460 (1969).Rush says otherwise, citing Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v.Pireno, supra, and insisting that that case holds externalreview of coverage decisions to be outside the "policy relationship." But Rush misreads Pireno. We held there thatan insurer's use of a "peer review" committee to gauge thenecessity of particular treatments was not a practice integralto the policy relationship for the purposes of McCarranFerguson. 458 U. S., at 131-132. We emphasized, however,that the insurer's resort to peer review was simply the insurer's unilateral choice to seek advice if and when it cared todo so. The policy said nothing on the matter. The insurer'scontract for advice from a third party was no concern of theinsured, who was not bound by the peer review committee'srecommendation any more, for that matter, than the insurerwas. Thus it was not too much of an exaggeration to conclude that the practice was "a matter of indifference to thepolicyholder," id., at 132. Section 4-10, by contrast, is different on all counts, providing as it does a legal right to theinsured, enforceable against the HMO, to obtain an authoritative determination of the HMO's medical obligations.The final factor, that the law be aimed at a "practice . . .limited to entities within the insurance industry," id., at 129,is satisfied for many of the same reasons that the law passesthe commonsense test. The law regulates application ofHMO contracts and provides for review of claim denials; onceit is established that HMO contracts are, in fact, contractsfor insurance (and not merely contracts for medical care), itis clear that $ 4-10 does not apply to entities outside the insurance industry (although it does not, of course, apply to allentities within it).Even if we accepted Rush's contention, rejected already,that the law regulates HMOs even when they act as pureadministrators, we would still find the third factor satisfied.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThat factor requires the targets of the law to be limited toentities within the insurance industry, and even a matchmaking HMO would fall within the insurance industry. But theimplausibility of Rush's hypothesis that the pure administrator would be bound by $ 4-10 obviates any need to say moreunder this third factor. Cf. Barnett Bank of Marion Cty.,N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 39 (1996) (holding that a federalstatute permitting banks to act as agents of insurance companies, although not insurers themselves, was a statute regu-lating the "business of insurance" for McCarran-Fergusonpurposes). IIIGiven that $ 4-10 regulates insurance, ERISA's mandatethat "nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State whichregulates insurance," 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), ostensiblyforecloses preemption. See Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at746 ("If a state law `regulates insurance,' . . . it is not preempted"). Rush, however, does not give up. It argues forpreemption anyway, emphasizing that the question is ultimately one of congressional intent, which sometimes is soclear that it overrides a statutory provision designed to savestate law from being preempted. See American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524U. S. 214, 227 (1998)(AT&T) (clause in Communications Actof 1934 purporting to save "the remedies now existing atcommon law or by statute," 47 U. S. C. $ 414 (1994 ed.), de-feated by overriding policy of the filed-rate doctrine);AdamsExpress Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491, 507 (1913) (savingclause will not sanction state laws that would nullify policyexpressed in federal statute; "the act cannot be said to de-stroy itself " (internal quotation marks omitted)).In ERISA law, we have recognized one example of thissort of overpowering federal policy in the civil enforcementprovisions, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), authorizing civil actions for536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN376 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtsix specific types of relief.7 In Massachusetts Mut. LifeIns. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134 (1985), we said those provisions amounted to an "interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme," id., at 146, which Pilot Lifedescribed as "represent[ing] a careful balancing of the needfor prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against thepublic interest in encouraging the formation of employeebenefit plans," 481 U. S., at 54. So, we have held, the civilenforcement provisions are of such extraordinarily preemptive power that they override even the "well-pleaded complaint" rule for establishing the conditions under which acause of action may be removed to a federal forum. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S., at 63-64.7 Title 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a) provides in relevant part:"A civil action may be brought--"(1) by a participant or beneficiary--"(A) for the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section [concerning requests to the administrator for information], or"(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights tofuture benefits under the terms of the plan;"(2) by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary forappropriate relief under section 1109 of this title [breach of fiduciary duty];"(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act orpractice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms ofthe plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redresssuch violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or theterms of the plan;"(4) by the Secretary, or by a participant, or beneficiary for appropriaterelief in the case of a violation of 1025(c) of this title [information to befurnished to participants];"(5) except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, bythe Secretary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief(i) to redress such violation or (ii) to enforce any provision of thissubchapter;"(6) by the Secretary to collect any civil penalty under paragraph (2),(4), (5), or (6) of subsection (c) of this section or under subsection (i) or (l )of this section."536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAAlthough we have yet to encounter a forced choice be-tween the congressional policies of exclusively federal remedies and the "reservation of the business of insurance to theStates,"Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 744, n. 21, we haveanticipated such a conflict, with the state insurance regulation losing out if it allows plan participants "to obtainremedies . . . that Congress rejected in ERISA," Pilot Life,supra, at 54.In Pilot Life, an ERISA plan participant who had beendenied benefits sued in a state court on state tort and con-tract claims. He sought not merely damages for breach ofcontract, but also damages for emotional distress and puni-tive damages, both of which we had held unavailable underrelevant ERISA provisions. Russell, supra, at 148. Wenot only rejected the notion that these common law contractclaims "regulat[ed] insurance," Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 50-51,but went on to say that, regardless, Congress intended a"federal common law of rights and obligations" to developunder ERISA,id., at 56, without embellishment by inde-pendent state remedies. As in AT&T, we said the savingclause had to stop short of subverting congressional intent,clearly expressed "through the structure and legislative history[,] that the federal remedy . . . displace state causes ofaction." 481 U. S., at 57.8Rush says that the day has come to turn dictum into hold-ing by declaring that the state insurance regulation, $ 4-10,is preempted for creating just the kind of "alternative rem-edy" we disparaged inPilot Life. As Rush sees it, the inde8 Rush and its amici interpret Pilot Life to have gone a step further tohold that any law that presents such a conflict with federal goals is simplynot a law that "regulates insurance," however else the "insurance" testcomes out. We believe the point is largely academic. As will be discussed further, even under Rush's approach, a court must still determinewhether the state law at issue does, in fact, create such a conflict. Thus,we believe that it is more logical to proceed as we have done here.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtpendent review procedure is a form of binding arbitrationthat allows an ERISA beneficiary to submit claims to a newdecisionmaker to examine Rush's determination de novo,supplanting judicial review under the "arbitrary and capricious" standard ordinarily applied when discretionary planinterpretations are challenged.Firestone Tire & RubberCo. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 110-112 (1989). Rush says thatthe beneficiary's option falls within Pilot Life's notion of aremedy that "supplement[s] or supplant[s]" the remediesavailable under ERISA. 481 U. S., at 56.We think, however, that Rush overstates the rule expressed in Pilot Life. The enquiry into state processes alleged to "supplemen[t] or supplan[t]" the federal scheme byallowing beneficiaries "to obtain remedies under state lawthat Congress rejected in ERISA," id., at 54, has, up to now,been far more straightforward than it is here. The first casetouching on the point did not involve preemption at all; itarose from an ERISA beneficiary's reliance on ERISA's ownenforcement scheme to claim a private right of action fortypes of damages beyond those expressly provided. Russell, 473 U. S., at 145. We concluded that Congress had notintended causes of action under ERISA itself beyond thosespecified in $ 1132(a). Id., at 148. Two years later we determined in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, supra, thatCongress had so completely preempted the field of benefitslaw that an ostensibly state cause of action for benefits wasnecessarily a "creature of federal law" removable to federalcourt. Id., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Russell and Taylor naturally led to the holding in Pilot Lifethat ERISA would not tolerate a diversity action seekingmonetary damages for breach generally and for consequential emotional distress, neither of which Congress had authorized in $ 1132(a). These monetary awards were claimedas remedies to be provided at the ultimate step of plan enforcement, and even if they could have been characterized asproducts of "insurance regulation," they would have signifi536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the Courtcantly expanded the potential scope of ultimate liability im-posed upon employers by the ERISA scheme.Since Pilot Life, we have found only one other state law to"conflict" with $ 1132(a) in providing a prohibited alternativeremedy. In Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133(1990), we had no trouble finding that Texas's tort of wrongful discharge, turning on an employer's motivation to avoidpaying pension benefits, conflicted with ERISA enforcement;while state law duplicated the elements of a claim availableunder ERISA, it converted the remedy from an equitableone under $ 1132(a)(3) (available exclusively in federal district courts) into a legal one for money damages (available ina state tribunal). Thus, Ingersoll-Rand fit within the category of state laws Pilot Life had held to be incompatiblewith ERISA's enforcement scheme; the law provided a formof ultimate relief in a judicial forum that added to the judicialremedies provided by ERISA. Any such provision patentlyviolates ERISA's policy of inducing employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities, under uniformstandards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and awards when a violation has occurred. See Pilot Life, supra, at 56 (" `The uniformity ofdecision . . . will help administrators . . . predict the legalityof proposed actions without the necessity of reference tovarying state laws' " (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 93-533, p. 12(1973))); 481 U. S., at 56 ("The expectations that a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISAregulated plans would develop . . . would make little sense ifthe remedies available to ERISA participants and beneficiaries under [$ 1132(a)] could be supplemented or supplantedby varying state laws").But this case addresses a state regulatory scheme thatprovides no new cause of action under state law and authorizes no new form of ultimate relief. While independent review under $ 4-10 may well settle the fate of a benefit claimunder a particular contract, the state statute does not en536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtlarge the claim beyond the benefits available in any actionbrought under $ 1132(a). And although the reviewer's determination would presumably replace that of the HMO asto what is "medically necessary" under this contract,9 therelief ultimately available would still be what ERISA authorizes in a suit for benefits under $ 1132(a).10 This casetherefore does not involve the sort of additional claim orremedy exemplified in Pilot Life, Russell, and IngersollRand, but instead bears a resemblance to the claimsprocedure rule that we sustained in UNUM Life Ins. Co. ofAmerica v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358 (1999), holding that a statelaw barring enforcement of a policy's time limitation on submitting claims did not conflict with $ 1132(a), even though thestate "rule of decision," id., at 377, could mean the differencebetween success and failure for a beneficiary. The procedure provided by $ 4-10 does not fall within Pilot Life's categorical preemption.9 The parties do not dispute that $ 4-10, as a matter of state law, purports to make the independent reviewer's judgment dispositive as to whatis "medically necessary." We accept this interpretation of the meaning ofthe statute for the purposes of our opinion.10 This is not to say that the court would have no role beyond orderingcompliance with the reviewer's determination. The court would have theresponsibility, for example, to fashion appropriate relief, or to determinewhether other aspects of the plan (beyond the "medical necessity" of aparticular treatment) affect the relative rights of the parties. Rush, forexample, has chosen to guarantee medically necessary services to planparticipants. For that reason, to the extent $ 4-10 may render the independent reviewer the final word on what is necessary, see n. 9, supra,Rush is obligated to provide the service. But insurance contracts do nothave to contain such guarantees, and not all do. Some, for instance, guarantee medically necessary care, but then modify that obligation by excluding experimental procedures from coverage. See, e. g., Tillery v. Hoffman Enclosures, Inc., 280 F. 3d 1192 (CA8 2002). Obviously, $ 4-10 doesnot have anything to say about whether a proposed procedure is experimental. There is also the possibility, though we do not decide the issuetoday, that a reviewer's judgment could be challenged as inaccurate orbiased, just as the decision of a plan fiduciary might be so challenged.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the CourtBRush still argues for going beyond Pilot Life, making thepreemption issue here one of degree, whether the state procedural imposition interferes unreasonably with Congress'sintention to provide a uniform federal regime of "rights andobligations" under ERISA. However, "[s]uch disuniformi-ties . . . are the inevitable result of the congressional decisionto `save' local insurance regulation." Metropolitan Life, 471U. S., at 747.11 Although we have recognized a limited exception from the saving clause for alternative causes of ac-tion and alternative remedies in the sense described above,we have never indicated that there might be additional jus-tifications for qualifying the clause's application. Rush'sarguments today convince us that further limits on insuranceregulation preserved by ERISA are unlikely to deserverecognition.To be sure, a State might provide for a type of "review"that would so resemble an adjudication as to fall within PilotLife's categorical bar. Rush, and the dissent, post, at 394(opinion of Thomas, J.), contend that $ 4-10 fills that bill byimposing an alternative scheme of arbitral adjudication at11 Thus, we do not believe that the mere fact that state independentreview laws are likely to entail different procedures will impose burdenson plan administration that would threaten the object of 29 U. S. C.$ 1132(a); it is the HMO contracting with a plan, and not the plan itself,that will be subject to these regulations, and every HMO will have toestablish procedures for conforming with the local laws, regardless of whatthis Court may think ERISA forbids. This means that there will be nospecial burden of compliance upon an ERISA plan beyond what the HMOhas already provided for. And although the added compliance cost to theHMO may ultimately be passed on to the ERISA plan, we have said thatsuch "indirect economic effect[s]," New York State Conference of BlueCross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 659 (1995),are not enough to preempt state regulation even outside of the insurancecontext. We recognize, of course, that a State might enact an independent review requirement with procedures so elaborate, and burdensso onerous, that they might undermine $ 1132(a). No such system isbefore us.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtodds with the manifest congressional purpose to confine adjudication of disputes to the courts. It does not turn out tobe this simple, however, and a closer look at the state lawreveals a scheme significantly different from common arbitration as a way of construing and applying contract terms.In the classic sense, arbitration occurs when "parties indispute choose a judge to render a final and binding decisionon the merits of the controversy and on the basis of proofspresented by the parties." 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T.Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law $ 2.1.1 (1995) (internalquotation marks omitted); see also Uniform Arbitration Act$ 5, 7 U. L. A. 173 (1997) (discussing submission evidence andempowering arbitrator to "hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence produced"); Commercial DisputeResolution Procedures of the American Arbitration Association |||| R33-R35 (Sept. 2000) (discussing the taking of evidence). Arbitrators typically hold hearings at which partiesmay submit evidence and conduct cross-examinations, e. g.,Uniform Arbitration Act $ 5, and are often invested withmany powers over the dispute and the parties, including thepower to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths, e. g., Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 7; 28 U. S. C. $ 653; UniformArbitration Act $ 7, 7 U. L. A., at 199; Cal. Civ. Proc. CodeAnn. $$ 1282.6, 1282.8 (West 1982).Section 4-10 does resemble an arbitration provision, then,to the extent that the independent reviewer considers disputes about the meaning of the HMO contract 12 and receives"evidence" in the form of medical records, statements from12 Nothing in the Act states that the reviewer should refer to the definitions of medical necessity contained in the contract, but the reviewer did,in this case, refer to that definition. Thus, we will assume that somedegree of contract interpretation is required under the Act. Were no interpretation required, there would be a real question as to whether $ 4-10is properly characterized as a species of mandated-benefit law of the typewe approved in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S.724 (1985).536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the Courtphysicians, and the like. But this is as far as the resem-blance to arbitration goes, for the other features of reviewunder $ 4-10 give the proceeding a different character, onenot at all at odds with the policy behind $ 1132(a). The Actdoes not give the independent reviewer a free-ranging powerto construe contract terms, but instead, confines review to asingle term: the phrase "medical necessity," used to definethe services covered under the contract. This limitation, inturn, implicates a feature of HMO benefit determinationsthat we described inPegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211(2000). We explained that when an HMO guarantees medically necessary care, determinations of coverage "cannot beuntangled from physicians' judgments about reasonable medical treatment." Id., at 229. This is just how the IllinoisAct operates; the independent examiner must be a physicianwith credentials similar to those of the primary care physi-cian, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 (2000), and is expected to exercise independent medical judgment in decidingwhat medical necessity requires. Accordingly, the reviewerin this case did not hold the kind of conventional evidentiaryhearing common in arbitration, but simply received medicalrecords submitted by the parties, and ultimately came toa professional judgment of his own. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-32.Once this process is set in motion, it does not resembleeither contract interpretation or evidentiary litigation beforea neutral arbiter, as much as it looks like a practice (havingnothing to do with arbitration) of obtaining another medicalopinion. The reference to an independent reviewer is simi-lar to the submission to a second physician, which manyhealth insurers are required by law to provide before deny-ing coverage.13The practice of obtaining a second opinion, however, is farremoved from any notion of an enforcement scheme, and13 See, e. g., Cal.

MORANOpinion of the Courtonce $ 4-10 is seen as something akin to a mandate forsecond-opinion practice in order to ensure sound medicaljudgments, the preemption argument that arbitration under$ 4-10 supplants judicial enforcement runs out of steam.Next, Rush argues that $ 4-10 clashes with a substantiverule intended to be preserved by the system of uniform enforcement, stressing a feature of judicial review highlyprized by benefit plans: a deferential standard for reviewingbenefit denials. Whereas Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.Bruch, 489 U. S., at 115, recognized that an ERISA plancould be designed to grant "discretion" to a plan fiduciary,deserving deference from a court reviewing a discretionaryjudgment, $ 4-10 provides that when a plan purchases medical services and insurance from an HMO, benefit denials aresubject to apparently de novo review. If a plan should continue to balk at providing a service the reviewer has foundmedically necessary, the reviewer's determination couldcarry great weight in a subsequent suit for benefits under$ 1132(a),14 depriving the plan of the judicial deference a fiduciary's medical judgment might have obtained if judicialreview of the plan's decision had been immediate.15Again, however, the significance of $ 4-10 is not whollycaptured by Rush's argument, which requires some perspec14 See n. 10, supra.15 An issue implicated by this case but requiring no resolution is thedegree to which a plan provision for unfettered discretion in benefit determinations guarantees truly deferential review. In Firestone Tire itself,we noted that review for abuse of discretion would home in on any conflictof interest on the plan fiduciary's part, if a conflict was plausibly raised.That last observation was underscored only two Terms ago in Pegram v.Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211 (2000), when we again noted the potential for conflict when an HMO makes decisions about appropriate treatment, see id.,at 219-220. It is a fair question just how deferential the review can bewhen the judicial eye is peeled for conflict of interest. Moreover, as weexplained in Pegram, "it is at least questionable whether Congress wouldhave had mixed eligibility decisions in mind when it provided that decisions administering a plan were fiduciary in nature." Id., at 232. Ourdecision today does not require us to resolve these questions.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the Courttive for evaluation. First, in determining whether stateprocedural requirements deprive plan administrators of anyright to a uniform standard of review, it is worth recallingthat ERISA itself provides nothing about the standard. Itsimply requires plans to afford a beneficiary some mechanismfor internal review of a benefit denial, 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(2),and provides a right to a subsequent judicial forum for aclaim to recover benefits, $ 1132(a)(1)(B). Whatever thestandards for reviewing benefit denials may be, they cannotconflict with anything in the text of the statute, which wehave read to require a uniform judicial regime of categoriesof relief and standards of primary conduct, not a uniformlylenient regime of reviewing benefit determinations. SeePilot Life, 481 U. S., at 56.16Not only is there no ERISA provision directly providinga lenient standard for judicial review of benefit denials, butthere is no requirement necessarily entailing such an effecteven indirectly. When this Court dealt with the reviewstandards on which the statute was silent, we held that ageneral or default rule of de novo review could be replaced16 Rush presents the alternative argument that $ 4-10 is preempted asconflicting with ERISA's requirement that a benefit denial be reviewed bya named fiduciary, 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(2). Rush contends that $ 4-10 interferes with fiduciary discretion by forcing the provision of benefits over afiduciary's objection. Happily, we need not decide today whether $ 1133(2)carries the same preemptive force of $ 1132(a) such that it overrides eventhe express saving clause for insurance regulation, because we see no conflict. Section 1133 merely requires that plans provide internal appeals ofbenefit denials; $ 4-10 plays no role in this process, instead providing forextra review once the internal process is complete. Nor is there any conflict in the removal of fiduciary "discretion"; as described below, ERISAdoes not require that such decisions be discretionary, and insurance regulation is not preempted merely because it conflicts with substantive planterms. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358, 376(1999) ("Under [Petitioner's] interpretation . . . insurers could displace anystate regulation simply by inserting a contrary term in plan documents.This interpretation would virtually rea[d] the saving clause out of ERISA"(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORANOpinion of the Courtby deferential review if the ERISA plan itself provided thatthe plan's benefit determinations were matters of high orunfettered discretion, see Firestone Tire, supra, at 115.Nothing in ERISA, however, requires that these kinds ofdecisions be so "discretionary" in the first place; whetherthey are is simply a matter of plan design or the draftingof an HMO contract. In this respect, then, $ 4-10 prohibitsdesigning an insurance contract so as to accord unfettereddiscretion to the insurer to interpret the contract's terms.As such, it does not implicate ERISA's enforcement schemeat all, and is no different from the types of substantive stateregulation of insurance contracts we have in the past permitted to survive preemption, such as mandated-benefit statutesand statutes prohibiting the denial of claims solely on theground of untimeliness.17 See Metropolitan Life Ins.

S. 358 (1999).* * *In sum, $ 4-10 imposes no new obligation or remedy likethe causes of action considered inRussell, Pilot Life, andIngersoll-Rand. Even in its formal guise, the State Actbears a closer resemblance to second-opinion requirementsthan to arbitration schemes. Deferential review in theHMO context is not a settled given; $ 4-10 operates beforethe stage of judicial review; the independent reviewer's denovo examination of the benefit claim mirrors the general or17 We do not mean to imply that States are free to create other forms ofbinding arbitration to provide de novo review of any terms of insurancecontracts; as discussed above, our decision rests in part on our recognitionthat the disuniformity Congress hoped to avoid is not implicated by decisions that are so heavily imbued with expert medical judgments. Rather,we hold that the feature of $ 4-10 that provides a different standard ofreview with respect to mixed eligibility decisions from what would beavailable in court is not enough to create a conflict that undermines congressional policy in favor of uniformity of remedies.536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)Opinion of the Courtdefault rule we have ourselves recognized; and its effect isno greater than that of mandated-benefit regulation.In deciding what to make of these facts and conclusions, ithelps to go back to where we started and recall the waysStates regulate insurance in looking out for the welfare oftheir citizens. Illinois has chosen to regulate insurance asone way to regulate the practice of medicine, which we havepreviously held to be permissible under ERISA, see Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 741. While the statute designedto do this undeniably eliminates whatever may have remained of a plan sponsor's option to minimize scrutiny ofbenefit denials, this effect of eliminating an insurer's autonomy to guarantee terms congenial to its own interests is thestuff of garden variety insurance regulation through the imposition of standard policy terms. See id., at 742 ("[S]tatelaws regulating the substantive terms of insurance contractswere commonplace well before the mid-70's"). It is therefore hard to imagine a reservation of state power to regulateinsurance that would not be meant to cover restrictions ofthe insurer's advantage in this kind of way. And any lingering doubt about the reasonableness of $ 4-10 in affecting theapplication of $ 1132(a) may be put to rest by recalling thatregulating insurance tied to what is medically necessary isprobably inseparable from enforcing the quintessentiallystate-law standards of reasonable medical care. See Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S., at 236. "[I]n the field of healthcare, a subject of traditional state regulation, there is noERISA preemption without clear manifestation of congressional purpose." Id., at 237. To the extent that benefitlitigation in some federal courts may have to account for theeffects of $ 4-10, it would be an exaggeration to hold that theobjectives of $ 1132(a) are undermined. The saving clause isentitled to prevail here, and we affirm the judgment.
