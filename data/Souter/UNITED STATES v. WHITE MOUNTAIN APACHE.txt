The question in this case arises under the Indian TuckerAct: does the Court of Federal Claims have jurisdiction overthe White Mountain Apache Tribe's suit against the UnitedStates for breach of fiduciary duty to manage land and improvements held in trust for the Tribe but occupied by theGovernment. We hold that it does.IThe former military post of Fort Apache dates back to1870 when the United States established the fort within territory that became the Tribe's reservation in 1877. In 1922,Congress transferred control of the fort to the Secretary ofthe Interior (Secretary) and, in 1923, set aside about 400acres, out of some 7,000, for use as the Theodore RooseveltIndian School. Act of Jan. 24, 1923, ch. 42, 42 Stat. 1187.*John E. Echohawk and Tracy A.

Pub. L. 86-392, 74 Stat. 8 (1960Act). The Secretary exercised that right, and although therecord does not catalog the uses made by the Department ofthe Interior, they extended to about 30 of the post's buildingsand appurtenances, a few of which had been built when theGovernment first occupied the land.

Brieffor Respondent 3.In 1993, the Tribe commissioned an engineering assessment of the property, resulting in a finding that as of 1998it would cost about $14 million to rehabilitate the propertyoccupied by the Government in accordance with standardsfor historic preservation. This is the amount the Tribesought in 1999, when it sued the United States in the Courtof Federal Claims, citing the terms of the 1960 Act, amongothers,1 and alleging breach of fiduciary duty to "maintain,protect, repair and preserve" the trust property.

The Government contended thatjurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation cited by the Tribe could fairly be read as imposing alegal obligation on the Government to maintain or restorethe trust property, let alone authorizing compensation forbreach.2The Court of Federal Claims agreed with the UnitedStates and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,relying primarily on the two seminal cases of tribal trustclaims for damages,United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535(1980) (Mitchell I), and United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S.206 (1983)(Mitchell II). Mitchell I held that the IndianGeneral Allotment Act (Allotment Act), 24 Stat. 388, asamended, 25 U. S. C. $ 331et seq. (1976 ed.)

The generaltrust provision established no duty of the United States tomanage timber resources, tribal members, rather, being "responsible for using the land," "occupy[ing] the land," and"manag[ing] the land." 445 U.

Mitchell II identified a specific trust relationship enforceable by award of damages for breach. Id.,at 225-226.Here, the Court of Federal Claims compared the 1960 Actto the Allotment Act in Mitchell I, as creating nothing morethan a "bare trust." It saw in the 1960 Act no mandate thatthe United States manage the site on behalf of the Tribe,and thus no predicate in the statutes and regulations identified by the Tribe for finding a fiduciary obligation enforceableby monetary relief.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed andremanded, on the understanding that the United States's useof property under the proviso of the 1960 Act triggered theduty of a common law trustee to act reasonably to preserveany property the Secretary had chosen to utilize, an obligation fairly interpreted as supporting a claim for money damages. The Court of Appeals held that the provision for theGovernment's exclusive control over the building actually occupied raised the trust to the level of Mitchell II, in whichthe trust relationship together with Government's controlover the property triggered a specific responsibility.Chief Judge Mayer dissented on the understanding thatthe 1960 Act "carve[d] out" from the trust the portions ofthe property that the Government is entitled to use for itsown benefit, with the consequence that the Tribe held onlya contingent future interest in the property, insufficient tosupport even a common law action for permissive waste.249 F. 3d 1364, 1384 (2001).We granted certiorari to decide whether the 1960 Actgives rise to jurisdiction over suits for money damagesagainst the United States, 535 U.

WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBEOpinion of the CourtIIAJurisdiction over any suit against the Government requires a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity, Mitchell I, supra, at 538-539, togetherwith a claim falling within the terms of the waiver, MitchellII, supra, at 216-217. The terms of consent to be sued maynot be inferred, but must be "unequivocally expressed,"Mitchell I, supra, at 538 (quoting United States v. King, 395U. S. 1, 4 (1969)) (internal quotation marks omitted), in orderto "define [a] court's jurisdiction," Mitchell I, supra, at 538(quoting United States v. Sherwood, 312 U. S. 584, 586 (1941))(internal quotation marks omitted). The Tucker Act contains such a waiver, Mitchell II, supra, at 212, giving theCourt of Federal Claims jurisdiction to award damages uponproof of "any claim against the United States founded eitherupon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress," 28 U. S. C.$ 1491(a)(1), and its companion statute, the Indian TuckerAct, confers a like waiver for Indian tribal claims that "otherwise would be cognizable in the Court of Federal Claims ifthe claimant were not an Indian tribe," $ 1505.Neither Act, however, creates a substantive right enforceable against the Government by a claim for money damages.Mitchell I, supra, at 538-540; Mitchell II, supra, at 216. Aswe said in Mitchell II, a statute creates a right capable ofgrounding a claim within the waiver of sovereign immunityif, but only if, it "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained." 463 U. S., at 217 (quoting United States v. Testan,424 U. S. 392, 400 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted).This "fair interpretation" rule demands a showing demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial waiver ofsovereign immunity. "Because the Tucker Act supplies awaiver of immunity for claims of this nature, the separatestatutes and regulations need not provide a second waiver537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN473Cite as: 537 U. S. 465 (2003)Opinion of the Courtof sovereign immunity, nor need they be construed in themanner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity."Mitchell II, supra, at 218-219. It is enough, then, that astatute creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenableto the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in dam-ages. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be"lightly inferred," 463 U. S., at 218, a fair inference will do.BThe two Mitchell cases give a sense of when it is fair toinfer a fiduciary duty qualifying under the Indian Tucker Actand when it is not. The characterizations of the trust as"limited," Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 542, or "bare," MitchellII, supra, at 224, distinguish the Allotment Act's trust-in-name from one with hallmarks of a more conventional fiduciary relationship. See United States v. Navajo Nation,post, at 504 (discussing $$ 1 and 2 of the Allotment Act inMitchell I as having "removed a standard element of a trustrelationship"). Although in form the United States "h[e]ldthe land . . . in trust for the sole use and benefit of the In-dian," 25 U. S. C. $ 348, the statute gave the United Statesno functional obligations to manage timber; on the contrary,it established that "the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land,"that "the allottee would occupy the land," and that "the allottee, and not the United States, was to manage the land."Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 542-543. Thus, we found that Con-gress did not intend to "impose any duty" on the Government to manage resources, id., at 542; cf. Mitchell II, supra,at 217-218, and we made sense of the trust language, considered without reference to any statute beyond the AllotmentAct, as intended "to prevent alienation of the land" and toguarantee that the Indian allottees were "immune from statetaxation," Mitchell I, supra, at 544.The subsequent case of Mitchell II arose on a claim thatdid look beyond the Allotment Act, and we found that stat537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN474 UNITED STATES v. WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBEOpinion of the Courtutes and regulations specifically addressing the managementof timber on allotted lands raised the fair implication thatthe substantive obligations imposed on the United States bythose statutes and regulations were enforceable by damages.The Department of the Interior possessed "comprehensivecontrol over the harvesting of Indian timber" and "exercise[d] literally daily supervision over [its] harvesting andmanagement,"Mitchell II, supra, at 209, 222 (quoting WhiteMountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 145, 147(1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted), giving it a "per-vasive" role in the sale of timber from Indian lands underregulations addressing "virtually every aspect of forest man-agement," Mitchell II, supra, at 219, 220. As the statutesand regulations gave the United States "full responsibilityto manage Indian resources and land for the benefit of theIndians," we held that they "define[d] . . . contours of theUnited States' fiduciary responsibilities" beyond the "bare"or minimal level, and thus could "fairly be interpreted asmandating compensation" through money damages if theGovernment faltered in its responsibility. 463 U. S., at224-226.IIIAThe 1960 Act goes beyond a bare trust and permits a fairinference that the Government is subject to duties as atrustee and liable in damages for breach. The statutory lan-guage, of course, expressly defines a fiduciary relationship3in the provision that Fort Apache be "held by the United3 Where, as in Mitchell II, 463 U. S. 206, 225 (1983), the relevant sourcesof substantive law create "[a]ll of the necessary elements of a common-lawtrust," there is no need to look elsewhere for the source of a trust relationship. We have recognized a general trust relationship since 1831. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16 (1831) (characterizing the relationshipbetween Indian tribes and the United States as "a ward to his guardian");Mitchell II, supra, at 225 (discussing "the undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people").537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN475Cite as: 537 U. S. 465 (2003)Opinion of the CourtStates in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe." 74Stat. 8. Unlike the Allotment Act, however, the statute proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary author-ity to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. Thetrust property is "subject to the right of the Secretary of theInterior to use any part of the land and improvements foradministrative or school purposes for as long as they areneeded for the purpose," ibid., and it is undisputed that theGovernment has to this day availed itself of its option. Asto the property subject to the Government's actual use, then,the United States has not merely exercised daily supervisionbut has enjoyed daily occupation, and so has obtained controlat least as plenary as its authority over the timber in Mitchell II. While it is true that the 1960 Act does not, like thestatutes cited in that case, expressly subject the Governmentto duties of management and conservation, the fact that theproperty occupied by the United States is expressly subjectto a trust supports a fair inference that an obligation to preserve the property improvements was incumbent on theUnited States as trustee. This is so because elementarytrust law, after all, confirms the commonsense assumptionthat a fiduciary actually administering trust property maynot allow it to fall into ruin on his watch. "One of the fundamental common-law duties of a trustee is to preserve andmaintain trust assets," Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472U. S. 559, 572 (1985) (citing G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law ofTrusts and Trustees $ 582, p. 346 (rev. 2d ed. 1980)); seeUnited States v. Mason, 412 U. S. 391, 398 (1973) (standardof responsibility is "such care and skill as a man of ordinaryprudence would exercise in dealing with his own property"(quoting 2 A. Scott, Trusts 1408 (3d ed. 1967) (internal quotation marks omitted))); Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 176(1957) ("The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to usereasonable care and skill to preserve the trust property").Given this duty on the part of the trustee to preserve corpus,537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN476 UNITED STATES v. WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBEOpinion of the Court"it naturally follows that the Government should be liable indamages for the breach of its fiduciary duties."4 MitchellII, supra, at 226. BThe United States raises three defenses against this con-clusion, the first being that the property occupied by theGovernment is not trust corpus at all. It asserts that in the1960 Act Congress specifically "carve[d] out of the trust" theright of the Federal Government to use the property for theGovernment's own purposes. Brief for United States 24-25(emphasis deleted). According to the United States, thiscarve-out means that the 1960 Act created even less than the"bare trust" in Mitchell I. But this position is at odds witha natural reading of the 1960 Act. It provided that "FortApache" was subject to the trust; it did not read that thetrust consisted of only the property not used by the Secretary. Nor is there any apparent reason to strain to avoidthe straightforward reading; it makes sense to treat even theproperty used by the Government as trust property, sinceany use the Secretary would make of it would presumably beintended to redound to the benefit of the Tribe in some way.Next, the Government contends that no intent to providea damages remedy is fairly inferable, for the reason that"[t]here is not a word in the 1960 Act--the only substantive4 The proper measure of damages is not before us. We mean to implynothing about the relevance of any historic building or preservation standards. Neither do we address the significance of the fact that a trustee isgenerally indemnified for the cost of upkeep and maintenance. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 244 (1957) ("The trustee is entitled to indemnity out of the trust estate for expenses properly incurred by him inthe administration of the trust"). Nor do we reach the issue whether arent-free occupant is obligated to supply funds to maintain the property itbenefits from. See Restatement of Property $ 187, Comment b (1936)("When the right of the owner of the future interest is that the owner ofthe estate for life shall do a given act, as for example, . . . make repairs . . .then this right is made effective through compelling by judicial action thespecific doing of the act").537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN477Cite as: 537 U. S. 465 (2003)Opinion of the Courtsource of law on which the Tribe relies--that suggests theexistence of such a mandate." Brief for United States 28.The argument rests, however, on a failure to appreciateeither the role of trust law in drawing a fair inference or thescope of United States v. Testan, 424 U. S. 392 (1976), andArmy and Air Force Exchange Service v. Sheehan, 456 U. S.728 (1982), cited in support of the Government's position.To the extent that the Government would demand an ex-plicit provision for money damages to support every claimthat might be brought under the Tucker Act, it would substi-tute a plain and explicit statement standard for the less demanding requirement of fair inference that the law wasmeant to provide a damages remedy for breach of a duty.To begin with, this would leave Mitchell II a wrongly decided case, for one would look in vain for a statute explicitlyproviding that inadequate timber management would becompensated through a suit for damages. But the more fundamental objection to the Government's position is that, ifcarried to its conclusion, it would read the trust relation outof Indian Tucker Act analysis; if a specific provision for damages is needed, a trust obligation and trust law are not.And this likewise would ignore Mitchell I, where the trustrelationship was considered when inferring that the trust obligation was enforceable by damages. To be sure, the factof the trust alone in Mitchell I did not imply a remedy indamages or even the duty claimed, since the Allotment Actfailed to place the United States in a position to dischargethe management responsibility asserted. To find a specificduty, a further source of law was needed to provide focus forthe trust relationship. But once that focus was provided,general trust law was considered in drawing the inferencethat Congress intended damages to remedy a breach ofobligation.Sheehan and Testan are not to the contrary; they werecases without any trust relationship in the mix of relevantfact, but with affirmative reasons to believe that no damages537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN478 UNITED STATES v. WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBEOpinion of the Courtremedy could have been intended, absent a specific provision.InSheehan, specific authorization was critical because of astatute that generally granted employees the damages rem-edy petitioner sought, but "expressly denie[d] that cause ofaction" to Army and Air Force Exchange Service personnel,such as petitioner. 456 U. S., at 740. InSheehan, restingin part on Testan, the Tucker Act plaintiffs unsuccessfullyasserted that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over aclaim against the United States for money damages for allegedly improper job classifications under the Classification Act.We stressed that no provision in the statute "expresslymakes the United States liable," Testan, 424 U. S., at 399, andrather, that there was a longstanding presumption againstpetitioner's argument. "The established rule is that one isnot entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been dulyappointed to it . . . . The Classification Act does not purportby its terms to change that rule, and we see no suggestionin it or in its legislative history that Congress intended toalter it." Id., at 402. Thus, in both Sheehan and Testanwe required an explicit authorization of a damages remedybecause of strong indications that Congress did not intend tomandate money damages. Together they show that a fairinference will require an express provision, when the legalcurrent is otherwise against the existence of a cognizableclaim. But that was not the case in Mitchell II and is notthe case here.Finally, the Government argues that the inference of adamages remedy is unsound simply because damages are inappropriate as a remedy for failures of maintenance, prospective injunctive relief being the sole relief tailored to the situation. Reply Brief for United States 19. We think this isclearly wrong. If the Government is suggesting that therecompense for run-down buildings should be an affirmativeorder to repair them, it is merely proposing the economic(but perhaps cumbersome) equivalent of damages. But if itis suggesting that relief must be limited to an injunction to537US2 Unit: $U24 [04-16-04 22:50:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 537 U.
