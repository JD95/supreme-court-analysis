DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the CourtUnited States District Court for the District of Utah, charg-ing Digital with unlawful use of the Desktop Direct name.Desktop sent Digital a copy of the complaint, and negotia-tions between officers of the two corporations ensued.Under a confidential settlement reached on March 25, 1992,Digital agreed to pay Desktop a sum of money for the rightto use the "Desktop Direct" trade name and correspondingtrademark, and for waiver of all damages and dismissal ofthe suit. That same day, Desktop filed a notice of dismissalin the District Court.Several months later, Desktop moved to vacate the dismissal and rescind the settlement agreement, alleging misrepresentation of material facts during settlement negotiations. The District Court granted the motion, concluding"that a fact finder could determine that [Digital] failed todisclose material facts to [Desktop] during settlement negotiations which would have resulted in rejection of the settlement offer."

After the DistrictCourt declined to reconsider that ruling or stay its ordervacating dismissal, Digital appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit dismissed theappeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the District Courtorder was not appealable under $ 1291, because it neither"end[ed] the litigation on the merits" nor "[fell] within thelong-recognized `collateral order' exception to the final judgment requirement." 993 F. 2d 755, 757 (1993). Applyingthe three-pronged test for determining when "collateralorder" appeal is allowed, see Cohen, supra; Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.

Although Digital claimedwhat it styled a "right not to go to trial," the court reasonedthat any such privately negotiated right as Digital sought tovindicate was different in kind from an immunity rooted inan explicit constitutional or statutory provision or "compel511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT867Cite as: 511 U.

Wehave repeatedly held that the statute entitles a party to ap-peal not only from a district court decision that "ends thelitigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the courtto do but execute the judgment,"Catlin v. United States,324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945), but also from a narrow class ofdecisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, inthe interest of "achieving a healthy legal system," cf. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 326 (1940), nonethe-less be treated as "final." The latter category comprisesonly those district court decisions that are conclusive, thatresolve important questions completely separate from themerits, and that would render such important questionseffectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment inthe underlying action.

Hol-lywood Motor Car Co., 458 U. S. 263, 270 (1982). We haveaccordingly described the conditions for collateral order ap-peal as stringent, see,e. g., Midland Asphalt Corp. v. UnitedStates, 489 U. S. 794, 799 (1989), and have warned that theissue of appealability under $ 1291 is to be determined forthe entire category to which a claim belongs, without regardto the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a "particular injustic[e]" averted, Van Cauwenberghe v.Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 529 (1988), by a prompt appellate courtdecision. See alsoRichardson-Merrell, supra, at 439 (thisCourt "has expressly rejected efforts to reduce the finalityrequirement of $ 1291 to a case-by-case [appealability] deter-mination"); Carroll v. United States, 354 U. S. 394, 405 (1957).BHere, the Court of Appeals accepted Digital's claim thatthe order vacating dismissal (and so rescinding the settlement agreement) was the "final word on the subject ad-dressed," 993 F. 2d, at 757 (citation omitted), and held thesecond Cohen condition, separability, to be satisfied, as well.Neither conclusion is beyond question,2 but each is best left2 It might be argued that given the District Court's "somewhat cryptic"reference, 993 F. 2d, at 757, to what "a trier of fact could determine," itsrecision order here was merely "tentative," Coopers & Lybrand v.Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469, n. 11 (1978), and thus inadequate under thefirst Cohen test, or that the basis for vacating, Digital's alleged misrepre511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT869Cite as: 511 U. S. 863 (1994)Opinion of the Courtuntouched here, both because Desktop has made no seriouseffort to defend the Court of Appeals' judgment on thosepoints and because the failure to meet the third condition ofthe Cohen test, that the decision on an "important" questionbe "effectively unreviewable" upon final judgment, would initself suffice to foreclose immediate appeal under $ 1291.3Turning to these dispositive factors, we conclude, despiteDigital's position that it holds a "right not to stand trial"requiring protection by way of immediate appeal, that rightsunder private settlement agreements can be adequately vindicated on appeal from final judgment.CThe roots of Digital's argument that the settlement withDesktop gave it a "right not to stand trial altogether" (andthat such a right per se satisfies the third Cohen require-ment) are readily traced to Abney v. United States, 431 U. S.651 (1977), where we held that $ 1291 entitles a criminal de-fendant to appeal an adverse ruling on a double jeopardyclaim, without waiting for the conclusion of his trial. Afterholding the secondCohen requirement satisfied by the dis-tinction between the former jeopardy claim and the questionof guilt to be resolved at trial, we emphasized that the FifthAmendment not only secures the right to be free from multisentations about when it first learned of Desktop's use of the trade name,was so "enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff'scause of action," 437 U. S., at 469 (internal quotation marks omitted), i. e.,whether Digital (willfully) misappropriated the name, as to elude Cohen'ssecond requirement for collateral order appeal. Indeed, it is possible thatthe District Court phrased its order here in equivocal terms preciselybecause it assumed that this lack of separability would preclude any immediate appeal under $ 1291.3 We have of course held that the Cohen requirements go to an appellatecourt's subject-matter jurisdiction, see Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 379 (1981), and thus, were it necessary here, wewould be obliged to assess whether each condition was met, without regard to whether the parties believe it to be satisfied.511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT870 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v.

" 431 U. S.,at 661-662 (quoting Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184,187-188 (1957)). We found that immediate appeal was theonly way to give "full protection" to this constitutional right"not to face trial at all." 431 U. S., at 662, and n. 7; see alsoHelstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500 (1979) (decision denyingimmunity under the Speech and Debate Clause would beappealable under $ 1291).Abney's rationale was applied in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S. 731, 742 (1982), where we held to be similarly appealable an order denying the petitioner absolute immunity fromsuit for civil damages arising from actions taken while petitioner was President of the United States. Seeing this immunity as a "functionally mandated incident of the President's unique office, rooted in the . . . separation of powersand supported by our history," id., at 749, we stressed thatit served "compelling public ends," id., at 758, and would beirretrievably lost if the former President were not allowedan immediate appeal to vindicate this right to be free fromthe rigors of trial, see id., at 752, n. 32.Next, in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), we heldthat similar considerations supported appeal under $ 1291from decisions denying government officials qualified immunity from damages suits. An "essential attribute," id., at525, of this freedom from suit for past conduct not violativeof clearly established law, we explained, is the "entitlementnot to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation," id.,at 526, one which would be "effectively lost if a case [were]erroneously permitted to go to trial," ibid. Echoing the reasoning of Nixon v. Fitzgerald, supra (and Harlow v. Fitz511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT871Cite as: 511 U. S. 863 (1994)Opinion of the Courtgerald, 457 U.

See 472 U. S., at 526 (internal quotationmarks omitted); see alsoPuerto Rico Aqueduct and SewerAuthority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 147 (1993)(State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federalcourt may be vindicated by immediate appeal under $ 1291).DDigital puts this case on all fours with Mitchell. It main-tains that it obtained dual rights under the settlement agreement with Desktop, not only a broad defense to liability butthe "right not to stand trial," the latter being just like thequalified immunity held immediately appealable in Mitchell.As inMitchell, that right must be enforceable on collateralorder appeal, Digital asserts, or an adverse trial ruling willdestroy it forever.While Digital's argument may exert some pull on a narrowanalysis, it does not hold up under the broad scrutiny towhich all claims of immediate appealability under $ 1291must be subjected. To be sure, Abney and Mitchell arefairly cited for the proposition that orders denying certainimmunities are strong candidates for prompt appeal under$ 1291. But Digital's larger contention, that a party's abilityto characterize a district court's decision as denying an irrep-arable "right not to stand trial" altogether is sufficient aswell as necessary for a collateral order appeal, is neither anaccurate distillation of our case law nor an appealing prospect for adding to it.Even as they have recognized the need for immediate appeals under $ 1291 to vindicate rights that would be "irre-trievably lost," Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 431, if re511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT872 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the Courtview were confined to final judgments only, our cases havebeen at least as emphatic in recognizing that the jurisdictionof the courts of appeals should not, and cannot, depend on aparty's agility in so characterizing the right asserted. Thismust be so because the strong bias of $ 1291 against piecemeal appeals almost never operates without some cost. Afully litigated case can no more be untried than the law'sproverbial bell can be unrung, and almost every pretrial ortrial order might be called "effectively unreviewable" in thesense that relief from error can never extend to rewritinghistory. Thus, erroneous evidentiary rulings, grants ordenials of attorney disqualification, see, e. g., RichardsonMerrell, supra, and restrictions on the rights of interveningparties, see Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action,480 U. S. 370 (1987), may burden litigants in ways that areonly imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a finaldistrict court judgment, cf. Carroll, 354 U. S., at 406; Parr v.United States, 351 U. S. 513, 519-520 (1956); and other errors, real enough, will not seem serious enough to warrantreversal at all, when reviewed after a long trial on the merits, see Stringfellow, supra. In still other cases, see Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463 (1978), an erroneousdistrict court decision will, as a practical matter, sound the"death knell" for many plaintiffs' claims that might have goneforward if prompt error correction had been an option. Butif immediate appellate review were available every suchtime, Congress's final decision rule would end up a prettypuny one, and so the mere identification of some interest thatwould be "irretrievably lost" has never sufficed to meet thethird Cohen requirement.

S. 863 (1994)Opinion of the CourtNor does limiting the focus to whether the interest asserted may be called a "right not to stand trial" offer muchprotection against the urge to push the $ 1291 limits. Wehave, after all, acknowledged that virtually every right thatcould be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal mightloosely be described as conferring a "right not to stand trial,"see, e. g., Midland Asphalt, 489 U. S., at 501; Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S., at 524. Allowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move $ 1291 asidefor claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction,see Van Cauwenberghe, supra, that the statute of limitationshas run, see 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 3918.5, and n. 65, p. 521 (1992), thatthe movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to aspeedy trial, see MacDonald, supra, that an action is barredon claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim.Such motions can be made in virtually every case, see generally id., at 862; United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co.,458 U. S., at 270, and it would be no consolation that a party'smeritless summary judgment motion or res judicata claimwas rejected on immediate appeal; the damage to the efficient and congressionally mandated allocation of judicial responsibility would be done, and any improper purpose theappellant might have had in saddling its opponent with costand delay would be accomplished. Cf. Richardson-Merrell,supra, at 434 (appeals from "entirely proper" decisions impose the same costs as do appeals from "injudicious" ones).Thus, precisely because candor forces us to acknowledge thatthere is no single, "obviously correct way to characterize"an asserted right, Lauro Lines, supra, at 500, we have heldthat $ 1291 requires courts of appeals to view claims of a"right not to be tried" with skepticism, if not a jaundicedeye.

DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the CourtIn Midland Asphalt, for example, we had no trouble indispatching a defendant's claim of entitlement to an immediate appeal from an order denying dismissal for alleged viola-tion of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), forbiddingdisclosure of secret grand jury information. Noting " `a cru-cial distinction between a right not to be tried and a rightwhose remedy requires the dismissal of charges,' " 489 U. S.,at 801, quotingHollywood Motor Car, supra, at 269, we ob-served that Rule 6(e) "contains no hint," 489 U.

Only such an "explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee that trial will not occur," we suggested,id., at 801, could be grounds for an immediate appeal of rightunder $ 1291.4The characterization issue surfaced again (and more omi-nously for Digital, seeinfra, at 880) in Lauro Lines, supra,where a defendant sought to appeal under $ 1291 from anorder denying effect to a contractual provision that a Neapol-itan court would be the forum for trying all disputes arisingfrom the parties' cruise-ship agreement. While we realizedof course that the value of the forum-selection clause wouldbe diminished if the defendant could be tried before appeal-ing, we saw the contractual right to limit trial to an Italianforum as "different in kind" from the entitlement to "avoid4 That reasoning echoed our decision one Term earlier in Van Cauwenberghe v.

Evenif such an immunity might supply a basis for vacating a judgment on appeal, we held, the right "should be characterized as the right not to besubject to a binding judgment of the court," and so understood, it couldtherefore "be effectively vindicated following final judgment."

EAs Digital reads the cases, the only things standing in theway of an appeal to perfect its claimed rights under the settlement agreement are the lone statement in Midland Asphalt, to the effect that only explicit statutory and constitu-tional immunities may be appealed immediately under $ 1291,and language (said to be stray) repeated in many of ourcollateral order decisions, suggesting that the "importance"of the right asserted is an independent condition of appeal-ability. See Brief for Petitioner 28-34. The first, Digitalexplains, cannot be reconciled with Mitchell's holding, thatdenial of qualified immunity (which we would be hard pressedto call "explicitly . . . guarantee[d]" by a particular constitu-tional or statutory provision) is a collateral order under$ 1291; as between Mitchell and the Midland Asphalt dic-tum, Digital says, the dictum must give way. As for thesecond obstacle, Digital adamantly maintains that "impor-tance" has no place in a doctrine justified as supplying a glosson Congress's "final decision" language.1These arguments miss the mark. First, even if Mitchellcould not be squared fully with the literal words of theMid-land Asphalt sentence (but cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U. S., at 499,noting that Midland Asphalt was a criminal case and Mitch-ell was not), that would be only because the qualified immunity right is inexplicit, not because it lacks a good pedigreein public law. Indeed, the insight that explicitness may notbe needed for jurisdiction consistent with $ 1291 only leavesDigital with the unenviable task of explaining why otherrights that might fairly be said to include an (implicit) "rightto avoid trial" aspect are less in need of protection by immediate review, or more readily vindicated on appeal from final511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT876 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the Courtjudgment, than the (claimed) privately negotiated right to befree from suit. It is far from clear, for example, why $ 1291should bless a party who bargained for the right to avoidtrial, but not a party who "purchased" the right by havingonce prevailed at trial and now pleads res judicata, see Inre Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation v. WillametteIndustries, Inc., 694 F. 2d 1041 (CA5 1983); or a party whoseeks shelter under the statute of limitations, see, e. g.,United States v. Weiss, 7 F. 3d 1088 (CA2 1993), which isusually understood to secure the same sort of "repose" thatDigital seeks to vindicate here, see Brief for Petitioner 25;or a party not even subject to a claim on which relief couldbe granted. See alsoCobbledick, 309 U. S., at 325 ("Bearingthe discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even byan innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizen-ship"); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368,378 (1981) ("[P]otential harm" should be compared to "theharm resulting from other interlocutory orders that may beerroneous") (internal quotation marks omitted).Digital answers that the status under $ 1291 of these other(seemingly analogous) rights should not give us pause, be-cause the text and structure of this particular settlementwith Desktop confer what no res judicata claimant could everhave, an express right not to stand trial.5 But we cannotattach much significance one way or another to the supposedclarity of the agreement's terms in this case. To ground aruling here on whether this settlement agreement in termsconfers the prized "right not to stand trial" (a point Desktopby no means concedes) would flout our own frequent admoni-tions, see,e. g., Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U. S., at 529, thatavailability of collateral order appeal must be determined at5 But cf. Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.

Indeed, just because it wouldbe the rare settlement agreement that could not be construed to include (at least an implicit) freedom-from-trial"aspect," we decide this case on the assumption that if Digital prevailed here, any district court order denying effect toa settlement agreement could be appealed immediately.(And even if form were held to matter, settlement agree-ments would all include "immunity from suit" language agood deal plainer than what Digital relies on here, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 44.) See alsoVan Cauwenberghe, supra, at 524("For purposes of determining appealability, . . . we willassume, but do not decide, that petitioner has presented asubstantial claim" on the merits).62The more fundamental response, however, to the claimthat an agreement's provision for immunity from trial can6 Similarly, we must reject as patently irrelevant for $ 1291 purposesDigital's repeated claims that the District Court applied the "wrong legalstandard" in granting Desktop's motion to vacate the dismissal order. IfDigital is right that a settlement agreement confers a contractual "immunity from suit," that protection is no more "irretrievably lost," and thusno more appealable under $ 1291, when a district court applies an erroneous legal standard than when it commits a plain vanilla mistake in misapplying the proper standard.Nor do we accept uncritically Digital's novel and highly convenientcontention that such a right to be free from trial is, either in this caseor generally, more valuable than other rights conferred by a settlementagreement. See infra, at 881-882. While Digital emphasizes that, underthe terms of the settlement here, Desktop is owed a larger sum for "dismissal of the above referenced lawsuit and a waiver of all damages" thanfor "all rights to the Trademarks," that proves little, if anything. To compare those two amounts is to place the bargained-for damages waiver onthe wrong side of the ledger: that (typically quite valuable) right is precisely the sort that is fully vindicable on postjudgment appeal. Moreover,even if a high price tag might otherwise be an indicator of a right's "importance" to the benefited party, we cannot ignore that settlement agreement"prices" may be structured for tax, accounting, and business strategy reasons that have nothing to do with their true value to the party.511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT878 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the Courtdistinguish it from other arguable rights to be trial free issimply that such a right by agreement does not rise to thelevel of importance needed for recognition under $ 1291.This, indeed, is the bone of the fiercest contention in the case.In disparaging any distinction between an order denying aclaim grounded on an explicit constitutional guarantee ofimmunity from trial and an order at odds with an equallyexplicit right by private agreement of the parties, Digitalstresses that the relative "importance" of these rights, heavily relied upon by the Court of Appeals, is a rogue factor.No decision of this Court, Digital maintains, has held anorder unappealable as "unimportant" when it has otherwisemet the three Cohen requirements, and whether a decidedissue is thought "important," it says, should have no bearingon whether it is "final" under $ 1291.If "finality" were as narrow a concept as Digital maintains,however, the Court would have had little reason to go beyond the first factor in Cohen, see also United States v.243.22 Acres of Land in Babylon, Suffolk Cty., 129 F. 2d 678,680 (CA2 1942) (Frank, J.) (" `Final' is not a clear one-purposeword"). And if "importance" were truly aberrational, wewould not find it featured so prominently in the Cohen opinion itself, which describes the "small class" of immediatelyappealable prejudgment decisions in terms of rights that are"too important to be denied review" right away, see 337U. S., at 546. To be sure, Digital may validly questionwhether "importance" is a factor "beyond" the three Cohenconditions or whether it is best considered, as we have sometimes suggested it should be, in connection with the second,"separability," requirement, see, e. g., Coopers & Lybrand,437 U. S., at 468; Lauro Lines, 490 U. S., at 498, but neitherenquiry could lead to the conclusion that "importance" isitself unimportant. To the contrary, the third Cohen question, whether a right is "adequately vindicable" or "effectively reviewable," simply cannot be answered without ajudgment about the value of the interests that would be lost511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT879Cite as: 511 U.

S., at 860, n. 7);Lauro Lines, supra, at 502-503 (Scalia, J., concurring).While there is no need to decide here that a privately conferred right could never supply the basis of a collateral orderappeal, but cf. n. 7,infra (discussing 9 U. S. C. $ 16), thereare surely sound reasons for treating such rights differentlyfrom those originating in the Constitution or statutes.When a policy is embodied in a constitutional or statutoryprovision entitling a party to immunity from suit (a rareform of protection), there is little room for the judiciary togainsay its "importance." Including a provision in a privatecontract, by contrast, is barely a prima facie indication thatthe right secured is "important" to the benefited party (contracts being replete with boilerplate), let alone that its valueexceeds that of other rights not embodied in agreements(e. g., the right to be free from a second suit based on a claimthat has already been litigated), or that it qualifies as "important" in Cohen's sense, as being weightier than the societalinterests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles. Where statutory and constitutional rightsare concerned, "irretrievabl[e] los[s]" can hardly be trivial,and the collateral order doctrine might therefore be understood as reflecting the familiar principle of statutory construction that, when possible, courts should construe statutes (here $ 1291) to foster harmony with other statutory andconstitutional law, see, e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,467 U. S. 986, 1018 (1984); United States ex rel. MilwaukeeSocial Democratic Publishing Co. v. Burleson, 255 U. S. 407,437-438 (1921) (Holmes, J., dissenting). But it is one thingto say that the policy of $ 1291 to avoid piecemeal litigationshould be reconciled with policies embodied in other statutesor the Constitution, and quite another to suggest that this511US3 Unit: $U65 [11-04-99 07:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN880 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the Courtpublic policy may be trumped routinely by the expectationsor clever drafting of private parties.7Indeed, we do not take issue with the Tenth Circuit's ob-servation that this case shares more in common withLauroLines than with Mitchell. It is hard to see how, for pur-poses of $ 1291, the supposedly explicit "right not to be tried"element of the settlement agreement in this case differs fromthe unarguably explicit, privately negotiated "right not to betried in any forum other than Naples, Italy," in that one.There, no less than here (if Digital reads the settlementagreement correctly), one private party secured from another a promise not to bring suit for reasons that presumablyincluded avoiding the burden, expense, and perhaps embarrassment of a certain class of trials (all but Neapolitan onesor, here, all prompted by Desktop). Cf. Lauro Lines, supra,at 501 (asserted right was "surely as effectively vindicable"on final judgment appeal as was the right in Van Cauwenberghe).8 The losing argument in Lauro Lines should be alosing argument here.7 This is not to say that rights originating in a private agreement maynever be important enough to warrant immediate appeal. To the contrary, Congress only recently enacted a statute, 102 Stat. 4671, see 9U. S. C. $ 16 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), essentially providing for immediate appeal when a district court rejects a party's assertion that, under the Arbitration Act, a case belongs before a commercial arbitrator and not in court,a measure predicted to have a "sweeping impact," 15B C. Wright, A.Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3914.17, p. 11 (1992);see generally id., at 7-38. That courts must give full effect to this express congressional judgment that particular policies require that privaterights be vindicable immediately, however, by no means suggests that theyshould now be more ready to make similar judgments for themselves. Congress has expressed no parallel sentiment, to the effect that settlementagreement rights are, as a matter of federal policy, similarly "too important" to be denied immediate review.8 To be fair, the Lauro Lines opinion does contain language that, takenalone, might lend succor to petitioner's claim, see 490 U. S., at 501 ("[A]nentitlement to avoid suit is different in kind from an entitlement to besued only in a particular forum"), but the opinion is not easily read as511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT881Cite as: 511 U. S. 863 (1994)Opinion of the CourtNor are we swayed by Digital's last-ditch effort to comewithin Cohen's sense of "importance" by trying to show thatsettlement-agreement "immunities" merit first-class treat-ment for purposes of collateral order appeal, because theyadvance the public policy favoring voluntary resolution ofdisputes. It defies common sense to maintain that parties'readiness to settle will be significantly dampened (or the cor-responding public interest impaired) by a rule that a districtcourt's decision to let allegedly barred litigation go forwardmay be challenged as a matter of right only on appeal froma judgment for the plaintiff 's favor.IIIAEven, finally, if the term "importance" were to be exor-cised from theCohen analysis altogether, Digital's rightswould remain "adequately vindicable" or "effectively reviewable" on final judgment to an extent that other immunities,like the right to be free from a second trial on a criminalcharge, are not. As noted already, experience suggests thatfreedom from trial is rarely thesine qua non (or "the es-sence," see Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U. S., at 525) of a negotiated settlement agreement. Avoiding the burden of a trialis no doubt a welcome incident of out-of-court dispute resolution ( just as it is for parties who prevail on pretrial motions),but in the run-of-the-mill cases this boon will rarely comparewith the " `embarrassment' " and " `anxiety' " averted by asuccessful double jeopardy claimant, seeAbney, 431 U. S., at661-662, or the " `distraction from . . . dut[y],' " Mitchell, 472endorsing Digital's claim that a privately negotiated right not to standtrial would be immediately appealable. To the contrary, Lauro Lines expressly adopted (at least for criminal appeals) Midland Asphalt's limitation that " `[a] right not to be tried in the sense relevant to the Cohenexception rests upon an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee,' "490 U. S., at 499, quoting 489 U. S., at 801, and stated that the collateralorder doctrine operates "[s]imilarly" in civil cases, 490 U. S., at 499.511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT882 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the CourtU. S., at 526, avoided by qualified immunity. Judged withinthe four corners of the settlement agreement, avoiding trialprobably pales in comparison with the benefit of limiting ex-posure to liability (an interest that is fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment). In the rare case where a partyhad a special reason, apart from the generic desire to tri-umph early, for having bargained for an immunity from trial,e. g., an unusual interest in preventing disclosure of particu-lar information, it may seek protection from the districtcourt.The case for adequate vindication without immediate appeal is strengthened, moreover, by recognizing that a settling party has a source of recompense unknown to trialimmunity claimants dependent on public law alone. The essence of Digital's claim here is that Desktop, for valuableconsideration, promised not to sue, and we have been givenno reason to doubt that Utah law provides for the enforcement of that promise in the same way that other rights arising from private agreements are enforced, through an actionfor breach of contract. See, e. g., VanDyke v. MountainCoin Machine Distributors, Inc., 758 P. 2d 962 (Utah App.1988) (upholding compensatory and punitive damages awardagainst party pursuing suit in the face of settlement agreement); see generally 5A A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts$ 1251 (1964); cf. Yockey v. Horn, 880 F. 2d 945, 947 (CA71989) (awarding damages for breach of settlement agreementpromise not to "participate in any litigation" against plaintiff); see also Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 435, and n. 2(existence of alternative fora for vindicating asserted rights isrelevant to appealability under $ 1291). And as for Digital'ssuggestion, see Brief for Petitioner 25, that Desktop is usingthis proceeding not to remedy a fraud but merely to renegeon a promise because it now thinks it should have negotiateda better deal, when a party claims fraud or otherwise seeksrecision of a settlement for such improper purposes, its opponent need not rely on a court of appeals for protection. See511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT883Cite as: 511 U. S. 863 (1994)Opinion of the CourtFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11 (opponent may move for sanctionwhen litigation is motivated by an "improper purpose, suchas . . . unnecessary delay or needless increase in the costof litigation").BIn preserving the strict limitations on review as of rightunder $ 1291, our holding should cause no dismay, for the lawis not without its safety valve to deal with cases where thecontest over a settlement's enforceability raises serious legalquestions taking the case out of the ordinary run. WhileDigital's insistence that the District Court applied a fundamentally wrong legal standard in vacating the dismissalorder here may not be considered in deciding appealabilityunder $ 1291, see n. 6, supra, it plainly is relevant to theavailability of the discretionary interlocutory appeal fromparticular district court orders "involv[ing] a controllingquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground fordifference of opinion," provided for in $ 1292(b) of Title 28.Indeed, because we suppose that a defendant's claimed entitlement to a privately negotiated "immunity from suit" couldin some instances raise "a controlling question of law . . .[which] . . . may materially advance the ultimate terminationof the litigation," the discretionary appeal provision (allowing courts to consider the merits of individual claims) wouldseem a better vehicle for vindicating serious contractualinterpretation claims than the blunt, categorical instrumentof $ 1291 collateral order appeal. See Van Cauwenberghe,486 U. S., at 529-530 (internal quotation marks omitted);Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U. S., at 474-475.99 We recognize that $ 1292 is not a panacea, both because it depends toa degree on the indulgence of the court from which review is sought andbecause the discretion to decline to hear an appeal is broad, see, e. g.,Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U. S., at 475 (serious docket congestion may beadequate reason to support denial of certified appeal). On the other hand,we find nothing in the text or purposes of either statute to justify theconcern, expressed here by Digital, that a party's request to appeal under511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT884 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.Opinion of the CourtIVThe words of $ 1291 have long been construed to recognizethat certain categories of prejudgment decisions exist forwhich it is both justifiable and necessary to depart from thegeneral rule, that "the whole case and every matter in controversy in it [must be] decided in a single appeal." McLishv.Roff, 141 U. S. 661, 665-666 (1891). But denying effect tothe sort of (asserted) contractual right at issue here is farremoved from those immediately appealable decisions involv-ing rights more deeply rooted in public policy, and the rightsDigital asserts may, in the main, be vindicated throughmeans less disruptive to the orderly administration of justicethan immediate, mandatory appeal. We accordingly holdthat a refusal to enforce a settlement agreement claimed toshelter a party from suit altogether does not supply the basisfor immediate appeal under $ 1291. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is therefore Affirmed.$ 1292(b) might operate, practically or legally, to prejudice its claimed rightto immediate appeal under $ 1291.11-03-97 16:16:15 511ordnot1Reporter's NoteThe next page is purposely numbered 1001.

Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburgwould grant the application for stay of execution.Justice Blackmun, dissenting.Even if I had not reached the conclusion that the death penaltycannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution, see my dissent in Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143(1994), I could not support its imposition in this case. There issubstantial evidence that William Henry Hance is mentally re-tarded as well as mentally ill. There is reason to believe thathis trial and sentencing proceedings were infected with racialprejudice. One of his sentencers has come forward to say thatshe did not vote for the death penalty because of his mentalimpairments. And Mr. Hance has raised a colorable claim thatthe trial court's refusal to answer his jurors' questions about sen-tencing options should be held and considered in light of theforthcoming decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, No. 92-9059,pending before this Court. Accordingly, I would grant the application for a stay, grant the petition for writ of certiorari, andvacate the death sentence in this case.April 3, 1994Certiorari DismissedNo. 93-8492 (A-809).

Print)1061ORDERSThomas, J., dissenting1060Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.Petitioner Ian Hoffman brought suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983, against respondents, Kentucky's Cabinet for HumanResources (CHR), two CHR social workers, and his former wife,Melisa Hoffman, alleging that they had deprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being allowed to visit hisminor daughter, B. H. The events giving rise to the suit beganwhen Melisa told the social workers that she suspected petitionerof sexually abusing B. H. The social workers obtained an exparte order from a state court that suspended petitioner's visita-tion rights. The District Court held that the social workers wereabsolutely immune from damages liability under $ 1983 for thisconduct. Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grantcertiorari to address petitioner's challenge to that ruling.In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, "due to their quasi-prosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,"social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juve-nile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing thequestion have agreed that social workers are entitled to absoluteimmunity under $ 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which theyacted. See,e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of SocialServs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (holding that "social workersare entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasi-prosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuitof child dependency proceedings"), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829(1987);Vosburg v. Department of Social Servs., 884 F. 2d 133(CA4 1989) (granting absolute immunity to social workers in connection with their filing of a child removal petition in juvenilecourt); Snell v. Tunnell, 920 F. 2d 673 (CA10 1990) (denying absolute immunity to social workers for conduct in seeking a pro-tective custody order that did not initiate juvenile court proceedings), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 976 (1991). These courts havereasoned that social workers function as prosecutors in certaincontexts, and therefore are entitled to the absolute immunity thatwould be due a prosecutor performing analogous functions. Cf.Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976) (discussing prosecuto-rial immunity).511ord$$1t 11-17-97 21:57:38 PGT*ORD1PP (Prelim. Print)1062 OCTOBER TERM, 1993Thomas, J., dissenting 511 U. S.Consideration of the function performed by an official seekingabsolute immunity plays an important role in our immunity analysis. See, e. g., Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 269 (1993).Function, however, becomes significant only when evaluated inhistorical context. A related inquiry precedes the functionalanalysis: "Our initial inquiry is whether an official claiming immunity under $ 1983 can point to a common-law counterpart to theprivilege he asserts." Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 339-340(1986) (emphasis added). Although $ 1983 "on its face admits ofno defense of official immunity," "[c]ertain immunities were sowell established in 1871, when $ 1983 was enacted, that `we pre-sume that Congress would have specifically so provided had itwished to abolish' them." Buckley, supra, at 268 (quoting Pier-son v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554-555 (1967)). We therefore haveheld that some officials are, under certain circumstances, entitledto absolute immunity. See, e. g., Imbler, supra. An official seeking such immunity, however, must at the outset show that a "coun-terpart to the privilege he asserts" was recognized at commonlaw in 1871, for "[w]here we have found that a tradition of abso-lute immunity did not exist as of 1871, we have refused to grantsuch immunity under $ 1983." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 498(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissentingin part).The courts that have accorded absolute immunity to socialworkers appear to have overlooked the necessary historical in-quiry; none has seriously considered whether social workers enjoyed absolute immunity for their official duties in 1871. If theydid not, absolute immunity is unavailable to social workers under$ 1983. See ibid. This all assumes, of course, that "social work-ers" (at least as we now understand the term) even existed in1871. If that assumption is false, the argument for granting abso-lute immunity becomes (at least) more difficult to maintain. Cf.Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U. S. 429 (1993) (denyingcourt reporter absolute immunity in large part because officialcourt reporters did not begin appearing in state courts until thelate 19th century).It may be argued that the Sixth Circuit and other courts haveeffectively identified a common-law counterpart to the modernsocial worker for purposes of the immunity analysis: the 1871prosecutor. In reasoning that the social worker functions as aprosecutor in performing certain duties, these courts essentially511ord$$1t 11-17-97 21:57:38 PGT*ORD1PP (Prelim. Print)1063ORDERSApril 25, 1994511 U. S.have suggested that, by analogy, the historically rooted immunityfor prosecutors should apply to social workers. In the absenceof a detailed examination of the immunity (if any) that applied tosocial workers in 1871, however, such an analogy must be suspect.But even putting historical concerns aside, it is not clear to methat the functional analysis of the Sixth Circuit is correct. I amnot convinced that social workers, who often are involved in civilfamily welfare proceedings, can ever function as prosecutors forpurposes of $ 1983 immunity analysis. Cf. Imbler, supra, at 430(absolute prosecutorial immunity extends to those functions "intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process")(emphasis added).Of course, the decision below and other decisions granting abso-lute immunity to social workers may be premised more on thenotion that absolute immunity serves important policy concernsthan on either historical or functional analyses. See, e. g., Meyers, 812 F. 2d, at 1157. To the extent they are so based, they aremisguided: The federal courts "do not have a license to establishimmunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of what [they]judge to be sound public policy." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914,922-923 (1984).We should address the important threshold question whethersocial workers are, under any circumstances, entitled to absoluteimmunity.

Certio-rari denied.Justice O'Connor, concurring.As Justice Blackmun details, post, p. 1098, petitioner ap-pears to have a strong claim under Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.302 (1989), that the jury at his capital sentencing trial was unableto give mitigating effect to his mental retardation. It has beenthe traditional practice of this Court, however, to decline to re-view claims raised for the first time on rehearing in the courtbelow. See Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120,128 (1945) ("Questions first presented to the highest State court511ord$$2v 11-03-97 16:36:52 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1098 OCTOBER TERM, 1993Blackmun, J., dissenting 511 U. S.on a petition for rehearing come too late for consideration here,unless the State court exerted its jurisdiction [over them on rehearing]") (emphasis added). Following this practice here makesgood sense because we do not have the benefit of a decision analyzing the application of Penry to the facts of petitioner's case.Petitioner is free to bring his Penry claim to the attention of theTexas courts in a postconviction proceeding. See Ex parte Kun-kle, 852 S. W. 2d 499, 502, n. 3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (Penryclaims are cognizable in state habeas despite an applicant's failureto raise them on direct appeal). If he is unsuccessful in statecourt, petitioner can proceed to federal court and petition for awrit of habeas corpus. Because these avenues of relief are sufficient to afford full review of petitioner's substantial constitutionalclaim, I concur in the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari.Justice Blackmun, dissenting.Petitioner Bobby Joe Wills, a mentally retarded capital defend-ant who was 17 at the time of his offense, was sentenced to deathin Texas without the jury's being allowed to give mitigating effectto his mental impairment. Petitioner's death sentence thus wasimposed in direct violation of Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302(1989), and is devoid of the reliability the Constitution requiresbefore death can be the appropriate punishment. See Woodsonv. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976) (opinion of Stewart,Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Petitioner has an IQ of 61.1 At his trial in 1985, petitioner'scounsel introduced evidence of petitioner's mental retardation tochallenge only the reliability of his confession and his mens reato commit the offense. At the close of the guilt phase, the prose-cutor admonished the jury not to " `have any sympathy for thedefendant because he's a little slow or he's borderline mentallyretarded . . . . Don't say, Poor Old Bobby Joe, he's a little slow,he's borderline mentally retarded. Let's give him a break.' "1 At the time of petitioner's trial, the American Association on MentalRetardation classified individuals with an IQ score between 50-55 and 70 ashaving "mild" retardation. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 308, n. 1(1989). In 1992, the association revised its classification to identify individu-als with an IQ of 75 or below as presumptively retarded. See AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 14 (9thed. 1992).511ord$$2v 11-03-97 16:36:52 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim.

At the penalty phase, the jurors were askedto answer Texas' two standard "special issues": "Did [Wills] actdeliberately when he murdered . . . ? Is there a probability thathe will be dangerous in the future?" SeePenry, 492 U. S., at320. The prosecutor repeatedly commanded the jurors to consider only these questions and reminded them: " `You're not asked,"Was the defendant given an unfair chance at life?" ' " Pet. forCert. 11. After reviewing petitioner's unstable past, the prosecu-tor concluded that "all the counselors and all the psychologistsand all the teachers and all the case workers and all the supervi-sors can't do anything for Bobby Joe Wills.They can't rehabili-tate Bobby Joe Wills." Ibid. (emphasis added). The jury returned affirmative answers to both special issues and sentencedpetitioner to death.Penry v. Lynaugh was decided while petitioner's direct appealwas pending. Recognizing that mental retardation may render adefendant "less morally `culpable than defendants who have nosuch excuse,' " 492 U. S., at 322, quotingCalifornia v. Brown, 479U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring), this Court heldthat Texas' execution of a mentally retarded defendant, withoutthe jury's being instructed that it could consider and give mitigat-ing effect to his mental impairment in imposing sentence, wouldviolate the Eighth Amendment. A rational juror, this Court ob-served, readily could conclude that a mentally retarded capitaldefendant had killed deliberately and was likely to be dangerousin the future, while also concluding that mercy and the defendant'sreduced culpability for the crime made his execution inappropriate. Texas' capital sentencing scheme allowed a jury to give ef-fect to the former conclusion but not the latter, and thus eliminated "a constitutionally indispensable part of the process ofinflicting the penalty of death."Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Like Penry, petitioner was condemned to die by the State ofTexas without the jury's ever having had an opportunity to givea "reasoned moral response to the defendant's background, char-acter, and crime."Brown, 479 U. S., at 545 (O'Connor, J., concurring). His sentence therefore runs the constitutionally intol-erable risk that the death penalty has been imposed despite thepresence of factors that may justify a sentence less than death.511ord$$2v 11-03-97 16:36:52 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim.

J.).2It is possible that petitioner's claims may be better addressedin state and federal postconviction proceedings. Even if I didnot believe that the death penalty cannot be fairly administeredwithin the constraints of our Constitution, see Callins v. Collins,510 U.

Reported below: No. 93-6750, 856 P. 2d 992;2 Petitioner additionally claims that the execution of mentally retarded juvenile offenders is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the EighthAmendment. This Court has recognized that youth, like mental retardation,reduces a defendant's criminal culpability and may render the imposition ofsociety's ultimate retributive sanction inappropriate. See, e. g., Eddings v.Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115-116 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S.815 (1988) (striking death sentence for juvenile offender under age 16); butsee Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989) (declining to declare capitalpunishment per se invalid for juvenile offenders age 16 or older). That suchexecutions violate society's "evolving standards of decency," Trop v. Dulles,356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion), is consistent, of course, with international practice, which condemns the execution of both the mentally dis-abled and juvenile offenders. At least 72 countries that retain the deathpenalty restrict its administration to persons age 18 or over at the time ofthe offense. Amnesty International, Open Letter to the President on theDeath Penalty 8, n. 10 (1994). The United States thus "stands almost alonein the world in still executing offenders who were under-18 at the time ofthe crime." Id., at 8. See generally W. Schabas, The Abolition of theDeath Penalty in International Law (1993).511ord$$2v 11-03-97 16:36:52 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1101ORDERSMay 16, 1994511 U. S.No. 93-7505, 866 S.

That court madetwo key observations: (1) "[R]eligious affiliation (or lack thereof)is not as self-evident as race or gender," 504 N. W. 2d 767, 771(Minn. 1993); (2) "Ordinarily . . . , inquiry on voir dire into ajuror's religious affiliation and beliefs is irrelevant and prejudicial,511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim.

Petitioner, who is black, objectedon Batson grounds and requested a race-neutral explanation forthe strike. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 97 (1986). Theprosecutor responded that she had struck the venireman becausehe was a Jehovah's Witness and explained that "[i]n my experi-ence Jahovah Witness [sic] are reluctant to exercise authorityover their fellow human beings in this Court House." 504N. W. 2d 767, 768 (Minn. 1993). The trial court accepted thatreason for the strike and proceeded to trial. Petitioner subse-quently was convicted.On appeal, petitioner conceded that the prosecutor's explanationfor the strike was race neutral, but contended that Batson shouldbe extended to prohibit peremptory strikes based on religion.The Supreme Court of Minnesota rejected petitioner's Batsonargument and affirmed the conviction. The court reasoned thatthis Court has never held that "Batson should extend beyondrace-based peremptory challenges," and noted that "Batson, itself,speaks solely of the need to eradicate racial discrimination."Ibid. Acknowledging that "[i]f the life of the law were logicrather than experience, Batson might well be extended to includereligious bias and, for that matter, an endless number of otherbiases," id., at 769, the court nevertheless concluded that, becauseBatson had been confined by this Court to the context of race, itshould not be broadened to reach petitioner's claim in this case,504 N. W. 2d, at 772.I find it difficult to understand how the Court concludes todaythat the judgment of the court below should not be vacated andthe case remanded in light of our recent decision in J. E. B.v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., ante, p. 127, which shatters the Su-preme Court of Minnesota's understanding that Batson's equalprotection analysis applies solely to racially based peremptorystrikes. It is abundantly clear that the lower court was relying511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1117ORDERSThomas, J., dissenting1115on just such a reading of Batson, for it reasoned that Batsonembodies " `a special rule of relevance' " that operates only in thecontext of race, and concluded that " `[o]utside the uniquely sensi-tive area of race the ordinary rule that a prosecutor may strikewithout giving any reason applies.' " 504 N. W. 2d, at 771-772(quoting Brown v. North Carolina, 479 U. S. 940, 942 (1986)(O'Connor, J., concurring in denial of certiorari)). In extendingEqual Protection Clause analysis to prohibit strikes exercised onthe basis of sex, J. E. B. explicitly disavowed that understandingof Batson.Indeed, given the Court's rationale in J. E. B., no principledreason immediately appears for declining to apply Batson to anystrike based on a classification that is accorded heightened scru-tiny under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court's decision inJ. E. B. was explicitly grounded on a conclusion that peremptorystrikes based on sex cannot survive "heightened scrutiny" underthe Clause, ante, at 135, because such strikes "are not substan-tially related to an important government objective," ante, at 137,n. 6. In breaking the barrier between classifications that meritstrict equal protection scrutiny and those that receive what wehave termed "heightened" or "intermediate" scrutiny, J. E. B.would seem to have extended Batson's equal protection analysisto all strikes based on the latter category of classifications--acategory which presumably would include classifications based onreligion. Cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246 (1982);Batson, supra, at 124 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). It is at leastnot obvious, given the reasoning in J. E. B., why peremptorystrikes based on religious affiliation would survive equal protection analysis. As Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent, J. E. B.itself provided no rationale for distinguishing between strikes exercised on the basis of various classifications that receive height-ened scrutiny, ante, at 161, and the Supreme Court of Minnesotacertainly did not develop such a distinction. As described above,the court relied expressly on the understanding that Batson wasconfined to the context of race. Under these circumstances, thiscase should be remanded for the Supreme Court of Minnesota toconsider explicitly whether a principled basis exists for confiningthe holding in J. E. B. to the context of sex.I can only conclude that the Court's decision to deny certioraristems from an unwillingness to confront forthrightly the ramifications of the decision in J. E. B. It has long been recognized511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1118 OCTOBER TERM, 1993May 23, 1994 511 U.

B., ante, at 161-162(Scalia, J., dissenting). Once the scope of the logic in J. E. B. ishonestly acknowledged, it cannot be glibly asserted that the decision has no implications for peremptory strikes based on classifications other than sex, or that it does not imply further restrictions on the exercise of the peremptory strike outside the contextof race and sex.In my view, the petition should therefore be granted, the judgment below vacated, and the case remanded for reconsiderationin light of J.

Application for stay of execution of sentence of death, presented toJustice O'Connor, and by her referred to the Court, denied.Certiorari denied. Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburgwould grant the application for stay of execution of sentence ofdeath. Reported below: 18 F. 3d 662.Justice Blackmun, dissenting.In 1853, hanging was the "nearly universal form of execution"in the United States, State v. Frampton, 95 Wash. 2d 469, 492,627 P. 2d 922, 934 (1981), and 48 States once imposed death bythis method. Today, only Washington and Montana still employjudicial hanging. Montana has not executed anyone by hangingin over 50 years, and no one who has contested the sentence hasbeen lawfully hanged in the United States in more than threedecades.1 Petitioner Charles Rodman Campbell, who is scheduled to be executed "by hanging by the neck" in Washington thisweek,2 contends that his hanging will constitute a cruel and unusual punishment. I agree, and accordingly, even if I believedthat the death penalty could be applied constitutionally, see Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissent-ing), I would vote to grant the application for stay and the petition for certiorari in this case.31 The only execution by hanging to occur since 1963 was that of WestleyAlan Dodd, who was executed in Washington last year. Dodd refused eitherto select his mode of punishment or to challenge his hanging sentence.2 Washington's death penalty statute, Wash. Rev. Code 10.95.180(1) (1992),provides: "The punishment of death . . . shall be inflicted either by hangingby the neck or, at the election of the defendant, by [lethal injection]." Fordefendants like Campbell who are unwilling to select their mode of execu-tion, Washington imposes death by hanging.3 Possible obstacles to review are the facts that petitioner's habeas claimmight constitute a new rule under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plu-rality opinion), and that no circuit conflict exists regarding whether hangingis cruel and unusual. Because the only two States that retain hanging arein the Ninth Circuit, a circuit conflict on this issue is unlikely to emerge.Though I respect that Members of this Court may disagree, I would notawait a conflict in a capital case raising a fundamental constitutional question such as this.511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1120 OCTOBER TERM, 1993Blackmun, J., dissenting 511 U. S.This Court has accepted that the Eighth Amendment's prohibi-tion against cruel and unusual punishments "draw[s] its meaningfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progressof a maturing society," Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958)(plurality opinion), and that the best evidence of these evolvingstandards "is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures," Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989); see also Stan-ford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 370 (1989) (citations omitted)(" `[F]irst' among the `objective indicia that reflect the public atti-tude toward a given sanction' are statutes passed by society'selected representatives"); Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 408-410 (1986). The public condemnation of hanging is overwhelming.Not only have 46 of the 48 States that once regularly imposedhanging abandoned the practice, but many state legislatures rejected the practice because it was perceived as inhumane andbarbaric, precisely the concern that lies at the core of the EighthAmendment. See, e. g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 296-297 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("Since the development of thesupposedly more humane methods" of lethal gas and electrocution,"hanging and shooting have virtually ceased"); Malloy v. SouthCarolina, 237 U. S. 180, 185 (1915) (noting that 11 States alteredtheir practice based on "a well-grounded belief that electrocutionis less painful and more humane than hanging"). But see Glassv. Louisiana, 471 U. S. 1080 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (arguing that death by electrocution is cruel and unusual). Evenas the death penalty's popularity has increased in recent years,toleration for hanging has steadily declined. Of the eight Statesthat provided for judicial hanging by the time of the Furmandecision, see 408 U. S., at 297, n. 50 (Brennan, J., concurring), allbut two have abolished it. Today, the only three jurisdictions inthe English-speaking world that impose state-sponsored hangingsare Washington, Montana, and South Africa.4 App. to Pet. forCert. A-38.Moreover, the States' rejection of hanging has been much moreuniversal than that of practices this Court previously has foundto be cruel and unusual. Compare Thompson v. Oklahoma, 4874 Hanging in South Africa also soon may be a thing of the past. FormerPresident F. W. de Klerk imposed a moratorium on hanging in South Africain 1990, and no one has been executed in that country since 1989. TheAfrican National Congress has campaigned to abolish the death penalty.See N. Y. Times, Apr. 27, 1994, section A, p. 9, col. 1.511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1121ORDERSBlackmun, J., dissenting1119U. S. 815 (1988) (invalidating capital punishment for offendersunder age 16 where almost two-thirds of state legislatures rejected the practice); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982)(striking down the death penalty for vicarious felony murderswhere only eight States still authorized the punishment); Cokerv. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 595-596 (1977) (abolishing the deathpenalty for rape where only Georgia imposed death for rape ofan adult and only three States imposed the penalty for any rape),with Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S., at 371 (upholding the deathpenalty for 16-year-olds since "a majority of the States that permit capital punishment authorize" the practice). If the EighthAmendment represents anything other than a prohibition againstpunishments that have been entirely abolished, a punishment onceuniversally practiced and then abandoned specifically due to itsinhumanity must qualify as cruel and unusual.In a 6-to-5 en banc opinion, the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit disregarded this overwhelming evidence of state practice,holding that such evidence is relevant to consideration only ofthe proportionality of a death sentence. Where the method ofexecution is contested, the majority reasoned, the Eighth Amendment prohibits only "the unnecessary and wanton infliction ofpain." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-20. Because hanging does notinflict "purposeful cruelty," the method is constitutional. Id., atA-25. The Ninth Circuit's analysis is surprising given that thisCourt never has held that pain is the exclusive considerationunder the Eighth Amendment, nor distinguished between challenges to the proportionality and the method of capital punish-ment. To the contrary, we have suggested that "[a] penalty mustalso accord with `the dignity of man,' which is the `basic conceptunderlying the Eighth Amendment,' " Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S.153, 173 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,JJ.), a suggestion supported by our recognition that painless, postmortem punishments such as public display, drawing and quarter-ing, and mutilation also violate the Eighth Amendment. Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135-136 (1879).But the en banc panel's emphasis on pain also fails on its ownterms. Under the most "ideal" of circumstances, hanging killsby breaking the spine. "When the victim is dropped from a sufficient height his vertebrae are dislocated and his spinal cordcrushed; unconsciousness is immediate and death follows a shorttime later." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-49 (Reinhardt, J., dissent511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1122 OCTOBER TERM, 1993Blackmun, J., dissenting 511 U. S.ing), quoting Gardner, Executions and Indignities--An EighthAmendment Assessment of Methods of Inflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L. J. 96, 120 (1978). Hanging, however, is acrude and imprecise practice, which always includes a risk thatthe inmate will slowly strangulate or asphyxiate, if the rope istoo elastic or too short, or will be decapitated, if the rope istoo taut or too long. A veteran prison warden has described atypical hanging:"When the trap springs he dangles at the end of the rope.There are times when the neck has not been broken and theprisoner strangles to death. His eyes pop almost out of hishead, his tongue swells and protrudes from his mouth, hisneck may be broken, and the rope many times takes largeportions of skin and flesh from the side of the face that thenoose is on. He urinates, he defecates, and droppings fall tothe floor while witnesses look on." App. to Pet. for Cert.A-57 (Reinhardt, J., dissenting), quoting Gardner, 39 Ohio St.L. J., at 121.A person who slowly asphyxiates or strangulates while twistingat the end of a rope unquestionably experiences the most torturous and "wanton infliction of pain," Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S.,at 173 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, andStevens, JJ.), whilepartial or complete decapitation of the person, as blood spraysuncontrollably, obviously violates human dignity.Washington contends that by conducting its hangings pursuantto its Field Instruction WSP 410.500 or "protocol," these misfor-tunes can be reduced. Washington's protocol details the appropriate placement of the noose knot and the width and length ofthe rope to avoid decapitation, and provides that the rope beboiled, stretched, and waxed to reduce asphyxiation. The proto-col includes a chart for determining, based on the weight of thedefendant, the appropriate distance the body should be dropped.Washington relies entirely on this protocol in conducting its judicial hangings; the State employs no "trained hangers," nor, appar-ently, are there any persons so trained in the United States.App. to Pet. for Cert. A-26.The Ninth Circuit relied on this protocol and the State's ownevidence from its sole recent hanging to find only a "slight risk"that death by hanging will not be rapid or comparatively painless.Id., at A-25. Washington's protocol, however, is derived almost511ord$$3x 11-03-97 16:42:48 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1123ORDERSMay 26, 31, 1994511 U. S.verbatim from a 1959 military execution manual that never hasbeen used in any hanging, and that is almost indistinguishablefrom hanging procedures that resulted in torturous deaths andmutilations in the past. See id., at A-50, and n. 31 (Reinhardt,J., dissenting). Experts for both parties who testified before theDistrict Court agreed that hanging always includes a risk thatunconsciousness and death will not be instantaneous, and ad-mitted that a certain number of Washington's hangings inevitablywill result in death by decapitation. The State presented no evi-dence that Washington's protocol will significantly reduce the riskof asphyxiation or decapitation, and Campbell introduced unre-futed testimony that the protocol actually may increase the likelihood that an inmate's head will be torn off. The evidence in therecord is uncontested, therefore, that Washington's hangings willsuffer the inevitable failings that led all but one other State toabandon hanging as a means of execution.I do not dispute that petitioner's crime was horrible or that hispunishment should be severe. It is equally irrefutable, however,that the Constitution prohibits the imposition of punishments thatare offensive to civilized society. Forty-six of the forty-eightStates that once imposed hanging have rejected that punishmentas unnecessarily torturous, brutal, and inhumane. I can only conclude that today in the United States of America, hanging is crueland unusual punishment. I dissent.No. 93-9278 (A-977). Nethery v. Texas. Ct. Crim. App.Tex.

Certiorari denied.Reported below: 862 S. W. 2d 297.Justice O'Connor, dissenting.Each year, Downtown Frankfort, Inc. (DFI), a nonprofit corpo-ration established to promote downtown revitalization in Frankfort, Kentucky, organizes a 1-day "Great Pumpkin Festival" onthe city's St. Clair Mall. Capital Area Right to Life, Inc.(CARTL), had a booth at the 1989 festival, where it, among otherthings, distributed plastic models of fetuses in little baskets.When many festivalgoers objected to this sort of political advo-cacy at the festival, DFI adopted a policy of denying booths toorganizations that it deemed incompatible with the festival's goalsof "fun and entertainment." Under this policy, DFI refused togive CARTL a booth at the 1990 festival; DFI's president explic-itly told CARTL representatives that this was because CARTLwas a "controversial group." DFI also denied booths to Ken-tucky NOW and the Kentucky Religious Coalition for AbortionRights, two political groups with a message opposed to that ofCARTL. 862 S. W. 2d 297, 297-298 (Ky. 1993).CARTL sued, claiming the policy violated its free speech rights.The Kentucky Supreme Court disagreed. It concluded DFI was511ord$$3x 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1136 OCTOBER TERM, 1993O'Connor, J., dissenting 511 U. S.a state actor, and thus subject to the strictures of the FirstAmendment, because (1) DFI is principally funded by state agencies, (2) DFI took over from the city the function of promotingdowntown revitalization, and (3) the city temporarily delegatedto DFI control over the St. Clair Mall by letting DFI conduct thefestival and decide who gets booths. Id., at 299-300. But thecourt went on to hold that the festival's policy was nonetheless"content neutral," and therefore a valid time, place, and mannerrestriction. Id., at 300-301. The court interpreted the content-neutrality requirement as meaning that the restriction must be"neutral as to the type of message the restriction permits as wellas being nondiscriminatory between messages of the same type,so long as there is a logical and legitimate reason for restrictingthe type of message." Id., at 301. "It is a critical fact in thiscase," the court said, "that CARTL's counterparts, NOW and theReligious Coalition for Abortion Rights, were also denied boothsin keeping with the festival's theme." Ibid.This content-neutrality analysis is flatly inconsistent with ourprecedents. The restriction here is clearly not content neutral,and therefore cannot be a permissible time, place, and mannerrestriction, because it is indisputably justified with reference tothe controversial content of the speech. See, e. g., Boos v. Barry,485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988). The fact that prochoice speakers weretreated similarly under this regulation does not dispose of thecontent-neutrality analysis; we have time and again rejected theargument that viewpoint neutrality equals content neutrality.See, e. g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 197 (1992); Boos,supra, at 319; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481U. S. 221, 230 (1987); Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. PublicServ. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 537-538 (1980); Carey v.Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462, n. 6 (1980).In fact, Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640 (1981), the case on which the opinionbelow relied, specifically said that, to be a valid time, place, andmanner restriction, a regulation " `may not be based upon eitherthe content or subject matter of speech,' " id., at 648 (emphasisadded). Perhaps there is some other reason why the restrictionmight be permissible; but to call it content neutral and to upholdit on that basis is a serious error and an unfortunate precedent.I also think the Kentucky Supreme Court's state action analysisraises an important and difficult question. Many private organi511ord$$3x 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1137ORDERSMay 31, 1994511 U. S.zations--artists' groups, private hospitals, private universities, or-ganizations that educate the public on social matters, Presidentialcampaigns--get government subsidies. We have made clear thata state subsidy of a private organization, even a private organization that exercises functions which might otherwise be performedby the State, does not make that organization a state actor forFirst Amendment purposes. Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S.830, 840-843 (1982) (dealing with a First Amendment claim basedon the discharge of an employee by a private school for malad-justed high school students). That this case also involves the useof a traditional public forum probably should not change the anal-ysis. Many of the groups mentioned above may put on events inpublic fora, and it is not clear that they should have any less rightto exclude people from their events than any other public forumuser would have to exclude others from its rally or parade.We have recently granted certiorari in Lebron v. NationalRailroad Passenger Corporation, 511 U. S. 1105 (1994), to resolvea related state action question. While we cannot now tell towhat extent the decision in Lebron may bear on this case, I wouldhold this case pending that decision, and then either grant andremand in light of Lebron, or, if Lebron proves irrelevant, grantand summarily reverse on the content-neutrality point. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for awrit of certiorari.No. 93-1488. New York v. Martinez. Ct. App. N. Y.

Alexander Securities, Inc. v. Mendez.Ct. App. Cal., 2d App. Dist. Certiorari denied. Reported below:17 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 826.Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.Petitioner is a Los Angeles brokerage firm. When respondentopened an account there, she executed an agreement providingfor arbitration of all disputes. See 17 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 1087,n. 2, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 826, 828, n. 2 (1993). The contract alsoprovided that " `[t]his agreement and its enforcement shall be gov-erned by the laws of the State of New York.' " Id., at 1087, 21Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 827. In 1991, respondent alleged that petitionerand one of its employees had engaged in various deceptive practices, resulting in financial losses to respondent. The parties sub-mitted the dispute to a panel of three arbitrators convened inaccordance with the rules of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers (NASD). The panel awarded respondent $27,000 in compensatory damages and $27,000 in punitive damages for petition-er's failure to adequately supervise the employee. Id., at 1087-1088, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 828.Petitioner sought to have the punitive damages portion of theaward set aside, arguing that New York law prohibits arbitratorsfrom awarding punitive damages. See Garrity v. Lyle Stuart,Inc., 40 N. Y. 2d 354, 353 N. E. 2d 793 (1976). The trial courtdeclined to correct the award. Relying on the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 2 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), the Califor-nia Court of Appeal affirmed. The court concluded that "[t]hechoice of law provision [in the contract] merely designates thesubstantive law that the arbitrators must apply in determiningwhether the conduct of the parties warrants an award of punitivedamages; it does not deprive the arbitrators of their authority toaward punitive damages." 17 Cal. App. 4th, at 1091, 21 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 830.The decision below is in accord with several federal decisionsholding that the Arbitration Act pre-empts state law prohibitionson arbitral punitive damages awards. See, e. g., Todd ShipyardsCorp. v. Cunard Line, Ltd., 943 F. 2d 1056 (CA9 1991); Bonar v.Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 835 F. 2d 1378 (CA11 1988). Butthe Court of Appeal expressly "decline[d] to follow two SecondCircuit cases, which held . . . that state law relating to the propri511ord$$3y 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)1151ORDERSO'Connor, J., dissenting1150ety of a punitive damages award by an arbitrator is not pre-empted by federal substantive law, and thus vacated the punitivedamage[s] award." 17 Cal. App. 4th, at 1091, n. 7, 21 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 830, n. 7, citing Barbier v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,Inc., 948 F. 2d 117 (CA2 1991), and Fahnestock & Co. v. Waltman,935 F. 2d 512 (CA2 1991).Moreover, the decision below irreconcilably conflicts with Mas-trobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 20 F. 3d 713 (CA71994). In Mastrobuono, the investor signed an agreement withthe brokerage house containing an arbitration provision and aNew York choice-of-law clause identical to those in the agreementin this case. The investor brought the same kinds of claims asrespondent did--churning and unauthorized trading--and theywere submitted to arbitration pursuant to NASD rules. The arbitration panel awarded punitive damages against the brokeragefirm, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held thatthe award should be set aside. See 9 U. S. C. $ 10(a)(4) (1988 ed.,Supp. IV) (authorizing set-aside where "the arbitrators exceededtheir powers"). The court acknowledged the strong federal policyfavoring arbitration, but also noted that the policy "is simplyto ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of privateagreements to arbitrate." Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S.468, 476 (1989) (emphasis added). By incorporating New Yorklaw into the agreement, the court reasoned, the parties agreed tobe bound by the New York prohibition on arbitrators' awardingpunitive damages. The Seventh Circuit expressly "recognize[d]that some circuit courts have reached a different result." 20 F.3d, at 718, citing Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra;Raytheon Co. v. Automated Business Systems, Inc., 882 F. 2d 6(CA1 1989); Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Cunard Line, Ltd., supra;Lee v. Chica, 983 F. 2d 883 (CA8), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 906(1993).To this list of conflicting decisions may be added the decisionbelow. The result is that courts in different jurisdictions reachcontrary results with respect to the availability of punitivedamages in cases involving similarly situated parties and iden-tical arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act waspassed, in part, to prevent this kind of disarray. Because mostsecurities agreements contain arbitration provisions, and manyare governed by New York law, the ability of arbitrators to award511ord$$3y 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim.
