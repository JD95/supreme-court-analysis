The question is whether the provision of the Fair LaborStandards Act of 1938 (FLSA or Act), that suit under theAct "may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State courtof competent jurisdiction," 52 Stat. 1069, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 216(b), bars removal of a suit from state to federalcourt. We hold there is no bar.IPetitioner, Phillip T. Breuer, sued respondent, his formeremployer, Jim's Concrete of Brevard, Inc., in a state court ofFlorida for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, prejudgmentinterest, and attorney's fees. Section 216(b) provides notonly that an employer who violates its minimum wage andovertime provisions is liable to an employee, but that "[a]naction to recover the liability prescribed . . . may be main-tained against any employer (including a public agency) inany Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction."Jim's Concrete removed the case to the United StatesDistrict Court for the Middle District of Florida under 28U. S. C. $ 1441(a), which reads that "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action broughtin a State court of which the district courts of the United*Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the Academyof Florida Management Attorneys, Inc., by Peter W.

JIM'S CONCRETE OF BREVARD, INC.Opinion of the CourtStates have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the UnitedStates for the district and division embracing the placewhere such action is pending." Breuer sought an order remanding the case to state court, arguing that removal wasimproper owing to the FLSA's provision that an action "maybe maintained" in any state court, a provision that Breuerput forward as an express exception to the general authorization of removal under $ 1441(a). Though the DistrictCourt denied Breuer's motion, it certified the issue for interlocutory appeal under $ 1292(b). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that Congress had expressly barred removalin "direct, unequivocal language" in other statutes, 292 F. 3d1308, 1310 (2002), but was not comparably prohibitory in$ 216(b). The Eleventh Circuit thus joined the First, seeCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 786 F. 2d 445 (1986), but placeditself at odds with the Eighth, see Johnson v. Butler Bros.,162 F. 2d 87 (1947) (denying removability under FLSA). Wegranted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 537 U. S. 1099(2003), and now affirm.IIAThere is no question that Breuer could have begun hisaction in the District Court. The FLSA provides that anaction "may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State courtof competent jurisdiction," 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b), and the district courts would in any event have original jurisdictionover FLSA claims under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, as "arising underthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," and$ 1337(a), as "arising under any Act of Congress regulatingcommerce." Removal of FLSA actions is thus prohibitedunder $ 1441(a) only if Congress expressly provided as much.Nothing on the face of 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b) looks like anexpress prohibition of removal, there being no mention ofremoval, let alone of prohibition. While $ 216(b) provides538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN695Cite as: 538 U. S. 691 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthat an action "may be maintained . . . in any . . . State courtof competent jurisdiction," the word "maintain" enjoys abreadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal am-biguous at best. "To maintain an action" may mean "to continue" to litigate, as opposed to "commence" an action.1Black's Law Dictionary 1143 (3d ed. 1933). But "maintain"in reference to a legal action is often read as "bring" or "file";"[t]o maintain an action or suit may mean to commence orinstitute it; the term imports the existence of a cause of ac-tion."Ibid.; see 1A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice|| 0.167[5], p. 472 (2d ed. 1996) (calling the " `may be maintained' " language an "ambiguous phrase" and "certainly notan express provision against removal within the meaning of$ 1441"); 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 3729, p. 235 (1998) (referring to"use of the ambiguous term `maintain' in the statute"). Themost, then, that Breuer can claim simply from the use of theterm "maintain" is that any text, even when ambiguous, thatmight be read as inconsistent with removal is an "express"prohibiting provision under the statute. But if an ambigu-ous term like "maintain" qualified as an express provision1 Actually, there is reason to think that this sense of "maintain" wasintended. Under the FLSA, the Secretary of Labor may file a suit onbehalf of an employee to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation,and when the Secretary files such a suit, an employee's right to bring acomparable action terminates, see, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 216(c). Congressional reports suggest that although an employee may no longer initiate anew action once the Secretary has sued, an employee may continue tolitigate, i. e., "maintain," an action already pending. See H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 327, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 20 (1961) (filing of the Secretary's complaintwould "not, however, operate to terminate any employee's right to maintain such a private suit to which he had become a party plaintiff beforethe Secretary's action"); S. Rep. No. 145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 39 (1961)(Secretary's filing of complaint "terminates the rights of individuals tolater file suit"); cf. Smallwood v. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, 61 (1927) ("Tomaintain a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suitalready begun"). Seen in this light, Congress's use of the term "maintain"is easy to understand, carrying no implication for removal.538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN696 BREUER v. JIM'S CONCRETE OF BREVARD, INC.Opinion of the Courtfor purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), then the requirement ofan "expres[s] provi[sion]" would call for nothing more than a"provision," pure and simple, leaving the word "expressly"with no consequence whatever. "[E]xpres[s] provi[sion]"must mean something more than any verbal hook for anargument.The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is underscored by examples of indisputable prohibi-tions of removal in a number of other statutes. Section1445, for example, provides that"(a) A civil action in any State court against a railroador its receivers or trustees . . . may not be removed toany district court of the United States."(b) A civil action in any State court against a carrieror its receivers or trustees to recover damages for delay,loss, or injury of shipments . . . may not be removed toany district court of the United States unless the matterin controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interestand costs."(c) A civil action in any State court arising under theworkmen's compensation laws of such State may not beremoved to any district court of the United States."(d) A civil action in any State court arising under . . .the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 may not beremoved to any district court of the United States."See also 15 U.

When Congress has "wished to give plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum, it has shown itself capableof doing so in unmistakable terms." Cosme Nieves, 786F. 2d, at 451. It has not done so here.BNone of Breuer's refinements on his basic argument fromthe term "maintain" puts him in a stronger position. Hegoes on to say, for example, that interpretation does not stopat the dictionary, and he argues that the statutory phrase"may be maintained" shows up as sufficiently prohibitoryonce it is coupled with a federal policy of construing removaljurisdiction narrowly. Breuer relies heavily on our state-ment in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100(1941), that "the policy of the successive acts of Congressregulating the jurisdiction of federal courts is one calling forthe strict construction of [removal legislation] . . . . `Dueregard for the rightful independence of state governments,which should actuate federal courts, requires that theyscrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the preciselimits . . . the statute has defined.' " Id., at 108-109 (quotingHealy v. Ratta, 292 U. S. 263, 270 (1934)). But whatever ap-parent force this argument might have claimed when Shamrock was handed down has been qualified by later statutorydevelopment. At the time that case was decided, $ 1441 provided simply that any action within original federal subject-matter jurisdiction could be removed. Fourteen years later,however, it was amended into its present form, requiring anyexception to the general removability rule to be express.See Act of June 25, 1948, $ 1441(a), 62 Stat. 937 (authorizingremoval over civil suits within the district courts' originaljurisdiction "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Actof Congress"); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 1441 (historical and revi538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN698 BREUER v. JIM'S CONCRETE OF BREVARD, INC.Opinion of the Courtsion notes). Since 1948, therefore, there has been no question that whenever the subject matter of an action qualifiesit for removal, the burden is on a plaintiff to find an expressexception. As Shamrock itself said, "the language of theAct . . . evidence[s] the Congressional purpose," 313 U. S., at108, and congressional insistence on express exception ishardly satisfied by the malleability of the term "maintain" inthe text Breuer relies upon.Nor does it do Breuer any good to emphasize a sense of"maintain" as implying continuation of an action to finaljudgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an action thestatutory right under 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b) to see it through.We may concede that it does, and the concession leaves theterm "maintain" just as ambiguous as ever on the issue before us.2 The right to maintain an action may indeed be aright to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeatthat right; far from concluding a case before final judgment,removal just transfers it from one forum to another. Asbetween a state and a federal forum, the statute seems tobetray an indifference, with its provision merely for maintaining action "in any Federal or State Court," ibid.But even if the text of $ 216(b) were not itself reasonenough to doubt that the provision conveys any right to remain in the original forum, the implication of Breuer's position would certainly raise misgivings about his point. Forif the phrase "[a]n action . . . may be maintained" meant thata plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case whereverhe filed it in the first place, it would seem that an FLSA casebrought in a federal district court could never be transferredto a different one over the plaintiff 's objection, a result thatwould plainly clash with the provision for change of venue,28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a) ("For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer2 As to individual cases brought before the institution of any suit by theGovernment, see n. 1, supra.538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN699Cite as: 538 U. S. 691 (2003)Opinion of the Courtany civil action to any other district or division where itmight have been brought").It is, finally, a like concern about consequences that leavesus with fatal reservations about Breuer's pragmatic appealthat many claims under the FLSA are for such smallamounts that removal to a sometimes distant federal courtmay make it less convenient and more expensive for employ-ees to vindicate their rights effectively. This may often betrue, but even if its truth somehow justified winking at theambiguity of the term "maintain," the implications wouldkeep us from going Breuer's way. A number of other statutes incorporate or use the same language as $ 216(b), see 29U. S. C. $ 626(b) (providing that the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967 "shall be enforced in accordancewith the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in"$ 216(b) and other sections of the FLSA); $ 2005(c)(2) ("Anaction to recover the liability prescribed [under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988] in paragraph (1)may be maintained against the employer in any Federalor State court of competent jurisdiction"); $ 2617(a)(2) ("Anaction to recover the damages or equitable relief [under theFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993] prescribed in paragraph (1) may be maintained against any employer (includinga public agency) in any Federal or State court of competentjurisdiction by any one or more employees"). Breuer, then,cannot have a removal exception for the FLSA without entailing exceptions for other statutory actions, to the pointthat it becomes just too hard to believe that a right to "maintain" an action was ever meant to displace the right toremove.33 Breuer points to two nonjudicial authorities that do nothing to assuageour skepticism. He calls our attention to the position taken by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department ofLabor, in an amicus brief filed before the Eighth Circuit in Johnson v.Butler Bros., 162 F. 2d 87 (1947), arguing that the text of the FLSA andthe policies motivating its passage demonstrate that FLSA actions may538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN700 BREUER v.
