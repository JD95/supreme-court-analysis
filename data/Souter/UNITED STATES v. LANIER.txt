Respondent David Lanier was convicted under 18 U. S. C.$ 242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of fivewomen by assaulting them sexually while Lanier served asa state judge. The Sixth Circuit reversed his convictionson the ground that the constitutional right in issue had notpreviously been identified by this Court in a case with fundamentally similar facts. The question is whether this stand-ard of notice is higher than the Constitution requires, andwe hold that it is. IDavid Lanier was formerly the sole state Chancery Courtjudge for two rural counties in western Tennessee. Thetrial record, read most favorably to the jury's verdict, showsthat from 1989 to 1991, while Lanier was in office, he sexuallyassaulted several women in his judicial chambers. The twomost serious assaults were against a woman whose divorceproceedings had come before Lanier and whose daughter'scustody remained subject to his jurisdiction. When thewoman applied for a secretarial job at Lanier's courthouse,Lanier interviewed her and suggested that he might have toreexamine the daughter's custody. When the woman got upto leave, Lanier grabbed her, sexually assaulted her, and finally committed oral rape. A few weeks later, Lanier invei-gled the woman into returning to the courthouse again toget information about another job opportunity, and againsexually assaulted and orally raped her. App. 44-67. Onfive other occasions Lanier sexually assaulted four otherwomen: two of his secretaries, a Youth Services Officer ofthe juvenile court over which Lanier presided, and a localcoordinator for a federal program who was in Lanier's chambers to discuss a matter affecting the same court. Id., at13-43, 67-109.Ultimately, Lanier was charged with 11 violations of $ 242,each count of the indictment alleging that, acting willfullyand under color of Tennessee law, he had deprived the victim520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN262 UNITED STATES v. LANIEROpinion of the Courtof "rights and privileges which are secured and protected bythe Constitution and the laws of the United States, namelythe right not to be deprived of liberty without due processof law, including the right to be free from wilful sexual assault." Id., at 5-12. Before trial, Lanier moved to dismissthe indictment on the ground that $ 242 is void for vagueness.The District Court denied the motion.The trial judge instructed the jury on the Government'sburden to prove as an element of the offense that the defendant deprived the victim of rights secured or protected by theConstitution or laws of the United States:"Included in the liberty protected by the [Due ProcessClause of the] Fourteenth Amendment is the concept ofpersonal bodily integrity and the right to be free of un-authorized and unlawful physical abuse by state intrusion. Thus, this protected right of liberty provides thatno person shall be subject to physical or bodily abusewithout lawful justification by a state official acting orclaiming to act under the color of the laws of any stateof the United States when that official's conduct is sodemeaning and harmful under all the circumstances asto shock one's consci[ence]. Freedom from such physical abuse includes the right to be free from certain sexu-ally motivated physical assaults and coerced sexual battery. It is not, however, every unjustified touching orgrabbing by a state official that constitutes a violationof a person's constitutional rights. The physical abusemust be of a serious substantial nature that involvesphysical force, mental coercion, bodily injury or emotional damage which is shocking to one's consci[ence]."Id., at 186-187.The jury returned verdicts of guilty on seven counts, and notguilty on three (one count having been dismissed at the closeof the Government's evidence).

He was sentenced to consecutive maxi-mum terms totaling 25 years.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions and sentence, 33 F. 3d 639 (1994), butthe full court vacated that decision and granted rehearing enbanc, 43 F. 3d 1033 (1995). On rehearing, the court set asideLanier's convictions for "lack of any notice to the public thatthis ambiguous criminal statute [i. e., $ 242] includes simpleor sexual assault crimes within its coverage." 73 F. 3d 1380,1384 (1996). Invoking general canons for interpreting criminal statutes, as well as this Court's plurality opinion inScrews v. United States, 325 U. S. 91 (1945), the Sixth Circuitheld that criminal liability may be imposed under $ 242 onlyif the constitutional right said to have been violated is firstidentified in a decision of this Court (not any other federal,or state, court), and only when the right has been held toapply in "a factual situation fundamentally similar to the oneat bar." 73 F. 3d, at 1393. The Court of Appeals regardedthese combined requirements as "substantially higher thanthe `clearly established' standard used to judge qualified immunity" in civil cases under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.$ 1983. 73 F. 3d, at 1393. Finding no decision of this Courtapplying a right to be free from unjustified assault or invasions of bodily integrity in a situation "fundamentallysimilar" to those charged, the Sixth Circuit reversed thejudgment of conviction with instructions to dismiss the indictment. Two judges would not have dismissed the felonycounts charging the oral rapes but concurred in dismissingthe misdemeanor counts, while three members of the courtdissented as to all dismissals.We granted certiorari to review the standard for determining whether particular conduct falls within the rangeof criminal liability under $ 242. 518 U.

LANIEROpinion of the CourtIISection 242 is a Reconstruction Era civil rights statutemaking it criminal to act (1) "willfully" and (2) under colorof law (3) to deprive a person of rights protected by the Con-stitution or laws of the United States.1 18 U. S. C. $ 242;Screws v. United States, supra. The en banc decision of theSixth Circuit dealt only with the last of these elements, andit is with that element alone that we are concerned here.2The general language of $ 242,3 referring to "the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or pro1 The present $ 242 has its roots in portions of three Reconstruction EraCivil Rights Acts, whose substantive criminal provisions were consolidated in a single section in 1874. See 2 Cong. Rec. 827-828 (1874) (describing derivation of consolidated criminal civil rights law from $$ 1 and2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27; $$ 16 and 17 of the CivilRights Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 144; and $ 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17Stat. 13). Although those statutory forebears created criminal sanctionsonly for violations of some enumerated rights and privileges, the consolidated statute of 1874 expanded the law's scope to apply to deprivations ofall constitutional rights, despite the "customary stout assertions of thecodifiers that they had merely clarified and reorganized without changingsubstance." United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 803 (1966). Since the1874 recodification, Congress has revisited $ 242 on several occasions, without contracting its substantive scope. See 35 Stat. 1092 (1909) (addingwillfulness requirement); 82 Stat. 75 (1968) (enhancing penalties for someviolations); 102 Stat. 4396 (1988) (same); 108 Stat. 1970, 2109, 2113, 2147(1994) (same).2 Thus, we do not address the argument, pressed by respondent, thatthe actions for which he was convicted were not taken under color of law.The Sixth Circuit discussed that issue only in the original panel opinion,subsequently vacated, but did not reach the question in the en banc decision under review here. To the extent the issue remains open, we leaveits consideration in the first instance to the Court of Appeals on remand.3 "Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, orcustom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, or Districtto the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or to differentpunishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being an alien,or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishmentof citizens," shall be subject to specified criminal penalties.520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN265Cite as: 520 U. S. 259 (1997)Opinion of the Courttected by the Constitution or laws of the United States," ismatched by the breadth of its companion conspiracy statute,$ 241,4 which speaks of conspiracies to prevent "the free ex-ercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to [anyperson] by the Constitution or laws of the United States."Thus, in lieu of describing the specific conduct it forbids, eachstatute's general terms incorporate constitutional law by ref-erence, seeUnited States v. Kozminski, 487 U. S. 931, 941(1988); United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 797, 805 (1966),and many of the incorporated constitutional guarantees are,of course, themselves stated with some catholicity of phrasing. The result is that neither the statutes nor a good manyof their constitutional referents delineate the range of forbidden conduct with particularity.The right to due process enforced by $ 242 and said to havebeen violated by Lanier presents a case in point, with theirony that a prosecution to enforce one application of its spacious protection of liberty can threaten the accused with dep-rivation of another: what Justice Holmes spoke of as "fairwarning . . . in language that the common world will under-stand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line shouldbe clear." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931)." `The . . . principle is that no man shall be held criminallyresponsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.' " Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378U. S. 347, 351 (1964) (quotingUnited States v. Harriss, 347U. S. 612, 617 (1954)).54 Insofar as pertinent: "If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured tohim by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of hishaving so exercised the same," they shall be subject to specified criminalpenalties.5 The fair warning requirement also reflects the deference due to thelegislature, which possesses the power to define crimes and their punishment. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820); United520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN266 UNITED STATES v. LANIEROpinion of the CourtThere are three related manifestations of the fair warningrequirement. First, the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of "a statute which either forbids or requires the doingof an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligencemust necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to itsapplication." Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385,391 (1926); accord, Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357(1983); Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939).Second, as a sort of "junior version of the vagueness doctrine," H. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 95(1968), the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes,or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conductclearly covered. See, e. g., Liparota v. United States, 471U. S. 419, 427 (1985); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,347-348 (1971); McBoyle, supra, at 27. Third, although clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss onan otherwise uncertain statute, see, e. g., Bouie, supra, at357-359; Kolender, supra, at 355-356; Lanzetta, supra, at455-457; Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Constructionof Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L. Rev. 189, 207 (1985), due processbars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminalstatute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope, see,e. g., Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 191-192 (1977);Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313 (1972) (per curiam);Bouie, supra, at 353-354; cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3;id., $ 10, cl. 1; Bouie, supra, at 353-354 (Ex Post FactoStates v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600 (1995). See generally H. Packer,The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 79-96 (1968) (discussing "principle oflegality," "that conduct may not be treated as criminal unless it has beenso defined by [a competent] authority . . . before it has taken place," asimplementing separation of powers, providing notice, and preventingabuses of official discretion) (quotation at 80); Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Construction of Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L. Rev. 189 (1985).520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN267Cite as: 520 U. S. 259 (1997)Opinion of the CourtClauses bar legislatures from making substantive criminaloffenses retroactive). In each of these guises, the touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as con-strued, made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that thedefendant's conduct was criminal.We applied this standard inScrews v. United States, 325U. S. 91 (1945), which recognized that the expansive language of due process that provides a basis for judicial reviewis, when incorporated by reference into $ 242, generally illsuited to the far different task of giving fair warning aboutthe scope of criminal liability. TheScrews plurality identified the affront to the warning requirement posed by employing $ 242 to place "the accused . . . on trial for an offense, thenature of which the statute does not define and hence ofwhich it gives no warning." Id., at 101. At the same time,the same Justices recognized that this constitutional difficulty does not arise when the accused is charged with violat-ing a "right which has been made specific either by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United Statesor by decisions interpreting them."Id., at 104. Whenbroad constitutional requirements have been "made specific"by the text or settled interpretations, willful violators "cer-tainly are in no position to say that they had no adequateadvance notice that they would be visited with pun-ishment. . . . [T]hey are not punished for violating an unknowable something." Id., at 105. Accordingly, Screwslimited the statute's coverage to rights fairly warned of, having been "made specific" by the time of the charged conduct.See alsoKozminski, supra, at 941 (parallel construction of$ 241).66 This process of "making specific" does not, as the Sixth Circuit believed, qualify Screws as "the only Supreme Court case in our legal historyin which a majority of the Court seems [to have been] willing to create acommon law crime." 73 F. 3d 1380, 1391 (1996). Federal crimes are defined by Congress, not the courts, Kozminski, 487 U. S., at 939; UnitedStates v. Wiltberger, supra, at 95, and Screws did not "create a common520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN268 UNITED STATES v. LANIEROpinion of the CourtThe Sixth Circuit, in this case, added two glosses to themade-specific standard of fair warning. In its view, a generally phrased constitutional right has been made specificwithin the meaning of Screws only if a prior decision of thisCourt has declared the right, and then only when this Courthas applied its ruling in a case with facts "fundamentallysimilar" to the case being prosecuted. 73 F. 3d, at 1393.None of the considerations advanced in this case, however,persuade us that either a decision of this Court or the ex-treme level of factual specificity envisioned by the Court ofAppeals is necessary in every instance to give fair warning.First, contrary to the Court of Appeals, seeibid., we thinkit unsound to readScrews as reasoning that only this Court'sdecisions could provide the required warning. Although theScrews plurality gave two examples involving decisions ofthe Court, their opinion referred in general terms to rightsmade specific by "decisions interpreting" the Constitution,see 325 U. S., at 104 (plurality opinion), and no subsequentcase has held that the universe of relevant interpretive deci-sions is confined to our opinions. WhileUnited States v.Kozminski, 487 U. S. 931 (1988), a case under $ 241 for violatlaw crime"; it narrowly construed a broadly worded Act of Congress, andthe policies favoring strict construction of criminal statutes oblige us tocarry out congressional intent as far as the Constitution will admit, seeKozminski, supra, at 939; Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 831(1974); United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475 (1840). Nor is $ 242'spedigree as an Act of Congress tainted by its birth at the hands of codifierswho arguably made substantive changes in the pre-existing law, see n. 1,supra, as the Sixth Circuit concluded from the statutory history, 73 F. 3d,at 1384-1387. The legislative intent of Congress is to be derived fromthe language and structure of the statute itself, if possible, not from theassertions of codifiers directly at odds with clear statutory language. See,e. g., United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496-497 (1997). Further, theSixth Circuit's conclusion that Congress never intended $ 242 to extend to"newly-created constitutional rights," 73 F. 3d, at 1387, is belied by thefact that Congress has increased the penalties for the section's violationseveral times since Screws was decided, without contracting its substantive scope, see n. 1, supra.520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN269Cite as: 520 U. S. 259 (1997)Opinion of the Courting Thirteenth Amendment rights, did characterize our taskas ascertaining the crime charged "by looking to the scopeof the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition . . . specified inour prior decisions,"id., at 941, in at least one other case wehave specifically referred to a decision of a Court of Appealsin defining the established scope of a constitutional right forpurposes of $ 241 liability, seeAnderson v. United States, 417U. S. 211, 223-227 (1974). It is also to the point, as we ex-plain below, that in applying the rule of qualified immunityunder 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), we have referred todecisions of the Courts of Appeals when enquiring whethera right was "clearly established." See Mitchell v. Forsyth,472 U. S. 511, 533 (1985); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 191-192 (1984); see also id., at 203-205 (Brennan, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part); Elder v. Holloway, 510 U. S.510, 516 (1994) (treating Court of Appeals decision as "relevant authority" that must be considered as part of qualifiedimmunity enquiry). Although the Sixth Circuit was concerned, and rightly so, that disparate decisions in variousCircuits might leave the law insufficiently certain even on apoint widely considered, such a circumstance may be takeninto account in deciding whether the warning is fair enough,without any need for a categorical rule that decisions of theCourts of Appeals and other courts are inadequate as a matter of law to provide it.Nor have our decisions demanded precedents that appliedthe right at issue to a factual situation that is "fundamentallysimilar" at the level of specificity meant by the Sixth Circuitin using that phrase. To the contrary, we have upheld convictions under $ 241 or $ 242 despite notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and the cases thenbefore the Court, so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights. See United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 759,n. 17 (1966) (prior cases established right of interstate travel,520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN270 UNITED STATES v. LANIEROpinion of the Courtbut later case was the first to address the deprivation of thisright by private persons);United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S.385 (1944) (pre-Screws; prior cases established right to havelegitimate vote counted, whereas later case involved dilutionof legitimate votes through casting of fraudulent ballots);United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 321-324 (1941) (preScrews; prior cases established right to have vote counted ingeneral election, whereas later case involved primary elec-tion); see alsoScrews, 325 U. S., at 106 (stating that Classicmet the test being announced).But even putting these examples aside, we think that theSixth Circuit's "fundamentally similar" standard would leadtrial judges to demand a degree of certainty at once unnecessarily high and likely to beget much wrangling. This danger flows from the Court of Appeals' stated view, 73 F. 3d,at 1393, that due process under $ 242 demands more than the"clearly established" law required for a public officer to beheld civilly liable for a constitutional violation under $ 1983or Bivens, see Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635 (1987)(Bivens action); Davis v. Scherer, supra ($ 1983 action).This, we think, is error.In the civil sphere, we have explained that qualified immunity seeks to ensure that defendants "reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability," id., at195, by attaching liability only if "[t]he contours of the right[violated are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable officialwould understand that what he is doing violates that right,"Anderson, supra, at 640. So conceived, the object of the"clearly established" immunity standard is not different fromthat of "fair warning" as it relates to law "made specific" forthe purpose of validly applying $ 242. The fact that onehas a civil and the other a criminal law role is of no significance; both serve the same objective, and in effect the qualified immunity test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments)the same protection from civil liability and its consequences520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN271Cite as: 520 U. S. 259 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthat individuals have traditionally possessed in the face ofvague criminal statutes. To require something clearer than"clearly established" would, then, call for something beyond"fair warning."This is not to say, of course, that the single warning standard points to a single level of specificity sufficient in everyinstance. In some circumstances, as when an earlier caseexpressly leaves open whether a general rule applies tothe particular type of conduct at issue, a very high degreeof prior factual particularity may be necessary. See, e. g.,Mitchell v. Forsyth, supra, at 530-535, and n. 12. But general statements of the law are not inherently incapable ofgiving fair and clear warning, and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisionallaw may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct inquestion, even though "the very action in question has [not]previously been held unlawful," Anderson, supra, at 640.As Judge Daughtrey noted in her dissenting opinion in thiscase: " `The easiest cases don't even arise. There has neverbeen . . . a section 1983 case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery; it does not follow that if sucha case arose, the officials would be immune from damages[or criminal] liability.' " 73 F. 3d, at 1410 (quoting K. H.Through Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1990));see also Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972) (dueprocess requirements are not "designed to convert into aconstitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawingcriminal statutes both general enough to take into account avariety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to providefair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited");Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951) (holdingthat beating to obtain a confession plainly violates $ 242). Insum, as with civil liability under $ 1983 or Bivens, all thatcan usefully be said about criminal liability under $ 242 isthat it may be imposed for deprivation of a constitutionalright if, but only if, "in the light of pre-existing law the un520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 UNITED STATES v. LANIEROpinion of the Courtlawfulness [under the Constitution is] apparent," Anderson,supra, at 640. Where it is, the constitutional requirementof fair warning is satisfied.Because the Court of Appeals used the wrong gauge indeciding whether prior judicial decisions gave fair warningthat respondent's actions violated constitutional rights, wevacate the judgment and remand the case for application ofthe proper standard.7
