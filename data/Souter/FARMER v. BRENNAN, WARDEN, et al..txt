This case requires us to define the term"deliberate indifference," as we do by requiring a showingthat the official was subjectively aware of the risk.IThe dispute before us stems from a civil suit brought bypetitioner, Dee Farmer, alleging that respondents, federalprison officials, violated the Eighth Amendment by their de-liberate indifference to petitioner's safety. Petitioner, whois serving a federal sentence for credit card fraud, has beendiagnosed by medical personnel of the Bureau of Prisons asa transsexual, one who has "[a] rare psychiatric disorder inwhich a person feels persistently uncomfortable about his orher anatomical sex," and who typically seeks medical treat-ment, including hormonal therapy and surgery, to bringabout a permanent sex change. American Medical Associa-tion, Encyclopedia of Medicine 1006 (1989); see also AmericanPsychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders 74-75 (3d rev. ed. 1987). For severalyears before being convicted and sentenced in 1986 at theage of 18, petitioner, who is biologically male, wore women'sclothing (as petitioner did at the 1986 trial), underwent es-trogen therapy, received silicone breast implants, and submitted to unsuccessful "black market" testicle-removal sur-gery. See Farmer v. Haas, 990 F. 2d 319, 320 (CA7 1993).Petitioner's precise appearance in prison is unclear from therecord before us, but petitioner claims to have continued hormonal treatment while incarcerated by using drugs smug-gled into prison, and apparently wears clothing in a femininemanner, as by displaying a shirt "off one shoulder," App.112. The parties agree that petitioner "projects femininecharacteristics." Id., at 51, 74.The practice of federal prison authorities is to incarceratepreoperative transsexuals with prisoners of like biologicalsex, seeFarmer v. Haas, supra, at 320, and over time author-ities housed petitioner in several federal facilities, sometimes511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:26 PAGES OPINPGT830 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtin the general male prison population but more often in seg-regation. While there is no dispute that petitioner was segregated at least several times because of violations of prisonrules, neither is it disputed that in at least one penitentiarypetitioner was segregated because of safety concerns. SeeFarmer v. Carlson, 685 F. Supp. 1335, 1342 (MD Pa. 1988).On March 9, 1989, petitioner was transferred for disciplinary reasons from the Federal Correctional Institute in Ox-ford, Wisconsin (FCI-Oxford), to the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana (USP-Terre Haute). Thoughthe record before us is unclear about the security designations of the two prisons in 1989, penitentiaries are typicallyhigher security facilities that house more troublesome prisoners than federal correctional institutes. See generallyFederal Bureau of Prisons, Facilities 1990. After an initialstay in administrative segregation, petitioner was placed inthe USP-Terre Haute general population. Petitioner voicedno objection to any prison official about the transfer to thepenitentiary or to placement in its general population.Within two weeks, according to petitioner's allegations, petitioner was beaten and raped by another inmate in petitioner's cell. Several days later, after petitioner claims to havereported the incident, officials returned petitioner to segregation to await, according to respondents, a hearing aboutpetitioner's HIV-positive status.Acting without counsel, petitioner then filed a Bivens complaint, alleging a violation of the Eighth Amendment. SeeBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388(1971); Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980). As defendants,petitioner named respondents: the warden of USP-TerreHaute and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (sued onlyin their official capacities); the warden of FCI-Oxford and acase manager there; and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons North Central Region Office and an official in that office(sued in their official and personal capacities). As lateramended, the complaint alleged that respondents either511US3 Unit: $U64 [11-04-99 07:49:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN831Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courttransferred petitioner to USP-Terre Haute or placed peti-tioner in its general population despite knowledge that thepenitentiary had a violent environment and a history of in-mate assaults, and despite knowledge that petitioner, as atranssexual who "projects feminine characteristics," wouldbe particularly vulnerable to sexual attack by some USPTerre Haute inmates. This allegedly amounted to a deliber-ately indifferent failure to protect petitioner's safety, andthus to a violation of petitioner's Eighth Amendment rights.Petitioner sought compensatory and punitive damages, andan injunction barring future confinement in any penitentiary,including USP-Terre Haute.1Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment sup-ported by several affidavits, to which petitioner respondedwith an opposing affidavit and a cross-motion for summaryjudgment; petitioner also invoked Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), asking the court to delay its ruling until re-spondents had complied with petitioner's pending request forproduction of documents. Respondents then moved for aprotective order staying discovery until resolution of theissue of qualified immunity, raised in respondents' summaryjudgment motion.Without ruling on respondents' request to stay discovery,the District Court denied petitioner's Rule 56(f) motion andgranted summary judgment to respondents, concluding thatthere had been no deliberate indifference to petitioner'ssafety. The failure of prison officials to prevent inmate as-saults violates the Eighth Amendment, the court stated, onlyif prison officials were "reckless in a criminal sense," mean-ing that they had "actual knowledge" of a potential danger. App. 124. Respondents, however, lacked the requisite1 Petitioner also sought an order requiring the Bureau of Prisons toplace petitioner in a "co-correctional facility" (i. e., one separately housingmale and female prisoners but allowing coeducational programming). Petitioner tells us, however, that the Bureau no longer operates such facilities,and petitioner apparently no longer seeks this relief.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT832 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtknowledge, the court found. "[Petitioner] never expressedany concern for his safety to any of [respondents]. Since[respondents] had no knowledge of any potential danger to[petitioner], they were not deliberately indifferent to hissafety." Ibid.The United States Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit summarily affirmed without opinion. We grantedcertiorari, 510 U. S. 811 (1993), because Courts of Appealshad adopted inconsistent tests for "deliberate indifference."Compare, for example,McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d 344,348 (CA7 1991) (holding that "deliberate indifference" requires a "subjective standard of recklessness"), cert. denied,503 U. S. 907 (1992), withYoung v. Quinlan, 960 F. 2d 351,360-361 (CA3 1992) ("[A] prison official is deliberately indifferent when he knows or should have known of a sufficientlyserious danger to an inmate").IIAThe Constitution "does not mandate comfortable prisons,"Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 349 (1981), but neitherdoes it permit inhumane ones, and it is now settled that "thetreatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditionsunder which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under theEighth Amendment," Helling, 509 U. S., at 31. In its pro-hibition of "cruel and unusual punishments," the EighthAmendment places restraints on prison officials, who maynot, for example, use excessive physical force against prisoners. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). TheAmendment also imposes duties on these officials, who mustprovide humane conditions of confinement; prison officialsmust ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing,shelter, and medical care, and must "take reasonable meas-ures to guarantee the safety of the inmates," Hudson v.Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 526-527 (1984). See Helling, supra,511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT833Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtat 31-32; Washington v. Harper, 494 U.

S. 86, 101 (1958)(plurality opinion)). Being violently assaulted in prison issimply not "part of the penalty that criminal offenders payfor their offenses against society." Rhodes, supra, at 347.It is not, however, every injury suffered by one prisonerat the hands of another that translates into constitutionalliability for prison officials responsible for the victim's safety.Our cases have held that a prison official violates the EighthAmendment only when two requirements are met. First,the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, "sufficiently serious," Wilson, supra, at 298; see also Hudson v. McMillian,supra, at 5; a prison official's act or omission must result inthe denial of "the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities," Rhodes, supra, at 347. For a claim (like the one here)based on a failure to prevent harm, the inmate must showthat he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantialrisk of serious harm. See Helling, supra, at 35.3The second requirement follows from the principle that"only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment." Wilson, 501 U. S., at 297(internal quotation marks, emphasis, and citations omitted).To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, aprison official must have a "sufficiently culpable state ofmind." Ibid.; see also id., at 302-303; Hudson v. McMillian, supra, at 8. In prison-conditions cases that state ofmind is one of "deliberate indifference" to inmate health orsafety, Wilson, supra, at 302-303; see also Helling, supra, at34-35; Hudson v. McMillian, supra, at 5; Estelle, supra, at106, a standard the parties agree governs the claim in thiscase. The parties disagree, however, on the proper test fordeliberate indifference, which we must therefore undertaketo define.3 At what point a risk of inmate assault becomes sufficiently substantialfor Eighth Amendment purposes is a question this case does not present,and we do not address it.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT835Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the CourtB1Although we have never paused to explain the meaning ofthe term "deliberate indifference," the case law is instructive. The term first appeared in the United States Reportsin Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S., at 104, and its use there showsthat deliberate indifference describes a state of mind moreblameworthy than negligence. In considering the inmate'sclaim in Estelle that inadequate prison medical care violatedthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, we distinguished "deliberate indifference to serious medical needs ofprisoners," ibid., from "negligen[ce] in diagnosing or treatinga medical condition," id., at 106, holding that only the formerviolates the Clause. We have since read Estelle for theproposition that Eighth Amendment liability requires "morethan ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner's interests orsafety." Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319 (1986).While Estelle establishes that deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence, the cases arealso clear that it is satisfied by something less than acts oromissions for the very purpose of causing harm or withknowledge that harm will result. That point underlies theruling that "application of the deliberate indifference standard is inappropriate" in one class of prison cases: when "officials stand accused of using excessive physical force." Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S., at 6-7; see also Whitley, supra,at 320. In such situations, where the decisions of prison officials are typically made " `in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance,' " Hudson v.McMillian, supra, at 6 (quoting Whitley, supra, at 320), anEighth Amendment claimant must show more than "indifference," deliberate or otherwise. The claimant must showthat officials applied force "maliciously and sadistically forthe very purpose of causing harm," 503 U. S., at 6 (internalquotation marks and citations omitted), or, as the Court also511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT836 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtput it, that officials used force with "a knowing willingnessthat [harm] occur," id., at 7 (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted). This standard of purposeful or knowingconduct is not, however, necessary to satisfy the mens rearequirement of deliberate indifference for claims challengingconditions of confinement; "the very high state of mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison conditionscases."Wilson, supra, at 302-303.With deliberate indifference lying somewhere between thepoles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledgeat the other, the Courts of Appeals have routinely equateddeliberate indifference with recklessness.4 See, e. g., LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F. 2d 1526, 1535 (CA11 1993); Manaritev. Springfield, 957 F. 2d 953, 957 (CA1 1992); Redman v.County of San Diego, 942 F. 2d 1435, 1443 (CA9 1991); McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d, at 347; Miltier v. Beorn, 896F. 2d 848, 851-852 (CA4 1990); Martin v. White, 742 F. 2d469, 474 (CA8 1984); see alsoSpringfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S.257, 269 (1987) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It is, indeed, fairto say that acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is theequivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.That does not, however, fully answer the pending questionabout the level of culpability deliberate indifference entails,for the term recklessness is not self-defining. The civil lawgenerally calls a person reckless who acts or (if the personhas a duty to act) fails to act in the face of an unjustifiablyhigh risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that itshould be known. See Prosser and Keeton $ 34, pp. 213-214;Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 500 (1965). The criminal4 Between the poles lies "gross negligence" too, but the term is a "nebulous" one, in practice typically meaning little different from recklessnessas generally understood in the civil law (which we discuss later in thetext). See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser andKeeton on Law of Torts $ 34, p. 212 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosserand Keeton).511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT837Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlaw, however, generally permits a finding of recklessnessonly when a person disregards a risk of harm of which he isaware. See R. Perkins & R. Boyce, Criminal Law 850-851(3d ed. 1982); J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law115-116, 120, 128 (2d ed. 1960) (hereinafter Hall); AmericanLaw Institute, Model Penal Code $ 2.02(2)(c), and Comment3 (1985); but see Commonwealth v. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165,175-178 (1884) (Holmes, J.) (adopting an objective approachto criminal recklessness). The standards proposed by theparties in this case track the two approaches (though theparties do not put it that way): petitioner asks us to definedeliberate indifference as what we have called civil-law recklessness,5 and respondents urge us to adopt an approach consistent with recklessness in the criminal law.6We reject petitioner's invitation to adopt an objective testfor deliberate indifference. We hold instead that a prisonofficial cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendmentfor denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk toinmate health or safety; the official must both be aware offacts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also drawthe inference. This approach comports best with the text ofthe Amendment as our cases have interpreted it. TheEighth Amendment does not outlaw cruel and unusual "conditions"; it outlaws cruel and unusual "punishments." Anact or omission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significantrisk of harm might well be something society wishes to dis5 See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (suggesting that a prison official isdeliberately indifferent if he "knew facts which rendered an unreasonablerisk obvious; under such circumstances, the defendant should have knownof the risk and will be charged with such knowledge as a matter of law");see also Brief for Petitioner 20-21.6 See Brief for Respondents 16 (asserting that deliberate indifferencerequires that a prison "official must know of the risk of harm to which aninmate is exposed").511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT838 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtcourage, and if harm does result society might well wish toassure compensation. The common law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objectivebasis. See Prosser and Keeton $$ 2, 34, pp. 6, 213-214; seealso Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2671-2680;United States v. Muniz, 374 U. S. 150 (1963). But an offi-cial's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should haveperceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, can-not under our cases be condemned as the infliction ofpunishment.InWilson v. Seiter, we rejected a reading of the EighthAmendment that would allow liability to be imposed onprison officials solely because of the presence of objectivelyinhumane prison conditions. See 501 U. S., at 299-302. Aswe explained there, our "cases mandate inquiry into a prisonofficial's state of mind when it is claimed that the official hasinflicted cruel and unusual punishment." Id., at 299. Although "state of mind," like "intent," is an ambiguous termthat can encompass objectively defined levels of blameworthiness, see 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive CriminalLaw $$ 3.4, 3.5, pp. 296-300, 313-314 (1986) (hereinafter LaFave & Scott); United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404(1980), it was no accident that we said in Wilson and repeated in later cases that Eighth Amendment suits againstprison officials must satisfy a "subjective" requirement. SeeWilson, supra, at 298; see also Helling, 509 U. S., at 35;Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S., at 8. It is true, as petitioner points out, that Wilson cited with approval Court ofAppeals decisions applying an objective test for deliberateindifference to claims based on prison officials' failure to prevent inmate assaults. See 501 U. S., at 303 (citing CortesQuinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F. 2d, at 560; and Morgan v. District of Columbia, 824 F. 2d 1049, 1057-1058(CADC 1987)). But Wilson cited those cases for the proposition that the deliberate indifference standard applies to allprison-conditions claims, not to undo its holding that the511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT839Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the CourtEighth Amendment has a "subjective component." 501U. S., at 298. Petitioner's purely objective test for deliberate indifference is simply incompatible with Wilson's holding.To be sure, the reasons for focusing on what a defendant'smental attitude actually was (or is), rather than what itshould have been (or should be), differ in the Eighth Amendment context from that of the criminal law. Here, a subjec-tive approach isolates those who inflict punishment; there, itisolates those against whom punishment should be inflicted.But the result is the same: to act recklessly in either settinga person must "consciously disregar[d]" a substantial risk ofserious harm. Model Penal Code $ 2.02(2)(c).At oral argument, the Deputy Solicitor General advisedagainst frank adoption of a criminal-law mens rea requirement, contending that it could encourage triers of fact to findEighth Amendment liability only if they concluded that prisonofficials acted like criminals. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40. We think this concern is misdirected. Bivens actionsagainst federal prison officials (and their 42 U. S. C. $ 1983counterparts against state officials) are civil in character, anda court should no more allude to the criminal law when en-forcing the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause thanwhen applying the Free Speech and Press Clauses, wherewe have also adopted a subjective approach to recklessness.See Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton,491 U. S. 657, 688 (1989) (holding that the standard for "reckless disregard" for the truth in a defamation action by a pub-lic figure "is a subjective one," requiring that "the defendantin fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publi-cation," or that "the defendant actually had a high degree ofawareness of . . . probable falsity") (internal quotation marksand citations omitted).7 That said, subjective recklessnessas used in the criminal law is a familiar and workable stand7 Appropriate allusions to the criminal law would, of course, be properduring criminal prosecutions under, for example, 18 U. S. C. $ 242, whichsets criminal penalties for deprivations of rights under color of law.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT840 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtard that is consistent with the Cruel and Unusual Punish-ments Clause as interpreted in our cases, and we adopt itas the test for "deliberate indifference" under the EighthAmendment.2Our decision that Eighth Amendment liability requiresconsciousness of a risk is thus based on the Constitution andour cases, not merely on a parsing of the phrase "deliberateindifference." And we do not reject petitioner's argumentsfor a thoroughly objective approach to deliberate indiffer-ence without recognizing that on the crucial point (whethera prison official must know of a risk, or whether it sufficesthat he should know) the term does not speak with certainty.Use of "deliberate," for example, arguably requires nothingmore than an act (or omission) of indifference to a seriousrisk that is voluntary, not accidental. Cf. Estelle, 429 U. S.,at 105 (distinguishing "deliberate indifference" from "accident" or "inadverten[ce]"). And even if "deliberate" is bet-ter read as implying knowledge of a risk, the concept ofconstructive knowledge is familiar enough that the term "de-liberate indifference" would not, of its own force, preclude ascheme that conclusively presumed awareness from a risk'sobviousness.Because "deliberate indifference" is a judicial gloss, ap-pearing neither in the Constitution nor in a statute, we couldnot accept petitioner's argument that the test for "deliberateindifference" described inCanton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378(1989), must necessarily govern here. In Canton, interpret-ing Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, we held that a municipality can be liable for failure to train its employees whenthe municipality's failure shows "a deliberate indifference tothe rights of its inhabitants." 489 U. S., at 389 (internalquotation marks omitted). In speaking to the meaning ofthe term, we said that "it may happen that in light of theduties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT841Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtmore or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacyso likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said tohave been deliberately indifferent to the need." Id., at 390;see also id., at 390, n. 10 (elaborating). Justice O'Connor'sseparate opinion for three Justices agreed with the Court's"obvious[ness]" test and observed that liability is appropriatewhen policymakers are "on actual or constructive notice" ofthe need to train, id., at 396 (opinion concurring in part anddissenting in part). It would be hard to describe the Canton understanding of deliberate indifference, permitting liability to be premised on obviousness or constructive notice,as anything but objective.Canton's objective standard, however, is not an appropriate test for determining the liability of prison officialsunder the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in our cases.Section 1983, which merely provides a cause of action, "contains no state-of-mind requirement independent of that necessary to state a violation of the underlying constitutionalright." Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 330 (1986). Andwhile deliberate indifference serves under the EighthAmendment to ensure that only inflictions of punishmentcarry liability, see Wilson, 501 U. S., at 299-300, the "termwas used in the Canton case for the quite different purposeof identifying the threshold for holding a city responsible forthe constitutional torts committed by its inadequatelytrained agents," Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 124(1992), a purpose the Canton Court found satisfied by a testpermitting liability when a municipality disregards "obvious" needs. Needless to say, moreover, considerable conceptual difficulty would attend any search for the subjectivestate of mind of a governmental entity, as distinct from thatof a governmental official. For these reasons, we cannot accept petitioner's argument that Canton compels the conclu511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT842 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtsion here that a prison official who was unaware of a substan-tial risk of harm to an inmate may nevertheless be held liableunder the Eighth Amendment if the risk was obvious and areasonable prison official would have noticed it.We are no more persuaded by petitioner's argument that,without an objective test for deliberate indifference, prisonofficials will be free to ignore obvious dangers to inmates.Under the test we adopt today, an Eighth Amendment claim-ant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to actbelieving that harm actually would befall an inmate; it isenough that the official acted or failed to act despite hisknowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm. Cf. 1 C.Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law $ 27, p. 141 (14th ed. 1978);Hall 115. We doubt that a subjective approach will presentprison officials with any serious motivation "to take refugein the zone between `ignorance of obvious risks' and `actualknowledge of risks.' " Brief for Petitioner 27. Whether aprison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantialrisk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in theusual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence,cf. Hall 118 (cautioning against "confusing a mental statewith the proof of its existence"), and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk fromthe very fact that the risk was obvious. Cf. LaFave & Scott$ 3.7, p. 335 ("[I]f the risk is obvious, so that a reasonableman would realize it, we might well infer that [the defendant]did in fact realize it; but the inference cannot be conclusive,for we know that people are not always conscious of whatreasonable people would be conscious of "). For example, ifan Eighth Amendment plaintiff presents evidence showingthat a substantial risk of inmate attacks was "longstanding,pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted by prisonofficials in the past, and the circumstances suggest that thedefendant-official being sued had been exposed to information concerning the risk and thus `must have known' aboutit, then such evidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT843Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtfact to find that the defendant-official had actual knowledgeof the risk." Brief for Respondents 22.8Nor may a prison official escape liability for deliberate in-difference by showing that, while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk to inmate safety, he did not know thatthe complainant was especially likely to be assaulted by thespecific prisoner who eventually committed the assault.The question under the Eighth Amendment is whetherprison officials, acting with deliberate indifference, exposeda prisoner to a sufficiently substantial "risk of serious damage to his future health," Helling, 509 U. S., at 35, and it doesnot matter whether the risk comes from a single source ormultiple sources, any more than it matters whether a pris-oner faces an excessive risk of attack for reasons personal tohim or because all prisoners in his situation face such a risk.See Brief for Respondents 15 (stating that a prisoner canestablish exposure to a sufficiently serious risk of harm "byshowing that he belongs to an identifiable group of prisonerswho are frequently singled out for violent attack by otherinmates"). If, for example, prison officials were aware thatinmate "rape was so common and uncontrolled that some po-tential victims dared not sleep [but] instead . . . would leave8 While the obviousness of a risk is not conclusive and a prison officialmay show that the obvious escaped him, see infra, at 844, he would notescape liability if the evidence showed that he merely refused to verifyunderlying facts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist (as when aprison official is aware of a high probability of facts indicating that oneprisoner has planned an attack on another but resists opportunities toobtain final confirmation; or when a prison official knows that some diseases are communicable and that a single needle is being used to administer flu shots to prisoners but refuses to listen to a subordinate who hestrongly suspects will attempt to explain the associated risk of transmitting disease). When instructing juries in deliberate indifference caseswith such issues of proof, courts should be careful to ensure that the requirement of subjective culpability is not lost. It is not enough merely tofind that a reasonable person would have known, or that the defendantshould have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT844 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courttheir beds and spend the night clinging to the bars nearestthe guards' station,"Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 681-682,n. 3 (1978), it would obviously be irrelevant to liability thatthe officials could not guess beforehand precisely who wouldattack whom. Cf. Helling, supra, at 33 (observing that theEighth Amendment requires a remedy for exposure of in-mates to "infectious maladies" such as hepatitis and venerealdisease "even though the possible infection might not affectall of those exposed");Commonwealth v. Welansky, 316Mass. 383, 55 N. E. 2d 902 (1944) (affirming conviction formanslaughter under a law requiring reckless or wanton conduct of a nightclub owner who failed to protect patrons froma fire, even though the owner did not know in advance whowould light the match that ignited the fire or which patronswould lose their lives); State v. Julius, 185 W. Va. 422, 431-432, 408 S. E. 2d 1, 10-11 (1991) (holding that a defendantmay be held criminally liable for injury to an unanticipatedvictim).Because, however, prison officials who lacked knowledgeof a risk cannot be said to have inflicted punishment, it remains open to the officials to prove that they were unawareeven of an obvious risk to inmate health or safety. That atrier of fact may infer knowledge from the obvious, in otherwords, does not mean that it must do so. Prison officialscharged with deliberate indifference might show, for example, that they did not know of the underlying facts indicatinga sufficiently substantial danger and that they were therefore unaware of a danger, or that they knew the underlyingfacts but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to whichthe facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.In addition, prison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free fromliability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if theharm ultimately was not averted. A prison official's dutyunder the Eighth Amendment is to ensure " `reasonablesafety,' " Helling, supra, at 33; see also Washington v. Har511US3 Unit: $U64 [11-04-99 07:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN845Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtper, 494 U. S., at 225; Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S., at 526-527, a standard that incorporates due regard for prison officials' "unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safecustody under humane conditions,"Spain v. Procunier, 600F. 2d 189, 193 (CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.); see also Bell v.Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547-548, 562 (1979). Whether oneputs it in terms of duty or deliberate indifference, prisonofficials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.We address, finally, petitioner's argument that a subjectivedeliberate indifference test will unjustly require prisoners tosuffer physical injury before obtaining court-ordered correction of objectively inhumane prison conditions. "It would,"indeed, "be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainlyproved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prisonon the ground that nothing yet had happened to them." Helling, supra, at 33. But nothing in the test we adopt todayclashes with that common sense. Petitioner's argument isflawed for the simple reason that "[o]ne does not have toawait the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S.553, 593 (1923). Consistently with this principle, a subjective approach to deliberate indifference does not require aprisoner seeking "a remedy for unsafe conditions [to] awaita tragic event [such as an] actua[l] assaul[t] before obtainingrelief." Helling, supra, at 33-34.In a suit such as petitioner's, insofar as it seeks injunctiverelief to prevent a substantial risk of serious injury fromripening into actual harm, "the subjective factor, deliberateindifference, should be determined in light of the prison authorities' current attitudes and conduct," Helling, supra, at36: their attitudes and conduct at the time suit is broughtand persisting thereafter. An inmate seeking an injunctionon the ground that there is "a contemporary violation of anature likely to continue," United States v. Oregon StateMedical Soc., 343 U. S. 326, 333 (1952), must adequately511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT846 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the Courtplead such a violation; to survive summary judgment, hemust come forward with evidence from which it can be inferred that the defendant-officials were at the time suit wasfiled, and are at the time of summary judgment, knowinglyand unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerablerisk of harm, and that they will continue to do so; and finallyto establish eligibility for an injunction, the inmate mustdemonstrate the continuance of that disregard during the remainder of the litigation and into the future. In so doing,the inmate may rely, in the district court's discretion, on developments that postdate the pleadings and pretrial motions,as the defendants may rely on such developments to establish that the inmate is not entitled to an injunction.9 SeeFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d); 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $$ 1504-1510, pp. 177-211 (2d ed. 1990). If the court finds the Eighth Amendment's subjective and objective requirements satisfied, itmay grant appropriate injunctive relief. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S., at 685-688, and n. 9 (upholding order designedto halt "an ongoing violation" in prison conditions that included extreme overcrowding, rampant violence, insufficientfood, and unsanitary conditions). Of course, a district courtshould approach issuance of injunctive orders with the usual9 If, for example, the evidence before a district court establishes that aninmate faces an objectively intolerable risk of serious injury, the defendants could not plausibly persist in claiming lack of awareness, any morethan prison officials who state during the litigation that they will not takereasonable measures to abate an intolerable risk of which they are awarecould claim to be subjectively blameless for purposes of the EighthAmendment, and in deciding whether an inmate has established a continuing constitutional violation a district court may take such developmentsinto account. At the same time, even prison officials who had a subjectively culpable state of mind when the lawsuit was filed could preventissuance of an injunction by proving, during the litigation, that they wereno longer unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk ofharm and that they would not revert to their obduracy upon cessation ofthe litigation.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT847Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcaution, see Bell v. Wolfish, supra, at 562 (warning courtsagainst becoming "enmeshed in the minutiae of prison operations"), and may, for example, exercise its discretion if appropriate by giving prison officials time to rectify the situationbefore issuing an injunction.That prison officials' "current attitudes and conduct," Helling, 509 U. S., at 36, must be assessed in an action for injunctive relief does not mean, of course, that inmates are free tobypass adequate internal prison procedures and bring theirhealth and safety concerns directly to court. "An appeal tothe equity jurisdiction conferred on federal district courts isan appeal to the sound discretion which guides the determinations of courts of equity," Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320U. S. 228, 235 (1943), and any litigant making such an appealmust show that the intervention of equity is required.When a prison inmate seeks injunctive relief, a court neednot ignore the inmate's failure to take advantage of adequateprison procedures, and an inmate who needlessly bypassessuch procedures may properly be compelled to pursue them.Cf. 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e (authorizing district courts in $ 1983actions to require inmates to exhaust "such plain, speedy,and effective administrative remedies as are available").Even apart from the demands of equity, an inmate would bewell advised to take advantage of internal prison proceduresfor resolving inmate grievances. When those proceduresproduce results, they will typically do so faster than judicialprocesses can. And even when they do not bring constitutionally required changes, the inmate's task in court willobviously be much easier.Accordingly, we reject petitioner's arguments and holdthat a prison official may be held liable under the EighthAmendment for denying humane conditions of confinementonly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk ofserious harm and disregards that risk by failing to takereasonable measures to abate it.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT848 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the CourtIIIAAgainst this backdrop, we consider whether the DistrictCourt's disposition of petitioner's complaint, summarily affirmed without briefing by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, comports with Eighth Amendment principles.We conclude that the appropriate course is to remand.In granting summary judgment to respondents on theground that petitioner had failed to satisfy the EighthAmendment's subjective requirement, the District Courtmay have placed decisive weight on petitioner's failure tonotify respondents of a risk of harm. That petitioner "neverexpressed any concern for his safety to any of [respondents],"App. 124, was the only evidence the District Court cited forits conclusion that there was no genuine dispute about respondents' assertion that they "had no knowledge of anypotential danger to [petitioner]," ibid. But with respect toeach of petitioner's claims, for damages and for injunctiverelief, the failure to give advance notice is not dispositive.Petitioner may establish respondents' awareness by relianceon any relevant evidence. See supra, at 842.The summary judgment record does not so clearly establish respondents' entitlement to judgment as a matter of lawon the issue of subjective knowledge that we can simply assume the absence of error below. For example, in papersfiled in opposition to respondents' summary-judgmentmotion, petitioner pointed to respondents' admission thatpetitioner is a "non-violent" transsexual who, because ofpetitioner's "youth and feminine appearance" is "likely toexperience a great deal of sexual pressure" in prison. App.50-51, 73-74. And petitioner recounted a statement by oneof the respondents, then warden of the penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, who told petitioner that there was "ahigh probability that [petitioner] could not safely functionat USP-Lewisburg," id., at 109, an incident confirmed in a511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT849Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Opinion of the Courtpublished District Court opinion. See Farmer v. Carlson,685 F. Supp., at 1342; see also ibid. ("Clearly, placing plaintiff,a twenty-one year old transsexual, into the general popula-tion at [USP-]Lewisburg, a [high-]security institution, couldpose a significant threat to internal security in general andto plaintiff in particular").We cannot, moreover, be certain that additional evidenceis unavailable to petitioner because in denying petitioner'sRule 56(f ) motion for additional discovery the District Courtmay have acted on a mistaken belief that petitioner's failureto notify was dispositive. Petitioner asserted in papers accompanying the Rule 56(f) motion that the requested documents would show that "each defendant had knowledge thatUSP-Terre Haute was and is, a violent institution with ahistory of sexual assault, stabbings, etc., [and that] each de-fendant showed reckless disregard for my safety by designating me to said institution knowing that I would be sexu-ally assaulted." App. 105-106. But in denying the Rule56(f ) motion, the District Court stated that the requesteddocuments were "not shown by plaintiff to be necessary tooppose defendants' motion for summary judgment," id., at121, a statement consistent with the erroneous view that fail-ure to notify was fatal to petitioner's complaint.Because the District Court may have mistakenly thoughtthat advance notification was a necessary element of anEighth Amendment failure-to-protect claim, we think itproper to remand for reconsideration of petitioner's Rule56(f ) motion and, whether additional discovery is permittedor not, for application of the Eighth Amendment principlesexplained above.1010 The District Court's opinion is open to the reading that it required notonly advance notification of a substantial risk of assault, but also advancenotification of a substantial risk of assault posed by a particular fellowprisoner. See App. 124 (referring to "a specific threat to [a prisoner's]safety"). The Eighth Amendment, however, imposes no such requirement. See supra, at 842-844.511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT850 FARMER v. BRENNANOpinion of the CourtBRespondents urge us to affirm for reasons not relied onbelow, but neither of their contentions is so clearly correctas to justify affirmance.With respect to petitioner's damages claim, respondentsargue that the officials sued in their individual capacities (of-ficials at FCI-Oxford and the Bureau of Prisons North Central Region office) were alleged to be liable only for theirtransfer of petitioner from FCI-Oxford to USP-Terre Haute,whereas petitioner "nowhere alleges any reason for believingthat these officials, who had no direct responsibility for administering the Terre Haute institution, would have hadknowledge of conditions within that institution regardingdanger to transsexual inmates." Brief for Respondents 27-28. But petitioner's Rule 56(f ) motion alleged just that.Though respondents suggest here that petitioner offered nofactual basis for that assertion, that is not a ground on whichthey chose to oppose petitioner's Rule 56(f) motion belowand, in any event, is a matter for the exercise of the DistrictCourt's judgment, not ours. Finally, to the extent respond-ents seek affirmance here on the ground that officials atFCI-Oxford and the Bureau of Prisons regional office had nopower to control prisoner placement at Terre Haute, the record gives at least a suggestion to the contrary; the affidavitof one respondent, the warden of USP-Terre Haute, statesthat after having been at USP-Terre Haute for about amonth petitioner was placed in administrative segregation"pursuant to directive from the North Central Regional Of-fice" and a "request . . . by staff at FCI-Oxford." App. 94-95. Accordingly, though we do not reject respondents' argu-ments about petitioner's claim for damages, the record doesnot permit us to accept them as a basis for affirmance whenthey were not relied upon below. Respondents are free todevelop this line of argument on remand.With respect to petitioner's claim for injunctive relief, respondents argued in their merits brief that the claim was511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT851Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)Blackmun, J., concurring"foreclosed by [petitioner's] assignment to administrative de-tention status because of his high-risk HIV-positive condition, . . . as well as by the absence of any allegation . . . thatadministrative detention status poses any continuing threatof physical injury to him." Brief for Respondents 28-29.At oral argument, however, the Deputy Solicitor General informed us that petitioner was no longer in administrativedetention, having been placed in the general prison population of a medium-security prison. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26.He suggested that affirmance was nevertheless proper because "there is no present threat" that petitioner will beplaced in a setting where he would face a "continuing threatof physical injury," id., at 26, but this argument turns onfacts about the likelihood of a transfer that the DistrictCourt is far better placed to evaluate than we are. We leaveit to respondents to present this point on remand.IVThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
