Keene Corporation has been sued by thousands of plaintiffs alleging injury from exposure to asbestos fibers anddust released from products made by Keene and by a company it acquired. In trying to recoup some of the money itwas paying to litigate and settle the cases, Keene filed twocomplaints against the United States in the Court of FederalClaims.1 When it filed each complaint, however, Keene hada similar claim pending against the Government in anothercourt. We hold that 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 consequently precludes Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over Keene'sactions and affirm the dismissal of its complaints.IThrough its subsidiary Keene Building Products Corporation, Keene manufactured and sold thermal insulation andacoustical products containing asbestos, as did a companyit acquired in 1968, Baldwin-Ehret-Hill, Inc.

S. 200 (1993)Opinion of the Court1970's, plaintiffs began suing Keene in tort, alleging injuryor death from exposure to asbestos fibers. In a typical casefiled against Keene and other defendants in the DistrictCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania,Miller v.Johns-Manville Products Corp., No. 78-1283E, the plaintiffalleged, on behalf of the estate of one Dzon, that the dece-dent had died of lung cancer caused by asbestos fibers anddust inhaled during employment in 1943 and 1944. In June1979, Keene filed a third-party complaint against the UnitedStates, alleging that any asbestos products to which Dzonwas exposed had been supplied to the Government in accordance with specifications set out in Government contracts,and seeking indemnification or contribution from the Government for any damages Keene might have to pay theplaintiff. This third-party action ended, however, in May1980, when the District Court granted Keene's motion forvoluntary dismissal of its complaint.In the meantime, in December 1979, with the Miller thirdparty action still pending, Keene filed the first of its twocomplaints in issue here, seeking damages from the UnitedStates in the Court of Federal Claims "for any amountswhich have been, or which may be recovered from Keene bythe claimants, by settlement or judgment." Keene Corp. v.United States, No. 579-79C (Keene I), App. to Pet. for Cert.H15. The "claimants" are defined as the plaintiffs in themore than 2,500 lawsuits filed against Keene "by personsalleging personal injury or death from inhalation of asbestosfibers contained in thermal insulation products" manufactured or sold by Keene or its subsidiaries. Id., at H3.Keene alleges conformance with Government specificationsin the inclusion of asbestos within the thermal insulationproducts Keene supplied to Government shipyards and otherprojects funded or controlled by the Government, and Keenefurther claims that the Government even sold it some ofthe asbestos fiber used in its products.

S. C. $ 1491(a)(1).Keene's next move against the Government came the following month when it filed a 23-count complaint in the Dis-trict Court for the Southern District of New York.KeeneCorp. v. United States, No. 80-CIV-0401(GLG). The plead-ings tracked, almost verbatim, the lengthy factual allegations of Keene I, but the action was recast in terms of varioustort theories, again seeking damages for any amounts paidby Keene to asbestos claimants. Keene also added a takingsclaim for the Government's allegedly improper recoupment,under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA),5 U. S. C. $ 8132, of money paid by Keene to claimants covered by the Act. For this, Keene sought restitution of "theamounts of money which have been, or which may be, recouped by [the United States] from claimants from judgments and settlements paid by Keene," App. 37, as well asan injunction against the Government's collection of FECArefunds thereafter. This suit suffered dismissal in September 1981, on the basis of sovereign immunity, which the courtheld unaffected by any waiver found in the Federal TortClaims Act, the Suits in Admiralty Act, and the Public Vessels Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Keene Corp. v.United States, 700 F. 2d 836 (CA2 1983), and we denied certiorari, 464 U. S. 864 (1983).Only five days before the Southern District's dismissal ofthat omnibus action, Keene returned to the Court of FederalClaims with the second of the complaints in issue here.Keene Corp. v. United States, No. 585-81C (Keene II). Although this one, too, repeats many of the factual allegationsof Keene I, it adopts one of the theories raised in the Southern District case, seeking payment for "the amounts ofmoney that [the United States] has recouped" under FECAfrom asbestos claimants paid by Keene.

Again, the recoupments are said to betakings of Keene's property without due process and justcompensation, contrary to the Fifth Amendment. See 28U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1) (covering, inter alia, certain claims"founded . . . upon the Constitution").After the Court of Federal Claims raised the present jurisdictional issue sua sponte in similar actions brought byJohns-Manville, the Government invoked 28 U. S. C. $ 1500in moving to dismiss both Keene I and Keene II, as well aslike actions by five other asbestos product manufacturers.With trial imminent in the Johns-Manville cases, the Courtof Federal Claims initially granted the motion to dismissonly as to them. Keene Corp. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct.197 (1987). That decision was affirmed on appeal, JohnsManville Corp. v. United States, 855 F. 2d 1556 (CA Fed.1988) (per curiam), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1066 (1989), andthe Court of Federal Claims then entered dismissals inKeene I and Keene II, among other cases, finding that whenKeene had filed both Keene I and Keene II, it had the sameclaims pending in other courts. 17 Cl. Ct. 146 (1989).While a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitreversed on the ground that $ 1500 was inapplicable becauseno other claim had been pending elsewhere when the Courtof Federal Claims entertained and acted upon the Government's motion to dismiss, UNR Industries, Inc. v. UnitedStates, 911 F. 2d 654 (1990), the Court of Appeals, en banc,subsequently vacated the panel opinion, 926 F. 2d 1109(1990), and affirmed the trial court's dismissals, 962 F. 2d1013 (1992). We granted certiorari. 506 U. S. 939 (1992).IIThe authority cited for dismissing Keene's complaints forwant of jurisdiction was 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 (1988 ed., Supp. IV):"The United States Court of Federal Claims shall nothave jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT206 KEENE CORP. v.

Whenthese cotton claimants had difficulty meeting the statutorycondition that they must have given no aid or comfort toparticipants in the rebellion, see $ 3 of the Act, they re-sorted to separate suits in other courts seeking compensation not from the Government as such but from federal offi-cials, and not under the statutory cause of action but on torttheories such as conversion. See Schwartz, Section 1500 ofthe Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 574-580 (1967).It was these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress toprohibit anyone from filing or prosecuting in the Court ofClaims "any claim . . . for or in respect to which he . . . shallhave commenced and has pending" an action in any othercourt against an officer or agent of the United States. Actof June 25, 1868, ch. 71, $ 8, 15 Stat. 77. The statute haslong outlived the cotton claimants, having been incorporated2 When Keene filed its complaints, $ 1500 referred to the "Court ofClaims" rather than the "United States Court of Federal Claims." See28 U. S. C. $ 1500 (1976 ed.). Section 1500 has since been amended twice,first to substitute "United States Claims Court" for "Court of Claims,"Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, $ 133(e)(1), 96 Stat. 40, andthen to substitute "Court of Federal Claims" for "Claims Court," Courtof Federal Claims Technical and Procedural Improvements Act of 1992,$ 902(a), 106 Stat. 4516.

C. $ 1500.Keene argues it was error for the courts below to applythe statute by focusing on facts as of the time Keene filedits complaints (instead of the time of the trial court's rulingon the motion to dismiss) and to ignore differences said toexist between the Court of Federal Claims actions and thosefiled in the District Courts. Neither assignment of errorwill stand. ACongress has the constitutional authority to define the ju-risdiction of the lower federal courts, seeFinley v. UnitedStates, 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989), and, once the lines aredrawn, "limits upon federal jurisdiction . . . must be neitherdisregarded nor evaded," Owen Equipment & Erection Co.v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 374 (1978). In $ 1500, Congresshas employed its power to provide that the Court of FederalClaims "shall not have jurisdiction" over a claim, "for or inrespect to which" the plaintiff "has [a suit or process] pend-ing" in any other court. In applying the jurisdictional barhere by looking to the facts existing when Keene filed eachof its complaints, the Court of Federal Claims followed thelongstanding principle that "the jurisdiction of the Courtdepends upon the state of things at the time of the actionbrought." Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824)(Marshall, C. J.); seeGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 69 (1987) (opinionofScalia, J.); St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red CabCo., 303 U. S. 283, 289-290 (1938); Minneapolis & St. LouisR. Co. v. Peoria & P. U. R. Co., 270 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtKeene would have us dispense with the rule here. Brieffor Petitioner 33. Assuming that we could,3 however, Keenegives us nothing to convince us that we should. Keene ar-gues that if $ 1500 spoke of "jurisdiction to render judgment" instead of "jurisdiction" pure and simple, the phrasewould "all but preclude" application of the time-of-filing rule.Id., at 34. But, without deciding whether such a change ofterms would carry such significance, we have only to saythat $ 1500 speaks of "jurisdiction," without more, whereassome nearby sections of Title 28 use the longer phrase. Thisfact only underscores our duty to refrain from reading aphrase into the statute when Congress has left it out." `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one sec-tion of a statute but omits it in another . . . , it is generallypresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely inthe disparate inclusion or exclusion.' " Russello v. UnitedStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (citation omitted).Keene's next appeal, to statutory history, is no more availing. The immediate predecessor of $ 1500, $ 154 of the Judi-cial Code of 1911, provided that "[n]o person shall file orprosecute in the Court of Claims . . . any claim for or inrespect to which he . . . has pending in any other court anysuit or process . . . ." Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, $ 154,36 Stat. 1138. With this express prohibition against filingclaims for which another suit was pending, there could, ofcourse, have been no doubt that at least a time-of-filing ruleapplied. See Shapiro v. United States, 168 F. 2d 625, 626(CA3 1948) ($ 154 "forbids the filing" of a Little Tucker Act3 On this score, Keene cites Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain,490 U. S. 826 (1989), for the proposition that the Court can rely on practical considerations to create exceptions to the time-of-filing rule. Brieffor Petitioner 35-36.

Although Keene urges us to see significance in thedeletion of the "file or prosecute" language in favor of thecurrent reference to "jurisdiction" in the comprehensiverevision of the Judicial Code completed in 1948, we do notpresume that the revision worked a change in the underlyingsubstantive law "unless an intent to make such [a] chang[e]is clearly expressed."Fourco Glass Co. v.

S. 151, 162 (1972).On the point in issue here, there is no such clear expressionin the shift from specific language to the general, and theReviser's Note to $ 1500 indicates nothing more than achange "in phraseology," see H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong.,1st Sess., A140 (1947); cf.Newman-Green, supra, at 831.Since Keene, indeed, comes up with nothing to the contrary,we read the statute as continuing to bar jurisdiction over theclaim of a plaintiff who, upon filing, has an action pending inany other court "for or in respect to" the same claim.44 We do not decide whether the statute also continues to bar a plaintifffrom prosecuting a claim in the Court of Federal Claims while he haspending a later-filed suit in another court "for or in respect to" the sameclaim. Cf. Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, 170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343F. 2d 943 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 976 (1966). As the dissentingjudge noted below, this case does not raise that issue. UNR Industries,508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT210 KEENE CORP. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBThe statutory notion of comparable claims is more elusive.By precluding jurisdiction over the claim of a plaintiff witha suit pending in another court "for or in respect to" thesame claim, $ 1500 requires a comparison between the claimsraised in the Court of Federal Claims and in the other law-suit. The exact nature of the things to be compared is notilluminated, however, by the awkward formulation of $ 1500.Nor does it advance the ball very far to recognize from thestatute's later reference to "the cause of action alleged insuch suit or process," that the term "claim" is used heresynonymously with "cause of action," see Black's Law Dic-tionary 247 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "claim" as "cause of action"), since, as both parties admit, "cause of action," like"claim," can carry a variety of meanings. See Brief for Petitioner 18; Brief for United States 15; see also JohnsManville Corp., 855 F. 2d, at 1560.Fortunately, though, we can turn to earlier readings ofthe word "claim" as it appears in this statute. The phrase"any claim . . . for or in respect to which" has remainedunchanged since the statute was first adopted in 1868, seeAct of June 25, 1868, ch. 71, $ 8, 15 Stat. 77, and prior encounters with $ 154 of the Judicial Code of 1911, the immediate predecessor to $ 1500, shed some light on the issue.Corona Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537 (1924), wasan action brought against the United States in the Court ofClaims, seeking compensation for coal requisitioned by theGovernment. Before bringing its appeal to this Court, theplaintiff sued the President's agent in Federal DistrictCourt, "the causes of action therein set forth being the sameas that set forth in the [Court of Claims] case."Id., at 539.After noting that the causes of action "arose out of " thesame factual setting, we applied $ 154 and dismissed theInc. v.

Id., at 539-540. Later that year, we had the caseof a plaintiff seeking a writ of mandamus to stop the Courtof Claims from reinstating a suit it had dismissed earlier,without prejudice, on the plaintiff 's own motion. Ex parteSkinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86 (1924). Skinner & Eddyhad sued the United States in the Court of Claims for nearly$17.5 million; "[t]he largest item of the claim was for antici-pated profits on 25 vessels" covered by an order, later canceled, by the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation.Id., at 91. After the Court of Claims had granted its motionto dismiss, Skinner & Eddy sued the Emergency Fleet Corporation in state court "on substantially the same causesof action as those sued for in the Court of Claims."Id.,at 92. There was no question that the factual predicate ofeach action was the same, except for the omission from thestate court action of any demand for anticipated profits, thuslimiting the damages sought to $9.1 million. We issued thewrit of mandamus, holding that $ 154 prevented the Courtof Claims from exercising jurisdiction over the claims it haddismissed earlier, given the intervening state court suit.5A few years later, the Court of Claims settled a key ques-tion only foreshadowed by Skinner & Eddy: whether $ 154applied when the Court of Claims action and the "other"suit proceeded under different legal theories. In BritishAmerican Tobacco Co. v. United States, 89 Ct. Cl. 438 (1939)(per curiam), after the plaintiff had surrendered his goldbullion to the Government (in compliance with executive or-ders and regulations that took this country off the gold5 We have had one other encounter with this statute, in Matson Navigation Co. v. United States, 284 U. S. 352 (1932), where we relied on theplain words of $ 154 to hold that the statute did not apply where the Courtof Claims plaintiff had brought suit in another court against the UnitedStates, rather than against an agent of the United States, for the sameclaim. When Congress reenacted the statute in 1948, it added the phrase"against the United States" to close this loophole. See Act of June 25,1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 942; Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, 855F. 2d 1556, 1566-1567, and n. 15 (CA Fed. 1988).508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT212 KEENE CORP. v.

Earlier the same day, the plaintiff had filed a suit in FederalDistrict Court "for the recovery of the same amount for thesame gold bullion surrendered." Id., at 439. The Court ofClaims observed that "[t]he only distinction between the twosuits instituted in the District Court and in this court is thatthe action in the District Court was made to sound in tortand the action in this court was alleged on contract." Id.,at 440. Because the two actions were based on the sameoperative facts, the court dismissed the Court of Claimsaction for lack of jurisdiction, finding it to be "clear that theword `claim,' as used in section 154, . . . has no reference tothe legal theory upon which a claimant seeks to enforce hisdemand." Ibid.These precedents demonstrate that under the immediatepredecessor of $ 1500, the comparison of the two cases forpurposes of possible dismissal would turn on whether theplaintiff 's other suit was based on substantially the sameoperative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least ifthere was some overlap in the relief requested.6 See Skin-ner & Eddy, supra; Corona Coal, supra. That the two actions were based on different legal theories did not matter.See British American Tobacco, supra. Since Keene hasgiven us no reason to doubt that these cases representedsettled law when Congress reenacted the "claim for or inrespect to which" language in 1948, see 62 Stat. 942, weapply the presumption that Congress was aware of theseearlier judicial interpretations and, in effect, adopted them.Lorillard v.

S. 200 (1993)Opinion of the Courtnot apply when there is no "settled judicial construction" atthe time of reenactment). The decision inBritish American Tobacco strikes us, moreover, as a sensible reading ofthe statute, for it honors Congress's decision to limit Courtof Federal Claims jurisdiction not only as to claims "for . . .which" the plaintiff has sued in another court, but as tothose "in respect to which" he has sued elsewhere as well.While the latter language does not set the limits of claimidentity with any precision, it does make it clear that Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered useless by anarrow concept of identity providing a correspondingly liberal opportunity to maintain two suits arising from the samefactual foundation.Keene nonetheless argues, for the first time in its meritsbrief,7 that "[a] claim brought outside the [Court of FederalClaims] is `for or in respect to' a claim in the [Court ofFederal Claims only] when claim-splitting law would treatthem as the same--i. e., require them to be joined in a singlesuit--if the two claims were both brought against the UnitedStates." Brief for Petitioner 20. Under this theory, $ 1500would not apply to a Court of Federal Claims plaintiff unlesshis suit pending in the other court rested on a legal theorythat could have been pleaded (as Keene's could not havebeen) in the Court of Federal Claims. But this reinterpretation of $ 1500 is bound to fail, not because novelty isalways fatal in the construction of an old statute, but because the novel proposition in Keene's suggested readingwould have rendered the statute useless, in all or nearlyall instances, to effect the very object it was originally en7 Keene argued in its petition for certiorari that the claim it raised inits third-party action in Miller was not based on the same facts as itscomplaint in Keene I. Keene did not press this argument after wegranted the writ, and, in any event, we see no reason to disturb therulings to the contrary by both courts below. See 962 F. 2d, at 1024("[W]e have no quarrel with the [Court of Federal Claims] determinationthat the underlying facts in Miller and Keene I are the same").508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT214 KEENE CORP. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtacted to accomplish. Keene fails to explain how the originalstatute would have applied to the cotton claimants, whosetort actions brought in other courts were beyond the juris-diction of the Court of Claims, just as tort cases are outsidethe jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims today.8Keene's theory was squarely rejected in British AmericanTobacco,9 and it must be rejected again this time.8 It is not that Keene has not tried to meet the objection. Keene assumes, contrary to the plain text, that the statute here is not jurisdictional, arguing instead that it was meant to supplement the formalistic19th-century concept of res judicata. According to Keene, res judicatawould not have barred a cotton claimant from instigating an action againsta federal officer who had acted for the Government, even though theclaimant had lost an otherwise identical action against the Governmentitself (and vice versa), the difference between the named defendants beingsignificant at that time. On the assumption that the statute eliminatednonidentity of parties defendant as a barrier to the application of res judicata, Keene then argues that causes of action were treated as identicalin those days if the same evidence was used to prove multiple claims. Onthis view of the law, Keene concludes, multiple cotton claims would havebeen treated as the same, and the statute would have barred the Courtof Claims suit, just as Congress intended. Reply Brief for Petitioner 7.Even on its own terms, however, this argument fails, for the Court ofClaims in 1868 had no jurisdiction to try a tort action for conversion,however similar it might have been for res judicata purposes to the statutory action within that court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, under Keene'sclaim-splitting theory, the conversion action would not have been treatedas identical with the statutory action; each would have survived, leavingthe statute useless to solve the problem Congress was addressing.9 Keene claims that its view represents "well-established law," citingAllied Materials & Equipment Co. v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl. 714 (1976)(per curiam), and Casman v. United States, supra. Brief for Petitioner15. In Casman, however, the plaintiff was seeking completely differentrelief in the Court of Claims and the District Court, and later cases haveread Casman as limited to that situation.

Huson, 404U. S. 97 (1971). Brief for Petitioner 42-43. Even assuming that this call for "pure prospectivity," see James B.Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 544 (1991)(opinion of Souter, J.), might fairly fall within the questionspresented,10 there is no need to address it because, as theGovernment points out, Keene's claims were dismissed underwell-settled law.The Court of Appeals, to be sure, announced that it wasoverruling five cases: Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U. S.976 (1966); Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956);Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, FSB v.

Andwhile Keene contends that nothing less than these repudiations of precedent would have sufficed to dismiss its suits,we read the five cases as supporting neither Keene's positionthat the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over itscases nor its plea for pure prospectivity of the overrulingdecision.Johns-Manville Corp., supra, at 1562-1563; Los Angeles Shipbuilding &Drydock Corp. v.

Accordingly,Keene's appeal to "well-established law" is misplaced.10 The questions on which we granted certiorari contain no direct mention of prospectivity, see Pet. for Cert. i, although Keene did argue in itspetition that Tecon Engineers should be overruled only prospectively, seePet. for Cert. 13, and the Court of Appeals did consider, and reject, theargument that its ruling should only be prospectively applied, see 962F. 2d, at 1025.508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT216 KEENE CORP. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn applying $ 1500 to the facts of this case, we find itunnecessary to consider, much less repudiate, the "judiciallycreated exceptions" to $ 1500 found in Tecon Engineers, Casman, and Boston Five. See 962 F. 2d, at 1021. Tecon Engineers held that a later filed action in another court doesnot oust the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over anearlier filed complaint; our decision turns on Keene's earlierfiled District Court actions, and even Keene now concedesit to be "unnecessary for the Court to address the Teconquestion" in ruling on the dismissal of Keene's claims.Reply Brief for Petitioner 14, n. 14; see n. 4, supra. TheCasman court recognized an exception (followed in BostonFive) for plaintiffs who seek distinctly different types of relief in the two courts; here, Keene had sought monetaryrelief in each of the cases pending when it filed the complaints seeking monetary relief in Keene I and Keene II.See n. 6, supra. In Brown, the Court of Claims reinstateda claim after the plaintiff 's District Court action for thesame claim had been dismissed, on the grounds that theother suit was "no longer `pending' " and had itself beendismissed because jurisdiction lay exclusively in the Courtof Claims. 175 Ct. Cl., at 348, 358 F. 2d, at 1004. Brown'snarrow reasoning, that $ 1500 does not apply after dismissalof an earlier filed District Court suit brought in derogationof the Court of Federal Claims's exclusive jurisdiction, wasechoed in Hossein, a per curiam order citing neither Brown,nor any other case, on this point.11 See also Boston Five,supra, at 139-140 (following Hossein). Since Keene's District Court actions were not, and could not have been, dis11 We note that both the Brown and Hossein courts failed to considerthe possibility that the District Court, in such a situation, could transferthe case to the Court of Federal Claims under a statute first adopted in1960.

It may well be, as Keene argues,that $ 1500 operates in some circumstances to deprive plaintiffs of an opportunity to assert rights that Congress hasgenerally made available to them "under the complex legaland jurisdictional schemes that govern claims against theGovernment." Brief for Petitioner 15. The trial judge inthis case was not the first to call this statute anachronistic,see 12 Cl. Ct., at 205; A. C. Seeman, Inc. v. United States,5 Cl. Ct. 386, 389 (1984), and there is a good argument that,even when first enacted, the statute did not actually performthe preclusion function emphasized by its sponsor, seeSchwartz, 55 Geo. L. J., at 579. But the "proper theater"for such arguments, as we told another disappointed claimant many years ago, "is the halls of Congress, for thatbranch of the government has limited the jurisdiction of theCourt of Claims." 14 Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 45 (1873).We enjoy no "liberty to add an exception . . . to remove12 Brown and Hossein do not survive our ruling today, for they ignoredthe time-of-filing rule discussed in Part II-A, supra.13 Keene also asks the Court to "make clear that, if Keene refiles thesame claims, equitable tolling would be available to eliminate any limitations bar." Brief for Petitioner 45. But any response to this requestwould be an advisory opinion.14 A recent attempt to repeal $ 1500 failed in Congress.

C. $ 1500 does not require theCourt of Federal Claims to dismiss an action against theUnited States simply because another suit on the same claimwas once, but is no longer, pending in district court.Rather, the plaintiff may continue to pursue his claim solong as there is no other suit pending when the Court ofFederal Claims decides the motion to dismiss. Neither thetext nor the history of the statute demands more of theplaintiff than that he make an "election either to leave theCourt of Claims or to leave the other courts" at that time.1Section 1500 is not itself a grant of jurisdiction to theCourt of Federal Claims. That function is performed byother sections of the Judicial Code immediately preceding$ 1500, which give the court "jurisdiction to render judgmentupon any claim against the United States founded eitherupon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regu1 Senator Edmunds explained the purpose of the provision that is now$ 1500, as follows:" `The object of this amendment is to put to their election that large classof persons having cotton claims particularly, who have sued the Secretaryof the Treasury and the other agents of the Government in more than ahundred suits that are now pending, scattered over the country here andthere, and who are here at the same time endeavoring to prosecute theirclaims, and have filed them in the Court of Claims, so that after they putthe Government to the expense of beating them once in a court of lawthey can turn around and try the whole question in the Court of Claims.The object is to put that class of persons to their election either to leavethe Court of Claims or to leave the other courts.

See also $$ 1497 and 1499(granting jurisdiction to "render judgment" over otherclaims).2 Section 1500, by contrast, "takes away jurisdiction even though the subject matter of the suit may appropriately be before the Claims Court." UNR Industries,Inc. v. United States, 962 F. 2d 1013, 1028 (CA Fed. 1992)(Plager, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). It is only reasonable to assume that the "jurisdiction" $ 1500 takes awayis the same as the "jurisdiction" surrounding Code provisionsbestow: the jurisdiction to enter judgment.The text of $ 1500 simply provides that the Court of Federal Claims " `shall not have jurisdiction' over a claim `. . .which' the plaintiff . . . `has pending' in any other court . . . ."Ante, at 207 (emphasis added). Accordingly, so long as aplaintiff has pending another suit in another court, the Courtof Federal Claims may not adjudicate the plaintiff 's claim,even though its subject matter would otherwise bring itwithin the court's jurisdiction. The Government may invoke this exception by putting such a plaintiff to his choice:either "leave the other courts," n. 1, supra, or forgo furtherproceedings in the Court of Federal Claims. If the plaintiffdeclines to leave the other courts, then the Court of Federal Claims is without jurisdiction to proceed with the casebefore it, though it may retain the case on its docket pendingdisposition of the other action. Hossein v. United States,218 Ct. Cl. 727 (1978). But if the plaintiff does dismiss hisother action, then the Court of Federal Claims is free to decide his case. Section 1500 was so construed over a quarter2 Sections immediately following $ 1500 use similar language with respect to other types of claims. See 28 U. S.

Cl. 343,358 F. 2d 1002 (1966),3 and I see no reason to interpret it nowas a broader prohibition on pretrial proceedings.It is true that an earlier version of $ 1500 provided that aclaimant may not "file or prosecute" an action in the Courtof Federal Claims while another action is pending. Ante,at 208. That original text, however, did not prescribe theconsequences of a prohibited filing. In view of the fact thatthe text did not then mention the word "jurisdiction," thereis nothing to suggest that pendency of another action wouldhave to be treated as a defect warranting automatic dismissal.4 Instead, given the plain statement of the legislation's sponsor that he intended to force an election of remedies before trial, see n. 1, supra, this earlier language isfairly construed as giving the Government the right to avoidduplicative litigation by having the Court of Claims action3 "At the present time, therefore, the only claim for just compensationpending in a court is that stated in the plaintiffs' petition in this court."In these circumstances we grant the motions for rehearing, vacate ourprior order dismissing the petition, and now deny the defendant's motionto dismiss. Our earlier order of dismissal was predicated on the fact thatthe other `claim remains pending in the said District Court.' That is nolonger true, and the claim is no longer `pending in any other court.' Inthis situation, we do not believe that 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 requires us todeprive plaintiffs of the only forum they have in which to test their demand for just compensation." Brown, 175 Ct.

Of course it could be argued that logically they had that scope,but common sense would revolt." Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.

S. 200 (1993)Stevens, J., dissentingdismissed if the plaintiff chose not to abandon the claimpending elsewhere.In any event, when the text of $ 1500 was revised in 1948,Congress removed the prohibition on filing. The Courtnevertheless assumes that the section should be construedas originally drafted, because Congress did not intend the1948 revisions of the Judicial Code to make substantivechanges in the law. See ante, at 209. In fact, the 1948 revision did work a significant substantive change by enlargingthe class of suits subject to dismissal to include suits againstthe United States, as well as suits against its agents. Seeante, at 212, n. 6; Matson Navigation Co. v. United States,284 U. S. 352, 355-356 (1932); see also Schwartz, Section1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against theGovernment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 579-580(1967). But even if it were the case that Congress intendedno substantive change in 1948, that would mean only thatthe present text is the best evidence of what the law hasalways meant, and that the language of the prior versioncannot be relied upon to support a different reading.In my judgment, the Court of Claims properly construed$ 1500 in 1966 when it held that the provision merely requires claimants to choose between alternative pendingclaims before proceeding to trial. See Brown, 175 Ct. Cl.,at 348, 358 F. 2d, at 1004. The statute limits the power ofthe Court of Federal Claims to render judgments, and thusthe ability of a plaintiff to prosecute simultaneous actionsagainst the Government, but it does not prevent the Courtof Federal Claims from allowing a case to remain on itsdocket until the claimant has made the required election.Even if I did not agree with this interpretation of $ 1500,however, I would nevertheless endorse it here, as litigantshave a right to rely on a longstanding and reasoned judicialconstruction of an important statute that Congress has notseen fit to alter. See McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT222 KEENE CORP. v. UNITED STATESStevens, J., dissenting350, 376-377 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing cases).Whether or not "novelty is always fatal in the constructionof an old statute," ante, at 213, the overruling of a consistentline of precedent raises equitable concerns that should notbe disregarded.5Admittedly, this is a badly drafted statute. Viewedagainst a legal landscape that has changed dramatically sincethe days of the cotton claimants, seeante, at 206-207, it doesnot lend itself easily to sensible construction. Moreover,the Court's interpretation of $ 1500 today may have the salu-tary effect of hastening its repeal or amendment. Nevertheless, a reading that is faithful not only to the statutory textbut also to the statute's stated purpose is surely preferableto the harsh result the Court endorses here. Accordingly,I respectfully dissent.5 The Court seeks to minimize these concerns by suggesting that theBrown line of cases on which petitioner relies would not in any eventapply here, because petitioner's District Court action was not dismissedon the grounds that it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court ofFederal Claims. Ante, at 216-217. In my view, Brown, and cases like it,do not warrant such a narrow reading, but stand instead for the broaderproposition that a former district court action, once dismissed, no longerbars adjudication in the Court of Federal Claims. See n. 2, supra; National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 274, 275-276(1985) (in case of concurrent jurisdiction, providing for automatic reinstatement of Court of Federal Claims action upon dismissal of districtcourt suit). That the Court of Appeals felt it necessary to overruleBrown on the facts of this case, see UNR Industries, 962 F. 2d, at 1022,suggests a similar understanding of Brown's scope.508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT223OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusSMITH v. UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuitNo. 91-8674. Argued March 23, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993After petitioner Smith offered to trade an automatic weapon to an undercover officer for cocaine, he was charged with numerous firearm anddrug trafficking offenses. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) requires the imposition of specified penalties if the defendant, "during and in relation to. . . [a] drug trafficking crime[,] uses . . . a firearm." In affirming Smith'sconviction and sentence, the Court of Appeals held that $ 924(c)(1)'s plainlanguage imposes no requirement that a firearm be "use[d]" as aweapon, but applies to any use of a gun that facilitates in any mannerthe commission of a drug offense.Held: A criminal who trades his firearm for drugs "uses" it "during andin relation to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime" within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1). Pp. 227-241.(a) Section 924's language and structure establish that exchanginga firearm for drugs may constitute "use" within $ 924(c)(1)'s meaning.Smith's handling of his gun falls squarely within the everyday meaningand dictionary definitions of "use." Had Congress intended $ 924(c)(1)to require proof that the defendant not only used his firearm but usedit in a specific manner--as a weapon--it could have so indicated inthe statute. However, Congress did not. The fact that the most familiar example of "us[ing] . . . a firearm" is "use" as a weapon does notmean that the phrase excludes all other ways in which a firearm mightbe used. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, even if the Courtwere to assume their relevance in the present context, do not supportthe dissent's narrow interpretation that "to use" a firearm can meanonly to use it for its intended purposes, such as firing and brandishing,since Guidelines Manual $ 2B3.1(b)(2) explicitly contemplates "othe[r]use[s]" that are not limited to the intended purposes identified by thedissent. The dissent's approach, moreover, would exclude the use ofa gun to pistol-whip a victim as the intended purpose of a gun is thatit be fired or brandished, not that it be used as a bludgeon. In addition,Congress affirmatively demonstrated that it meant to include transactions like Smith's as "us[ing] a firearm" within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1) by employing similar language in $ 924(d)(1), which subjectsto forfeiture any "firearm . . . intended to be used" in various listedoffenses. Many of the listed offenses involve "using" the firearm not as508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT224 SMITH v. UNITED STATESSyllabusa weapon but as an item of barter or commerce. Thus, even if$ 924(c)(1), as originally enacted, applied only to use of a firearm duringcrimes of violence, it is clear from the face of the statute that "use" isnot presently limited to use as a weapon, but is broad enough to coveruse for trade. Pp. 227-237.(b) Smith's use of his firearm was "during and in relation to" adrug trafficking crime. Smith does not, and cannot, deny that thealleged use occurred "during" such a crime. And there can be littledoubt that his use was "in relation to" the offense. That phrase has adictionary meaning of "with reference to" or "as regards" and, at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some purpose or effect withrespect to the drug crime. Thus, its presence or involvement cannotbe the result of accident or coincidence, and it at least must facilitate orhave the purpose of facilitating the drug offense. Here, the firearmwas an integral part of the drug transaction, which would not have beenpossible without it. There is no reason why Congress would not havewanted its language to cover this situation, since the introduction ofguns into drug transactions dramatically heightens the danger to society, whether the guns are used as a medium of exchange or as protectionfor the transactions or dealers. Pp. 237-239.(c) Smith's invocation of the rule of lenity is rejected. Imposing apostnarrower construction of $ 924(c)(1) than the one herein adoptedwould do violence not only to the statute's plain language and structure,but also to its purpose of addressing the heightened risk of violence anddeath that accompanies the introduction of firearms to drug traffickingoffenses.

[a] drug trafficking crime" within the meaning of 18U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). We hold that it does.IPetitioner John Angus Smith and his companion went fromTennessee to Florida to buy cocaine; they hoped to resellit at a profit. While in Florida, they met petitioner's ac-quaintance, Deborah Hoag. Hoag agreed to, and in fact did,purchase cocaine for petitioner. She then accompanied peti-tioner and his friend to her motel room, where they werejoined by a drug dealer. While Hoag listened, petitionerand the dealer discussed petitioner's MAC-10 firearm, whichhad been modified to operate as an automatic. The MAC-10apparently is a favorite among criminals. It is small andcompact, lightweight, and can be equipped with a silencer.Most important of all, it can be devastating: A fully automatic MAC-10 can fire more than 1,000 rounds per minute.The dealer expressed his interest in becoming the owner ofa MAC-10, and petitioner promised that he would discussselling the gun if his arrangement with another potentialbuyer fell through.Unfortunately for petitioner, Hoag had contacts not onlywith narcotics traffickers but also with law enforcement offi-cials. In fact, she was a confidential informant. Consistentwith her post, she informed the Broward County Sheriff 'sOffice of petitioner's activities. The Sheriff 's Office responded quickly, sending an undercover officer to Hoag 'smotel room. Several others were assigned to keep themotel under surveillance. Upon arriving at Hoag's motelroom, the undercover officer presented himself to petitioneras a pawnshop dealer. Petitioner, in turn, presented the of-ficer with a proposition: He had an automatic MAC-10 andsilencer with which he might be willing to part. Petitioner508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT226 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthen pulled the MAC-10 out of a black canvas bag andshowed it to the officer. The officer examined the gun andasked petitioner what he wanted for it. Rather than askingfor money, however, petitioner asked for drugs. He waswilling to trade his MAC-10, he said, for two ounces of cocaine. The officer told petitioner that he was just a pawn-shop dealer and did not distribute narcotics. Nonetheless,he indicated that he wanted the MAC-10 and would try toget the cocaine. The officer then left, promising to returnwithin an hour.Rather than seeking out cocaine as he had promised, theofficer returned to the Sheriff 's Office to arrange for petitioner's arrest. But petitioner was not content to wait. Theofficers who were conducting surveillance saw him leave themotel room carrying a gun bag; he then climbed into his vanand drove away. The officers reported petitioner's departure and began following him. When law enforcement authorities tried to stop petitioner, he led them on a high-speedchase. Petitioner eventually was apprehended.Petitioner, it turns out, was well armed. A search ofhis van revealed the MAC-10 weapon, a silencer, ammunition, and a "fast-feed" mechanism. In addition, the policefound a MAC-11 machine gun, a loaded .45 caliber pistol,and a .22 caliber pistol with a scope and homemade silencer.Petitioner also had a loaded 9 millimeter handgun in hiswaistband.A grand jury sitting in the District Court for the SouthernDistrict of Florida returned an indictment charging petitioner with, among other offenses, two drug traffickingcrimes--conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and attempt to possess cocaine with intent to distributein violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)(1), 846, and 18 U. S. C. $ 2.App. 3-9.

Andwhere, as here, the firearm is a "machinegun" or is fittedwith a silencer, the sentence is 30 years. See $ 924(c)(1)("[I]f the firearm is a machinegun, or is equipped with a firearm silencer," the sentence is "thirty years"); $ 921(a)(23),26 U. S. C. $ 5845(b) (term "machinegun" includes automaticweapons). The jury convicted petitioner on all counts.On appeal, petitioner argued that $ 924(c)(1)'s penalty forusing a firearm during and in relation to a drug traffickingoffense covers only situations in which the firearm is used asa weapon. According to petitioner, the provision does notextend to defendants who use a firearm solely as a mediumof exchange or for barter. The Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit disagreed. 957 F. 2d 835 (1992). Theplain language of the statute, the court explained, imposesno requirement that the firearm be used as a weapon. Instead, any use of "the weapon to facilitate in any mannerthe commission of the offense" suffices. Id., at 837 (internalquotation marks omitted).Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit decided this case, theCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit arrivedat the same conclusion.United States v. Harris, 294 U. S.App. D. C. 300, 315-316, 959 F. 2d 246, 261-262 (per curiam),cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992). In United States v.Phelps, 877 F. 2d 28 (1989), however, the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit held that trading a gun in a drug-related transaction could not constitute use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense within themeaning of $ 924(c)(1). We granted certiorari to resolve theconflict among the Circuits. 506 U. S. 814 (1992). We nowaffirm.IISection 924(c)(1) requires the imposition of specified penal-ties if the defendant, "during and in relation to any crime ofviolence or drug trafficking crime[,] uses or carries a fire-arm." By its terms, the statute requires the prosecution to508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT228 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtmake two showings. First, the prosecution must demon-strate that the defendant "use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm." Second, it must prove that the use or carrying was "during andin relation to" a "crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."APetitioner argues that exchanging a firearm for drugs doesnot constitute "use" of the firearm within the meaning of thestatute. He points out that nothing in the record indicatesthat he fired the MAC-10, threatened anyone with it, or employed it for self-protection. In essence, petitioner arguesthat he cannot be said to have "use[d]" a firearm unless heused it as a weapon, since that is how firearms most oftenare used. See 957 F. 2d, at 837 (firearm often facilitatesdrug offenses by protecting drugs or protecting or embold-ening the defendant). Of course, $ 924(c)(1) is not limited tothose cases in which a gun is used; it applies with equal forcewhenever a gun is "carrie[d]." In this case, however, theindictment alleged only that petitioner "use[d]" the MAC-10.App. 4. Accordingly, we do not consider whether the evidence might support the conclusion that petitioner carriedthe MAC-10 within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1). Instead weconfine our discussion to what the parties view as the dispos-itive issue in this case: whether trading a firearm for drugscan constitute "use" of the firearm within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1).When a word is not defined by statute, we normally con-strue it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning. SeePerrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (words notdefined in statute should be given ordinary or common meaning). Accord, post, at 242 ("In the search for statutory mean-ing, we give nontechnical words and phrases their ordinarymeaning"). Surely petitioner's treatment of his MAC-10can be described as "use" within the everyday meaning ofthat term. Petitioner "used" his MAC-10 in an attempt toobtain drugs by offering to trade it for cocaine. Webster's508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdefines "to use" as "[t]o convert to one's service" or "to em-ploy." Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed.1950). Black's Law Dictionary contains a similar definition:"[t]o make use of; to convert to one's service; to employ; toavail oneself of; to utilize; to carry out a purpose or actionby means of." Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990).Indeed, over 100 years ago we gave the word "use" the samegloss, indicating that it means " `to employ' " or " `to deriveservice from.' "Astor v. Merritt, 111 U. S. 202, 213 (1884).Petitioner's handling of the MAC-10 in this case fallssquarely within those definitions. By attempting to tradehis MAC-10 for the drugs, he "used" or "employed" it as anitem of barter to obtain cocaine; he "derived service" from itbecause it was going to bring him the very drugs he sought.In petitioner's view, $ 924(c)(1) should require proof notonly that the defendant used the firearm, but also that heused it as a weapon. But the words "as a weapon" appearnowhere in the statute. Rather, $ 924(c)(1)'s languagesweeps broadly, punishing any "us[e]" of a firearm, so longas the use is "during and in relation to" a drug traffickingoffense. See United States v. Long, 284 U. S. App. D. C. 405,409-410, 905 F. 2d 1572, 1576-1577 (Thomas, J.) (although notwithout limits, the word "use" is "expansive" and extendseven to situations where the gun is not actively employed),cert. denied, 498 U. S. 948 (1990). Had Congress intendedthe narrow construction petitioner urges, it could have soindicated. It did not, and we decline to introduce that additional requirement on our own.Language, of course, cannot be interpreted apart from context. The meaning of a word that appears ambiguous ifviewed in isolation may become clear when the word is analyzed in light of the terms that surround it. Recognizingthis, petitioner and the dissent argue that the word "uses"has a somewhat reduced scope in $ 924(c)(1) because it appears alongside the word "firearm." Specifically, they contend that the average person on the street would not think508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT230 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtimmediately of a guns-for-drugs trade as an example of"us[ing] a firearm." Rather, that phrase normally evokes animage of the most familiar use to which a firearm is put--use as a weapon. Petitioner and the dissent therefore arguethat the statute excludes uses where the weapon is not firedor otherwise employed for its destructive capacity. Seepost, at 242-244. Indeed, relying on that argument--andwithout citation to authority--the dissent announces its own,restrictive definition of "use." "To use an instrumentality,"the dissent argues, "ordinarily means to use it for its in-tended purpose."Post, at 242.There is a significant flaw to this argument. It is onething to say that the ordinary meaning of "uses a firearm"includes using a firearm as a weapon, since that is the intended purpose of a firearm and the example of "use" thatmost immediately comes to mind. But it is quite another toconclude that, as a result, the phrase also excludes any otheruse. Certainly that conclusion does not follow from thephrase "uses . . . a firearm" itself. As the dictionary definitions and experience make clear, one can use a firearm in anumber of ways. That one example of "use" is the first tocome to mind when the phrase "uses . . . a firearm" is uttereddoes not preclude us from recognizing that there are other"uses" that qualify as well. In this case, it is both reasonable and normal to say that petitioner "used" his MAC-10 inhis drug trafficking offense by trading it for cocaine; the dissent does not contend otherwise. Ibid.The dissent's example of how one might "use" a cane,ibid., suffers from a similar flaw. To be sure, "use" as anadornment in a hallway is not the first "use" of a cane thatcomes to mind. But certainly it does not follow that theonly "use" to which a cane might be put is assisting one'sgrandfather in walking. Quite the opposite: The most infamous use of a cane in American history had nothing to dowith walking at all, see J. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom150 (1988) (describing the caning of Senator Sumner in the508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the CourtUnited States Senate in 1856); and the use of a cane as aninstrument of punishment was once so common that "tocane" has become a verb meaning "[t]o beat with a cane."Webster's New International Dictionary,supra, at 390. Inany event, the only question in this case is whether thephrase "uses . . . a firearm" in $ 924(c)(1) is most reasonablyread asexcluding the use of a firearm in a gun-for-drugstrade. The fact that the phrase clearly includes using afirearm to shoot someone, as the dissent contends, does notanswer it.The dissent relies on one authority, the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1992), as "reflect[ing]" its interpretation of the phrase "uses . . . a firearm." See post, at 243. But the Guidelines do not define"using a firearm" as using it for its intended purposes, whichthe dissent apparently assumes are limited to firing, brandishing, displaying, and possessing. In fact, if we entertainfor the moment the dubious assumption that the SentencingGuidelines are relevant in the present context, they supportthe opposite view. Section 2B3.1(b)(2), upon which the dissent relies, ibid., provides for increases in a defendant'soffense level, and therefore his sentence, if the offense involved a firearm. The extent of the adjustment varies according to the nature of the gun's involvement. There is aseven-point upward adjustment if the firearm "was discharged," $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(A); a six-point enhancement if a gunwas "otherwise used," $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added); anda five-point adjustment if the firearm was brandished, displayed, or possessed, $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). Unless the six-pointenhancement for "othe[r] use[s]" is mere surplusage, theremust be "uses" for a firearm other than its "intended purposes" of firing, brandishing, displaying, or possessing. Thedissent points out that there may be some uses that arenot firing or brandishing but constitute use as a weaponnonetheless. See post, at 243-244, n. 2. But nothing in$ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) suggests that the phrase "othe[r] use[s]"508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT232 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtmust be so limited. On the contrary, it is perfectly reason-able to construe $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) as including uses, such astrading and bludgeoning, that do not constitute use for thefirearm's "intended purpose."It is true that the Guidelines commentary defines " `[o]therwise used' " as conduct that falls short of " `discharg[ing]a firearm but [is] more than brandishing, displaying, orpossessing [it].' " Post, at 243 (quoting USSG $ 1B1.1, com-ment., n. 1(g)). That definition, however, simply reflectsthe peculiar hierarchy of culpability established in USSG$ 2B3.1(b)(2). It clarifies that between the most culpableconduct of discharging the firearm and less culpable actionssuch as "brandishing, displaying, or possessing" lies a category of "othe[r] use[s]" for which the Guidelines impose intermediate punishment. It does not by its terms exclude fromits scope trading, bludgeoning, or any other use beyond thefirearm's "intended purpose."We are not persuaded that our construction of the phrase"uses . . . a firearm" will produce anomalous applications.See post, at 242 (example of using a gun to scratch one'shead). As we already have noted, see supra, at 227-228,and will explain in greater detail later, infra, at 237-239,$ 924(c)(1) requires not only that the defendant "use" thefirearm, but also that he use it "during and in relation to"the drug trafficking crime. As a result, the defendant who"uses" a firearm to scratch his head, see post, at 242, or forsome other innocuous purpose, would avoid punishment forthat conduct altogether: Although scratching one's head witha gun might constitute "use," that action cannot support punishment under $ 924(c)(1) unless it facilitates or furthers thedrug crime; that the firearm served to relieve an itch is notenough. See infra, at 238 (phrase "in relation to" requires,at a minimum, that the use facilitate the crime). Such adefendant would escape the six-point enhancement providedin USSG $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) as well. As the Guidelines definition of "[o]therwise use[d]" makes clear, see USSG $ 1B1.1,508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT233Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcomment., n. 1(g), the six-point enhancement does not applyunless the use is "more than" brandishing. While pistolwhipping a victim with a firearm might be "more than" bran-dishing, scratching one's head is not.In any event, the "intended purpose" of a firearm is notthat it be used in any offensive manner whatever, but ratherthat it be used in a particular fashion--by firing it. Thedissent's contention therefore cannot be that the defendantmust use the firearm "as a weapon," but rather that he mustfire it or threaten to fire it, "as a gun." Under the dissent'sapproach, then, even the criminal who pistol-whips his victimhas not used a firearm within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1), forfirearms are intended to be fired or brandished, not used asbludgeons. It appears that the dissent similarly would limitthe scope of the "othe[r] use[s]" covered by USSG $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). The universal view of the courts of appeals, however, is directly to the contrary. No court of appeals everhas held that using a gun to pistol-whip a victim is anythingbut the "use" of a firearm; nor has any court ever held thattrading a firearm for drugs falls short of being the "use"thereof. But cf. Phelps, 877 F. 2d, at 30 (holding that trad-ing a gun for drugs is not use "in relation to" a drug traf-ficking offense).To the extent there is uncertainty about the scope of thephrase "uses . . . a firearm" in $ 924(c)(1), we believe the remainder of $ 924 appropriately sets it to rest. Just as a sin-gle word cannot be read in isolation, nor can a single provision of a statute. As we have recognized:"Statutory construction . . . is a holistic endeavor. Aprovision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is oftenclarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme--because the same terminology is used elsewhere in acontext that makes its meaning clear, or because onlyone of the permissible meanings produces a substantiveeffect that is compatible with the rest of the law."United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT234 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (cita-tions omitted).Here, Congress employed the words "use" and "firearm" to-gether not only in $ 924(c)(1), but also in $ 924(d)(1), whichdeals with forfeiture of firearms. See United States v. OneAssortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984) (discussingearlier version of the statute). Under $ 924(d)(1), any "fire-arm or ammunition intended to be used" in the various offenses listed in $ 924(d)(3) is subject to seizure and forfeiture.Consistent with petitioner's interpretation, $ 924(d)(3) listsoffenses in which guns might be used as offensive weapons.See $$ 924(d)(3)(A), (B) (weapons used in a crime of violenceor drug trafficking offense). But it also lists offenses inwhich the firearm isnot used as a weapon but instead as anitem of barter or commerce. For example, any gun intendedto be "used" in an interstate "transfer, s[ale], trade, gi[ft],transport, or deliver[y]" of a firearm prohibited under$ 922(a)(5) where there is a pattern of such activity, see$ 924(d)(3)(C), or in a federal offense involving "the exportation of firearms," $ 924(d)(3)(F), is subject to forfeiture. Infact, none of the offenses listed in four of the six subsectionsof $ 924(d)(3) involves the bellicose use of a firearm; each of-fense involves use as an item in commerce.* Thus, it is clear*Section 924(d)(3)(C) lists four offenses: unlicensed manufacture of orcommerce in firearms, in violation of $ 922(a)(1); unlicensed receipt of aweapon from outside the State, in violation of $ 922(a)(3); unlicensed transfer of a firearm to a resident of a different State, in violation of $ 922(a)(5);and delivery of a gun by a licensed entity to a resident of a State that isnot the licensee's, in violation of $ 922(b)(3). Section 924(d)(3)(D) mentionsonly one offense, the transfer or sale of a weapon to disqualified persons,such as fugitives from justice and felons, in violation of $ 922(d). Under$ 924(d)(3)(E), firearms are subject to forfeiture if they are intended to beused in any of five listed offenses: shipping stolen firearms, in violation of$ 922(i); receipt of stolen firearms, in violation of $ 922(j); importation offirearms, in violation of $ 922(l); shipment of a firearm by a felon, in violation of $ 922(n); and shipment or receipt of a firearm with intent to commita felony, in violation of $ 924(b). Finally, $ 924(d)(3)(F) subjects to forfeit508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfrom $ 924(d)(3) that one who transports, exports, sells, ortrades a firearm "uses" it within the meaning of $ 924(d)(1)--even though those actions do not involve using the firearmas a weapon. Unless we are to hold that using a firearm hasa different meaning in $ 924(c)(1) than it does in $ 924(d)--and clearly we should not,United Savings Assn., supra, at371--we must reject petitioner's narrow interpretation.The evident care with which Congress chose the languageof $ 924(d)(1) reinforces our conclusion in this regard. Although $ 924(d)(1) lists numerous firearm-related offensesthat render guns subject to forfeiture, Congress did not lumpall of those offenses together and require forfeiture solely ofguns "used" in a prohibited activity. Instead, it carefullyvaried the statutory language in accordance with the guns'relation to the offense. For example, with respect to somecrimes, the firearm is subject to forfeiture not only if it is"used," but also if it is "involved in" the offense. $ 924(d)(1).Examination of the offenses to which the "involved in" lan-guage applies reveals why Congress believed it necessary toinclude such an expansive term. One of the listed offenses,violation of $ 922(a)(6), is the making of a false statementmaterial to the lawfulness of a gun's transfer. Because mak-ing a material misstatement in order to acquire or sell a gunis not "use" of the gun even under the broadest definition ofthe word "use," Congress carefully expanded the statutorylanguage. As a result, a gun with respect to which a mate-rial misstatement is made is subject to forfeiture because,even though the gun is not "used" in the offense, it is "in-volved in" it. Congress, however, did not so expand the language for offenses in which firearms were "intended to beused," even though the firearms in many of those offensesfunction as items of commerce rather than as weapons. In-stead, Congress apparently was of the view that one coulduse a gun by trading it. In light of the common meaning ofure any firearm intended to be used in any offense that may be prosecutedin federal court if it involves the exportation of firearms.508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT236 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe word "use" and the structure and language of the statute,we are not in any position to disagree.The dissent suggests that our interpretation produces a"strange dichotomy" between "using" a firearm and "carrying" one. Post, at 246. We do not see why that is so. Justas a defendant may "use" a firearm within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1) by trading it for drugsor using it to shoot someone, so too would a defendant "carry" the firearm by keepingit on his person whether he intends to exchange it for cocaineor fire it in self-defense. The dichotomy arises, if at all, onlywhen one tries to extend the phrase " `uses . . . a firearm' "to any use " `for any purpose whatever.' " Ibid. For ourpurposes, it is sufficient to recognize that, because $ 924(d)(1)includes both using a firearm for trade and using a firearmas a weapon as "us[ing] a firearm," it is most reasonable toconstrue $ 924(c)(1) as encompassing both of those "uses" aswell.Finally, it is argued that $ 924(c)(1) originally dealt withuse of a firearm during crimes of violence; the provision concerning use of a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking offenses was added later. Ibid. From this, the dissent infers that "use" originally was limited to use of a gun"as a weapon." That the statute in its current form employsthe term "use" more broadly is unimportant, the dissentcontends, because the addition of the words " `drug trafficking crime' would have been a peculiar way to expand itsmeaning." Ibid. Even if we assume that Congress hadintended the term "use" to have a more limited scope whenit passed the original version of $ 924(c) in 1968, but seesupra, at 229-231, we believe it clear from the face of thestatute that the Congress that amended $ 924(c) in 1986 didnot. Rather, the 1986 Congress employed the term "use"expansively, covering both use as a weapon, as the dissentadmits, and use as an item of trade or barter, as an examination of $ 924(d) demonstrates. Because the phrase "uses . . . afirearm" is broad enough in ordinary usage to cover use of a508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT237Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfirearm as an item of barter or commerce, Congress was freein 1986 so to employ it. The language and structure of $ 924indicate that Congress did just that. Accordingly, we con-clude that using a firearm in a guns-for-drugs trade may constitute "us[ing] a firearm" within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1).BUsing a firearm, however, is not enough to subject the de-fendant to the punishment required by $ 924(c)(1). Instead,the firearm must be used "during and in relation to" a "crimeof violence or drug trafficking crime." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1).Petitioner does not deny that the alleged use occurred "dur-ing" a drug trafficking crime. Nor could he. The indictment charged that petitioner and his companion conspired topossess cocaine with intent to distribute. App. 3-4. Therecan be no doubt that the gun-for-drugs trade was proposedduring and in furtherance of that interstate drug conspiracy.Nor can it be contended that the alleged use did not occurduring the "attempt" to possess cocaine with which petitioner also was charged, id., at 4; the MAC-10 served as aninducement to convince the undercover officer to providepetitioner with the drugs that petitioner sought.Petitioner, however, does dispute whether his use of thefirearm was "in relation to" the drug trafficking offense.The phrase "in relation to" is expansive, cf. District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Board of Trade, 506 U. S. 125,129 (1992) (the phrase "relate to" is "deliberately expansive"(internal quotation marks omitted)), as the Courts of Ap-peals construing $ 924(c)(1) have recognized, United States v.Phelps, 877 F. 2d, at 30 ("[t]he phrase `in relation to' isbroad");United States v. Harris, 294 U. S. App. D. C., at 315,959 F. 2d, at 261 (per curiam) (firearm is used "in relationto" the crime if it "facilitate[s] the predicate offense in someway"). Nonetheless, the phrase does illuminate $ 924(c)(1)'sboundaries. According to Webster's, "in relation to" means"with reference to" or "as regards." Webster's New Inter508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT238 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnational Dictionary, at 2102. The phrase "in relation to"thus, at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have somepurpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime;its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accidentor coincidence. As one court has observed, the "in relationto" language "allay[s] explicitly the concern that a personcould be" punished under $ 924(c)(1) for committing a drugtrafficking offense "while in possession of a firearm" eventhough the firearm's presence is coincidental or entirely "unrelated" to the crime. United States v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.). Instead, the gun at leastmust "facilitat[e], or ha[ve] the potential of facilitating," thedrug trafficking offense. Id., at 540. Accord, United Statesv. Ocampo, 890 F. 2d 1363, 1371-1372 (CA7 1989); 957 F. 2d,at 837.We need not determine the precise contours of the "in relation to" requirement here, however, as petitioner's use ofhis MAC-10 meets any reasonable construction of it. TheMAC-10's presence in this case was not the product ofhappenstance. On the contrary, "[f]ar more than [in] theordinary case" under $ 924(c)(1), in which the gun merelyfacilitates the offense by providing a means of protection orintimidation, here "the gun . . . was an integral part of thetransaction." United States v. Phelps, 895 F. 2d 1281, 1283(CA9 1990) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearingen banc). Without it, the deal would not have been possible.The undercover officer posing as a pawnshop dealer expressly told petitioner that he was not in the narcotics business and that he did not get involved with drugs. For aMAC-10, however, he was willing to see if he could trackdown some cocaine.Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit in Phelps and on the legislative record, petitioner insists that the relationship between the gun and thedrug offense in this case is not the type of connection Congress contemplated when it drafted $ 924(c)(1). With re508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT239Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Opinion of the Courtspect to that argument, we agree with the District of Colum-bia Circuit's observation:"It may well be that Congress, when it drafted thelanguage of [$ ]924(c), had in mind a more obvious use ofguns in connection with a drug crime, but the language[of the statute] is not so limited[;] nor can we imagineany reason why Congress would not have wished its lan-guage to cover this situation. Whether guns are usedas the medium of exchange for drugs sold illegally oras a means to protect the transaction or dealers, theirintroduction into the scene of drug transactions dramati-cally heightens the danger to society."Harris, supra,at 316, 959 F. 2d, at 262.One need look no further than the pages of the Federal Re-porter to verify the truth of that observation. In Phelps,supra, the defendant arranged to trade his MAC-10 forchemicals necessary to make methamphetamine. The NinthCircuit held that the gun was not used or carried "in relationto" the drug trafficking offense because it was used as anitem of barter and not as a weapon. The defendant, how-ever, did not believe his MAC-10's capabilities were so limited. When he was stopped for a traffic violation, "[t]heMAC 10, suddenly transmogrified [from an item of commerce] into an offensive weapon, was still in [the defendant's]possession[.] [He] opened fire and shot a deputy sheriff."Id., at 1288, n. 4 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of re-hearing en banc).CFinally, the dissent and petitioner invoke the rule of lenity.Post, at 246-247. The mere possibility of articulating a nar-rower construction, however, does not by itself make the ruleof lenity applicable. Instead, that venerable rule is reservedfor cases where, "[a]fter `seiz[ing] every thing from which aidcan be derived,' " the Court is "left with an ambiguous stat-ute." United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347 (1971) (quot508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT240 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805)). Ac-cord,Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990).This is not such a case. Not only does petitioner's use of hisMAC-10 fall squarely within the common usage and dictionary definitions of the terms "uses . . . a firearm," but Congress affirmatively demonstrated that it meant to includetransactions like petitioner's as "us[ing] a firearm" by so employing those terms in $ 924(d).Imposing a more restrictive reading of the phrase "uses. . . a firearm" does violence not only to the structure andlanguage of the statute, but to its purpose as well. WhenCongress enacted the current version of $ 924(c)(1), it was nodoubt aware that drugs and guns are a dangerous combination. In 1989, 56 percent of all murders in New York Citywere drug related; during the same period, the figure for theNation's Capital was as high as 80 percent. The AmericanEnterprise 100 (Jan.-Feb. 1991). The fact that a gun istreated momentarily as an item of commerce does not renderit inert or deprive it of destructive capacity. Rather, as experience demonstrates, it can be converted instantaneouslyfrom currency to cannon. See supra, at 239. We thereforesee no reason why Congress would have intended courts andjuries applying $ 924(c)(1) to draw a fine metaphysical distinction between a gun's role in a drug offense as a weaponand its role as an item of barter; it creates a grave possibilityof violence and death in either capacity.We have observed that the rule of lenity "cannot dictatean implausible interpretation of a statute, nor one at oddswith the generally accepted contemporary meaning of aterm." Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 596 (1990).That observation controls this case. Both a firearm's use asa weapon and its use as an item of barter fall within the plainlanguage of $ 924(c)(1), so long as the use occurs during andin relation to a drug trafficking offense; both must constitute"uses" of a firearm for $ 924(d)(1) to make any sense at all;and both create the very dangers and risks that Congress508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT241Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)Scalia, J., dissentingmeant $ 924(c)(1) to address. We therefore hold that a crimi-nal who trades his firearm for drugs "uses" it during and inrelation to a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1). Because the evidence in this case showed thatpetitioner "used" his MAC-10 machine gun and silencer inprecisely such a manner, proposing to trade them for cocaine,petitioner properly was subjected to $ 924(c)(1)'s 30-yearmandatory minimum sentence. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.
