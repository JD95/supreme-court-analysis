S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the Courtobtained through an unconstitutional search or seizure.Today we hold that Stone's restriction on the exercise of federal habeas jurisdiction does not extend to a state prisoner'sclaim that his conviction rests on statements obtained in violation of the safeguards mandated by Miranda v. Arizona,384 U. S. 436 (1966).IPolice officers in Romulus, Michigan, learned that respondent, Robert Allen Williams, Jr., might have informationabout a double murder committed on April 6, 1985. OnApril 10, two officers called at Williams's house and askedhim to the police station for questioning. Williams agreedto go. The officers searched Williams, but did not handcuffhim, and they all drove to the station in an unmarked car.One officer, Sergeant David Early, later testified that Williams was not under arrest at this time, although a contemporaneous police report indicates that the officers arrested Williams at his residence. App. 12a-13a, 24a-26a.At the station, the officers questioned Williams about hisknowledge of the crime. Although he first denied anyinvolvement, he soon began to implicate himself, and the officers continued their questioning, assuring Williams thattheir only concern was the identity of the "shooter." Afterconsulting each other, the officers decided not to advise Williams of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, supra. SeeApp. to Pet. for Cert. 48a. When Williams persisted in denying involvement, Sergeant Early reproved him:"You know everything that went down. You just don'twant to talk about it. What it's gonna amount to is youcan talk about it now and give us the truth and we'regonna check it out and see if it fits or else we're simplygonna charge you and lock you up and you can just tellit to a defense attorney and let him try and prove differently." Ibid.507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT684 WITHROW v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtThe reproof apparently worked, for Williams then admittedhe had furnished the murder weapon to the killer, who hadcalled Williams after the crime and told him where he haddiscarded the weapon and other incriminating items. Williams maintained that he had not been present at the crimescene.Only at this point, some 40 minutes after they began questioning him, did the officers advise Williams of his Mirandarights. Williams waived those rights and during subsequent questioning made several more inculpatory state-ments. Despite his prior denial, Williams admitted that hehad driven the murderer to and from the scene of the crime,had witnessed the murders, and had helped the murdererdispose of incriminating evidence. The officers interrogatedWilliams again on April 11 and April 12, and, on April 12,the State formally charged him with murder.Before trial, Williams moved to suppress his responses tothe interrogations, and the trial court suppressed the statements of April 11 and April 12 as the products of improperdelay in arraignment under Michigan law. See App. to Pet.for Cert. 90a-91a. The court declined to suppress the statements of April 10, however, ruling that the police had givenWilliams a timely warning of his Miranda rights. Id., at90a. A bench trial led to Williams's conviction on twocounts each of first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and resulted in twoconcurrent life sentences. The Court of Appeals of Michigan affirmed the trial court's ruling on the April 10 statements, People v. Williams, 171 Mich. App. 234, 429 N. W. 2d649 (1988), and the Supreme Court of Michigan denied leaveto appeal, 432 Mich. 913, 440 N. W. 2d 416 (1989). We deniedthe ensuing petition for writ of certiorari. Williams v.Michigan, 493 U. S. 956 (1989).Williams then began this action pro se by petitioning for awrit of habeas corpus in the District Court, alleging a violation of his Miranda rights as the principal ground for relief.507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT685Cite as: 507 U.

The District Court granted relief, finding thatthe police had placed Williams in custody for Miranda pur-poses when Sergeant Early had threatened to "lock [him]up," and that the trial court should accordingly have ex-cluded all statements Williams had made between that pointand his receipt of the Miranda warnings. App. to Pet. forCert. 49a-52a. The court also concluded, though neitherWilliams nor petitioner had addressed the issue, that Wil-liams's statements after receiving theMiranda warningswere involuntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus likewise subject to suppression.App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a-71a. The court found that thetotality of circumstances, including repeated promises oflenient treatment if he told the truth, had overborne Williams's will.1The Court of Appeals affirmed, 944 F. 2d 284 (CA6 1991),holding the District Court correct in determining the policehad subjected Williams to custodial interrogation before giving him the requisite Miranda advice, and in finding thestatements made after receiving theMiranda warningsinvoluntary. Id., at 289-290. The Court of Appeals summarily rejected the argument that the rule in Stone v. Pow-ell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), should apply to bar habeas review ofWilliams's Miranda claim. 944 F. 2d, at 291. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the significant issue thus presented.503 U.

WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtIIWe have made it clear that Stone's limitation on federalhabeas relief was not jurisdictional in nature,3 but rested onprudential concerns counseling against the application of theFourth Amendment exclusionary rule on collateral review.See Stone, supra, at 494-495, n. 37; see also Kuhlmann v.Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 447 (1986) (opinion of Powell, J.) (dis-cussing equitable principles underlying Stone); Kimmelmanv. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 379, n. 4 (1986); Allen v. McCurry,449 U. S. 90, 103 (1980) (Stone concerns "the prudent exer-cise of federal-court jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254"); cf.28 U. S. C. $ 2243 (court entertaining habeas petition shall"dispose of the matter as law and justice require"). We simply concluded in Stone that the costs of applying the exclu-sionary rule on collateral review outweighed any potentialadvantage to be gained by applying it there. Stone, supra,at 489-495.We recognized that the exclusionary rule, held applicableto the States inMapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), "is not apersonal constitutional right"; it fails to redress "the injuryto the privacy of the victim of the search or seizure" at issue,"for any `[r]eparation comes too late.' " Stone, supra, at 486(quoting Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 637 (1965)).The rule serves instead to deter future Fourth Amendmentviolations, and we reasoned that its application on collateralreview would only marginally advance this interest in deterrence. Stone, 428 U. S., at 493. On the other side of theledger, the costs of applying the exclusionary rule on habeasin state court, should collateral review of the same claim on a habeascorpus petition be precluded?"), and we see no good reason to address itin this case.3 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a) provides: "The Supreme Court, a Justicethereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an applicationfor a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant tothe judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody inviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT687Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwere comparatively great. We reasoned that doing sowould not only exclude reliable evidence and divert attentionfrom the central question of guilt, but would also intrudeupon the public interest in " `(i) the most effective utilization of limited judicial resources, (ii) the necessity of finalityin criminal trials, (iii) the minimization of friction betweenour federal and state systems of justice, and (iv) the maintenance of the constitutional balance upon which the doctrineof federalism is founded.' "Id., at 491, n. 31 (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 259 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring)).Over the years, we have repeatedly declined to extend therule in Stone beyond its original bounds. In Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), for example, we denied a requestto apply Stone to bar habeas consideration of a FourteenthAmendment due process claim of insufficient evidence to support a state conviction. We stressed that the issue was"central to the basic question of guilt or innocence," Jackson,443 U. S., at 323, unlike a claim that a state court had received evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, and we found that to review such a claim onhabeas imposed no great burdens on the federal courts. Id.,at 321-322.After a like analysis, in Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545(1979), we decided against extending Stone to foreclosehabeas review of an equal protection claim of racial discrimination in selecting a state grand-jury foreman. A chargethat state adjudication had violated the direct command ofthe Fourteenth Amendment implicated the integrity of thejudicial process, we reasoned, Rose, 443 U. S., at 563, andfailed to raise the "federalism concerns" that had driven theCourt in Stone. 443 U. S., at 562. Since federal courts hadgranted relief to state prisoners upon proof of forbidden discrimination for nearly a century, we concluded, "confirmationthat habeas corpus remains an appropriate vehicle by whichfederal courts are to exercise their Fourteenth Amendment507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT688 WITHROW v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtresponsibilities" would not likely raise tensions between thestate and federal judicial systems. Ibid.In a third instance, in Kimmelman v. Morrison, supra, weagain declined to extend Stone, in that case to bar habeasreview of certain claims of ineffective assistance of counselunder the Sixth Amendment. We explained that unlike theFourth Amendment, which confers no "trial right," the Sixthconfers a "fundamental right" on criminal defendants, onethat "assures the fairness, and thus the legitimacy, of ouradversary process." 477 U. S., at 374. We observed thatbecause a violation of the right would often go unremediedexcept on collateral review, "restricting the litigation of someSixth Amendment claims to trial and direct review wouldseriously interfere with an accused's right to effective representation." Id., at 378.In this case, the argument for extending Stone again fallsshort.4 To understand why, a brief review of the derivationof the Miranda safeguards, and the purposes they were designed to serve, is in order.The Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendmentguarantees that no person "shall be compelled in any crimi-nal case to be a witness against himself." U. S. Const.,Amdt. 5. In Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 (1897), theCourt held that the Clause barred the introduction in federalcases of involuntary confessions made in response to custo-dial interrogation. We did not recognize the Clause's applicability to state cases until 1964, however, see Malloy v.Hogan, 378 U. S. 1; and, over the course of 30 years, begin-ning with the decision in Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278(1936), we analyzed the admissibility of confessions in suchcases as a question of due process under the FourteenthAmendment. See Stone, The Miranda Doctrine in theBurger Court, 1977 S. Ct. Rev. 99, 101-102. Under this ap4 We have in the past declined to address the application of Stone in thiscontext. See, e. g., Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 201, n. 3 (1989);Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87, n. 11 (1977).507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT689Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the Courtproach, we examined the totality of circumstances to deter-mine whether a confession had been " `made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement of any sort.' "Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 513 (1963) (quoting Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 (1896)); seealsoSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, supra, at 223-227 (discuss-ing totality-of-circumstances approach). See generally 1W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure $ 6.2 (1984). In-deed, we continue to employ the totality-of-circumstancesapproach when addressing a claim that the introduction ofan involuntary confession has violated due process. E. g.,Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991); Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 109-110 (1985).In Malloy, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendmentincorporates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and thereby opened Bram's doctrinal avenuefor the analysis of state cases. So it was that two yearslater we held in Miranda that the privilege extended to statecustodial interrogations. In Miranda, we spoke of the privi-lege as guaranteeing a person under interrogation "the right`to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfetteredexercise of his own will,' " 384 U. S., at 460 (quotingMalloy,supra, at 8), and held that "without proper safeguards theprocess of in-custody interrogation . . . contains inherentlycompelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he wouldnot otherwise do so freely." 384 U. S., at 467. To counterthese pressures we prescribed, absent "other fully effectivemeans," the now-familiar measures in aid of a defendant'sFifth Amendment privilege:"He must be warned prior to any questioning that hehas the right to remain silent, that anything he says canbe used against him in a court of law, that he has theright to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for himprior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT690 WITHROW v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtto exercise these rights must be afforded to himthroughout the interrogation. After such warningshave been given, and such opportunity afforded him, theindividual may knowingly and intelligently waive theserights and agree to answer questions or make a state-ment."Id., at 479.Unless the prosecution can demonstrate the warnings andwaiver as threshold matters, we held, it may not overcomean objection to the use at trial of statements obtained fromthe person in any ensuing custodial interrogation. Seeibid.;cf. Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 721-723 (1975) (permittinguse for impeachment purposes of statements taken in viola-tion of Miranda).Petitioner, supported by the United States as amicus cu-riae, argues that Miranda's safeguards are not constitutionalin character, but merely "prophylactic," and that in conse-quence habeas review should not extend to a claim that astate conviction rests on statements obtained in the absenceof those safeguards. Brief for Petitioner 91-93; Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 14-15. We accept petition-er's premise for purposes of this case, but not her conclusion.The Miranda Court did of course caution that the Consti-tution requires no "particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process," and left it open to aState to meet its burden by adopting "other procedures . . .at least as effective in apprising accused persons" of theirrights. 384 U. S., at 467. The Court indeed acknowledgedthat, in barring introduction of a statement obtained withoutthe required warnings, Miranda might exclude a confessionthat we would not condemn as "involuntary in traditionalterms,"id., at 457, and for this reason we have sometimescalled the Miranda safeguards "prophylactic" in nature.E. g., Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203 (1989); Connect-icut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987); Oregon v. Elstad,470 U. S. 298, 305 (1985); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649,654 (1984); see Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 444 (1974)507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT691Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the Court(Miranda Court "recognized that these procedural safe-guards were not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were instead measures to insure that the rightagainst compulsory self-incrimination was protected"). Butcf. Quarles, supra, at 660 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (MirandaCourt "held unconstitutional, because inherently compelled,the admission of statements derived from in-custody questioning not preceded by an explanation of the privilegeagainst self-incrimination and the consequences of forgoingit"). Calling the Miranda safeguards "prophylactic," how-ever, is a far cry from puttingMiranda on all fours withMapp, or from rendering Miranda subject to Stone.As we explained in Stone, the Mapp rule "is not a personalconstitutional right," but serves to deter future constitutional violations; although it mitigates the juridical consequences of invading the defendant's privacy, the exclusion ofevidence at trial can do nothing to remedy the completed andwholly extrajudicial Fourth Amendment violation. Stone,428 U. S., at 486. Nor can the Mapp rule be thought to enhance the soundness of the criminal process by improvingthe reliability of evidence introduced at trial. Quite the contrary, as we explained in Stone, the evidence excluded underMapp "is typically reliable and often the most probative information bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant." 428 U. S., at 490.Miranda differs from Mapp in both respects. "Prophylactic" though it may be, in protecting a defendant's FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination, Mirandasafeguards "a fundamental trial right." United States v.Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990) (emphasisadded); cf. Kimmelman, 477 U. S., at 377 (Stone does not barhabeas review of claim that the personal trial right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated). The privilegeembodies "principles of humanity and civil liberty, which hadbeen secured in the mother country only after years of struggle," Bram, 168 U. S., at 544, and reflects507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT692 WITHROW v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Court"many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: . . . our preference for an accusatorial rather thanan inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear thatself-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play whichdictates `a fair state-individual balance by requiring thegovernment to leave the individual alone until goodcause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring thegovernment in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load;' our respect for the inviolability ofthe human personality and of the right of each individual`to a private enclave where he may lead a private life;'our distrust of self-deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes `a shelterto the guilty,' is often `a protection to the innocent.' "Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of New York Harbor,378 U. S. 52, 55 (1964) (citations omitted).Nor does the Fifth Amendment "trial right" protected byMiranda serve some value necessarily divorced from thecorrect ascertainment of guilt. " `[A] system of criminal lawenforcement which comes to depend on the "confession" will,in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses'than a system relying on independent investigation." Michigan v. Tucker, supra, at 448, n. 23 (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 488-489 (1964)). By bracing against "thepossibility of unreliable statements in every instance of incustody interrogation," Miranda serves to guard against"the use of unreliable statements at trial." Johnson v. NewJersey, 384 U. S. 719, 730 (1966); see also Schneckloth, 412U. S., at 240 (Miranda "Court made it clear that the basisfor decision was the need to protect the fairness of the trialitself "); Halpern, Federal Habeas Corpus and the Mapp Exclusionary Rule after Stone v. Powell, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1,40 (1982); cf. Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545 (1979) (Stonedoes not bar habeas review of claim of racial discrimination507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT693Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the Courtin selection of grand-jury foreman, as this claim goes to theintegrity of the judicial process).Finally, and most importantly, eliminating review ofMiranda claims would not significantly benefit the federalcourts in their exercise of habeas jurisdiction, or advance thecause of federalism in any substantial way. As oneamicusconcedes, eliminating habeas review of Miranda issueswould not prevent a state prisoner from simply convertinghis barred Miranda claim into a due process claim that hisconviction rested on an involuntary confession. See Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae 17. Indeed, althoughcounsel could provide us with no empirical basis for project-ing the consequence of adopting petitioner's position, see Tr.of Oral Arg. 9-11, 19-21, it seems reasonable to suppose thatvirtually allMiranda claims would simply be recast in thisway.5If that is so, the federal courts would certainly not haveheard the last ofMiranda on collateral review. Under thedue process approach, as we have already seen, courts lookto the totality of circumstances to determine whether a con-fession was voluntary. Those potential circumstances include not only the crucial element of police coercion, Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 167 (1986); the length of theinterrogation, Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 153-154(1944); its location, see Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433, 441 (1961);its continuity,Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556, 561 (1954); thedefendant's maturity, Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599-601(1948) (opinion of Douglas, J.); education, Clewis v. Texas,386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967); physical condition, Greenwald v.Wisconsin, 390 U. S. 519, 520-521 (1968) (per curiam); andmental health, Fikes v. Alabama, 352 U. S. 191, 196 (1957).They also include the failure of police to advise the defendantof his rights to remain silent and to have counsel present5 Justice O'Connor is confident that many such claims would be unjustified, see post, at 708-709, but that is beside the point. Justifiability isnot much of a gatekeeper on habeas.507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT694 WITHROW v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtduring custodial interrogation. Haynes v. Washington, 373U. S. 503, 516-517 (1963); Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 19, n. 17; see also Schneckloth, supra, at 226 (discussing factors). We could lock the front door against Miranda,but not the back.We thus fail to see how abdicating Miranda's bright-line(or, at least, brighter-line) rules in favor of an exhaustivetotality-of-circumstances approach on habeas would do muchof anything to lighten the burdens placed on busy federalcourts. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro,Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the FederalSystem 188 (3d ed. 1988, Supp. 1992); Halpern, supra, at 40;Schulhofer, Confessions and the Court, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 865,891 (1981); see also Quarles, 467 U. S., at 664 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S. 1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)) (Miranda's " `core virtue' " was " `afford[ing] police and courts clear guidance on the manner inwhich to conduct a custodial investigation' "). We likewisefail to see how purporting to eliminate Miranda issues fromfederal habeas would go very far to relieve such tensions asMiranda may now raise between the two judicial systems.Relegation of habeas petitioners to straight involuntarinessclaims would not likely reduce the amount of litigation, andeach such claim would in any event present a legal questionrequiring an "independent federal determination" on habeas.Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S., at 112.One might argue that tension results between the two judicial systems whenever a federal habeas court overturns astate conviction on finding that the state court let in a voluntary confession obtained by the police without the Mirandasafeguards. And one would have to concede that this hasoccurred in the past, and doubtless will occur again. It isnot reasonable, however, to expect such occurrences to befrequent enough to amount to a substantial cost of reviewing507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT695Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)Opinion of the CourtMiranda claims on habeas or to raise federal-state tensionsto an appreciable degree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, 21. Wemust remember in this regard that Miranda came downsome 27 years ago. In that time, law enforcement hasgrown in constitutional as well as technological sophistica-tion, and there is little reason to believe that the police todayare unable, or even generally unwilling, to satisfy Miranda'srequirements. SeeQuarles, supra, at 663 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 304 (1980) (Burger,C.

Rev. 435, 455-457 (1987).6 And if, finally, one should question the need for federal collateral re-view of requirements that merit such respect, the answersimply is that the respect is sustained in no small part bythe existence of such review. "It is the occasional abuse thatthe federal writ of habeas corpus stands ready to correct."Jackson, 443 U. S., at 322.IIIOne final point should keep us only briefly. As he haddone in his state appellate briefs, on habeas Williams raisedonly one claim going to the admissibility of his statements tothe police: that the police had elicited those statements without satisfying the Miranda requirements. See supra, at 684.In her answer, petitioner addressed only that claim. SeeBrief in Support of Answer in No. 90CV-70256 DT, p. 3 (EDMich.). The District Court, nonetheless, without an evidentiary hearing or even argument, went beyond the habeaspetition and found the statements Williams made after re6 It should indeed come as no surprise that one of the submissions arguing against the extension of Stone in this case comes to us from lawenforcement organizations.

WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtceiving the Miranda warnings to be involuntary under dueprocess criteria. Before the Court of Appeals, petitionerobjected to the District Court's due process enquiry on theground that the habeas petition's reference to Mirandarights had given her insufficient notice to address a due process claim. Brief for Respondent-Appellant in No. 90-2289,p. 6 (CA6). Petitioner pursues the objection here. See Pet.for Cert. 1; Brief for Petitioner 14-15, n. 2.Williams effectively concedes that his habeas petitionraised no involuntariness claim, but he argues that the matter was tried by the implied consent of the parties underFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b),7 and that petitionercan demonstrate no prejudice from the District Court'saction. See Brief for Respondent 41-42, n. 22. The record,however, reveals neither thought, word, nor deed of petitioner that could be taken as any sort of consent to thedetermination of an independent due process claim, and petitioner was manifestly prejudiced by the District Court'sfailure to afford her an opportunity to present evidence bearing on that claim's resolution. The District Court shouldnot have addressed the involuntariness question in thesecircumstances.87 The relevant part of Rule 15(b) provides: "When issues not raised bythe pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, theyshall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them toconform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amenddoes not affect the result of the trial of these issues." See 28 U. S. C.$ 2254 Rule 11 (application of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to habeaspetitions); 1 J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure$ 17.2 (1988) (Rule 15 applies in habeas actions).8 We need not address petitioner's arguments that Williams failed toexhaust the involuntariness claim in the state courts and that the DistrictCourt applied a new rule under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Ofcourse, we also express no opinion on the merits of the involuntarinessclaim.507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT697Cite as: 507 U.
