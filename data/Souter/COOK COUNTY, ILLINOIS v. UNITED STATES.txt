Thisposition accorded with the common understanding amongcontemporary commentators that corporations were "persons" in the general enjoyment of the capacity to sue and besued. See,e. g., 2 J.

While it is true that Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch61, 86-87 (1809), declined to rely on the presumption whenit decided the separate issue whether a corporation was a"citizen" for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction, by1844 the Deveaux position had been abandoned and a corporation was understood to have citizenship independent of itsconstituent members by virtue of its status as "a person,although an artificial person." Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v.Letson, 2 How. 497, 558 (1844); see 1 A.

MercerCounty, 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the Letson rule to them.Cowles, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least toCoke, supra, that municipal corporations and private oneswere simply two species of "body politic and corporate,"treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capableof suing and being sued. See, e. g., W. Glover, A PracticalTreatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837)(Municipal corporations have, as an attribute "necessarilyand inseparably incident to every corporation," the ability"[t]o sue or be sued, . . . and do all other acts as natural538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 538 U.

Indeed, "[t]he archetypalAmerican corporation of the eighteenth century [was] themunicipality"; only in the early 19th century did private corporations become widespread. M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, p. 112 (1977). This history explains how the Court in Cowles could conclude"automatically and without discussion" that municipal corporations, like private ones, "should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutoryanalysis." Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,436 U. S. 658, 687-688 (1978); see Cowles, supra, at 121(describing the question as one that "presents but littledifficulty").7Of course, the meaning of "person" recognized in Cowlesis the usual one, but not immutable, see Monell, supra, at688, and the County asks us to take a cue from the qualification included in the later definition in the Dictionary Act,Act of Feb. 25, 1871, $ 2, 16 Stat. 431, that "the word `person'may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . unless the context shows that [it was] intended to beused in a more limited sense." Cf. J. Angell & S. Ames, ATreatise on the Law of Private Corporations Aggregate 4(rev. 3d ed. 1846) ("The construction is, that when `persons'are mentioned in a statute, corporations are included if theyfall within the general reason and design of the statute").The County invokes two points of context that it takes as7 The County and some of its supporting amici urge a further distinctionbetween full-fledged municipal corporations such as towns and cities,which were incorporated at the request of their inhabitants, and "quasicorporations" such as counties, which were unilateral creations of theState. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 91 U. S. 540, 552 (1876).While the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differedfrom that of municipal corporations, see ibid., both were treated equallyas legal "persons." Indeed, Cowles itself applied to an Illinois county likeCook County.538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLEROpinion of the Courtindicating that in the FCA Congress intended a more lim-ited meaning.First, it says that the statutory text is "inherently incon-sistent with local governmental liability," Brief for Petitioner13, owing to the references of the original enactment to "anyperson in the land or naval forces of the United States" and"any person not in the military or naval forces of the UnitedStates," together with a provision imposing criminal liability,including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category,see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, $$ 1, 3, 12 Stat. 696, 697, 698.8But the old text merely shows that "any person in the land ornaval forces" was directed at natural persons. The secondphrase, covering all other "persons," could not have beenthat limited, or even private corporations would be outsidethe FCA's coverage, a reading that not even the County es-pouses and one that we seriously doubted inStevens, 529U. S., at 782. As for the FCA's reference to criminal liability, "[t]he short answer is that it has not been regarded asanomalous to require compliance by municipalities with thesubstantive standards of . . . federal laws which impose [bothcivil and criminal] sanctions upon `persons.' "Lafayette v.Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 400 (1978).Municipalities may not be susceptible to every statutory pen-alty, but that is no reason to exempt them from remediesthat sensibly apply. Id., at 400-401; United States v. UnionSupply Co., 215 U. S. 50, 54-55 (1909).The other contextual evidence cited by the County is thehistory of the FCA. We recounted in Stevens that Congress's primary concern in 1863 was " `stopping the massivefrauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during theCivil War.' " 529 U. S., at 781 (quoting United States v.Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 309 (1976), but adding "[private]").Local governments, the County says, were not players in the8 The FCA's civil and criminal provisions were bifurcated in 1878, seeRainwater v. United States, 356 U. S. 590, 592, n. 8 (1958), and the latterprovisions have since been recodified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287.538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 538 U.

United States v. Neifert-White Co., 390 U. S. 228, 232 (1968). Whatever municipalcorporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local gov-ernments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts offederal funding schemes and thus no less able than individu-als or private corporations to impose on the federal fiscand exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.Cf.Monell, supra, at 685-686 (noting that municipalities can,"equally with natural persons, create the harms intended tobe remedied [by 42 U. S. C. $ 1983]"). In sum, neither his-tory nor text points to exclusion of municipalities from theclass of "persons" covered by the FCA in 1863.IIINor is the application of this reading of the statute af-fected by the County's alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCA's provisions for relief. The County's argu-ment leads off, at least, with a sound premise about thehistorical tension between municipal liability and damagesimposed as punishment. Although it was well establishedin 1863 "that a municipality, like a private corporation, wasto be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a widerange of tortious activity, . . . this understanding did notextend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,"Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 259-260 (1981).Since municipalities' common law resistance to punitive damages still obtains, "[t]he general rule today is that no punitivedamages are allowed unless expressly authorized by statute." Id., at 260, n. 21.The County relies on this general statement in asking usto infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986amendments to the FCA. As part of an effort to modernize538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLEROpinion of the Courtthe FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to thecurrent range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling ondamages recoverable under $ 3729(a) from double to treble.False Claims Amendments Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-562, $ 2(7),100 Stat. 3153. In Stevens, we spoke of this change as turn-ing what had been a "remedial" provision into an "essentiallypunitive" one. 529 U. S., at 784, 785. The County relies onthis characterization to argue that, even if municipalitieswere covered by the term "person" from 1863 to 1986, Congress's adoption of a "punitive" remedy entailed the elimina-tion of municipal liability in 1986.Although we did indeed find the punitive character of thetreble damages provision a reason not to read "person" toinclude a State, see id., at 785, it does not follow that thepunitive feature has the force to show congressional intentto repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, whichincluded municipalities. To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, servingremedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives. See,e. g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth,Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 635-636 (1985) (citing Brunswick Corp.v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477, 485-486 (1977));American Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. HydrolevelCorp., 456 U. S. 556, 575 (1982); see also Agency HoldingCorp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 151(1987). While the tipping point between payback and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on theworkings of a particular statute and the course of particularlitigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damagesmultiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.There is no question that some liability beyond the amountof the fraud is usually "necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims." Bornstein, supra, at 315;see United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 445 (1989) (noting that the Government's injury includes "not merely the538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 538 U. S. 119 (2003)Opinion of the Courtamount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such asthe costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attendthe Government's efforts to root out deceptive practices di-rected at the public purse"). The most obvious indicationthat the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place underthis statute is itsqui tam feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Government's recoveryto a private relator who began the action. In qui tam casesthe rough difference between double and triple damages maywell serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interestof some private plaintiff who can spot violations and startlitigating to compensate the Government, while benefitinghimself as well. SeeUnited States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess,317 U. S. 537, 547 (1943). The treble feature thus leaves theremaining double damages to provide elements of makewhole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.Cf.Bornstein, 423 U. S., at 315, and n. 11. It may also benecessary for full recovery even when there is no qui tamrelator to be paid. The FCA has no separate provision forprejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential tocompensation, see, e. g., Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S. 1,10-11 (2001), and might well be substantial given the FCA'slong statute of limitations, $ 3731(b). Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typicallycome with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 549(1)(b), and Comment d (1976).9Thus, although Stevens recognized that the FCA's trebledamages remedy is still "punitive" in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this9 The treble damages provision was, in a way, adopted by Congress asa substitute for consequential damages. The Senate version of the billproposed consequential damages on top of treble damages, while theHouse version proposed consequential damages plus double damages.See S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 39 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep.No. 99-660, p. 20 (1986). Ultimately, the Senate's treble figure wasadopted and the consequential damages provision dropped.538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLEROpinion of the Courtpunitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is notas robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases. Trebledamages certainly do not equate with classic punitive dam-ages, which leave the jury with open-ended discretion overthe amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipaldefendants. One is that a local government's taxing powermakes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury. SeeNewport, 453 U. S., at 270-271. But under the FCA, thejury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, itsinstruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, forwhich the court alone then determines any multiplier, justas the court alone sets any separate penalty. $ 3729(a); see277 F. 3d, at 978. There is mitigation, also, for the secondworry, that "blameless or unknowing taxpayers" will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials. Newport,453 U. S., at 267. This very case shows how FCA liabilitymay expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyedthe indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxesor expanded services. Cf. ibid. The question in such casesis whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently outof pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case,not by an opportunistic qui tam relator, but by a combinationof the judge's discretion and the Government's power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see $ 3730(c)(2).The presumption against punitive damages thus bringsonly limited vigor to the County's aid. Working against theCounty's position, however, is a different presumption, thisone at full strength: the "cardinal rule . . . that repeals byimplication are not favored." Posadas v. National CityBank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936). Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendmentswordlessly redefined "person" to exclude municipalities.The County's argument, it must be remembered, is not538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 538 U. S. 119 (2003)Opinion of the Courtmerely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amend-ments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be readto eliminate the FCA's coverage of municipal corporationsentirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it isimpossible when we consider what is known about the objectof the amendments in 1986.The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to makethe FCA a "more useful tool against fraud in modern times."S. Rep., at 2. Because Congress was concerned about per-vasive fraud in "all Government programs,"ibid., it allowedprivate parties to sue even based on information already inthe Government's possession, see Hughes Aircraft Co. v.United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 946 (1997);increased the Gover nment's measure of recovery; andenhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit. Yet theCounty urges that in so doing Congress made local govern-ments, which today often administer or receive federal funds,immune not only from treble damages but from any liabilitywhatsoever under the FCA. Congress could have donethat, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congressdid it under its breath.10 It is simply not plausible that Con-gress intended to repeal municipal liabilitysub silentio bythe very Act it passed to strengthen the Government's hand10 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsedmunicipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments. See S. Rep., at8 (noting that "[t]he term `person' is used in its broad sense to includepartnerships, associations, and corporations . . . as well as States and political subdivisions thereof" (citing, inter alia, Monell v. New York CityDept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978))). Although in VermontAgency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S.765 (2000), we considered this evidence insufficient to overcome the background presumption that States are not "persons," in the present case thestatement belies the County's argument that Congress meant to changethe contrary presumption applicable to local governments and to removemunicipal liability.538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN134 COOK COUNTY v.
