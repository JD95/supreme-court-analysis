The village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, New York, isa religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of astrict form of Judaism. The village fell within the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute passed in 1989 carved out a separate district, followingvillage lines, to serve this distinctive population. 1989 N. Y.Laws, ch. 748. The question is whether the Act creating theseparate school district violates the Establishment Clauseof the First Amendment, binding on the States through theFourteenth Amendment. Because this unusual Act is tantamount to an allocation of political power on a religious crite-rion and neither presupposes nor requires governmentalimpartiality toward religion, we hold that it violates the pro-hibition against establishment.IThe Satmar Hasidic sect takes its name from the townnear the Hungarian and Romanian border where, in the earlyyears of this century, Grand Rebbe Joel Teitelbaum moldedthe group into a distinct community.

Then, 20 yearsago, the Satmars purchased an approved but undevelopedsubdivision in the town of Monroe and began assembling thecommunity that has since become the village of Kiryas Joel.When a zoning dispute arose in the course of settlement, theSatmars presented the Town Board of Monroe with a petition to form a new village within the town, a right that NewYork's Village Law gives almost any group of residents whosatisfy certain procedural niceties. See N. Y. Village Law,Art. 2 (McKinney 1973 and Supp. 1994). Neighbors who didnot wish to secede with the Satmars objected strenuously,and after arduous negotiations the proposed boundaries ofthe village of Kiryas Joel were drawn to include just the 320acres owned and inhabited entirely by Satmars. The village, incorporated in 1977, has a population of about 8,500today. Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, eldest son of the currentGrand Rebbe, serves as the village rov (chief rabbi) and roshyeshivah (chief authority in the parochial schools).The residents of Kiryas Joel are vigorously religious people who make few concessions to the modern world and goto great lengths to avoid assimilation into it. They interpretthe Torah strictly; segregate the sexes outside the home;speak Yiddish as their primary language; eschew television,radio, and English-language publications; and dress in distinctive ways that include headcoverings and special garments for boys and modest dresses for girls. Children areeducated in private religious schools, most boys at theUnited Talmudic Academy where they receive a thoroughgrounding in the Torah and limited exposure to secular subjects, and most girls at Bais Rochel, an affiliated school witha curriculum designed to prepare girls for their roles aswives and mothers.

Starting in 1984 the Monroe-Woodbury CentralSchool District provided such services for the children ofKiryas Joel at an annex to Bais Rochel, but a year laterended that arrangement in response to our decisions inAguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and School Dist. ofGrand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985). Children fromKiryas Joel who needed special education (including the deaf,the mentally retarded, and others suffering from a range ofphysical, mental, or emotional disorders) were then forced toattend public schools outside the village, which their familiesfound highly unsatisfactory. Parents of most of these children withdrew them from the Monroe-Woodbury secularschools, citing "the panic, fear and trauma [the children] suffered in leaving their own community and being with peoplewhose ways were so different," and some sought administrative review of the public-school placements.

Id., at 180, 527 N. E. 2d, at770.

The court added, however, that the Satmars' constitutional right to exercise theirreligion freely did not require a separate school, since theparents had alleged emotional trauma, not inconsistency512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT693Cite as: 512 U.

It was then that the New York Legislaturepassed the statute at issue in this litigation, which providedthat the village of Kiryas Joel "is constituted a separateschool district, . . . and shall have and enjoy all the powersand duties of a union free school district . . . ." 1989 N. Y.Laws, ch. 748.1 The statute thus empowered a locallyelected board of education to take such action as openingschools and closing them, hiring teachers, prescribing textbooks, establishing disciplinary rules, and raising propertytaxes to fund operations. N. Y. Educ. Law $ 1709 (McKinney 1988). In signing the bill into law, Governor Cuomo rec-ognized that the residents of the new school district were"all members of the same religious sect," but said that thebill was "a good faith effort to solve th[e] unique problem"associated with providing special education services to handicapped children in the village.

Law $ 3202 (McKinney 1981 andSupp. 1994), the Kiryas Joel Village School District currentlyruns only a special education program for handicapped chil-dren. The other village children have stayed in their parochial schools, relying on the new school district only fortransportation, remedial education, and health and welfareservices. If any child without a handicap in Kiryas Joelwere to seek a public-school education, the district would paytuition to send the child into Monroe-Woodbury or anotherschool district nearby. Under like arrangements, several ofthe neighboring districts send their handicapped Hasidicchildren into Kiryas Joel, so that two thirds of the full-timestudents in the village's public school come from outside. Inall, the new district serves just over 40 full-time students,and two or three times that many parochial school studentson a part-time basis.Several months before the new district began operations,the New York State School Boards Association and respondents Grumet and Hawk brought this action against the StateEducation Department and various state officials, challenging Chapter 748 under the National and State Constitutionsas an unconstitutional establishment of religion.2 The StateSupreme Court for Albany County allowed the Kiryas JoelVillage School District and the Monroe-Woodbury CentralSchool District to intervene as parties defendant and accepted the parties' stipulation discontinuing the actionagainst the original state defendants, although the attorneygeneral of New York continued to appear to defend the constitutionality of the statute.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, thetrial court ruled for the plaintiffs (respondents here), findingthat the statute failed all three prongs of the test in Lemonv.Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), and was thus unconstitutional under both the National and State Constitutions.Grumet v. New York State Ed. Dept., 151 Misc. 2d 60, 579N. Y. S. 2d 1004 (1992).A divided Appellate Division affirmed on the ground thatChapter 748 had the primary effect of advancing religion, inviolation of both constitutions, 187 App. Div. 2d 16, 592N. Y. S. 2d 123 (1992), and the State Court of Appeals affirmed on the federal question, while expressly reserving thestate constitutional issue, 81 N. Y. 2d 518, 618 N. E. 2d 94(1993). Judge Smith wrote for the court in concluding thatbecause both the district's public-school population and itsschool board would be exclusively Hasidic, the statute created a "symbolic union of church and State" that was "likelyto be perceived by the Satmarer Hasidim as an endorsementof their religious choices, or by nonadherents as a disapproval" of their own. Id., at 529, 618 N. E. 2d, at 100. Asa result, said the majority, the statute's primary effect wasan impermissible advancement of religious belief. In a concurring opinion, Judge Hancock found the effect purposeful,so that the statute violated the first as well as the secondprong of Lemon. 81 N. Y. 2d, at 540, 618 N. E. 2d, at 107.Chief Judge Kaye took a different tack, applying the strictscrutiny we have prescribed for statutes singling out a particular religion for special privileges or burdens; she foundChapter 748 invalid as an unnecessarily broad response to anarrow problem, since it creates a full school district insteadof simply prescribing a local school for the village's handicapped children.

Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 792-793 (1973),favoring neither one religion over others nor religious ad-herents collectively over nonadherents. See Epperson v.Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968). Chapter 748, the statutecreating the Kiryas Joel Village School District, departs fromthis constitutional command by delegating the State's discre-tionary authority over public schools to a group defined byits character as a religious community, in a legal and histori-cal context that gives no assurance that governmental powerhas been or will be exercised neutrally.Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982), pro-vides an instructive comparison with the litigation before us.There, the Court was requested to strike down a Massachu-setts statute granting religious bodies veto power over applications for liquor licenses.

S., at 125-126; see also Lemonv. Kurtzman, supra, at 612. Comparable constitutionalproblems inhere in the statute before us.ALarkin presented an example of united civic and religiousauthority, an establishment rarely found in such straightforward form in modern America, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433U. S. 229, 263 (1977) (Powell, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), and a violation of "the core rationale underlying the EstablishmentClause," 459 U. S., at 126. See also Allegheny County v.American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.

GRUMETOpinion of Souter, J.The Establishment Clause problem presented by Chapter748 is more subtle, but it resembles the issue raised inLarkin to the extent that the earlier case teaches that a Statemay not delegate its civic authority to a group chosen according to a religious criterion. Authority over public schoolsbelongs to the State, N. Y. Const., Art. XI, $ 1, and cannotbe delegated to a local school district defined by the State inorder to grant political control to a religious group. Whatmakes this litigation different fromLarkin is the delegationhere of civic power to the "qualified voters of the village ofKiryas Joel," 1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748, as distinct from areligious leader such as the village rov, or an institution ofreligious government like the formally constituted parishcouncil in Larkin. In light of the circumstances of thesecases, however, this distinction turns out to lack constitutional significance.It is, first, not dispositive that the recipients of state powerin these cases are a group of religious individuals united bycommon doctrine, not the group's leaders or officers. Although some school district franchise is common to all voters,the State's manipulation of the franchise for this district limited it to Satmars, giving the sect exclusive control of thepolitical subdivision. In the circumstances of these cases,the difference between thus vesting state power in the members of a religious group as such instead of the officers of itssectarian organization is one of form, not substance. It istrue that religious people (or groups of religious people)cannot be denied the opportunity to exercise the rights ofcitizens simply because of their religious affiliations or commitments, for such a disability would violate the right toreligious free exercise, see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618(1978), which the First Amendment guarantees as certainlyas it bars any establishment. But McDaniel, which heldthat a religious individual could not, because of his religiousactivities, be denied the right to hold political office, is not inpoint here. That individuals who happen to be religious512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT699Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)Opinion of Souter, J.may hold public office does not mean that a State may delib-erately delegate discretionary power to an individual, institution, or community on the ground of religious identity. IfNew York were to delegate civic authority to "the GrandRebbe," Larkin would obviously require invalidation (eventhough under McDaniel the Grand Rebbe may run for, andserve on, his local school board), and the same is true if NewYork delegates political authority by reference to religiousbelief. Where "fusion" is an issue, the difference lies in thedistinction between a government's purposeful delegation onthe basis of religion and a delegation on principles neutral toreligion, to individuals whose religious identities are incidental to their receipt of civic authority.Of course, Chapter 748 delegates power not by expressreference to the religious belief of the Satmar community,but to residents of the "territory of the village of KiryasJoel." 1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748. Thus the second (and arguably more important) distinction between these cases andLarkin is the identification here of the group to exercise civilauthority in terms not expressly religious. But our analysisdoes not end with the text of the statute at issue, see Churchof Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 534(1993); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 56-61 (1985); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 341-342 (1960), and the context here persuades us that Chapter 748 effectively identifiesthese recipients of governmental authority by reference todoctrinal adherence, even though it does not do so expressly.We find this to be the better view of the facts because of theway the boundary lines of the school district divide residentsaccording to religious affiliation, under the terms of an unusual and special legislative Act.It is undisputed that those who negotiated the villageboundaries when applying the general village incorporationstatute drew them so as to exclude all but Satmars, and thatthe New York Legislature was well aware that the villageremained exclusively Satmar in 1989 when it adopted Chap512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT700 BOARD OF ED.

The significance of this fact to the statelegislature is indicated by the further fact that carving outthe village school district ran counter to customary districting practices in the State. Indeed, the trend in New York isnot toward dividing school districts but toward consolidatingthem. The thousands of small common school districts laidout in the early 19th century have been combined and recombined, first into union free school districts and then intolarger central school districts, until only a tenth as manyremain today.

Most of these cover several towns, manyof them cross county boundaries, and only one remains pre-cisely coterminous with an incorporated village. Law Pamphlet, at 24. The object of the State's practice of consolida-tion is the creation of districts large enough to provide acomprehensive education at affordable cost, which is thoughtto require at least 500 pupils for a combined junior-seniorhigh school. Univ. of State of N. Y. and State EducationDept., Master Plan for School District Reorganization inNew York State 10-11 (rev. ed. 1958).3 The Kiryas Joel Vil-lage School District, in contrast, has only 13 local, full-timestudents in all (even including out-of-area and part-time stu-dents leaves the number under 200), and in offering only special education and remedial programs it makes no pretenseto be a full-service district.The origin of the district in a special Act of the legislature,rather than the State's general laws governing school district3 The Commissioner of Education updates this Master Plan as schooldistricts consolidate, see N. Y. Educ. Law $ 314 (McKinney 1988), but hasnot published a superseding version.512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT701Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)Opinion of Souter, J.reorganization,4 is likewise anomalous. Although the legis-lature has established some 20 existing school districts byspecial Act, all but one of these are districts in name only,having been designed to be run by private organizationsserving institutionalized children. They have neither taxbases nor student populations of their own but serve childrenplaced by other school districts or public agencies. See N. Y.Educ. Law $ 3601-a (Statutory Notes), $$ 4001 and 4005 (Mc-Kinney Supp. 1994); Law Pamphlet, at 18 ("These districtsare school districts only by way of a legal fiction"). The oneschool district petitioners point to that was formed by specialAct of the legislature to serve a whole community, as thisone was, is a district formed for a new town, much largerand more heterogeneous than this village, being built on landthat straddled two existing districts. See 1972 N. Y. Laws,ch. 928 (authorizing Gananda School District). Thus theKiryas Joel Village School District is exceptional to the pointof singularity, as the only district coming to our notice thatthe legislature carved from a single existing district to servelocal residents. Clearly this district "cannot be seen as thefulfillment of [a village's] destiny as an independent govern-mental entity,"United States v. Scotland Neck City Bd. ofEd., 407 U. S. 484, 492 (1972) (Burger, C. J., concurring inresult).54 State law allows consolidation on the initiative of a district superintendent, N. Y. Educ. Law $ 1504 (McKinney 1988), local voters, $$ 1510-1513, 1522-1524, 1902, or the Commissioner of Education, $$ 1526, 1801-1803-a, depending on the circumstances. It also authorizes the districtsuperintendent to "organize a new school district," $ 1504, which mayallow secession from an existing district, but this general law played nopart in the creation of the Kiryas Joel Village School District.5 Although not dispositive in this facial challenge, the pattern of interdistrict transfers, proposed and presently occurring, tends to confirm thatreligion rather than geography is the organizing principle for this district.Cf. United States v. Scotland Neck City Bd. of Ed., 407 U. S., at 490(Burger, C. J., concurring in result). When Chapter 748 was passed, the512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT702 BOARD OF ED. OF KIRYAS JOEL VILLAGESCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMETOpinion of the CourtBecause the district's creation ran uniquely counter tostate practice, following the lines of a religious communitywhere the customary and neutral principles would not havedictated the same result, we have good reasons to treat thisdistrict as the reflection of a religious criterion for identify-ing the recipients of civil authority. Not even the specialneeds of the children in this community can explain the legis-lature's unusual Act, for the State could have responded tothe concerns of the Satmar parents without implicating theEstablishment Clause, as we explain in some detail furtheron. We therefore find the legislature's Act to be substan-tially equivalent to defining a political subdivision and hencethe qualification for its franchise by a religious test, resultingin a purposeful and forbidden "fusion of governmental andreligious functions." Larkin v. Grendel's Den, 459 U. S., at126 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).6BThe fact that this school district was created by a specialand unusual Act of the legislature also gives reason for concern whether the benefit received by the Satmar communityis one that the legislature will provide equally to other religious (and nonreligious) groups. This is the second maladyunderstanding was that if a non-Hasidic child were to move into the village, the district would pay tuition to send the child to one of the neighboring school districts, since Kiryas Joel would have no regular educationprogram. Although the need for such a transfer has not yet arisen, thereare 20 Hasidic children with handicapping conditions who transfer intoKiryas Joel's school district from the nearby East Ramapo and MonroeWoodbury school districts.6 Because it is the unusual circumstances of this district's creation thatpersuade us the State has employed a religious criterion for delegatingpolitical power, this conclusion does not imply that any political subdivision that is coterminous with the boundaries of a religiously homogeneouscommunity suffers the same constitutional infirmity. The district in thesecases is distinguishable from one whose boundaries are derived accordingto neutral historical and geographic criteria, but whose population happens to comprise coreligionists.512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT703Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe Larkin Court identified in the law before it, the absenceof an "effective means of guaranteeing" that governmentalpower will be and has been neutrally employed. Id., at 125(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Butwhereas in Larkin it was religious groups the Court thoughtmight exercise civic power to advance the interests of religion (or religious adherents), here the threat to neutralityoccurs at an antecedent stage.The fundamental source of constitutional concern here isthat the legislature itself may fail to exercise governmentalauthority in a religiously neutral way. The anomalouslycase-specific nature of the legislature's exercise of state authority in creating this district for a religious communityleaves the Court without any direct way to review such stateaction for the purpose of safeguarding a principle at theheart of the Establishment Clause, that government shouldnot prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion.See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S., at 52-54; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S., at 104; School Dist. of Abington Townshipv.Schempp, 374 U. S., at 216-217. Because the religiouscommunity of Kiryas Joel did not receive its new governmental authority simply as one of many communities eligible forequal treatment under a general law,7 we have no assurancethat the next similarly situated group seeking a school dis-trict of its own will receive one; unlike an administrativeagency's denial of an exemption from a generally applicablelaw, which "would be entitled to a judicial audience,"Olsenv.Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F. 2d 1458, 1461 (CADC1989) (R. B. Ginsburg, J.), a legislature's failure to enact aspecial law is itself unreviewable. Nor can the historicalcontext in these cases furnish us with any reason to supposethat the Satmars are merely one in a series of communities7 This contrasts with the process by which the village of Kiryas Joelitself was created, involving, as it did, the application of a neutral statelaw designed to give almost any group of residents the right to incorporate.

R. Church & M.Sedlak, Education in the United States 162, 167-169 (1976).And in more recent history, the special Act in these casesstands alone. Seesupra, at 701.The general principle that civil power must be exercisedin a manner neutral to religion is one the Larkin Court rec-ognized, although it did not discuss the specific possibility oflegislative favoritism along religious lines because the stat-ute before it delegated state authority to any religious groupassembled near the premises of an applicant for a liquor li-cense, see 459 U. S., at 120-121, n. 3, as well as to a furthercategory of institutions not identified by religion. But theprinciple is well grounded in our case law, as we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of anybenefit provided religious groups or individuals in turningaside Establishment Clause challenges. In Walz v. TaxComm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 673 (1970), forexample, the Court sustained a property tax exemption forreligious properties in part because the State had "not singled out one particular church or religious group or evenchurches as such," but had exempted "a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations." Ac-cord,id., at 696-697 (opinion of Harlan, J.). And Bowen v.Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608 (1988), upheld a statute enlistinga "wide spectrum of organizations" in addressing adolescentsexuality because the law was "neutral with respect to thegrantee's status as a sectarian or purely secular institu-tion."8 See also Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S.8 The Court used "sectarian" to refer to organizations akin to this schooldistrict in that they were operated in a secular manner but had a religiousaffiliation; it recognized that government aid may not flow to an institution" `in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its func512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT705Cite as: 512 U.

Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 492(1986) (Powell, J., concurring). Here the benefit flows onlyto a single sect, but aiding this single, small religious groupcauses no less a constitutional problem than would followfrom aiding a sect with more members or religion as a whole,see Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246 (1982), and weare forced to conclude that the State of New York has violated the Establishment Clause.CIn finding that Chapter 748 violates the requirement ofgovernmental neutrality by extending the benefit of a specialfranchise, we do not deny that the Constitution allows theState to accommodate religious needs by alleviating specialburdens. Our cases leave no doubt that in commanding neu-trality the Religion Clauses do not require the governmentto be oblivious to impositions that legitimate exercises ofstate power may place on religious belief and practice.Rather, there is "ample room under the EstablishmentClause for `benevolent neutrality which will permit religiousexercise to exist without sponsorship and without interfer-ence,' " Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 334 (1987)(quoting Walz v.

Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n ofFla., 480 U. S. 136, 144-145 (1987). The fact that Chapter748 facilitates the practice of religion is not what renders itan unconstitutional establishment. Cf.Lee v. Weisman, 505U. S. 577, 627 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring) ("That government must remain neutral in matters of religion does notforeclose it from ever taking religion into account");SchoolDist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 299(Brennan, J., concurring) ("[H]ostility, not neutrality, wouldcharacterize the refusal to provide chaplains and places ofworship for prisoners and soldiers cut off by the State fromall civilian opportunities for public communion").But accommodation is not a principle without limits, andwhat petitioners seek is an adjustment to the Satmars' religiously grounded preferences 9 that our cases do not counte-nance. Prior decisions have allowed religious communitiesand institutions to pursue their own interests free fromgovernmental interference, see Corporation of PresidingBishop v. Amos, supra, at 336-337 (government may allowreligious organizations to favor their own adherents in hiring, even for secular employment); Zorach v. Clauson, 343U. S. 306 (1952) (government may allow public schools to release students during the schoolday to receive off-site religious education), but we have never hinted that an otherwiseunconstitutional delegation of political power to a religiousgroup could be saved as a religious accommodation. Petitioners' proposed accommodation singles out a particular religious sect for special treatment,10 and whatever the limitsof permissible legislative accommodations may be, compare9 The Board of Education of the Kiryas Joel Village School Districtexplains that the Satmars prefer to live together "to facilitate individualreligious observance and maintain social, cultural and religious values,"but that it is not " `against their religion' to interact with others." Brieffor Petitioner in No. 93-517, p. 4, n. 1.10 In this respect, it goes beyond even Larkin, transferring politicalauthority to a single religious group rather than to any church or school.512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT707Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)Opinion of the CourtTexas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, supra (striking down lawexempting only religious publications from taxation), withCorporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, supra (upholdinglaw exempting religious employers from Title VII), it is clearthat neutrality as among religions must be honored. SeeLarson v. Valente, supra, at 244-246.This conclusion does not, however, bring the Satmar parents, the Monroe-Woodbury school district, or the State ofNew York to the end of the road in seeking ways to respondto the parents' concerns. Just as the Court in Larkin ob-served that the State's interest in protecting religious meeting places could be "readily accomplished by other means,"459 U. S., at 124, there are several alternatives here for providing bilingual and bicultural special education to Satmarchildren. Such services can perfectly well be offered to village children through the Monroe-Woodbury Central SchoolDistrict. Since the Satmars do not claim that separatism isreligiously mandated, their children may receive bilingualand bicultural instruction at a public school already run bythe Monroe-Woodbury district. Or if the educationally appropriate offering by Monroe-Woodbury should turn out tobe a separate program of bilingual and bicultural educationat a neutral site near one of the village's parochial schools,this Court has already made it clear that no EstablishmentClause difficulty would inhere in such a scheme, administered in accordance with neutral principles that would notnecessarily confine special treatment to Satmars. See Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 247-248.To be sure, the parties disagree on whether the servicesMonroe-Woodbury actually provided in the late 1980's wereappropriately tailored to the needs of Satmar children, butthis dispute is of only limited relevance to the questionwhether such services could have been provided, had adjustments been made. As we understand New York law,parents who are dissatisfied with their handicapped child'sprogram have recourse through administrative review pro512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT708 BOARD OF ED. OF KIRYAS JOEL VILLAGESCHOOL DIST. v.

Y. 2d, at180, 527 N. E. 2d, at 770), and if the New York Legislatureshould remain dissatisfied with the responsiveness of thelocal school district, it could certainly enact general legislation tightening the mandate to school districts on matters ofspecial education or bilingual and bicultural offerings.IIIJustice Cardozo once cast the dissenter as "the gladiatormaking a last stand against the lions." B. Cardozo, Law andLiterature 34 (1931). Justice Scalia's dissent is certainlythe work of a gladiator, but he thrusts at lions of his ownimagining. We do not disable a religiously homogeneousgroup from exercising political power conferred on it withoutregard to religion. Cf. post, at 735-736. Unlike the Statesof Utah and New Mexico (which were laid out according totraditional political methodologies taking account of lines oflatitude and longitude and topographical features, see U. S.Dept. of Interior, F. Van Zandt, Boundaries of the UnitedStates and the Several States 250-257 (Geological SurveyBulletin 1212, 1966)), the reference line chosen for the KiryasJoel Village School District was one purposely drawn to separate Satmars from non-Satmars. Nor do we impugn themotives of the New York Legislature, cf.post, at 737-740,which no doubt intended to accommodate the Satmar community without violating the Establishment Clause; we sim-ply refuse to ignore that the method it chose is one that aidsa particular religious community, as such, see App. 19-20(Assembly sponsor thrice describes the Act's beneficiaries asthe "Hasidic" children or community), rather than all groupssimilarly interested in separate schooling.

Tax Comm'n of New YorkCity, 397 U. S., at 673, and Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S., at608, purporting to rely on the breadth of the statutoryschemes would have been mere surplusage. Indeed, underthe dissent's theory, if New York were to pass a law providing school buses only for children attending Christian dayschools, we would be constrained to uphold the statuteagainst Establishment Clause attack until faced by a requestfrom a non-Christian family for equal treatment under thepatently unequal law. Cf. Everson v. Board of Ed. ofEwing, 330 U. S., at 17 (upholding school bus service provided all pupils). And to end on the point with which Justice Scalia begins, the license he takes in suggesting thatthe Court holds the Satmar sect to be New York's established church, see post, at 732, is only one symptom of hisinability to accept the fact that this Court has long held thatthe First Amendment reaches more than classic, 18thcentury establishments. See Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S.,at 492-495.Our job, of course, would be easier if the dissent's positionhad prevailed with the Framers and with this Court over theyears. An Establishment Clause diminished to the dimensions acceptable to Justice Scalia could be enforced by afew simple rules, and our docket would never see cases requiring the application of a principle like neutrality towardreligion as well as among religious sects. But that wouldbe as blind to history as to precedent, and the differencebetween Justice Scalia and the Court accordingly turns onthe Court's recognition that the Establishment Clause doescomprehend such a principle and obligates courts to exercisethe judgment necessary to apply it.In these cases we are clearly constrained to conclude thatthe statute before us fails the test of neutrality. It delegates a power this Court has said "ranks at the very apex of512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT710 BOARD OF ED. OF KIRYAS JOEL VILLAGESCHOOL DIST. v.
