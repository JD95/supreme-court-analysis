The principal issue before us is whether materiality offalsehood is an element of the crime of knowingly making afalse statement to a federally insured bank, 18 U. S.

To raise cash, Copytech sold its interestin the income stream from these contracts to banks.In Count I of the indictment, the Government chargedrespondents with conspiring to violate $ 1014 by conceal-ing from several banks the true contractual terms.1 Re*Bruce S.

The Government alleged that respondents concealed the service obliga-tions in order to avoid tying up needed cash in reserve accounts, which the banks might have required Copytech tomaintain if they had known of the company's servicing obligations. Ibid.In Count II, respondents were charged with violating$ 1014 by giving a bank forgeries of respondents' wives' sig-natures on personal guaranties designed to enable the bankto pursue the wives' assets if Copytech defaulted on any lia-bility to the bank. See App. 21, 30-31; 63 F. 3d, at 748.2Each count of the indictment charged respondents with sub-mitting one or more statements that were both false and"material." App. 24, 25, 29, 30-31.At the end of the trial, the District Court instructed thejury, at the Government's behest, that withholding a "mate-rial fact" made a statement or representation false, id., at41, 42, and defined a material fact as one "that would beimportant to a reasonable person in deciding whether to engage or not to engage in a particular transaction," id., at 42.Although there was no controversy over the law as stated inthese instructions, the Government argued that materialitywas for the judge to determine, while respondents said itwas an issue for the jury. 63 F. 3d, at 749, nn. 3 and 4.Following Eighth Circuit precedent then prevailing, the District Court agreed with the Government and told the jurythat "[t]he materiality of the statement . . . alleged to befalse . . . is not a matter with which you are concerned and2 The Government also charged respondents with three other counts ofviolating $ 1014.

When the Court of Appeals in this case requested supplemental briefing on the applicability of Gaudin, respond-ents argued that under $ 1014 materiality is an element onwhich they were entitled to a jury's determination; the Gov-ernment argued, for the first time, that materiality is not anelement under $ 1014, so that no harm had been done whenthe judge dealt with the issue. The Court of Appealsagreed with respondents, vacated their convictions andsentences, and remanded the case for a new trial. 63 F.3d, at 749-751.We granted the Government's petition for certiorari todecide whether materiality of a false statement or report isan element under $ 1014.3 517 U.

S. 482 (1997)Opinion of the CourtIIWe first address respondents' efforts to block us fromreaching the question on which we granted certiorari.Given the Government's proposal for jury instructions to theeffect that materiality is an element under $ 1014, respondents argue that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 andthe doctrines of "law of the case" and "invited error" eachbar the Government from taking the position here that mate-riality is not an element. None of these reasons stands inour way to reaching the merits.Rule 30 (applicable in this Court, see Fed. Rules Crim.Proc. 1, 54(a)) provides that "[n]o party may assign as errorany portion of the charge [given to the jury] . . . unless thatparty objects thereto before the jury retires to consider itsverdict." But the Government is not challenging the juryinstruction in an effort to impute error to the trial court; itis merely arguing that the instruction it proposed was harmless surplusage insofar as it was directed to the jury.As for the two doctrines, respondents are correct that sev-eral Courts of Appeals have ruled that when the Government accepts jury instructions treating a fact as an elementof an offense, the "law of the case" doctrine precludes theGovernment from denying on appeal that the crime includesthe element. See United States v. Killip, 819 F. 2d 1542,1547-1548 (CA10), cert. deniedsub nom. Krout v. UnitedStates, 484 U. S. 987 (1987); United States v. Tapio, 634 F. 2d1092, 1094 (CA8 1980);United States v. Spletzer, 535 F. 2d950, 954 (CA5 1976).4 They are also correct that Courts ofUnited States, 493 U. S. 890 (1989) (all holding materiality to be an elementof $ 1014), with United States v. Cleary, 565 F. 2d 43, 46 (CA2 1977) (concluding that materiality is not an element), cert. denied sub nom. Passarelli v. United States, 435 U. S. 915 (1978).4 In this context, the "law of the case" doctrine is something of a misnomer. It does not counsel a court to abide by its own prior decision in agiven case, but goes rather to an appellate court's relationship to the courtof trial. See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 4478 (1981).519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT488 UNITED STATES v. WELLSOpinion of the CourtAppeals have stated more broadly under the "invited error"doctrine " `that a party may not complain on appeal of errorsthat he himself invited or provoked the [district] court . . . tocommit.' " United States v. Sharpe, 996 F. 2d 125, 129 (CA6)(quoting Harvis v. Roadway Express, Inc., 923 F. 2d 59, 60(CA6 1991)), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 951 (1993). But howevervaluable these doctrines may be in controlling the party whowishes to change its position on the way from the districtcourt to the court of appeals, they cannot dispositively oustthis Court's traditional rule that we may address a questionproperly presented in a petition for certiorari if it was"pressed [in] or passed on" by the Court of Appeals,UnitedStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 42 (1992) (internal quotationmarks and emphasis omitted). Accordingly, we have treatedan inconsistency between a party's request for a jury instruc-tion and its position before this Court as just one of severalconsiderations bearing on whether to decide a question onwhich we granted certiorari.5 See Springfield v. Kibbe, 480U. S. 257, 259-260 (1987) (per curiam).6 Here, it seems sen-sible to reach the question presented.5 Respondents offer variations on their "law of the case" and "invitederror" doctrines. In addition to arguing that the "law of the case" doctrine holds the Government to the position it took on the jury instructions,respondents contend this doctrine holds the Government to the position itadopted in the indictment. See Brief for Respondents 14-16 (citingUnited States v. Norberg, 612 F. 2d 1 (CA1 1979)). For the reasons setforth in the text, this latter version of the doctrine does not stand in ourway to reaching the question presented.Along with arguing that the Government "invited error" in the DistrictCourt by proposing its jury instructions, respondents claim that the Government invited error in the Court of Appeals by failing to argue thatmateriality is not an element of $ 1014 in its initial brief to that court.This claim is wrong. After the Court of Appeals requested supplementalbriefing, the Government argued that materiality is not an element of$ 1014 and therefore hardly "invited" that court's contrary ruling.6 In Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S., at 259, the Court dismissed the writof certiorari on prudential grounds in part because the petitioner there,like the Government here, sought "to revers[e] a judgment because of519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT489Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe question of materiality as an element was raised before the Court of Appeals, ruled on there, clearly set forth inthe certiorari petition, fully briefed, and argued. Nor wouldreaching the issue excuse inattention or reward cunning.For some time before respondents' trial in 1993, the EighthCircuit had assumed that the Government was bound toprove a false statement's materiality as an element under$ 1014, see 63 F. 3d, at 750-751; United States v. Ribaste, 905F. 2d 1140, 1143 (1990); United States v. McKnight, 771 F. 2d388, 389 (1985), and had treated this issue as one for thejudge, not the jury, see United States v. Ribaste, supra, at1143. Since the Government was confident that it had evidence of materiality to satisfy the Circuit rule, it had no reason not to address the element when it drafted the indictment and its proposed jury instructions. When Gaudinrendered it reversible error to assign a required materialityruling to the court, the Government suddenly had reason tocontest the requirement to show materiality at all. Nothingthe Government has done disqualifies it from the chance tomake its position good in this Court.IIIWe accordingly consider whether materiality of falsehoodis an element under $ 1014, understanding the term in question to mean "ha[ving] a natural tendency to influence, or[being] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed," Kungys v. UnitedStates, 485 U. S. 759, 770 (1988) (internal quotation marks[jury] instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed itself requested."In contrast to the case at hand, however, the petitioner in Kibbe had not,in the Court of Appeals, raised an issue critical to resolving the questionpresented in its petition for a writ of certiorari, the Court of Appeals hadnot considered that related issue, and the petitioner had not explicitlyraised that related issue in its certiorari petition, id., at 258-260.

Section1014 criminalizes "knowingly mak[ing] any false statementor report . . . for the purpose of influencing in any way theaction" of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)insured bank "upon any application, advance, . . . commitment, or loan." 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. Nowhere does it furthersay that a material fact must be the subject of the false statement or so much as mention materiality.8 To the contrary,its terms cover "any" false statement that meets the otherrequirements in the statute, and the term "false statement"carries no general suggestion of influential significance, seeKungys v. United States, supra, at 781; cf. Kay v. UnitedStates, 303 U. S. 1, 5-6 (1938). Thus, under the first criterion in the interpretive hierarchy, a natural reading of thefull text, see United States v. American Trucking Assns.,Inc., 310 U. S. 534, 542-543 (1940), materiality would not bean element of $ 1014.97 The Court of Appeals here also appears to have understood materialityto have this meaning. See 63 F. 3d, at 750 (relying on United States v.Adler, 623 F. 2d 1287, 1291 (CA8 1980), which defined "materiality" ashaving "a natural tendency to influence or [being] capable of influencing"an entity's decision (internal quotation marks omitted)).8 The pertinent text of $ 1014 is: "Whoever knowingly makes any falsestatement or report, or willfully overvalues any land, property or security,for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of . . . any institutionthe accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . . . , upon any application, advance, discount, purchase, purchaseagreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan, or any change orextension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor, shallbe fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years,or both."9 Justice Stevens argues that the four criminal acts other than "falsestatement" listed in $ 1014 would in fact involve material misstatements,and that it follows on the theories of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociisthat false statements must also be shown to be material.

S. 482 (1997)Opinion of the CourtNor have respondents come close to showing that at com-mon law the term "false statement" acquired any implicationof materiality that came with it into $ 1014. We do, ofcourse, presume that Congress incorporates the common-lawmeaning of the terms it uses if those " `terms . . . have accumulated settled meaning under . . . the common law' " and" `the statute [does not] otherwise dictat[e],' "NationwideMut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322 (1992) (quotingCommunity for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, supra, at739). Respondents here, however, make no claims about thesettled meaning of "false statement" at common law; theymerely note that some common-law crimes involving falsestatements, such as perjury, required proof of materiality.See Brief for Respondents 23-24. But Congress did notcodify the crime of perjury or comparable common-lawcrimes in $ 1014; as we discuss next, it simply consolidated13 statutory provisions relating to financial institutions, and,in fact, it enacted a separate general perjury provision at 18U. S. C. $ 1621, see 62 Stat. 773.10511, n. 12. But this does not follow. The question is not whether thespecified categories of statements will almost certainly be material statements in point of fact; like false statements made for the purpose ofinfluencing a lender, the four other criminal acts will virtually always involve material misstatements. The question, however, is whether materiality must be proven as a separate element, and on that question a listof criminal acts, none of which is expressly described as "material," isno premise for the dissent's conclusion under the ejusdem generis andnoscitur a sociis canons.10 Nor does Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), help respondents here. In Fedorenko, we agreed with the Government that,even though the phrase "willfully make a misrepresentation" in $ 10 of theDisplaced Persons Act, 62 Stat. 1013, did not use the term "material," itnonetheless applied only to willful misrepresentations about "material"facts, 449 U. S., at 507-508, and n. 28. The dissent argues we should reacha similar conclusion here, because Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759,781 (1988), made it clear that "misrepresentation" and "false statement"were on par at common law. Post, at 504, and n. 6. But the passagefrom Kungys quoted by the dissent addressed the historic meaning of the519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT492 UNITED STATES v. WELLSOpinion of the CourtStatutory history confirms the natural reading. WhenCongress originally enacted $ 1014 as part of its recodification of the federal criminal code in 1948, 62 Stat. 752, it explicitly included materiality in other provisions involvingfalse representations.11 Even more significantly, of the 13provisions brought together by $ 1014, 10 had previously contained no express materiality provision and received none inthe recodification,12 while 3 of the 13 had contained expressterm "material," see 485 U. S., at 769, not the common-law meaning of"misrepresentation" or "false statement." Although Kungys supports theview that "materiality" has the same meaning in criminal statutes thatprohibit falsehoods to public officials, whether the statutes refer to misrepresentations, see id., at 772-776, or to some form of false statements, seeid., at 779-782, that does not mean that "misrepresentation" and "falsestatement" are identical in carrying an implicit requirement of materiality.Indeed, Kungys distinguished between the common-law meaning of "misrepresentation" and "false testimony," concluding that while the formerhad been held to carry a materiality requirement in many contexts, theterms "false" or "falsity" did not as frequently carry such an implication.Id., at 781.More fundamentally, we disagree with our colleague's apparentview that any term that is an element of a common-law crime carrieswith it every other aspect of that common-law crime when the term isused in a statute. Justice Stevens seems to assume that because"false statement" is an element of perjury, and perjury criminalizesonly material statements, a statute criminalizing "false statements" coversonly material statements. See post, at 504. By a parity of reasoning,because common-law perjury involved statements under oath, a statutecriminalizing a false statement would reach only statements under oath.It is impossible to believe that Congress intended to impose such restrictions sub silentio, however, and so our rule on imputing common-lawmeaning to statutory terms does not sweep so broadly.11 See 18 U. S. C. $ 1621, 62 Stat. 773 (entitled "Perjury generally," andprohibiting statements under oath regarding "any material matter which[one] does not believe to be true"); 18 U. S.

The most likely inference in these circumstancesis that Congress deliberately dropped the term "materiality"without intending materiality to be an element of $ 1014.SeeUnited States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 13-14 (1994).1412 U. S. C. $ 1122 (1946 ed.)

(making a "material representation");12 U. S. C. $ 596 (1946 ed.) (making a "material statement"); and 12 U. S. C.$ 1138d(a) (1946 ed.) (making a "material representation").14 Justice Stevens suggests that because he can discern no meaningfuldifference between the subject matter and penalties involved in the 42sections of the United States Code criminalizing false statements that expressly include a materiality requirement, and the 54 sections criminalizing false statements that lack an express materiality requirement, wemust infer that Congress intended all of the sections to include a materiality element. See post, at 505-509. In other words, Congress must havethought that including materiality in 42 statutes was surplusage. This,of course, is contrary to our presumption that each term in a criminalstatute carries meaning. See Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 145(1995). Moreover, the dissent's approach to statutory interpretation leadsto remarkable results. The statutes cited by the dissent contain a varietyof different requirements; for example, some criminalize statements onlyif they were made with a particular intent, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 1919; 33U. S. C. $ 931, while others do not, see, e. g., 7 U. S. C. $ 13(a)(3); 7 U. S. C.$ 6407(e). Under our colleague's reasoning, unless a court could readilydiscern a meaningful difference between these two categories of statutes,apart from the language used, it should import the mens rea requirementsexpressly appearing in some sections to those that lack them.519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT494 UNITED STATES v. WELLSOpinion of the CourtWhile 2 of the 3 offenses from which the express materialityrequirement was dropped used the term "representation,"see n. 12, supra, and thus could have included a materialityelement implicitly, see Kungys v.

There can be no question that Congress was entitled to require that the infor-mation be given in good faith and not falsely with intentto mislead. Whether or not the Corporation would act15 Compare $ 8(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 48 Stat. 134 (providingthat "[w]hoever makes any statement, knowing it to be false, or whoeverwillfully overvalues any security, for the purpose of influencing in any waythe action of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation or the Board or anassociation upon any application, advance, discount, purchase, or repurchase agreement, or loan, under this Act, or any extension thereof byrenewal deferment, or action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, orsubstitution of security therefor, shall be punished by a fine of not morethan $5,000, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both"),with $ 1014 as enacted in 1948, 62 Stat. 752 (providing that "[w]hoeverknowingly makes any false statement or report, or willfully overvaluesany land, property or security, for the purpose of influencing in any waythe action of [enumerated institutions] upon any application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment,or loan, or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution ofsecurity therefor, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned notmore than two years, or both").519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT495Cite as: 519 U.

The case is notone of an action for damages but of criminal liability andactual damage is not an ingredient of the offense." Id.,at 5-6.16Although some courts have read Kay as holding only thatthere is no need for the Government to prove that falsestatements actually influenced the decisionmaker, see, e. g.,United States v. Goberman, 458 F. 2d 226, 229 (CA3 1972),the opinion speaks of the importance of the statements aswell as their efficacy, and no one reading Kay could reason-ably have assumed that criminal falsity presupposed materiality. Since we presume that Congress expects its statutesto be read in conformity with this Court's precedents, see,e. g., North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 34 (1995),and since the relevant language of the statute inKay wassubstantially like that in $ 1014, Kay stands in the way of anyassumption that Congress might have understood an expressmateriality provision to be redundant.Respondents' remaining arguments for affirmance are un-availing. They contend that Congress has ratified holdingsof some of the Courts of Appeals that materiality is an ele-ment of $ 1014 by repeatedly amending the statute withoutrejecting those decisions. But the significance of subse-quent congressional action or inaction necessarily varieswith the circumstances, and finding any interpretive help incongressional behavior here is impossible. Since 1948, Congress has amended $ 1014 to modify the list of covered insti-tutions and to increase the maximum penalty,17 but without16 We ultimately did not uphold the conviction in Kay, 303 U.

But even if silence could speak, it could not speakunequivocally to the issue here, since over the years judicialopinion has divided on whether $ 1014 includes a materialityelement, see n. 3, supra, and we have previously describedthe elements of $ 1014 without any mention of materiality,see Williams v. United States, 458 U. S., at 284. It wouldthus be impossible to say which view Congress might haveendorsed. See Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.

S. 482 (1997)Opinion of the CourtHistorical and Revision Notes following $ 1014, 18 U. S. C.,p. 247. Respondents say that the revisers' failure to mention the omission of materiality from the text of $ 1014 meansthat Congress must have "completely overlooked" the issue.Brief for Respondents 29-30. But surely this indicationthat the "staff of experts" who prepared the legislation,Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U. S. 454, 470, n. 10 (1975), eitheroverlooked or chose to say nothing about changing the language of three of the former statutes does nothing to muddythe ostensibly unambiguous provision of the statute asenacted by Congress, cf. Consumer Product Safety Comm'nv.GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 108 (1980) ("Absent aclearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive").In any event, the revisers' assumption that the consolidationmade no substantive change was simply wrong. As re-spondents candidly conceded at oral argument, they failed todiscover a single case holding that any of the predecessorstatutes lacking a materiality requirement implicitly contained one, and after our decision in Kay v. United States,303 U. S. 1 (1938), Congress could not have assumed that amateriality element was implicit in a comparable statute thatwas silent on the issue, see supra, at 494-495. Dropping themateriality element from the three statutes could not, then,reasonably have been seen as making no change. Those whowrite revisers' notes have proven fallible before. See StateFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 532,n. 11 (1967).20phrased "composite" of the then-existing terms. See Historical and Revision Notes following $ 1014, 18 U. S.

WELLSOpinion of the CourtRespondents next urge that we follow the reasoning ofsome Courts of Appeals in reading materiality into the statute to avoid the improbability that Congress intended toimpose substantial criminal penalties on relatively trivialor innocent conduct. See 63 F. 3d, at 751; United States v.Williams, 12 F. 3d 452, 458 (CA5 1994); United States v.Staniforth, 971 F. 2d 1355, 1358 (CA7 1992). But we thinkthere is no clear call to take such a course. It is true thatwe have held $ 1014 inapplicable to depositing false checks ata bank, in part because we thought that it would have"ma[d]e a surprisingly broad range of unremarkable conducta violation of federal law," Williams v. United States, 458U. S., at 286-287, n. 8, and elsewhere thought it possible toconstrue a prohibition narrowly where a loose mens rea re-quirement would otherwise have resulted in a surprisinglybroad statutory sweep, see United States v. X-CitementVideo, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 71-72 (1994). But an unqualifiedrequirement. In Kreidler, the defendant challenged his indictment under$ 8(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (the same provision at issue twoyears later in Kay, see n. 14, supra), arguing that a statement "must bematerial and calculated to deceive," Kreidler, 11 F. Supp., at 403. TheDistrict Court simply "assume[d]" the statement "must be relevant andmaterial," and then found that the indictment satisfied those requirements. Id., at 403-404. The question in McClanahan was whether thedefendant's prosecution under $ 31 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916,39 Stat. 382, 12 U. S. C. $ 981 (1946 ed.), was beyond Congress's constitutional power because the statute did "not limit the [punishable] statementto such as relate or are material to the proposed loan." 12 F. 2d, at 263.The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. While stating thatit "would in all probability be concluded" that "wholly frivolous and unrelated" false statements made in a loan application "did not supply the basisfor a prosecution under section 31," the court made it clear that this wasdicta, because it explained in the very next sentence that "there [was] noquestion of the relevancy of the alleged false statements knowingly made"in the case before it. Id., at 264. In determining what the revisers mighthave thought the words of $ 1014 meant, we think it far more likely thatthey would have relied on the clear implication of our 1938 decision in Kayv. United States, 303 U. S. 1, rather than on the dicta from two earlierDistrict or Appeals Court cases.519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT499Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Opinion of the Courtreading of $ 1014 poses no risk of criminalizing so much con-duct as to suggest that Congress meant something short ofthe straightforward reading. The language makes a falsestatement to one of the enumerated financial institutions acrime only if the speaker knows the falsity of what he saysand intends it to influence the institution. A statementmade "for the purpose of influencing" a bank will not usuallybe about something a banker would regard as trivial, and "itwill be relatively rare that the Government will be able toprove that" a false statement "was . . . made with the subjective intent" of influencing a decision unless it could firstprove that the statement has "the natural tendency to influence the decision," Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S., at780-781. Hence the literal reading of the statute will notnormally take the scope of $ 1014 beyond the limit that amateriality requirement would impose.Finally, the rule of lenity is no help to respondents here."The rule of lenity applies only if, `after seizing everythingfrom which aid can be derived,' . . . we can make `no morethan a guess as to what Congress intended.' "Reno v.Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995) (quoting Smith v. UnitedStates, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993), and Ladner v. United States,358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). Read straightforwardly, $ 1014reveals no ambiguity, its mens rea requirements narrow thesweep of the statute, and this is not a case of guessworkreaching out for lenity. IVRespondents advance two further reasons to affirm theCourt of Appeals's judgment, even on the assumption thatmateriality is not an element. According to respondents,the trial judge's instruction that "[t]he materiality of thestatement . . . alleged to be false . . . is not a matter withwhich you are concerned and should not be considered byyou in determining the guilt or innocence of the defend-ant[s]," App. 43, probably left the jurors with the impressionthat the statements as alleged would have been material, and519us2$30M 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT500 UNITED STATES v. WELLSStevens, J., dissentingthat impression could have improperly influenced the jury inpassing on the elements of falsity and purpose. Respondents also suggest that because the indictment alleged materiality, any ruling that materiality need not be shown in thiscase would impermissibly "amend" the indictment contraryto the Fifth Amendment's requirement that "[n]o personshall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamouscrime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a GrandJury." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. Since respondents failed toraise either of these issues in their briefs before the Courtof Appeals and that court did not pass on these questions,we leave it to the Court of Appeals on remand to take upthe propriety of raising these issues now and to address themif warranted.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, dissenting.Violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1014 is a crime punishable by upto 30 years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000,000, "or both." Iam convinced that Congress did not intend this draconianstatute to apply to immaterial falsehoods, even when madefor the purpose of currying favor with a bank's loan officer.The Court's contrary conclusion relies heavily on three dubious assumptions: (1) that our decision in Kay v. UnitedStates, 303 U. S. 1 (1938), speaks to the issue in this case; (2)that the revisers of $ 1014 erred in advising us that their1948 consolidation of 13 earlier statutes did not change thelaw; and (3) that flattery of bank officers is uncommon. Idisagree with each of those assumptions.IOur opinion in Kay, on which the majority relies, does notaddress the issue in this case. It does, however, illuminate519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT501Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingthe problems with the Court's holding today. Ms. Kay wasconvicted of making false statements under the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U. S. C. $$ 1467(a) and (e) (1940 ed.). 303U. S., at 3-4. She had falsely stated that the amount ofthe claims she presented for settlement was two to four timestheir actual value.Id., at 5. Among the challenges thatKay pressed before this Court was an argument that she couldnot be convicted under $ 1467(a) because the Governmentproduced no evidence that her false statement had any effecton the actions of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation. Ibid.In rightly rejecting this argument, this Court reasoned:"Whether or not the Corporation would act favorably onthe loan is not a matter which concerns one seeking todeceive by false information. The case is not one of anaction for damages but of criminal liability, and actualdamage is not an ingredient of the offense." Id., at 6.There is a clear distinction between the concept of materi-ality--whether the information provided could have playeda proper role in the loan approval process--and the conceptof reliance--whether the information did play a role in theprocess. Kay could not plausibly have contended that herfalse statement was immaterial. Certainly a misrepresentation regarding the proposed amount of settlement was rel-evant and could have affected the Corporation's decision.Instead, she argued that the charge was insufficient becauseit did not allege that the application had been approved,i. e.,that her material false statement had played a causal role.The Court, quite properly, rejected that argument becausethe crime was complete when the material false statementwas made. Since the materiality of the statement was notdisputed, the Court had no occasion to address the questionpresented by this case.The difference between the issue inKay and the issue inthis case does, however, illustrate the importance of theCourt's holding today. Conceivably a prohibition againstmaking intentional false statements might encompass fourdifferent categories: (1) all lies, including idle conversation;519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT502 UNITED STATES v. WELLSStevens, J., dissenting(2) all lies intended to encourage a favorable response, in-cluding mere flattery; (3) all material misstatements; or (4)only those material misstatements that are relied upon bythe deceived decisionmaker. Kay held that the coverage ofone of the predecessor statutes that became $ 1014 is broaderthan the fourth category. In my opinion, $ 1014 embracesonly the third category. The Court, however, concludes thatit encompasses all of the second category, which I call the"flattery category" even though that label does not ade-quately describe its breadth. As now construed, $ 1014 covers false explanations for arriving late at a meeting, falseassurances that an applicant does not mind if the loan officerlights up a cigar, false expressions of enthusiasm about theresults of a football game or an election, as well as false compliments about the subject of a family photograph. So longas the false statement is made "for the purpose of influencing" a bank officer, it violates $ 1014. Ante, at 499.IIThe history of $ 1014 also refutes the Court's interpreta-tion of that statute. Prior to the 1948 codification, three ofthe statutes that became a part of $ 1014 included an expressmateriality requirement. The others did not. The Reviser's Note states that the amalgamation of these 13 statutesmade no "change of substance" in the law.1 The majority,today interpreting $ 1014 as making a substantial change inthe law, concludes that the reviser was "simply wrong."Ante, at 497.A more plausible explanation shows that the reviserwas, in fact, correct. Prior to the 1948 codification, nofederal court appears to have held that any of $ 1014's predecessor statutes encompassed immaterial statements. Atleast two cases, however, had held or assumed that thenonexplicit statutes did contain a materiality requirement.SeeMcClanahan v. United States, 12 F. 2d 263, 264 (CA71 Historical and Revision Notes following $ 1014, 18 U. S. C., p. 247.519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT503Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Stevens, J., dissenting1926); 2 United States v. Kreidler, 11 F. Supp. 402, 403 (SDIowa 1935).3 Given these federal cases and the absence ofany common-law precedent for punishing immaterial falsestatements, it is far more likely that the revisers assumedthat all of these statutes included the common-law require-ment of materiality than that congressional silence was intended to make a dramatic change in the law.4 In my judg-ment, the fact that the materiality element had been expressly included in some of the predecessor statutes, andonly implicitly included in the others, explains why theReviser's Note could accurately state that the omission ofthe express reference to materiality was not a "change ofsubstance." 5At least three additional reasons support the conclusionthat the revisers correctly assumed that all of the federalstatutes criminalizing false statements included a materiality requirement that was sometimes implicit and sometimes2 "If the false statements charged and proved were wholly frivolous andunrelated, it would in all probability be concluded that they did not supplythe basis for a prosecution under [the Act]."3 "We may assume that a statement . . . not likely to influence one exercising common prudence and caution, would not support the charge. . . .[I]t must be relevant and material."4 The Court argues that these cases are not persuasive because theydid not hold that the relevant predecessor statutes to $ 1014 contained amateriality requirement. Ante, at 497-498, n. 20. Even if this is true,the fact remains that the only reported cases to address this issue statedthat these statutes did contain a materiality requirement. The naturalinference is that the prevailing view at the time, and therefore the prevailing view of the Congress that enacted $ 1014, was that all "false statements" had to be material to result in criminal penalties. Instead of thesecases, the Court asserts, Congress "likely . . . relied on the clear implication of our 1938 decision in Kay v. United States, 303 U. S. 1." Ante, at498, n. 20. It is difficult to see how Congress could have relied on this"clear implication" when the opinion does not in any way address materiality, but instead holds that reliance is not a requirement of $ 1014. SeeUnited States v. Goberman, 458 F. 2d 226, 229 (CA3 1972); United Statesv. Kernodle, 367 F. Supp. 844, 851-852 (MDNC 1973).5 Historical and Revision Notes following $ 1014, 18 U. S. C., p. 247.519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT504 UNITED STATES v. WELLSStevens, J., dissentingexplicit. First, contrary to the Court's assertion, crimes in-volving "false statements" have a common-law heritage thatincludes an assumption of a materiality requirement. Thisconclusion is consistent with our prior holding that the term"misrepresentation" in $ 10 of the Displaced Persons Act of1948, 62 Stat. 1013, implicitly contained a materiality requirement. See Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S. 490,507-508, and n. 28 (1981). Today the Court discounts thesignificance of that holding because it assumes that at com-mon law there was a critical difference between a "misrepresentation" and a "false statement." Ante, at 491-492, n. 10.However,Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759 (1988), fromwhich the Court draws this inference, made it perfectly clearthat "false statements" share a common-law ancestry with"misrepresentations."6 At common law, neither term included immaterial falsehoods such as mere flattery.76 "The term `material' in $ 1451(a) is not a hapax legomenon. Its use inthe context of false statements to public officials goes back as far as LordCoke, who defined the crime of perjury as follows:" `Perjury is a crime committed, when a lawful oath is ministred by anythat hath authority, to any person, in any judicial proceeding, whosweareth absolutely, and falsly in a manner material to the issue, or causein question, by their own act, or by the subornation of others.' 3 E. Coke,Institutes 164 (6th ed. 1680)."Blackstone used the same term, explaining that in order to constitute`the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury' the false statement `must be insome point material to the question in dispute; for if it only be in sometrifling collateral circumstance, to which no regard is paid,' it is not punishable. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *137. See also 1 W. Hawkins,Pleas of the Crown, ch. 27, $ 8, p. 433 (Curwood ed. 1824). Given thesecommon-law antecedents, it is unsurprising that a number of federal statutes criminalizing false statements to public officials use the term `material.' " 485 U. S., at 769 (some emphases added).See also Saks, United States v. Gaudin: A Decision with Material Impact,64 Ford. L. Rev. 1157, 1163-1166 (1995) (tracing $ 1001 and other federalfalse statement statutes back to the common law).7 Contrary to the Court's assertion, ante, at 491-492, n. 10, I do notassume that when Congress criminalizes an element of a common-lawcrime, the federal offense carries with it every other element of the519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT505Cite as: 519 U.

About 42 of them contain an express materiality requirement; approximately 54do not.8 The kinds of false statements found in the first category 9 are, to my eyes at least, indistinguishable from thosecommon-law crime. I do presume, however, that when Congress criminalizes an element of a common-law crime, it intends that element to havethe same meaning it had at common law.8 Judge Kozinski catalogued these statutes in his dissenting opinion inUnited States v. Gaudin, 28 F. 3d 943, 959-960, nn. 3 and 4 (CA9 1994).He made the assumption (which I share) that a materiality requirement"is probably implied" in every one of these statutes that does not containsuch an express requirement.

Far more likely, in my view, Congress simply assumed--as the Government did in Gaudin--that the materiality requirement would be implied whereverit was not explicit.Third, $ 1014 was revised at a time when a different viewof statutory interpretation held sway. When Congressenacted the current version of the law in 1948, a periodmarked by a spirit of cooperation between Congress and theFederal Judiciary, Congress looked to the courts to play animportant role in the lawmaking process by relying oncommon-law tradition and common sense to fill gaps in thelaw--even to imply causes of action and remedies that werenot set forth in statutory text. It was only three years earlier that one of the greatest judges of the era--indeed, of anyera--had admonished us "not to make a fortress out of thedictionary." Cabell v.

WELLSStevens, J., dissenting1945) (L. Hand, J.) The Court's approach to questions ofstatutory construction has changed significantly since thattime.11 The textual lens through which the Court views thework product of the 1948 revisers is dramatically differentfrom the contemporary legal context in which they labored.In 1948, it was entirely reasonable for Congress and the revisers to assume that the Judiciary would imply a materialityrequirement that was a routine aspect of common-law litigation about false statements.Indeed, subsequent history confirms the reasonableness ofsuch an assumption: The vast majority of judges who haveconfronted the question have found an implicit materialityrequirement in $ 1014. As the Court recognizes, all but oneof the Courts of Appeals have so held. Ante, at 486, n. 3.Moreover, both in this case and in Gaudin the prosecutorinitially proceeded on the assumption that a nonexplicit statute contained an implicit materiality requirement. Onlyafter it failed to convince us in Gaudin that the materialityissue should be resolved by the judge rather than the jurydid the Government switch its position and urge us to rejectthat assumption entirely. IIIBecause precedent and statutory history refute theCourt's position, its decision today must persuade, if at all, onthe basis of its textual analysis. But congressional silencecannot be so convincing when the resulting interpretation isso unlikely.12 Even the Court's recent jurisprudence affirms11 See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 24-26 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgmentin part and dissenting in part).12 In fact, the text of $ 1014 supports the conclusion that "false statement" was intended to cover only material false statements. That statute forbids a person, in the relevant circumstances, to make "any [1] falsestatement or [2] report, or willfully overvalu[ing] any [3] land, [4] propertyor [5] security." 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. The four covered actions other than"false statement[s]" are inherently material. Obviously the overvaluing519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT511Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingthat "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone."Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S.88, 96 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mindful ofthis dictate, the Court has routinely rejected literal statutory interpretations that would lead to anomalous results.SeeINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 454 (1987)(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (citing cases). We havebeen especially willing to reject a purely literal reading of afederal statute that would, as here, expand its coverage farbeyond any common-law antecedent.13 And, as the majorityof any "land, property or security" will be material to any relevant banking transaction. Similarly, the making of a "false report" will presumablybe inherently material since the information requested on the report formwill be that which the bank deems "capable of influencing" its decision.Read in this context, and drawing on standard statutory constructiontechniques, see Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S.117, 129 (1991) (applying "ejusdem generis"--that general terms should beunderstood in context of specific ones); Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.561, 575 (1995) (resolving statutory question problem with "noscitur asociis"--that "a word is known by the company it keeps"), "false statement" means those false statements that are material.13 For instance, in United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64(1994), we held that the "knowingly" requirement of the Protection ofChildren Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, 18 U. S. C. $ 2252, applied to the age of the individual visually depicted. We interpreted thestatute this way even though it flew in the face of the "most natural grammatical reading." 513 U. S., at 68. To hold otherwise, we explained,would lead to results that were "absurd." Similarly, in Staples v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), we held that the National Firearms Act, 26U. S. C. $$ 5801-5872, contained an implicit mens rea requirement althoughone was not apparent on the face of the statute. "Section 5861(d) is silentconcerning the mens rea required for a violation," we explained. 511U. S., at 605. "Nevertheless, silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest that Congress intended to dispense with a conventionalmens rea element . . . ." Ibid.An understanding of these cases also exposes the illogic of the Government's and the Court's reliance on United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10(1994). In Shabani, lacking a clear textual directive, we declined to depart from the common-law tradition of not requiring proof of an overt act519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT512 UNITED STATES v. WELLSStevens, J., dissentingacknowledges, this would not be the first time that we havehad to interpret $ 1014 so that it would not " `make a surprisingly broad range of unremarkable conduct a violation of fed-eral law.' " Ante, at 498 (quoting Williams v. United States,458 U. S. 279, 286-287 (1982)).Congress, the Court seems to recognize, could not haveintended that someone spend up to 30 years in prison forfalsely flattering a bank officer for the purpose of obtain-ing favorable treatment.14 Yet the Court justifies its interpretation of the statute by positing that a literal readingof $ 1014 will not "normally" extend the statute "beyondthe limit that a materiality requirement would impose."Ante, at 499. In making this assertion, the Court correctlyavoids relying on prosecutors not to bring frivolous cases.15to establish conspiracy. In this case, of course, the Government asks usto do the opposite: to derogate the common law without clear congressional approval.14 Consider the following scenario. A crafty homeowner in need of amortgage, having learned that the bank's loan officer is a bow tie aficionado, purchases his first bow tie to wear at their first meeting. As expected, the loan officer is wearing such a tie, which, incidentally, the prospective borrower considers downright ugly. Nevertheless, thinking thatflattery will increase the likelihood that the officer will be favorably disposed to approving the loan, the applicant swallows hard and complimentsthe officer on his tie; he then volunteers the information that he too alwayswears a bow tie. This is a lie. Under the majority's interpretation, thisperson could spend 30 years in federal prison. He made a "false statement." 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. In fact, until that day he had never worn abow tie. And the statement was made "for the purpose of influencing"the bank. Ibid. The applicant subjectively hoped that the loan officer--flattered and feeling a sartorial common ground--would be more likely toapprove his mortgage.15 It is well settled that courts will not rely on "prosecutorial discretion"to ensure that a statute does not ensnare those beyond its proper confines.See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 373-374 (1964) ("It will not do to saythat a prosecutor's sense of fairness and the Constitution would prevent asuccessful . . . prosecution for some of the activities seemingly embracedwithin the sweeping statutory definitions"); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 599 (1967) ("It is no answer519us2$30I 06-07-99 18:16:01 PAGES OPFXPGT513Cite as: 519 U. S. 482 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingRather, it appears to have made an empirical judgment thatfalse statements will not "usually" be about a trivial matter,and that the Government will " `relatively rare[ly]' " be ableto prove that nonmaterial statements were made for the purpose "of influencing a decision." Ibid. I am not at all sure,nor do I know how the Court determined, that attemptedflattery is less common than false statements about materialfacts. Even if it were, the "unusual" nature of trivial statements provides scant justification for reaching the conclusionthat Congress intended such peccadillos to constitute afelony. IVToday the Court misconstrues $ 1014, its history, and ourprecedents in holding that the statute does not contain abasic materiality requirement. In doing so, the Court con-fidently asserts that almost every court to interpret $ 1014,the revisers of the statute, and the courts discussing Kaywere all simply wrong. Unwarranted confidence in one'sown ability to ascertain the truth has prompted many a vic-tim of deception to make the false statement that "flatterywill get you nowhere." It now appears that flattery mayget you into a federal prison.I respectfully dissent.to say that the statute would not be applied in such a case"). Prosecutorsnecessarily enjoy much discretion and generally use it wisely. But theliberty of our citizens cannot rest at the whim of an individual who couldhave a grudge or, perhaps, just exercise bad judgment.05-12-99 06:52:35 519BV$noteReporter's NoteThe next page is purposely numbered 801.

Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 177 (1996)(Scalia, J., dissenting), our practice of granting certiorari, vacat-ing the judgment below, and remanding for further proceedingsin light of intervening developments apparently began when wefirst set aside the judgments of state supreme courts to allowthose courts to consider the impact of state statutes enacted aftertheir judgments had been entered. E. g., Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 273 U. S. 126 (1927). By1945, the practice of vacating state judgments in light of supervening events had become so commonplace that we could describeit as "[a] customary procedure." State Farm Mut. AutomobileIns. Co. v. Duel, 324 U. S. 154, 161. "Similarly, where a federalcourt of appeals' decision on a point of state law had been cast indoubt by an intervening state supreme court decision, it became519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)914 OCTOBER TERM, 1996Scalia, J., concurring 519 U. S.our practice to vacate and remand so that the question could bedecided by judges `familiar with the intricacies and trends of locallaw and practice.' " Lawrence, supra, at 180 (Scalia, J., dissent-ing) (quoting Huddleston v. Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232, 237 (1944)).See also Conner v. Simler, 367 U. S. 486 (1961); cf. Omaha Nat.Bank v. Nebraskans for Independent Banking, Inc., 426 U. S. 310(1976) (GVR'ing in light of an intervening state statute).Thus, the present case falls squarely within our historical useof the GVR mechanism. The Supreme Court of Georgia's deci-sion in Banks v. ICI Americas, Inc., 266 Ga. 607, 609-610, 469S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1996) (Banks II), handed down after the Courtof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit's decision, makes clear thatthe Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of Georgia law was incorrect.The sequence of events was as follows: After the Court of Appealshad issued its per curiam opinion affirming the District Court'sentry of summary judgment against petitioners, the Georgia Supreme Court, in Banks v. I. C. I., 264 Ga. 732, 450 S. E. 2d 671(1994) (Banks I), in effect overruled the Georgia case that wasthe basis for the District Court's holding. Petitioners' petition tothe Eleventh Circuit for rehearing was denied, the only explanation given being that "the holding of the Georgia Supreme Courtin [Banks I] would not apply to the injuries involved in this case"because that holding had no retroactive application. Thomas v.American Home Products, Inc., No. 93-9214 (CA11 1996), App.to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Shortly before the present petition for writof certiorari was filed, the Supreme Court of Georgia held inBanks II that Banks I was retroactive.The Chief Justice points out that "[p]etitioners' request forrelief meets none of the tests set forth in this Court's Rule 10,`Considerations Governing Review on Certiorari.' " Post, at 916.That is certainly so. Of course as this Court's Rule 10 itselfmakes plain, those tests "neither control[l] nor fully measur[e] theCourt's discretion," but rather merely "indicate the character ofthe reasons the Court considers" in deciding whether to grantcertiorari. More importantly, however, we have never regardedRule 10, which indicates the general character of reasons forwhich we will grant plenary consideration, as applicable to ourpractice of GVR'ing. See, e. g., Lawrence v. Chater, supra, at166-167. Indeed, most of the cases in which we exercise ourpower to GVR plainly do not meet the "tests" set forth in Rule519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)915ORDERSScalia, J., concurring91310. See, e. g., Schmidt v. Espy, 513 U. S. 801 (1994) (GVR in lightof administrative reinterpretations of federal statutes); Crouse v.United States, ante, p. 801 (GVR in light of Koon v. United States,518 U. S. 81 (1996)); Greater N. O. Broadcasting v. United States,ante, p. 801 (GVR in light of 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island,517 U. S. 484 (1996)).We are not remanding this state-law case, as The Chief Jus-tice suggests, because the Eleventh Circuit failed to prophesythe course that the Supreme Court of Georgia would ultimatelytake, see post, at 917, any more than we remand federal-law casesin light of intervening decisions of this Court because the courtof appeals failed adequately to predict how we would decide. Inboth instances, we are vacating the decision below to allow theCourt of Appeals to consider an intervening decision of the Courtthat is the final expositor of a particular body of law--with federalquestions, the Supreme Court of the United States, and withquestions of Georgia law, the Supreme Court of Georgia. Weassuredly would not decline to GVR a case affected by one of ourown intervening decisions merely because the case "is of no gen-eral importance beyond the interest of the parties." Post, at 917.Almost all of our GVR's fit this description--for example, themany cases GVR'd in recent months in light of our decision inBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), e. g., Cuellar v.United States, 518 U. S. 1014 (1996). I can think of no possiblereason why we would routinely GVR "unimportant" cases in lightof our own opinions but not in light of state supreme court opinions, unless, of course, we have less regard for the federal courts'correct application of state law than for their correct applicationof federal law--an attitude we should certainly not acknowledge.I do not shareThe Chief Justice's fear that our action todaywill flood the Court with applications to review questions of statelaw by petitioners "unhappy" with the result below. Post, at 917.As I have described, today's action breaks no new ground butmerely continues a longstanding practice. It does not involve usin an intensive review of state law, but requires only the simpledetermination (rarely available) that the federal-court decision onstate law appears to contradict a subsequent decision of the statesupreme court. When the conflict is of "far more dubious . . .relevance" than the one at issue here, ibid., we can and shouldexercise our discretion to deny the petition for writ of certiorari.519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)916 OCTOBER TERM, 1996Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting 519 U. S.Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Breyerjoins, dissenting.This is a personal-injury, products-liability case which is in thefederal court system by virtue of diversity of citizenship. TheCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a grant ofsummary judgment against petitioners by the District Court, andpetitioners have sought review here. In a supplemental brieffiled after their petition, they have called attention to the decisionof the Supreme Court of Georgia, Banks v. ICI Americas, Inc.,266 Ga. 607, 609-610, 469 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1996), handed downon April 29, 1996, 21/2 months after the Court of Appeals deniedrehearing.Petitioners' request for relief meets none of the tests set forthin this Court's Rule 10, "Considerations Governing Review onCertiorari." The first of these considerations, as outlined in theRule, is if a court of appeals has rendered a decision in conflictwith the decision of another United States court of appeals, orhas decided a federal question in a way which conflicts with thedecision of a state court of last resort, or "has so far departedfrom the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings . . . asto call for an exercise of this Court's supervisory power." Thereis clearly no conflict between courts of appeals in this case, nordo petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals for the EleventhCircuit has decided a federal question in a way which conflictswith a state court of last resort. Nor could it be claimed thatthe Court of Appeals departed from the accepted and usual courseof judicial proceedings, since the decision of the Supreme Courtof Georgia in Banks was handed down more than two monthsafter the Court of Appeals denied rehearing.The other considerations governing review of certiorari likewise have no application to this case. The Court of Appeals herehas not decided an important question of federal law which shouldbe settled by this Court, or decided a federal question in a waythat conflicts with applicable decisions of this Court.Thus, one must ask, why is this Court intervening to vacate andremand this case to the Court of Appeals? The Court's answer, Isuspect, would be that Banks suggests that the Court of Appealsmay have wrongly decided an issue of Georgia law in the case.But this Court's function, generally speaking, is not to correctfederal courts' misapplications of state law, except, perhaps, inexceptional cases with importance beyond the parties' particular519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)917ORDERSRehnquist, C. J., dissenting913dispute. This is not such an exceptional case; there is no reasonto think that the Eleventh Circuit will not apply Banks faithfullyin future cases. Nor is this a case which we must, for one reasonor another, decide on the merits and where the views of anothercourt as to the intervening state-law decision might be useful, ora case where certiorari has already been granted and the caseargued on the merits. See Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163,176 (1996) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in No. 94-9323 and dissenting in No. 94-8988) (citing and distinguishing cases).To be sure, there is a "special deference owed to state law andstate courts in our system of federalism," id., at 179 (Scalia, J.,dissenting), but by failing to predict the Georgia Supreme Court'sBanks decision the Eleventh Circuit has in no way slighted theState of Georgia or upset the balance of our federalism. I do notbelieve that this Court has a stake in the correctness of discretestate-law decisions by federal courts, nor, in such cases, any " `obligat[ion] to weigh justice among contesting parties.' " Lawrence,supra, at 177 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in No. 94-9323 anddissenting in No. 94-8988) (quoting 2 H. Pringle, The Life andTimes of William Howard Taft 997-998 (1939)).I trust I am correct in thinking that the Court would not grantcertiorari in this case to decide whether or not the decision ofthe Supreme Court of Georgia in Banks requires a different outcome than that reached below. I am equally sanguine that theCourt would not summarily reverse the decision of the Court ofAppeals on a question of Georgia law, a subject about which thatcourt knows a great deal more than we do. Because we are onlygranting, vacating, and remanding to the Court of Appeals, theCourt's action may seem more palatable here. But I believe it isjust as incorrect as would be our deciding the merits of a questionof state law in some other diversity case which is of no generalimportance beyond the interest of the parties. The decision tovacate and remand in this case doubtless seems an easy one tothose who join it; the Court of Appeals specifically mentioned theretroactivity issue later decided in Banks in its opinion denyingrehearing, and respondents have filed no response to petitioners'supplemental brief. But today's action will encourage numeroussimilar requests from other parties unhappy with the decision ofa court of appeals in their diversity cases, and the relevance ofthe intervening factors which they urge may be far more dubiousthan is the relevance of Banks to this case.519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)918 OCTOBER TERM, 1996October 15, 1996 519 U.

The typical active judge of the Court of Ap-peals for the Eleventh Circuit participates in somewhere between150 and 200 panel decisions each year. For us to require a busycourt to once more revisit the merits of this state-law disputegives these petitioners more of the time and resources of thefederal judicial system than they deserve.I dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.No. 95-1830.

Delay in the execution of judgments imposing the death penalty frustrates the public interest in deterrenceand eviscerates the only rational justification for that type ofpunishment.1 From the standpoint of the defendant, the delaycan become so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.2 Unfortunately,1 See, e. g., Kozinski & Gallagher, Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence,46 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 1, 4 (1995) ("Whatever purposes the death penaltyis said to serve--deterrence, retribution, assuaging the pain suffered by victims' families--these purposes are not served by the system as it now oper-ates"); Powell, Commentary: Capital Punishment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1035(1989) ("[Y]ears of delay between sentencing and execution . . . undermin[e]the deterrent effect of capital punishment and reduc[e] public confidence inthe criminal justice system").2 See Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., respecting denialof certiorari); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 312 (1972) (White, J., con-curring in judgment) (noting that when the death penalty "ceases realistically to further [the aims of deterrence and retribution] its imposition wouldthen be the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal con519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)919ORDERSOctober 15, 1996519 U. S.however, the Court has exhibited a callous indifference to theseconcerns, first by refusing to hear the claims of two inmates whohave suffered under a "sword of Damocles" since they were firstsentenced to death in 1978 and 1979,3 and now by ordering aremand that can serve no purpose other than to delay the conclusion of these cases.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that thesetwo respondents may be put to death by lethal injection, but thatusing the gas chamber to carry out the sentence is constitutionallyimpermissible. Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F. 3d 301, 309 (1996). Subsequent to that decision the California Legislature amended theState's death penalty statute to provide that lethal injectionsshould be used to carry out death sentences unless the defendantrequests that the State use the gas chamber. See Cal. PenalCode Ann. $ 3604(b) (West Supp. 1996). Thus, under either theterms of the new statute or the terms of the judgment of theCourt of Appeals, lethal injections will be used to carry out theserespondents' sentences. It seems perfectly clear that nothing butdelay will be accomplished by this Court's decision to vacate thejudgment of the Court of Appeals and to remand for furtherproceedings in the light of the new statute.

Reported below: 69 F. 3d 878.Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and JusticeThomas join, dissenting.This case arises from the 1990 action of the Department of theInterior acquiring 91 acres in trust for the Lower Brule Tribe ofthe Sioux Indians, pursuant to $ 5 of the 1934 Indian Reorganizations Act (IRA), 48 Stat. 985, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 465. Re-spondents challenged this action in Federal District Court, contending both that the Department's particular action violated theAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 706, and thatthe Secretary's statutory authority to acquire lands under theIRA is unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative power.Throughout this litigation, until now, it has been the Department's position that IRA land acquisitions are unreviewable underthe APA because they fall within the exception for matters "committed to agency discretion by law." $ 701(a)(2). The DistrictCourt agreed that APA review was unavailable, although on different grounds, holding that since the United States had acquiredtitle, the Quiet Title Act (QTA), 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a, provided thesole statutory means of challenging the action, and that the QTAexplicitly prohibits actions challenging title to Indian lands. TheDistrict Court also upheld the Secretary's constitutional authorityto acquire land on behalf of the United States under the IRA.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however, reversedon the ground that $ 5 of the IRA constitutes a delegation oflegislative power to the Secretary of the Interior and is henceunconstitutional. 69 F. 3d 878 (1995).Following the Eighth Circuit's sweeping decision, the Department of the Interior did an about-face with regard to the availability of judicial review under the APA. It promulgated a newregulation providing that "the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register, or in a newspaper of general circulation servingthe affected area a notice of his/her decision to take land intotrust," and that "the Secretary shall acquire title in the name ofthe United States no sooner than 30 days after the notice ispublished." Department of the Interior, Land Acquisitions (Nongaming), 61 Fed. Reg. 18083 (1996) (to be codified at 25 CFR$ 151.12). The preamble to that regulation recites that it is beingadopted "[i]n response to a recent court decision, State of South519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)921ORDERSScalia, J., dissenting919Dakota v. U. S. Department of the Interior, 69 F. 3d 878 (8th Cir.1995)," and asserts that the procedure it sets forth "permits judicial review before transfer of title to the United States." TheSolicitor General now represents to us that it is the position ofthe Department of the Interior, as well as that of the Departmentof Justice, that judicial review of an IRA land trust acquisitionmay be obtained by filing suit within the 30-day waiting period,although action will continue to be barred by the QTA after theUnited States formally acquires title.The decision today--to grant, vacate, and remand in light ofthe Government's changed position--is both unprecedented andinexplicable. This Court has in recent years occasionally entereda "GVR" in light of a position newly taken by the Solicitor Gen-eral where the United States was the prevailing party below.See, e. g., Stutson v. United States, 516 U. S. 193 (1996) (per cu-riam); Schmidt v. Espy, 513 U. S. 801 (1994); Wells v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 1050 (1994); Reed v. United States, 510 U. S. 1188(1994); Chappell v. United States, 494 U. S. 1075 (1990). Eventhat extension of our earlier practice is in my view unsound. SeeLawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 168, 184-186 (1995) (Scalia, J.,dissenting). But we have never before GVR'd simply becausethe Government, having lost below, wishes to try out a new legalposition. The unfairness of such a practice to the litigant whoprevailed in the court of appeals is obvious. ("Heads I win big,"says the Government; "tails we come back down and litigate againon the basis of a more moderate Government theory.") Today'sdecision encourages the Government to do what it did here: to"go for broke" in the courts of appeals, rather than get the lawright the first time.What makes today's action inexplicable as well as unprecedented is the fact that the Government's change of legal positiondoes not even purport to be applicable to the present case. TheGovernment now concedes only that APA review is available be-fore the Secretary's taking of title under the IRA; it has notaltered its view that once title has passed to the United StatesAPA review is precluded by the QTA. 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a(a); Pet.for Cert. 7. Since in this case title has passed, the Government'sposition in the present litigation remains what it was: Judicialreview is unavailable.The Government contends, however, that the Court of Appeals'determination that the IRA was a delegation of legislative powerwas based in part upon the unavailability of judicial review. I519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)922 OCTOBER TERM, 1996Scalia, J., dissenting 519 U. S.fail to see how the availability of judicial review has anything todo with that question; perhaps the Court of Appeals thoughtotherwise, though its opinion on this point is somewhat contradic-tory.* If, however, judicial reviewability was germane to theCourt of Appeals' judgment, surely it was only such reviewabilityas would exist of right, and not such as would be accorded onlyat the discretion of the agency. It is merely the latter that wehave here: The Government concedes only that, if the Secretarychooses to announce his acquisition decision before the acquisitionbecomes effective (as the new regulation graciously requires),judicial review is available. It is inconceivable that thisreviewability-at-the-pleasure-of-the-Secretary could affect theconstitutionality of the IRA in anyone's view, including that ofthe Court of Appeals.Finally, the existence of the new regulation does not make thisa case in which a postjudgment change in the law applicable tothe dispute warrants a remand. The preamble to the regulationacknowledges that "the Eighth Circuit decision precludes the Secretary from taking into trust the land at issue in that particularcase," and explicitly states that "[t]he procedure announced intoday's rule . . . will apply to all pending and future trust acquisi-tions." 61 Fed. Reg. 18083 (1996) (emphasis added). Of coursethat statement merely recites the obvious, since, title alreadyhaving been acquired in this case, it is quite impossible for theSecretary to provide 30-day advance notice of intent to take title.Evidently for that reason, the Government asks this Court, if itdeclines to grant certiorari, not merely to GVR, but to do so "withinstructions that the judgment of the district court sustaining theSecretary's decision also be vacated and that the matter, in turn,be remanded to the Secretary of the Interior for reconsiderationand issuance of a new administrative decision." Pet. for Cert.25. I cannot imagine where we would derive the authority forthis. If, as the Government asserts in its brief, statutory judicial*At one point the court quoted approvingly its statement in United Statesv. Garfinkel, 29 F. 3d 451, 459 (CA8 1994), that " `[j]udicial review is a factorweighing in favor of upholding a statute against a nondelegation challenge.' "69 F. 3d 878, 882 (1995). This seems inconsistent, however, with the approach the court takes elsewhere in its opinion, when it says: "We doubtwhether the Quiet Title Act precludes APA review of agency action bywhich the United States acquires title. But given our conclusion that $ 465is an unconstitutional delegation of power, we need not decide this issue."Id., at 881, n. 1.519ORD$$1b 06-09-99 12:44:01 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)923ORDERSOctober 15, 1996519 U. S.review of a land-trust decision under $ 5 of the IRA is unavailableonce title has passed to the United States, then certainly federalcourts cannot construct the necessary conditions for judicial re-view by simply ordering the land acquisition undone.In sum, there is no basis in precedent or in reason for a GVRin the present case.

Angelone, Director, Virginia Department ofCorrections v. Bennett. Application to vacate the stay of execution of sentence of death granted by the United States Courtof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on October 23, 1996, presentedto The Chief Justice, and by him referred to the Court,granted.Justice Stevens, dissenting.A procedural issue of greater importance than the timing ofrespondent's execution is presented by the application to vacatethe stay entered by the Court of Appeals. In Title I of theAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat.1217, Congress significantly limited the authority of the federalcourts to entertain second or successive habeas corpus applications by state prisoners. See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651(1996). That action by Congress increases the importance ofmaking sure that the courts have a full and fair opportunity toconsider the first federal petition filed by such prisoners.In this case, the Director of the Virginia Department of Correc-tions has asked this Court to take the extraordinary step of vacat519ORD$$1d 06-09-99 12:44:02 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)960 OCTOBER TERM, 1996Breyer, J., dissenting 519 U. S.ing a stay that the Court of Appeals had entered to enable adeath row inmate to have the time available to all other litigantsto file a petition for certiorari to review the denial of his firstfederal habeas corpus petition. Evenhanded administration ofthis Court's Rules counsels against action that affords such specialtreatment to the director. Moreover, the Court's decision to vacate the stay creates a precedent that will invite wardens gener-ally to ask us routinely to expedite our processing of certioraripetitions in similar cases. Given the irreparable consequences oferror in a capital case, I believe we should steadfastly resist thetemptation to endorse procedural shortcuts that can only increasethe risk of error. In response to the congressional decision effectively to limit death row inmates to one meaningful opportunityto obtain federal habeas corpus relief, we should give greater,rather than less, scrutiny to a death row inmate's allegations inhis first federal habeas petition.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.Our cases make clear that a court of appeals should grant astay (to permit application for a writ of certiorari) only in aspecial case--a case presenting a significant likelihood of a grant.E. g., Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951 (1995). There is noreason to believe that the Court of Appeals was unaware of theTuggle standard when it granted the motion to stay Bennett'sexecution. Even if it mispredicted this Court's eventual view ofthe case, it did not act unreasonably in doing so. See 92 F. 3d1336, 1345 (CA4 1996) (describing the prosecutor's closing argu-ment at Bennett's trial as "highly improper" and deserving"strong condemnation"). Further, the Court of Appeals issuedits stay to permit this Court to review a first habeas petition.The petitioner, in other words, simply has used, not abused, thewrit. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) (placing strict limits on subsequenthabeas corpus applications).Given these circumstances, I can find no special reason for thisCourt to curtail the certiorari time normally available or, in ef-fect, to make its certiorari decision on a schedule determined bythe State's execution timetable, rather than by this Court's Rules.Compare this Court's Rule 13.1 (providing for 90-day filing period)with Va. Code Ann. $ 53.1-232.1 (Supp. 1996) (providing for maxi519ORD$$1d 06-09-99 12:44:02 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)961ORDERSNovember 4, 1996519 U. S.mum 60-day period before execution). Thus, I would permit thisstay of execution to remain in place pending the filing and consideration of Bennett's petition for certiorari.No. D-1708. In re Disbarment of Lehman. Disbarmententered.

O'Dell v. Netherland, Warden, etal. C. A. 4th Cir. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed informa pauperis granted. Certiorari granted limited to Questions1 and 2 presented by the petition. Brief of petitioner is tobe filed with the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel on orbefore 3 p.m., Thursday, January 30, 1997. Brief of respondentsis to be filed with the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel onor before 3 p.m., Thursday, February 27, 1997.

Reported below: 95 F. 3d 1214.Statement of Justice Scalia respecting the grant of certiorari.My vote was to deny the petition for certiorari in this case(and hence to deny the application for stay of execution), but Ithink it important to point out that the issue on which certiorarihas been granted, and for which stay has been accorded, hasnothing to do with O'Dell's claimed innocence of his crime. TheCourt has expressly limited its grant of review to Questions 1and 2 of the petition for certiorari, which present the legal issueof whether our decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S.154 (1994)--holding that a capital sentencing jury must in certaincircumstances be instructed on the possibility of life imprisonmentwithout parole as an alternative to a death sentence--has retroac-tive application to persons tried before Simmons was decided.We have not granted certiorari on Question 3, the actual-innocence claim based upon newly available DNA evidence. Thatclaim has been rejected by every one of the 13 Court of AppealsJudges who have heard this case, as well as by the District Courtthat originally considered the claim. 95 F. 3d 1214, 1246-1254(CA4 1996) (en banc); id., at 1255-1256 (Ervin, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part); id., at 1218 (describing District Courtdecision). The unanimity of these 14 federal judges is unsurprising when the full story of the DNA evidence is told. While theDNA tests showed that blood stains on O'Dell's shirt did not come519ORD$$1i 06-09-99 12:44:02 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1051ORDERSDecember 19, 24, 27, 30, 1996519 U. S.from the murder victim, Helen Schartner, they also showed thatblood stains on his jacket did come from the victim--a conclusionconsistent with the overwhelming evidence at trial that bloodstains on numerous pieces of O'Dell's clothing came from her. Id.,at 1247-1248. Not one of the judges reviewing this evidence hasbeen persuaded of O'Dell's innocence.December 24, 1996Miscellaneous OrdersNo. 95-8736. Ogbomon v. United States. C.

The following, al-though neither controlling nor fully measuring the Court'sdiscretion, indicate the character of the reasons the Courtconsiders:(a) a United States court of appeals has entered adecision in conflict with the decision of another UnitedStates court of appeals on the same important matter;has decided an important federal question in a way that519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1168 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTconflicts with a decision by a state court of last resort;or has so far departed from the accepted and usualcourse of judicial proceedings, or sanctioned such a de-parture by a lower court, as to call for an exercise ofthis Court's supervisory power;(b) a state court of last resort has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with thedecision of another state court of last resort or of aUnited States court of appeals;(c) a state court or a United States court of appealshas decided an important question of federal law thathas not been, but should be, settled by this Court, orhas decided an important federal question in a way thatconflicts with relevant decisions of this Court.A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when theasserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or themisapplication of a properly stated rule of law.Rule 11. Certiorari to a United States Court of AppealsBefore JudgmentA petition for a writ of certiorari to review a case pendingin a United States court of appeals, before judgment is entered in that court, will be granted only upon a showing thatthe case is of such imperative public importance as to justifydeviation from normal appellate practice and to requireimmediate determination in this Court. See 28 U. S. C.$ 2101(e).Rule 12. Review on Certiorari: How Sought; Parties1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Rule, the peti-tioner shall file 40 copies of a petition for a writ of certiorari,prepared as required by Rule 33.1, and shall pay the Rule38(a) docket fee.2. A petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule39 shall file an original and 10 copies of a petition for a writof certiorari prepared as required by Rule 33.2, togetherwith an original and 10 copies of the motion for leave toproceed in forma pauperis. A copy of the motion shall pre519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1169RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTcede and be attached to each copy of the petition. An in-mate confined in an institution, if proceedingin formapauperis and not represented by counsel, need file onlyan original petition and motion.3. Whether prepared under Rule 33.1 or Rule 33.2, thepetition shall comply in all respects with Rule 14 and shallbe submitted with proof of service as required by Rule 29.The case then will be placed on the docket. It is the petitioner's duty to notify all respondents promptly, on a formsupplied by the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the casewas placed on the docket, and the docket number of the case.The notice shall be served as required by Rule 29.4. Parties interested jointly, severally, or otherwise in ajudgment may petition separately for a writ of certiorari; orany two or more may join in a petition. A party not shownon the petition as joined therein at the time the petition isfiled may not later join in that petition. When two or morejudgments are sought to be reviewed on a writ of certiorarito the same court and involve identical or closely relatedquestions, a single petition for a writ of certiorari coveringall the judgments suffices. A petition for a writ of certiorarimay not be joined with any other pleading, except that anymotion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall beattached.5. No more than 30 days after a case has been placed onthe docket, a respondent seeking to file a conditional cross-petition (i. e., a cross-petition that otherwise would be untimely) shall file, with proof of service as required by Rule29, 40 copies of the cross-petition prepared as required byRule 33.1, except that a cross-petitioner proceeding in formapauperis under Rule 39 shall comply with Rule 12.2. Thecross-petition shall comply in all respects with this Rule andRule 14, except that material already reproduced in the appendix to the opening petition need not be reproduced again.A cross-petitioning respondent shall pay the Rule 38(a)docket fee or submit a motion for leave to proceed in formapauperis. The cover of the cross-petition shall indicateclearly that it is a conditional cross-petition. The cross519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1170 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTpetition then will be placed on the docket, subject to theprovisions of Rule 13.4. It is the cross-petitioner's duty tonotify all cross-respondents promptly, on a form supplied bythe Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the cross-petitionwas placed on the docket, and the docket number of thecross-petition. The notice shall be served as required byRule 29. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari may notbe joined with any other pleading, except that any motionfor leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall be attached.The time to file a conditional cross-petition will not beextended.6. All parties to the proceeding in the court whose judg-ment is sought to be reviewed are deemed parties entitledto file documents in this Court, unless the petitioner notifiesthe Clerk of this Court in writing of the petitioner's beliefthat one or more of the parties below have no interest in theoutcome of the petition. A copy of such notice shall beserved as required by Rule 29 on all parties to the proceeding below. A party noted as no longer interested may re-main a party by notifying the Clerk promptly, with serviceon the other parties, of an intention to remain a party. Allparties other than the petitioner are considered respondents,but any respondent who supports the position of a petitionershall meet the petitioner's time schedule for filing documents, except that a response supporting the petition shallbe filed within 20 days after the case is placed on the docket,and that time will not be extended. Parties who file no document will not qualify for any relief from this Court.7. The clerk of the court having possession of the recordshall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to cer-tify and transmit it. In any document filed with this Court,a party may cite or quote from the record, even if it hasnot been transmitted to this Court. When requested by theClerk of this Court to certify and transmit the record, or anypart of it, the clerk of the court having possession of therecord shall number the documents to be certified and shalltransmit therewith a numbered list specifically identifyingeach document transmitted. If the record, or stipulated por519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1171RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTtions, have been printed for the use of the court below, thatprinted record, plus the proceedings in the court below, maybe certified as the record unless one of the parties or theClerk of this Court requests otherwise. The record mayconsist of certified copies, but if the lower court is of theview that original documents of any kind should be seen bythis Court, that court may provide by order for the trans-port, safekeeping, and return of such originals.Rule 13. Review on Certiorari: Time for Petitioning1. Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for a writof certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a state court of last resort or a United Statescourt of appeals (including the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) is timely when it is filed withthe Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of thejudgment. A petition for a writ of certiorari seeking reviewof a judgment of a lower state court that is subject to discretionary review by the state court of last resort is timelywhen it is filed with the Clerk within 90 days after entry ofthe order denying discretionary review.2. The Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari that is jurisdictionally out of time. See, e. g., 28U. S. C. $ 2101(c).3. The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runsfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to bereviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (orits equivalent under local practice). But if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, thetime to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties(whether or not they requested rehearing or joined in thepetition for rehearing) runs from the date of the denial ofthe petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing isgranted, the subsequent entry of judgment. A suggestionmade to a United States court of appeals for a rehearing enbanc is not a petition for rehearing within the meaning ofthis Rule unless so treated by the United States court ofappeals.519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1172 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT4. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is timely whenit is filed with the Clerk as provided in paragraphs 1, 3, and5 of this Rule, or in Rule 12.5. However, a conditionalcross-petition (which except for Rule 12.5 would be untimely)will not be granted unless another party's timely petition fora writ of certiorari is granted.5. For good cause, a Justice may extend the time to file apetition for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding 60days. An application to extend the time to file shall set outthe basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgmentsought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and anyorder respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons whyan extension of time is justified. The application must bereceived by the Clerk at least 10 days before the date thepetition is due, except in extraordinary circumstances. Forthe time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules21, 22, 30, and 33.2. An application to extend the time tofile a petition for a writ of certiorari is not favored.Rule 14. Content of a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari1. A petition for a writ of certiorari shall contain, in theorder indicated:(a) The questions presented for review, expressed con-cisely in relation to the circumstances of the case, withoutunnecessary detail.

The questions shallbe set out on the first page following the cover, and no otherinformation may appear on that page. The statement of anyquestion presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiaryquestion fairly included therein. Only the questions set outin the petition, or fairly included therein, will be consideredby the Court.(b) A list of all parties to the proceeding in the courtwhose judgment is sought to be reviewed (unless the captionof the case contains the names of all the parties), and a list519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1173RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTof parent companies and nonwholly owned subsidiaries asrequired by Rule 29.6.(c) If the petition exceeds five pages, a table of contentsand a table of cited authorities.(d) Citations of the official and unofficial reports of theopinions and orders entered in the case by courts or administrative agencies.(e) A concise statement of the basis for jurisdiction in thisCourt, showing:(i) the date the judgment or order sought to be re-viewed was entered (and, if applicable, a statement thatthe petition is filed under this Court's Rule 11);(ii) the date of any order respecting rehearing, andthe date and terms of any order granting an extensionof time to file the petition for a writ of certiorari;(iii) express reliance on Rule 12.5, when a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is filed under that Rule,and the date of docketing of the petition for a writ ofcertiorari in connection with which the cross-petition isfiled;(iv) the statutory provision believed to confer on thisCourt jurisdiction to review on a writ of certiorari thejudgment or order in question; and(v) if applicable, a statement that the notificationsrequired by Rule 29.4(b) or (c) have been made.(f) The constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, ordi-nances, and regulations involved in the case, set out verbatim with appropriate citation. If the provisions involved arelengthy, their citation alone suffices at this point, and theirpertinent text shall be set out in the appendix referred to insubparagraph 1(i).(g) A concise statement of the case setting out the factsmaterial to consideration of the questions presented, and alsocontaining the following:(i) If review of a state-court judgment is sought, spec-ification of the stage in the proceedings, both in thecourt of first instance and in the appellate courts, when519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1174 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTthe federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised;the method or manner of raising them and the way inwhich they were passed on by those courts; and perti-nent quotations of specific portions of the record or summary thereof, with specific reference to the places in therecord where the matter appears (e. g., court opinion,ruling on exception, portion of court's charge and excep-tion thereto, assignment of error), so as to show that thefederal question was timely and properly raised and thatthis Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment on awrit of certiorari. When the portions of the record re-lied on under this subparagraph are voluminous, theyshall be included in the appendix referred to in subpara-graph 1(i).(ii) If review of a judgment of a United States courtof appeals is sought, the basis for federal jurisdiction inthe court of first instance.(h) A direct and concise argument amplifying the reasonsrelied on for allowance of the writ. See Rule 10.(i) An appendix containing, in the order indicated:(i) the opinions, orders, findings of fact, and conclu-sions of law, whether written or orally given and transcribed, entered in conjunction with the judgmentsought to be reviewed;(ii) any other relevant opinions, orders, findings offact, and conclusions of law entered in the case by courtsor administrative agencies, and, if reference thereto isnecessary to ascertain the grounds of the judgment, ofthose in companion cases (each document shall includethe caption showing the name of the issuing court oragency, the title and number of the case, and the dateof entry);(iii) any order on rehearing, including the captionshowing the name of the issuing court, the title andnumber of the case, and the date of entry;(iv) the judgment sought to be reviewed if the dateof its entry is different from the date of the opinion519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1175RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTor order required in sub-subparagraph (i) of thissubparagraph;(v) material required by subparagraphs 1(f) or1(g)(i); and(vi) any other material the petitioner believes essen-tial to understand the petition.If the material required by this subparagraph is voluminous,it may be presented in a separate volume or volumes withappropriate covers.2.

A petition for a writ of certiorari should be statedbriefly and in plain terms and may not exceed the page limi-tations specified in Rule 33.4. The failure of a petitioner to present with accuracy,brevity, and clarity whatever is essential to ready and adequate understanding of the points requiring consideration issufficient reason for the Court to deny a petition.5. If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timelyand in good faith is in a form that does not comply with thisRule or with Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerk will return itwith a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected petitionreceived no more than 60 days after the date of the Clerk'sletter will be deemed timely.Rule 15. Briefs in Opposition; Reply Briefs;Supplemental Briefs1. A brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorarimay be filed by the respondent in any case, but is not mandatory except in a capital case, see Rule 14.1(a), or whenordered by the Court.2.

In addition to presenting other arguments519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1176 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTfor denying the petition, the brief in opposition should ad-dress any perceived misstatement of fact or law in the petition that bears on what issues properly would be before theCourt if certiorari were granted. Counsel are admonishedthat they have an obligation to the Court to point out in thebrief in opposition, and not later, any perceived misstatementmade in the petition.

If anotice of appeal has been filed, but the case has not beenplaced on this Court's docket within the time prescribed fordocketing, the district court may dismiss the appeal on theappellee's motion, with notice to all parties, and may makeany just order with respect to costs. If the district courthas denied the appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal, theappellee may move this Court to docket and dismiss the appeal by filing an original and 10 copies of a motion presentedin conformity with Rules 21 and 33.2.

If consideration of jurisdictionis postponed, counsel, at the outset of their briefs and at oralargument, shall address the question of jurisdiction. If therecord has not previously been filed in this Court, the Clerkof this Court will request the clerk of the court in possessionof the record to certify and transmit it.13. If the Clerk determines that a jurisdictional statementsubmitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does notcomply with this Rule or with Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerkwill return it with a letter indicating the deficiency.

A United States court of appeals may certify to thisCourt a question or proposition of law on which it seeks instruction for the proper decision of a case. The certificate519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1184 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTshall contain a statement of the nature of the case and thefacts on which the question or proposition of law arises.Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, andthey shall be stated separately and with precision. The certificate shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2 and shallbe signed by the clerk of the court of appeals.2. When a question is certified by a United States courtof appeals, this Court, on its own motion or that of a party,may consider and decide the entire matter in controversy.See 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(2).3. When a question is certified, the Clerk will notify theparties and docket the case. Counsel shall then enter theirappearances. After docketing, the Clerk will submit thecertificate to the Court for a preliminary examination to determine whether the case should be briefed, set for argu-ment, or dismissed. No brief may be filed until the preliminary examination of the certificate is completed.4. If the Court orders the case briefed or set for argument,the parties will be notified and permitted to file briefs. TheClerk of this Court then will request the clerk of the courtin possession of the record to certify and transmit it. Anyportion of the record to which the parties wish to direct theCourt's particular attention should be printed in a joint ap-pendix, prepared in conformity with Rule 26 by the appellantor petitioner in the court of appeals, but the fact that anypart of the record has not been printed does not prevent theparties or the Court from relying on it.5. A brief on the merits in a case involving a certifiedquestion shall comply with Rules 24, 25, and 33.1, except thatthe brief for the party who is the appellant or petitionerbelow shall be filed within 45 days of the order requiringbriefs or setting the case for argument.Rule 20. Procedure on a Petition for an ExtraordinaryWrit1. Issuance by the Court of an extraordinary writ author-ized by 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a) is not a matter of right, but ofdiscretion sparingly exercised. To justify the granting of519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1185RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTany such writ, the petition must show that the writ will bein aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction, that exceptionalcircumstances warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained inany other form or from any other court.2. A petition seeking a writ authorized by 28 U. S. C.$ 1651(a), $ 2241, or $ 2254(a) shall be prepared in all respectsas required by Rules 33 and 34. The petition shall be captioned "In re [name of petitioner]" and shall follow, insofaras applicable, the form of a petition for a writ of certiorariprescribed by Rule 14. All contentions in support of thepetition shall be included in the petition. The case will beplaced on the docket when 40 copies of the petition are filedwith the Clerk and the docket fee is paid, except that a petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule 39, including an inmate of an institution, shall file the number of copiesrequired for a petition by such a person under Rule 12.2,together with a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, a copy of which shall precede and be attached to eachcopy of the petition. The petition shall be served as required by Rule 29 (subject to subparagraph 4(b) of this Rule).3. (a) A petition seeking a writ of prohibition, a writ ofmandamus, or both in the alternative shall state the nameand office or function of every person against whom relief issought and shall set out with particularity why the reliefsought is not available in any other court. A copy of thejudgment with respect to which the writ is sought, includingany related opinion, shall be appended to the petition together with any other document essential to understandingthe petition.(b) The petition shall be served on every party to the proceeding with respect to which relief is sought. Within 30days after the petition is placed on the docket, a party shallfile 40 copies of any brief or briefs in opposition thereto,which shall comply fully with Rule 15. If a party named asa respondent does not wish to respond to the petition, thatparty may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter.519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1186 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTAll persons served are deemed respondents for all purposesin the proceedings in this Court.4. (a) A petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus shallcomply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2242,and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of$ 2242, which requires a statement of the "reasons for notmaking application to the district court of the district inwhich the applicant is held." If the relief sought is from thejudgment of a state court, the petition shall set out specifically how and where the petitioner has exhausted availableremedies in the state courts or otherwise comes within theprovisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b). To justify the grantingof a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show thatexceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of theCourt's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannotbe obtained in any other form or from any other court. Thiswrit is rarely granted.(b) Habeas corpus proceedings, except in capital cases, areex parte, unless the Court requires the respondent to showcause why the petition for a writ of habeas corpus should notbe granted. A response, if ordered, or in a capital case, shallcomply fully with Rule 15. Neither the denial of the petition, without more, nor an order of transfer to a district courtunder the authority of 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(b), is an adjudicationon the merits, and therefore does not preclude further application to another court for the relief sought.5. The Clerk will distribute the documents to the Courtfor its consideration when a brief in opposition under subparagraph 3(b) of this Rule has been filed, when a responseunder subparagraph 4(b) has been ordered and filed, whenthe time to file has expired, or when the right to file has beenexpressly waived.6. If the Court orders the case set for argument, the Clerkwill notify the parties whether additional briefs are required,when they shall be filed, and, if the case involves a petitionfor a common-law writ of certiorari, that the parties shallprepare a joint appendix in accordance with Rule 26.519US2rule 01-29-00 18:14:32 PGT * USRULES1187RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTPART V.

GRAYon application to vacate stay of executionNo. A-425. Decided December 23, 1996Virginia's application to vacate the stay of execution in respondent Gray'scase is denied. There appears to be no execution scheduled. Thus, itcannot be stayed, and there is nothing to be vacated. See Netherlandv. Tuggle, 517 U. S. 1301.Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.The Commonwealth of Virginia has asked me to vacate theCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's stay of executionin respondent Gray's case, noting that the court did not pur-port to follow the standard for such stays set out in Barefootv. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983).InGray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 170-171 (1996), weremanded to the Court of Appeals Gray's claim that theCommonwealth had violated due process by misleading himabout evidence it intended to use at sentencing. The courtheld that the claim was procedurally defaulted. Gray v.Netherland, 99 F. 3d 158, 166 (CA4 1996). The Court of Appeals therefore remanded Gray's case to the District Courtwith instructions to dismiss his habeas corpus petition butadded, "[i]n view of the Supreme Court's opinion remandingthe case to us, we think the respectful course is to stay bothour mandate and [Gray's] execution until such time as theSupreme Court rules on any petition for certiorari." Ibid.We have repeatedly and recently stated that it is not appropriate for a court of appeals to grant a stay of executionto permit a death-row inmate to file a petition for a writ ofcertiorari without first conducting the Barefoot inquiry.1301519US1$ic1 06-02-99 13:53:27 PAGES IC1301PGT1302 NETHERLAND v. GRAYOpinion in ChambersSee Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951, 952 (1995). Wehave rejected the view that "a capital defendant as a matterof right [is] entitled to a stay of execution until he has fileda petition for certiorari in due course." Ibid.I nonetheless deny the Commonwealth's motion to vacatethe stay of execution because, so far as I can tell, there is noexecution scheduled. If there is no execution scheduled, itcannot be stayed, and there is nothing for me to vacate. SeeNetherland v. Tuggle, 517 U. S. 1301 (1996) (Rehnquist,C. J., Circuit Justice) (no stay of execution to vacate whereCourt of Appeals had only stayed its own mandate).519ind$$bv 05-25-99 16:13:54 PGT*INDBV (Bound Volume)I N D E XABORTIONS.
