This case calls for identification of the circumstances underwhich an employer may be held liable under Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000eet seq., for the acts of a supervisory employee whosesexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile workenvironment amounting to employment discrimination. Wehold that an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirm-ative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer'sconduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.IBetween 1985 and 1990, while attending college, petitionerBeth Ann Faragher worked part time and during the summers as an ocean lifeguard for the Marine Safety Section ofthe Parks and Recreation Department of respondent, theCity of Boca Raton, Florida (City). During this period,Faragher's immediate supervisors were Bill Terry, DavidSilverman, and Robert Gordon. In June 1990, Faragherresigned.In 1992, Faragher brought an action against Terry, Silver-man, and the City, asserting claims under Title VII, Rev.Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and Florida law. So far as itconcerns the Title VII claim, the complaint alleged thatTerry and Silverman created a "sexually hostile atmosphere"at the beach by repeatedly subjecting Faragher and otherfemale lifeguards to "uninvited and offensive touching," bymaking lewd remarks, and by speaking of women in offensiveterms. The complaint contained specific allegations thatTerry once said that he would never promote a woman to therank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had said to Faragher,"Date me or clean the toilets for a year." Asserting thatQuentin Riegal; and for the Society for Human Resource Management byAllan H. Weitzman and Paul Salvatore.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN781Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the CourtTerry and Silverman were agents of the City, and that theirconduct amounted to discrimination in the "terms, conditions, and privileges" of her employment, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), Faragher sought a judgment against the City fornominal damages, costs, and attorney's fees.Following a bench trial, the United States District Courtfor the Southern District of Florida found that throughoutFaragher's employment with the City, Terry served as Chiefof the Marine Safety Division, with authority to hire newlifeguards (subject to the approval of higher management),to supervise all aspects of the lifeguards' work assignments,to engage in counseling, to deliver oral reprimands, and tomake a record of any such discipline. 864 F. Supp. 1552,1563-1564 (1994). Silverman was a Marine Safety lieutenant from 1985 until June 1989, when he became a captain.Id., at 1555. Gordon began the employment period as a lieutenant and at some point was promoted to the position oftraining captain. In these positions, Silverman and Gordonwere responsible for making the lifeguards' daily assignments, and for supervising their work and fitness training.Id., at 1564.The lifeguards and supervisors were stationed at the citybeach and worked out of the Marine Safety Headquarters, asmall one-story building containing an office, a meeting room,and a single, unisex locker room with a shower. Id., at 1556.Their work routine was structured in a "paramilitary configuration," id., at 1564, with a clear chain of command.Lifeguards reported to lieutenants and captains, who reported to Terry. He was supervised by the RecreationSuperintendent, who in turn reported to a Director of Parksand Recreation, answerable to the City Manager. Id., at1555. The lifeguards had no significant contact with highercity officials like the Recreation Superintendent. Id., at1564.In February 1986, the City adopted a sexual harassmentpolicy, which it stated in a memorandum from the City Man524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN782 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtager addressed to all employees. Id., at 1560. In May1990, the City revised the policy and reissued a statement ofit. Ibid. Although the City may actually have circulatedthe memos and statements to some employees, it completelyfailed to disseminate its policy among employees of the Marine Safety Section, with the result that Terry, Silverman,Gordon, and many lifeguards were unaware of it.Ibid.From time to time over the course of Faragher's tenure atthe Marine Safety Section, between 4 and 6 of the 40 to 50lifeguards were women. Id., at 1556. During that 5-yearperiod, Terry repeatedly touched the bodies of female employees without invitation, ibid., would put his arm aroundFaragher, with his hand on her buttocks, id., at 1557, andonce made contact with another female lifeguard in a motionof sexual simulation, id., at 1556. He made crudely demeaning references to women generally, id., at 1557, and oncecommented disparagingly on Faragher's shape, ibid. During a job interview with a woman he hired as a lifeguard,Terry said that the female lifeguards had sex with their malecounterparts and asked whether she would do the same.Ibid.Silverman behaved in similar ways. He once tackled Faragher and remarked that, but for a physical characteristic hefound unattractive, he would readily have had sexual relations with her. Ibid. Another time, he pantomimed an actof oral sex. Ibid. Within earshot of the female lifeguards,Silverman made frequent, vulgar references to women andsexual matters, commented on the bodies of female lifeguards and beachgoers, and at least twice told female lifeguards that he would like to engage in sex with them. Id.,at 1557-1558.Faragher did not complain to higher management aboutTerry or Silverman. Although she spoke of their behaviorto Gordon, she did not regard these discussions as formalcomplaints to a supervisor but as conversations with a person she held in high esteem. Id., at 1559. Other female524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN783Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtlifeguards had similarly informal talks with Gordon, but be-cause Gordon did not feel that it was his place to do so, hedid not report these complaints to Terry, his own supervisor,or to any other city official.Id., at 1559-1560. Gordon responded to the complaints of one lifeguard by saying that"the City just [doesn't] care." Id., at 1561.In April 1990, however, two months before Faragher's resignation, Nancy Ewanchew, a former lifeguard, wrote toRichard Bender, the City's Personnel Director, complainingthat Terry and Silverman had harassed her and other femalelifeguards.Id., at 1559. Following investigation of thiscomplaint, the City found that Terry and Silverman had behaved improperly, reprimanded them, and required them tochoose between a suspension without pay or the forfeitureof annual leave. Ibid.On the basis of these findings, the District Court concludedthat the conduct of Terry and Silverman was discriminatoryharassment sufficiently serious to alter the conditions ofFaragher's employment and constitute an abusive workingenvironment. Id., at 1562-1563. The District Court thenruled that there were three justifications for holding the Cityliable for the harassment of its supervisory employees.First, the court noted that the harassment was pervasiveenough to support an inference that the City had "knowledge, or constructive knowledge," of it. Id., at 1563. Next,it ruled that the City was liable under traditional agencyprinciples because Terry and Silverman were acting asits agents when they committed the harassing acts. Id.,at 1563-1564. Finally, the court observed that Gordon'sknowledge of the harassment, combined with his inaction,"provides a further basis for imputing liability on [sic] theCity." Id., at 1564. The District Court then awarded Faragher $1 in nominal damages on her Title VII claim. Id.,at 1564-1565.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitreversed the judgment against the City. 76 F. 3d 1155524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN784 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Court(1996). Although the panel had "no trouble concluding thatTerry's and Silverman's conduct . . . was severe and pervasive enough to create an objectively abusive work environ-ment,"id., at 1162, it overturned the District Court's conclusion that the City was liable. The panel ruled that Terryand Silverman were not acting within the scope of their em-ployment when they engaged in the harassment,id., at 1166,that they were not aided in their actions by the agency rela-tionship,id., at 1166, n. 14, and that the City had no constructive knowledge of the harassment by virtue of its pervasive-ness or Gordon's actual knowledge,id., at 1167, and n. 16.In a 7-to-5 decision, the full Court of Appeals, sitting enbanc, adopted the panel's conclusion. 111 F. 3d 1530 (1997).Relying on our decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), and on the Restatement (Second)of Agency $ 219 (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the courtheld that "an employer may be indirectly liable for hostileenvironment sexual harassment by a superior: (1) if the harassment occurs within the scope of the superior's employment; (2) if the employer assigns performance of a nondelegable duty to a supervisor and an employee is injuredbecause of the supervisor's failure to carry out that duty; or(3) if there is an agency relationship which aids the supervisor's ability or opportunity to harass his subordinate." 111F. 3d, at 1534-1535.Applying these principles, the court rejected Faragher'sTitle VII claim against the City. First, invoking standardagency language to classify the harassment by each supervisor as a "frolic" unrelated to his authorized tasks, the courtfound that in harassing Faragher, Terry and Silverman wereacting outside of the scope of their employment and solely tofurther their own personal ends. Id., at 1536-1537. Next,the court determined that the supervisors' agency relationship with the City did not assist them in perpetrating theirharassment. Id., at 1537. Though noting that "a supervisor is always aided in accomplishing hostile environment sex524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN785Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtual harassment by the existence of the agency relationshipwith his employer because his responsibilities include closeproximity to and regular contact with the victim," the courtheld that traditional agency law does not employ so broad aconcept of aid as a predicate of employer liability, but requires something more than a mere combination of agencyrelationship and improper conduct by the agent.Ibid. Because neither Terry nor Silverman threatened to fire ordemote Faragher, the court concluded that their agencyrelationship did not facilitate their harassment. Ibid.The en banc court also affirmed the panel's ruling that theCity lacked constructive knowledge of the supervisors' harassment. The court read the District Court's opinion to reston an erroneous legal conclusion that any harassment pervasive enough to create a hostile environment must a fortiorialso suffice to charge the employer with constructive knowledge. Id., at 1538. Rejecting this approach, the court reviewed the record and found no adequate factual basis toconclude that the harassment was so pervasive that the Cityshould have known of it, relying on the facts that the harassment occurred intermittently, over a long period of time, andat a remote location. Ibid. In footnotes, the court alsorejected the arguments that the City should be deemed tohave known of the harassment through Gordon, id., at 1538,n. 9, or charged with constructive knowledge because of itsfailure to disseminate its sexual harassment policy amongthe lifeguards, id., at 1539, n. 11.Since our decision in Meritor, Courts of Appeals havestruggled to derive manageable standards to govern employer liability for hostile environment harassment perpetrated by supervisory employees. While following our admonition to find guidance in the common law of agency, asembodied in the Restatement, the Courts of Appeals haveadopted different approaches. Compare, e. g., Harrison v.Eddy Potash, Inc., 112 F. 3d 1437 (CA10 1997), vacated, post,p. 947; 111 F. 3d 1530 (CA11 1997) (case below); Gary v.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN786 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the CourtLong, 59 F. 3d 1391 (CADC), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1011(1995); and Karibian v. Columbia University, 14 F. 3d 773(CA2), cert. denied, 512 U. S. 1213 (1994). We granted cer-tiorari to address the divergence, 522 U. S. 978 (1997), andnow reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit andremand for entry of judgment in Faragher's favor.IIAUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, "[i]t shallbe an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . tofail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or other-wise to discriminate against any individual with respect tohis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ-ment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex,or national origin." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). We haverepeatedly made clear that although the statute mentionsspecific employment decisions with immediate consequences,the scope of the prohibition " `is not limited to "economic" or"tangible" discrimination,' " Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (quotingMeritor Savings Bank, FSBv. Vinson, supra, at 64), and that it covers more than" `terms' and `conditions' in the narrow contractual sense."Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75,78 (1998). Thus, in Meritor we held that sexual harassmentso "severe or pervasive" as to " `alter the conditions of [thevictim's] employment and create an abusive working environment' " violates Title VII. 477 U. S., at 67 (quoting Hensonv. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 904 (CA11 1982)).In thus holding that environmental claims are covered bythe statute, we drew upon earlier cases recognizing liabilityfor discriminatory harassment based on race and national or-igin, see,e. g., Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234 (CA5 1971),cert. denied, 406 U. S. 957 (1972); Firefighters Institute forRacial Equality v. St. Louis, 549 F. 2d 506 (CA8), cert. de-nied sub nom. Banta v. United States, 434 U.

S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtjust as we have also followed the lead of such cases in at-tempting to define the severity of the offensive conditionsnecessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination underthe statute. See, e. g., Rogers, supra, at 238 ("[M]ere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensivefeelings in an employee" would not sufficiently alter termsand conditions of employment to violate Title VII).1 SeealsoDaniels v. Essex Group, Inc., 937 F. 2d 1264, 1271-1272(CA7 1991); Davis v. Monsanto Chemical Co., 858 F. 2d 345,349 (CA6 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1110 (1989); Snell v.Suffolk County, 782 F. 2d 1094, 1103 (CA2 1986); 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 349,and nn. 36-37 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann & Grossman) (citing cases instructing that "[d]iscourtesy or rudenessshould not be confused with racial harassment" and that "alack of racial sensitivity does not, alone, amount to action-able harassment").So, in Harris, we explained that in order to be actionableunder the statute, a sexually objectionable environmentmust be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one thata reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and onethat the victim in fact did perceive to be so. 510 U. S., at21-22. We directed courts to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by "looking at allthe circumstances," including the "frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threat1 Similarly, Courts of Appeals in sexual harassment cases have properlydrawn on standards developed in cases involving racial harassment. See,e. g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F. 2d 569, 577 (CA21989) (citing Lopez v. S. B. Thomas, Inc., 831 F. 2d 1184, 1189 (CA2 1987),a case of racial harassment, for the proposition that incidents of environmental sexual harassment "must be more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive"). Although racial and sexual harassment will often take different forms, andstandards may not be entirely interchangeable, we think there is goodsense in seeking generally to harmonize the standards of what amounts toactionable harassment.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN788 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; andwhether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's workperformance." Id., at 23. Most recently, we explained thatTitle VII does not prohibit "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact withmembers of the same sex and of the opposite sex." Oncale,523 U. S., at 81. A recurring point in these opinions is that"simple teasing," id., at 82, offhand comments, and iso-lated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amountto discriminatory changes in the "terms and conditions ofemployment."These standards for judging hostility are sufficiently demanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a "generalcivility code." Id., at 80. Properly applied, they will filterout complaints attacking "the ordinary tribulations of theworkplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language,gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing." B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Sexual Harassment in Employment Law175 (1992) (hereinafter Lindemann & Kadue) (footnotes omitted). We have made it clear that conduct must be extremeto amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, and the Courts of Appeals have heeded this view.See, e. g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F. 2d569, 577-578 (CA2 1989); Moylan v. Maries County, 792F. 2d 746, 749-750 (CA8 1986); See also 1 Lindemann &Grossman 805-807, n. 290 (collecting cases granting summaryjudgment for employers because the alleged harassment wasnot actionably severe or pervasive).While indicating the substantive contours of the hostileenvironments forbidden by Title VII, our cases have established few definite rules for determining when an employerwill be liable for a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive. Given the circumstances of manyof the litigated cases, including some that have come to us,it is not surprising that in many of them, the issue has beenjoined over the sufficiency of the abusive conditions, not the524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN789Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtstandards for determining an employer's liability for them.There have, for example, been myriad cases in which DistrictCourts and Courts of Appeals have held employers liable onaccount of actual knowledge by the employer, or highechelon officials of an employer organization, of sufficientlyharassing action by subordinates, which the employer or itsinformed officers have done nothing to stop. See,e. g., Katzv. Dole, 709 F. 2d 251, 256 (CA4 1983) (upholding employerliability because the "employer's supervisory personnel manifested unmistakable acquiescence in or approval of the har-assment");EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel, 881 F. 2d 1504, 1516(CA9 1989) (employer liable where hotel manager did not respond to complaints about supervisors' harassment); Hall v.Gus Constr. Co., 842 F. 2d 1010, 1016 (CA8 1988) (holdingemployer liable for harassment by co-workers because supervisor knew of the harassment but did nothing). In such instances, the combined knowledge and inaction may be seenas demonstrable negligence, or as the employer's adoption ofthe offending conduct and its results, quite as if they hadbeen authorized affirmatively as the employer's policy. Cf.Oncale, supra, at 77 (victim reported his grounds for fearingrape to company's safety supervisor, who turned him awaywith no action on complaint).Nor was it exceptional that standards for binding theemployer were not in issue in Harris, supra. In that caseof discrimination by hostile environment, the individualcharged with creating the abusive atmosphere was the president of the corporate employer, 510 U. S., at 19, who wasindisputably within that class of an employer organization'sofficials who may be treated as the organization's proxy.Burns v. McGregor Electronic Industries, Inc., 955 F. 2d559, 564 (CA8 1992) (employer-company liable where harassment was perpetrated by its owner); see Torres v. Pisano,116 F. 3d 625, 634-635, and n. 11 (CA2) (noting that a supervisor may hold a sufficiently high position "in the management hierarchy of the company for his actions to be imputed524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN790 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtautomatically to the employer"), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 997(1997); cf.Katz, supra, at 255 ("Except in situations where aproprietor, partner or corporate officer participates person-ally in the harassing behavior," an employee must "demonstrat[e] the propriety of holding the employer liable").Finally, there is nothing remarkable in the fact that claimsagainst employers for discriminatory employment actionswith tangible results, like hiring, firing, promotion, compen-sation, and work assignment, have resulted in employer liability once the discrimination was shown. See Meritor, 477U. S., at 70-71 (noting that "courts have consistently heldemployers liable for the discriminatory discharges of employees by supervisory personnel, whether or not the employerknew, should have known, or approved of the supervisor'sactions"); id., at 75 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)("[W]hen a supervisor discriminatorily fires or refuses topromote a black employee, that act is, without more, considered the act of the employer"); see also Anderson v. Methodist Evangelical Hospital, Inc., 464 F. 2d 723, 725 (CA6 1972)(imposing liability on employer for racially motivated discharge by low-level supervisor, although the "record clearlyshows that [its] record in race relations . . . is exemplary").A variety of reasons have been invoked for this apparentlyunanimous rule. Some courts explain, in a variation of the"proxy" theory discussed above, that when a supervisormakes such decisions, he "merges" with the employer, andhis act becomes that of the employer. See, e. g., Kotcher v.Rosa and Sullivan Appliance Ctr., Inc., 957 F. 2d 59, 62(CA2 1992) ("The supervisor is deemed to act on behalf ofthe employer when making decisions that affect the economicstatus of the employee. From the perspective of the employee, the supervisor and the employer merge into a singleentity"); Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F. 2d 1311,1316 (CA11 1989) ("When a supervisor requires sexualfavors as a quid pro quo for job benefits, the supervisor,by definition, acts as the company"); see also Lindemann &524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN791Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the CourtGrossman 776 (noting that courts hold employers "automati-cally liable" inquid pro quo cases because the "supervisor'sactions, in conferring or withholding employment benefits,are deemed as a matter of law to be those of the employer").Other courts have suggested that vicarious liability is properbecause the supervisor acts within the scope of his authoritywhen he makes discriminatory decisions in hiring, firing, promotion, and the like. See, e. g., Shager v. Upjohn Co., 913F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7 1990) ("[A] supervisory employee whofires a subordinate is doing the kind of thing that he is au-thorized to do, and the wrongful intent with which he doesit does not carry his behavior so far beyond the orbit of hisresponsibilities as to excuse the employer" (citing Restatement $ 228)). Others have suggested that vicarious liabilityis appropriate because the supervisor who discriminates inthis manner is aided by the agency relation. See, e. g., Nichols v. Frank, 42 F. 3d 503, 514 (CA9 1994). Finally, stillother courts have endorsed both of the latter two theories.See, e. g., Harrison, 112 F. 3d, at 1443; Henson, 682 F. 2d,at 910.The soundness of the results in these cases (and their continuing vitality), in light of basic agency principles, was confirmed by this Court's only discussion to date of standards ofemployer liability, in Meritor, supra, which involved a claimof discrimination by a supervisor's sexual harassment of asubordinate over an extended period. In affirming theCourt of Appeals's holding that a hostile atmosphere resulting from sex discrimination is actionable under Title VII, wealso anticipated proceedings on remand by holding agencyprinciples relevant in assigning employer liability and by rejecting three per se rules of liability or immunity. 477 U. S.,at 70-72. We observed that the very definition of employerin Title VII, as including an "agent," id., at 72, expressedCongress's intent that courts look to traditional principles ofthe law of agency in devising standards of employer liabilityin those instances where liability for the actions of a super524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN792 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtvisory employee was not otherwise obvious, ibid., and although we cautioned that "common-law principles may notbe transferable in all their particulars to Title VII," we citedthe Restatement $$ 219-237 with general approval. Ibid.We then proceeded to reject two limitations on employerliability, while establishing the rule that some limitation wasintended. We held that neither the existence of a companygrievance procedure nor the absence of actual notice of theharassment on the part of upper management would be dispositive of such a claim; while either might be relevant tothe liability, neither would result automatically in employerimmunity. Ibid. Conversely, we held that Title VII placedsome limit on employer responsibility for the creation of adiscriminatory environment by a supervisor, and we heldthat Title VII does not make employers "always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors,"ibid., contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, whichhad held that "an employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor's sexual advances, eventhough the employer neither knew nor reasonably could haveknown of the alleged misconduct," id., at 69-70.Meritor's statement of the law is the foundation on whichwe build today. Neither party before us has urged us todepart from our customary adherence to stare decisis in statutory interpretation, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) (stare decisis has "special force" instatutory interpretation). And the force of precedent hereis enhanced by Congress's amendment to the liability provisions of Title VII since the Meritor decision, without providing any modification of our holding.

S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the CourtBThe Court of Appeals identified, and rejected, three possible grounds drawn from agency law for holding the Cityvicariously liable for the hostile environment created bythe supervisors. It considered whether the two supervisorswere acting within the scope of their employment when theyengaged in the harassing conduct. The court then enquiredwhether they were significantly aided by the agency relationship in committing the harassment, and also consideredthe possibility of imputing Gordon's knowledge of the harassment to the City. Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled outliability for negligence in failing to prevent the harassment.Faragher relies principally on the latter three theories ofliability.1A "master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment." Restatement $ 219(1). This doctrine has traditionally defined the "scope of employment" as including conduct"of the kind [a servant] is employed to perform," occurring"substantially within the authorized time and space limits,"and "actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve themaster," but as excluding an intentional use of force "unexpectable by the master." Id., $ 228(1).Courts of Appeals have typically held, or assumed, thatconduct similar to the subject of this complaint falls outsidethe scope of employment. See, e. g., Harrison, 112 F. 3d,at 1444 (sexual harassment " `simply is not within the jobdescription of any supervisor or any other worker in anyreputable business' "); 111 F. 3d, at 1535-1536 (case below);Andrade v.

S. 1041 (1992). In so doing, the courts have emphasized that harassment consisting of unwelcome remarks andtouching is motivated solely by individual desires and servesno purpose of the employer. For this reason, courts havelikened hostile environment sexual harassment to the classic"frolic and detour" for which an employer has no vicariousliability.These cases ostensibly stand in some tension with othersarising outside Title VII, where the scope of employment hasbeen defined broadly enough to hold employers vicariouslyliable for intentional torts that were in no sense inspired byany purpose to serve the employer. In Ira S. Bushey &Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F. 2d 167 (1968), for example,524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN795Cite as: 524 U.

Judge Friendly acknowledged that the sailor'sconduct was not remotely motivated by a purpose to servehis employer, but relied on the "deeply rooted sentiment thata business enterprise cannot justly disclaim responsibility foraccidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of itsactivities," and imposed vicarious liability on the ground thatthe sailor's conduct "was not so `unforeseeable' as to make itunfair to charge the Government with responsibility." Id.,at 171. Other examples of an expansive sense of scope ofemployment are readily found, see, e. g., Leonbruno v. Champlain Silk Mills, 229 N. Y. 470, 128 N. E. 711 (1920) (opinionof Cardozo, J.) (employer was liable under worker's compensation statute for eye injury sustained when employee threwan apple at another; the accident arose "in the course of employment" because such horseplay should be expected); Carrv. Wm. C. Crowell Co., 28 Cal. 2d 652, 171 P. 2d 5 (1946)(employer liable for actions of carpenter who attacked a coemployee with a hammer). Courts, in fact, have treatedscope of employment generously enough to include sexualassaults. See, e. g., Primeaux v. United States, 102 F. 3d1458, 1462-1463 (CA8 1996) (federal police officer on limitedduty sexually assaulted stranded motorist); Mary M. v. LosAngeles, 54 Cal. 3d 202, 216-221, 814 P. 2d 1341, 1349-1352(1991) (en banc) (police officer raped motorist after placingher under arrest); Doe v.

BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtassistant raped patient).2 The rationales for these decisionshave varied, with some courts echoing Bushey in explainingthat the employee's acts were foreseeable and that the em-ployer should in fairness bear the resulting costs of doingbusiness, see, e. g., Mary M., supra, at 218, 814 P. 2d, at 1350,and others finding that the employee's sexual misconductarose from or was in some way related to the employee'sessential duties. See,e. g., Samuels, supra, at 574 (tortiousconduct was "reasonably incidental" to the performance ofthe nursing assistant's duties in caring for a "helpless" pa-tient in a "locked environment").An assignment to reconcile the run of the Title VII caseswith those just cited would be a taxing one. Here it isenough to recognize that their disparate results do not neces-sarily reflect wildly varying terms of the particular employment contracts involved, but represent differing judgmentsabout the desirability of holding an employer liable for hissubordinates' wayward behavior. In the instances in whichthere is a genuine question about the employer's responsibility for harmful conduct he did not in fact authorize, a holdingthat the conduct falls within the scope of employment ultimately expresses a conclusion not of fact but of law. Asone eminent authority has observed, the "highly indefinitephrase" is "devoid of meaning in itself " and is "obviouslyno more than a bare formula to cover the unordered andunauthorized acts of the servant for which it is found to beexpedient to charge the master with liability, as well as toexclude other acts for which it is not."

Owen, Prosser and Keaton on Lawof Torts 502 (5th ed. 1984); see also Seavey, Speculations asto "Respondeat Superior," in Studies in Agency 129, 1552 It bears noting that many courts in non-Title VII cases have held sexual assaults to fall outside the scope of employment. See Note, "Scope ofEmployment" Redefined: Holding Employers Vicariously Liable for SexualAssaults Committed by their Employees, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 1513, 1521-1522,and nn. 33, 34 (1992) (collecting cases).524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN797Cite as: 524 U.

Oldercases, for example, treated smoking by an employee duringworking hours as an act outside the scope of employment,but more recently courts have generally held smoking on thejob to fall within the scope. Prosser & Keeton, supra, at504, and n. 23. It is not that employers formerly did notauthorize smoking but have now begun to do so, or that em-ployees previously smoked for their own purposes but nowdo so to serve the employer. We simply understand smoking differently now and have revised the old judgmentsabout what ought to be done about it.The proper analysis here, then, calls not for a mechanicalapplication of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in theRestatement, see, e. g., $$ 219, 228, 229, but rather an enquiryinto the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor's employment, and the reasons for the opposite view.The Restatement itself points to such an approach, as in thecommentary that the "ultimate question" in determining thescope of employment is "whether or not it is just that theloss resulting from the servant's acts should be consideredas one of the normal risks to be borne by the business inwhich the servant is employed." Id., $ 229, Comment a.See generally Taber v.

Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law ofTorts $ 26.8, pp. 40-41 (2d ed. 1986))).In the case before us, a justification for holding the offensive behavior within the scope of Terry's and Silverman'semployment was well put in Judge Barkett's dissent: "[A]524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN798 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtpervasively hostile work environment of sexual harassmentis never (one would hope) authorized, but the supervisor isclearly charged with maintaining a productive, safe work en-vironment. The supervisor directs and controls the conductof the employees, and the manner of doing so may inure tothe employer's benefit or detriment, including subjecting theemployer to Title VII liability." 111 F. 3d, at 1542 (opiniondissenting in part and concurring in part). It is by now wellrecognized that hostile environment sexual harassment bysupervisors (and, for that matter, coemployees) is a persist-ent problem in the workplace. See Lindemann & Kadue 4-5(discussing studies showing prevalence of sexual harassment); Ellerth, 123 F. 3d, at 511 (Posner, C. J., concurringand dissenting) ("[E]veryone knows by now that sexual harassment is a common problem in the American workplace").An employer can, in a general sense, reasonably anticipatethe possibility of such conduct occurring in its workplace,and one might justify the assignment of the burden of theuntoward behavior to the employer as one of the costs ofdoing business, to be charged to the enterprise rather thanthe victim. As noted, supra, at 796-797, developments likethis occur from time to time in the law of agency.Two things counsel us to draw the contrary conclusion.First, there is no reason to suppose that Congress wishedcourts to ignore the traditional distinction between acts falling within the scope and acts amounting to what the olderlaw called frolics or detours from the course of employment.Such a distinction can readily be applied to the spectrum ofpossible harassing conduct by supervisors, as the followingexamples show. First, a supervisor might discriminate racially in job assignments in order to placate the prejudicepervasive in the labor force. Instances of this variety of theheckler's veto would be consciously intended to further theemployer's interests by preserving peace in the workplace.Next, supervisors might reprimand male employees forworkplace failings with banter, but respond to women's524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN799Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtshortcomings in harsh or vulgar terms. A third examplemight be the supervisor who, as here, expresses his sexualinterests in ways having no apparent object whatever ofserving an interest of the employer. If a line is to be drawnbetween scope and frolic, it would lie between the first twoexamples and the third, and it thus makes sense in terms oftraditional agency law to analyze the scope issue, in caseslike the third example, just as most federal courts addressingthat issue have done, classifying the harassment as beyondthe scope of employment.The second reason goes to an even broader unanimity ofviews among the holdings of District Courts and Courts ofAppeals thus far. Those courts have held not only that thesort of harassment at issue here was outside the scope ofsupervisors' authority, but, by uniformly judging employerliability for co-worker harassment under a negligence standard, they have also implicitly treated such harassment asoutside the scope of common employees' duties as well.

Larson, Em-ployment Discrimination $ 46.07[4][a], p. 46-101 (2d ed. 1998)(courts "uniformly" apply Equal Employment OpportunityCommission (EEOC) rule; "[i]t is not a controversial area").If, indeed, the cases did not rest, at least implicitly, on thenotion that such harassment falls outside the scope of em-ployment, their liability issues would have turned simply onthe application of the scope-of-employment rule. Cf. Hunterv.Allis-Chalmers, Inc., 797 F. 2d 1417, 1422 (CA7 1986) (noting that employer will not usually be liable under respondeatsuperior for employee's racial harassment because it "wouldbe the rare case where racial harassment . . . could bethought by the author of the harassment to help the employer's business").It is quite unlikely that these cases would escape effortsto render them obsolete if we were to hold that supervisorswho engage in discriminatory harassment are necessarilyacting within the scope of their employment. The rationalefor placing harassment within the scope of supervisory authority would be the fairness of requiring the employer tobear the burden of foreseeable social behavior, and the samerationale would apply when the behavior was that of coemployees. The employer generally benefits just as obviously from the work of common employees as from the workof supervisors; they simply have different jobs to do, allaimed at the success of the enterprise. As between an innocent employer and an innocent employee, if we use scope-ofemployment reasoning to require the employer to bear thecost of an actionably hostile workplace created by one classof employees (i. e., supervisors), it could appear just as appropriate to do the same when the environment was createdby another class (i. e., co-workers).The answer to this argument might well be to point outthat the scope of supervisory employment may be treatedseparately by recognizing that supervisors have specialauthority enhancing their capacity to harass, and that the524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN801Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtemployer can guard against their misbehavior more easilybecause their numbers are by definition fewer than thenumbers of regular employees. But this answer happens toimplicate an entirely separate category of agency law (to beconsidered in the next section), which imposes vicariousliability on employers for tortious acts committed by use ofparticular authority conferred as an element of an employee'sagency relationship with the employer. Since the virtue ofcategorical clarity is obvious, it is better to reject relianceon misuse of supervisory authority (without more) as irrelevant to scope-of-employment analysis.2The Court of Appeals also rejected vicarious liability onthe part of the City insofar as it might rest on the concludingprinciple set forth in $ 219(2)(d) of the Restatement, that anemployer "is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment unless . . .the servant purported to act or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance on apparent authority, or he wasaided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of theagency relation." Faragher points to several ways in whichthe agency relationship aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She argues that in general of-fending supervisors can abuse their authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make offensivestatements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse theirsupervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint.Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by the City enabled them to act for so long withoutprovoking defiance or complaint.The City, however, contends that $ 219(2)(d) has no applica-tion here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant "aided in accomplishing thetort by the existence of the agency relation," merely "refines" the one preceding it, which holds the employer vicari524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN802 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtously liable for its servant's abuse of apparent authority.Brief for Respondent 30-31, and n. 24. But this narrowreading is untenable; it would render the second qualificationof $ 219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem toask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisoryauthority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it coversnot only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, butalso cases in which tortious conduct is made possible orfacilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship.See Restatement $ 219, Comment e (noting employer liabilitywhere "the servant may be able to cause harm because ofhis position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sendsfalse messages purporting to come from third persons" andwhere the manager who operates a store "for an undisclosedprincipal is enabled to cheat the customers because of hisposition"); id., $ 247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper's lia-bility for a libelous editorial published by an editor actingfor his own purposes).We therefore agree with Faragher that in implementingTitle VII it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possibleby abuse of his supervisory authority, and that the aided-byagency-relation principle embodied in $ 219(2)(d) of the Re-statement provides an appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented here.3Several courts, indeed, have noted what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a harassing supervisoris always assisted in his misconduct by the supervisory relationship. See, e. g., Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins.3 We say "starting point" because our obligation here is not to make apronouncement of agency law in general or to transplant $ 219(2)(d) intoTitle VII. Rather, it is to adapt agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII. As we said in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986), "common-law principles may not be transferable inall their particulars to Title VII."524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN803Cite as: 524 U.

Monsanto Co., 585 So. 2d 1205, 1209-1210 (La.1991) (a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate is more aptto rise to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress than comparable harassment by a coemployee); Contreras v.

The agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor's sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept therisks of blowing the whistle on a superior. When a personwith supervisory authority discriminates in the terms andconditions of subordinates' employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people whoreport to him, or those under them, whereas an employeegenerally cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct thesame way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker.When a fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk awayor tell the offender where to go, but it may be difficult tooffer such responses to a supervisor, whose "power to supervise--[which may be] to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates--does not disappear . . . when he choosesto harass through insults and offensive gestures rather thandirectly with threats of firing or promises of promotion."Estrich, Sex at Work, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 813, 854 (1991). Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse ofsupervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of avictim's employment is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employershave greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, trainthem, and monitor their performance.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN804 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the CourtIn sum, there are good reasons for vicarious liability formisuse of supervisory authority. That rationale must, however, satisfy one more condition. We are not entitled to rec-ognize this theory under Title VII unless we can square itwith Meritor's holding that an employer is not "automati-cally" liable for harassment by a supervisor who creates therequisite degree of discrimination,4 and there is obviouslysome tension between that holding and the position that asupervisor's misconduct aided by supervisory authority sub-jects the employer to liability vicariously; if the "aid" maybe the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of super-visory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high. Tocounter it, we think there are two basic alternatives, onebeing to require proof of some affirmative invocation ofthat authority by the harassing supervisor, the other to rec-ognize an affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionableenvironment.There is certainly some authority for requiring active oraffirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse ofsupervisory authority before liability may be imputed.That is the way some courts have viewed the familiar casesholding the employer liable for discriminatory employment4 We are bound to honor Meritor on this point not merely because of thehigh value placed on stare decisis in statutory interpretation, supra, at792, but for a further reason as well. With the amendments enacted bythe Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress both expanded the monetary reliefavailable under Title VII to include compensatory and punitive damages,see $ 102, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a, and modified the statutorygrounds of several of our decisions, see $ 101 et seq. The decision of Congress to leave Meritor intact is conspicuous. We thus have to assumethat in expanding employers' potential liability under Title VII, Congressrelied on our statements in Meritor about the limits of employer liability.To disregard those statements now (even if we were convinced of reasonsfor doing so) would be not only to disregard stare decisis in statutoryinterpretation, but to substitute our revised judgment about the properallocation of the costs of harassment for Congress's considered decision onthe subject.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN805Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtaction with tangible consequences, like firing and demotion.Seesupra, at 790. And we have already noted some examples of liability provided by the Restatement itself, whichsuggest that an affirmative misuse of power might be required. See supra, at 802 (telegraph operator sends falsemessages, a store manager cheats customers, editor pub-lishes libelous editorial).But neat examples illustrating the line between the af-firmative and merely implicit uses of power are not easy tocome by in considering management behavior. Supervisorsdo not make speeches threatening sanctions whenever theymake requests in the legitimate exercise of managerial authority, and yet every subordinate employee knows the sanctions exist; this is the reason that courts have consistentlyheld that acts of supervisors have greater power to alter theenvironment than acts of coemployees generally, see supra,at 802-803. How far from the course of ostensible supervisory behavior would a company officer have to step beforehis orders would not reasonably be seen as actively usingauthority? Judgment calls would often be close, the resultswould often seem disparate even if not demonstrably contradictory, and the temptation to litigate would be hard toresist. We think plaintiffs and defendants alike would bepoorly served by an active-use rule.The other basic alternative to automatic liability wouldavoid this particular temptation to litigate, but allow an employer to show as an affirmative defense to liability that theemployer had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassmentand to eliminate it when it might occur, and that the complaining employee had failed to act with like reasonable careto take advantage of the employer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided. Thiscomposite defense would, we think, implement the statutesensibly, for reasons that are not hard to fathom.Although Title VII seeks "to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrim524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN806 FARAGHER v.

S. 405, 418(1975), its "primary objective," like that of any statute meantto influence primary conduct, is not to provide redress butto avoid harm.Id., at 417. As long ago as 1980, the EEOC,charged with the enforcement of Title VII, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-4, adopted regulations advising employers to "takeall steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as . . . informing employees of their right toraise and how to raise the issue of harassment." 29 CFR$ 1604.11(f ) (1997), and in 1990 the EEOC issued a policystatement enjoining employers to establish a complaint procedure "designed to encourage victims of harassment tocome forward [without requiring] a victim to complain firstto the offending supervisor." EEOC Policy Guidance onSexual Harassment, 8 FEP Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990)(internal quotation marks omitted). It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government's Title VII enforcement efforts to recognize the employer's affirmative obligation to prevent violations and givecredit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty. Indeed, a theory of vicarious liability formisuse of supervisory power would be at odds with the statutory policy if it failed to provide employers with somesuch incentive.The requirement to show that the employee has failed in acoordinate duty to avoid or mitigate harm reflects an equallyobvious policy imported from the general theory of damages,that a victim has a duty "to use such means as are reasonableunder the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages"that result from violations of the statute.

An employer may, for example, have provided aproven, effective mechanism for reporting and resolvingcomplaints of sexual harassment, available to the employeewithout undue risk or expense. If the plaintiff unreasonably524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN807Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtfailed to avail herself of the employer's preventive or reme-dial apparatus, she should not recover damages that couldhave been avoided if she had done so. If the victim couldhave avoided harm, no liability should be found against theemployer who had taken reasonable care, and if damagescould reasonably have been mitigated no award against aliable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her ownefforts could have avoided.In order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liabilityfor harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as wellas Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and inBurlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, ante, p. 742, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious liability toa victimized employee for an actionable hostile environmentcreated by a supervisor with immediate (or successivelyhigher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise anaffirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proofby a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a)that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent andcorrect promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b)that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Whileproof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassmentpolicy with complaint procedure is not necessary in everyinstance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately beaddressed in any case when litigating the first element of thedefense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfillthe corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoidharm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure touse any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN808 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONOpinion of the Courtdemonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfythe employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, whenthe supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. See Burlington, ante, at 762-763.Applying these rules here, we believe that the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals must be reversed. The District Courtfound that the degree of hostility in the work environmentrose to the actionable level and was attributable to Silver-man and Terry. It is undisputed that these supervisors"were granted virtually unchecked authority" over their subordinates, "directly controll[ing] and supervis[ing] all aspectsof [Faragher's] day-to-day activities." 111 F. 3d, at 1544(Barkett, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). It isalso clear that Faragher and her colleagues were "completelyisolated from the City's higher management." Ibid. TheCity did not seek review of these findings.While the City would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of itspresenting one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The District Court found that the City hadentirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials madeno attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors likeTerry and Silverman. The record also makes clear that theCity's policy did not include any assurance that the harassingsupervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints.App. 274. Under such circumstances, we hold as a matterof law that the City could not be found to have exercisedreasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct. Unlike the employer of a small work force, who mightexpect that sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior couldbe exercised informally, those responsible for city operationscould not reasonably have thought that precautions againsthostile environments in any one of many departments in far524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN809Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)Opinion of the Courtflung locations could be effective without communicatingsome formal policy against harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.We have drawn this conclusion without overlooking twopossible grounds upon which the City might argue for theopportunity to litigate further. There is, first, the Court ofAppeals's indulgent gloss on the relevant evidence: "Thereis some evidence that the City did not effectively disseminateamong Marine Safety employees its sexual harassment policy." 111 F. 3d, at 1539, n. 11. But, in contrast to the Courtof Appeals's characterization, the District Court made anexplicit finding of a "complete failure on the part of the Cityto disseminate said policy among Marine Safety Sectionemployees." 864 F. Supp., at 1560. The evidence supportsthe District Court's finding and there is no contrary claimbefore us.The second possible ground for pursuing a defense wasasserted by the City in its argument addressing the possibility of negligence liability in this case. It said that it shouldnot be held liable for failing to promulgate an antiharassmentpolicy, because there was no apparent duty to do so in the1985-1990 period. The City purports to rest this argumenton the position of the EEOC during the period mentioned,but it turns out that the record on this point is quite againstthe City's position. Although the EEOC issued regulationsdealing with promulgating a statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990, see supra, at 806, eversince 1980 its regulations have called for steps to preventviolations, such as informing employees of their rights andthe means to assert them, ibid. The City, after all, adoptedan antiharassment policy in 1986.The City points to nothing that might justify a conclusionby the District Court on remand that the City had exercisedreasonable care. Nor is there any reason to remand for consideration of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages,since the award to her was solely nominal.524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN810 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATONThomas, J., dissenting3The Court of Appeals also rejected the possibility that itcould hold the City liable for the reason that it knew of theharassment vicariously through the knowledge of its supervi-sors. We have no occasion to consider whether this waserror, however. We are satisfied that liability on the groundof vicarious knowledge could not be determined without further factfinding on remand, whereas the reversal necessaryon the theory of supervisory harassment renders any remandfor consideration of imputed knowledge entirely unjustifiable(as would be any consideration of negligence as an alternative to a theory of vicarious liability here).IIIThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the EleventhCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.
