This case under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Com-pensation Act is before us a second time, now raising thequestion whether the Act bars nominal compensation to aworker who is presently able to earn at least as much asbefore he was injured. We hold nominal compensationproper when there is a significant possibility that the worker's wage-earning capacity will fall below the level of hispreinjury wages sometime in the future.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the National Association of Waterfront Employers et al. by Charles T.

RAMBOOpinion of the CourtIRespondent John Rambo injured his back and leg in 1980while doing longshore work for petitioner Metropolitan Stevedore Company. Rambo claimed against Metropolitan forcompensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 44 Stat. 1424, asamended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., and the parties stipulatedthat Rambo had sustained a 221/2% permanent partial disability, which would normally reflect a $120.24 decline in his preinjury $534.38 weekly wage. This, in turn, was reduced toan award of $80.16 per week under $ 8(c)(21) of the Act, 33U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21), providing for compensation at the rateof 662/3% of the difference between an employee's preinjurywages and postinjury wage-earning capacity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) entered an order incorporating thisstipulated award. App. 51; Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v.Rambo (Rambo I), 515 U. S. 291, 293 (1995).Rambo was later trained as a longshore crane operator andgot full-time work with his new skills, with occasional stintsas a heavy-truck operator to earn extra pay. His resultingannual earnings between 1985 and 1990 were about threetimes what he had made before his injury. As a consequence, Metropolitan moved in 1989 to modify Rambo's earlier disability award, see $ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922, and a hearingwas held before an ALJ. While there was no evidence thatRambo's physical condition had improved, the ALJ orderedthe disability payments discontinued based on the tripling ofRambo's preinjury earnings:"After taking into consideration the increase in wagesdue to the rate of inflation and any increase in salary forthe particular job, it is evident that [Rambo] no longerhas a wage-earning capacity loss. Although [Rambo]testified that he might lose his job at some future time,the evidence shows that [Rambo] would not be at any521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN125Cite as: 521 U.

More-over, no evidence has been offered to show that [Rambo's] age, education, and vocational training are suchthat he would be at greater risk of losing his present jobor in seeking new employment in the event that heshould be required to do so. Likewise, the evidencedoes not show that [Rambo's] employer is a beneficentone. On the contrary, the evidence shows that [Rambo]is not only able to work full time as a crane operator,but that he is able to work as a heavy lift truck operatorwhen the time is available within which to do so."App. 55.See also Rambo I, supra, at 293-294.The Benefits Review Board affirmed the modificationorder, App. 57, 61, but the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit reversed on the ground that $ 22 authorizes modification of an award only for changed physical conditions, Rambov. Director, OWCP, 28 F. 3d 86 (1994).

Director,OWCP, 81 F. 3d 840, 844 (1996). The court reversed theorder ending Rambo's benefits as unsupported by substantialevidence, due to "overemphasi[s on] Rambo's current statusand fail[ure] to consider the effect of Rambo's permanent partial disability on his future earnings," ibid., and it remandedfor entry of a nominal award reflecting Rambo's permanentpartial disability, id., at 845.1 We granted certiorari. 519U. S. 1002 (1996). While we agree that nominal compensation may be awarded under certain circumstances despitethe worker's present ability to earn more than his preinjurywage, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals di-recting entry of such an award and remand for factfindingby the ALJ. IIThe LHWCA authorizes compensation not for physical in-jury as such, but for economic harm to the injured workerfrom decreased ability to earn wages. See Rambo I, supra,at 297-298. The Act speaks of this economic harm as "disability," defined as the "incapacity because of injury to earnthe wages which the employee was receiving at the time ofinjury in the same or any other employment," $ 2(10), 33U. S. C. $ 902(10). Such incapacity is conclusively presumedfor certain enumerated or "scheduled" injuries, which arecompensated at 662/3% of the worker's preinjury wages overspecified periods of time.

S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Courtgrams, 449 U. S. 268, 269 (1980). For other, so-called "un-scheduled" injuries resulting in less than total disability, theAct sets compensation at "662/3 per centum of the differencebetween the average weekly [preinjury] wages of the employee and the employee's wage-earning capacity there-after." $ 8(c)(21), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21) (permanent partialdisability); see also $ 8(e), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(e) (temporary partial disability). For figuring this difference, $ 8(h) explainsthat the claimant's postinjury "wage-earning capacity" is tobe determined"by his actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly andreasonably represent his wage-earning capacity: Provided, however, That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonablyrepresent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commissioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, having due regard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physicalimpairment, his usual employment, and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect hiscapacity to earn wages in his disabled condition, includ-ing the effect of disability as it may naturally extendinto the future." $ 8(h), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h).See also $ 10, 33 U. S. C. $ 910 (method for determining prein-jury wages). See generallyRambo I, 515 U. S., at 297-298.We may summarize these provisions and their implicationsthis way. Disability is a measure of earning capacity lost asa result of work-related injury. By distinguishing betweenthe diminished capacity and the injury itself, and by definingcapacity in relation both to the injured worker's old job andto other employment, the statute makes it clear that disability is the product of injury and opportunities in the jobmarket. Capacity, and thus disability, is not necessarilyreflected in actual wages earned after injury, see id., at300-301; Potomac Elec. Power, supra, at 272, n. 5, and when521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtit is not, the factfinder under the Act must make a determi-nation of disability that is "reasonable" and "in the interestof justice," and one that takes account of the disability'sfuture effects, $ 8(h).In some cases a disparity between the worker's actualpostinjury wages and his job-market capacity will be obvi-ous, along with the reasons for it. If a disabled worker withsome present capacity chooses not to work at all, or to workat less than his capacity, a windfall is avoided by determiningpresent disability and awarding a benefit accordingly. See,e. g., Penrod Drilling Co. v. Johnson, 905 F. 2d 84, 87-88(CA5 1990). At the other extreme, a worker with somepresent disability may nonetheless be fortunate enough toreceive not merely the market wages appropriate for his diminished capacity, but full preinjury wages (say, because anemployer is generous, for whatever reason). See, e. g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. McLellan, 288 F. 2d 250, 251 (CA2 1961); seealso Edwards v. Director, OWCP, 999 F. 2d 1374, 1375-1376(CA9 1993) (holding that wages from short-lived employmentdo not represent actual earning capacity on open market).Once again, the present disability may still be calculated anda corresponding award made.A problem in applying the provisions applicable whenthere is a disparity between current wages and wageearning capacity arises in a case like this one, however. Theworker now receives appropriate market wages as high orhigher than those before his injury, thus experiencing nodecline in present capacity. And yet (we assume for now)there is some particular likelihood that in the future the combination of injury and market conditions may leave him witha lower capacity. The question is whether such a person ispresently disabled within the meaning of the statute, and ifso, what provision should be made for the potential effectsof disability in the future.There are two reasons to treat such a person as presentlydisabled under the statute. The first follows from the provi521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsion of law that on its face bars an injured worker from wait-ing for adverse economic effects to occur in the future beforebringing his disability claim, which generally must be filedwithin a year of injury. $ 13(a), 33 U. S. C. $ 913(a); Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 342 U. S. 197 (1952). He isalso barred from seeking a new, modified award after oneyear from the date of any denial or termination of benefits.$ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922. Because an injured worker who hasa basis to anticipate wage loss in the future resulting from acombination of his injury and job-market opportunities mustnonetheless claim promptly, it is likely that Congress in-tended "disability" to include the injury-related potential forfuture wage loss.2 And because a losing claimant loses forall time after one year from the denial or termination of benefits, it is equally likely that Congress intended such a claim-ant to obtain some award of benefits in anticipation of thefuture potential loss.2 A different conclusion might, perhaps, be drawn from our observation46 years ago in Pillsbury, 342 U. S., at 198-199, that the agency allowedclaims to be filed within one year of injury but before recovery for presentdisability could be had. If that practice were assumed to be authorizedby the Act, an injured worker who anticipated future loss of earning capacity could file a claim within the 1-year period permitted by $ 13(a) yetdefer litigation of the claim indefinitely until a capacity loss manifesteditself, thereby undercutting our inference from the limitations provisionthat present disability must be conceived as including the potential forfuture decline in capacity. But it seems unlikely that when Congressenacted $ 13(a) it intended workers to be able to file claims before theycould establish all the elements entitling them to compensation. Moreover, while the practical effect of permitting protective filings and indefinitely deferring adjudication is in one respect the same as awarding nominal compensation when there is a significant possibility of future capacityloss, in that both approaches hold open the possibility of compensating aworker when the potential future economic effects of his injury actuallyappear, the former approach, unlike the latter, has the defect of puttingoff the adjudication of every element of the worker's claim, including suchmatters as the work-related nature of the injury, until long after the evidence grows stale. We therefore think that the inference we draw fromthe limitations provision is the better one.521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the CourtThis conclusion is confirmed by the provision of $ 8(h) thatin cases of disparity between actual wages and earning capacity, the natural effects of disability that will occur in thefuture must be given "due regard" as one of the "factorsor circumstances in the case which may affect [a claimant's]capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition." Althoughthis mandate is phrased in general terms, its practical effectis limited to the class of cases at issue here, where theworker is presently able to earn at least as much as beforehis injury. In all other cases, when injury depresses theclaimant's wage-earning capacity under the conditions pre-vailing at the time of an award, so that the present effectsof his disability are unquestionably compensable immedi-ately, the Act already makes provision for the future effectsof disability by means of $ 22, which liberally permits modi-fication of awards in response to changed conditions thatoccur within one year of the last payment of compensation(or a denial or termination of benefits). 33 U. S. C. $ 922.Rambo I held that this provision allows modification when-ever a changed combination of training and economic (letalone physical) circumstances reduces, restores, or improveswage-earning capacity. 515 U. S., at 296-297.3 Since ongoing awards may be modified if future possibilities becomepresent realities, there is no need to account for such possibilities in calculating a worker's immediately compensabledisability; the Act plainly takes a wait-and-see approach tofuture contingencies here.4 The first award in this case was3 As we noted in Rambo I, however, not every fluctuation in actualwages is a ground for modification, but only those shifts reflecting achange in the worker's underlying capacity, see 515 U. S., at 300-301, suchas a change in physical condition, skill level, or the availability of suitablejobs. "There may be cases raising difficult questions as to what constitutes a change in wage-earning capacity, but we need not address themhere." Ibid.4 In liberally permitting modification, the Act resembles virtually allother workers' compensation schemes. See 3 A. Larson & L. Larson, Lawof Workmen's Compensation $ 81.10, p. 15-1045 (1996). "[I]t is one of the521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Courta standard illustration of the proper practice of basing capac-ity determinations and compensation awards on present reality. If Rambo's initial award had already been discountedto reflect the odds of his obtaining less strenuous but higherpaying work in the future, Rambo I could hardly have heldthat the Act permitted reduction of that initial award againwhen Rambo actually received training as a crane operatorand found work using his new skills. The first award simplyreflected the degree of diminished capacity operative at thetime it was made, and it was proper to revise it when conditions changed.Thus, if $ 8(h)'s admonition to consider future effects whencalculating capacity has any practical application, it must bebecause it may apply in a case such as this one, in whichthere is no present wage loss and would thus be no presentaward if compensation were to be based solely on presentemployment conditions. If the future were ignored andcompensation altogether denied whenever present earningcapacity had not (yet) declined, $ 22 would bar modificationin response to future changes in condition after one year.main advantages of the reopening device [in workers' compensationschemes] that it permits a commission to make the best estimate of disability it can at the time of the original award, although at that moment itmay be impossible to predict the extent of future disability, without havingto worry about being forever bound by the first appraisal." Id., $ 81.31(a),at 15-1127 to 15-1132 (footnotes omitted).The need for finality in workers' compensation awards is further reduced because compensation is paid periodically over the life of the disability, rather than in a lump sum, see $$ 14(a), (b), 33 U. S. C. $$ 914(a), (b)(providing for periodic payment of compensation). Thus, modifying aworker's compensation award generally affects future payments only,rather than retroactively adjusting a prior lump-sum payment. "Underthe typical award in the form of periodic payments . . . , the objectives of[workers' compensation] legislation are best accomplished if the commission can increase, decrease, revive, or terminate payments to correspondto a claimant's changed condition," subject, under most such laws, tocertain time limitations. 3 Larson, Law of Workmen's Compensation$ 81.10, at 15-1045; id., $ 81.21, at 15-1046 to 15-1047.521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the CourtTo implement the mandate of $ 8(h) in this class of cases,then, "disability" must be read broadly enough to cover lossof capacity not just as a product of the worker's injury andpresent market conditions, but as a potential product of injury and market opportunities in the future. There must, inother words, be a cognizable category of disability that ispotentially substantial, but presently nominal in character.There being, then, a need to account for potential futureeffects in a present determination of wage-earning capacity(and thus disability) when capacity does not immediately decline, the question is which of two basic methods to chooseto do this. The first would be to make a one-time calculationof a periodic benefit following the approach of the commonlaw of torts, which bases lump-sum awards for loss of futureearnings on an estimate of "the difference . . . between thevalue of the plaintiff 's services as they will be in view of theharm and as they would have been had there been no harm."Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 924, Comment d, p. 525(1977). This predictive approach ordinarily requires consid-eration of every possible variable that could have an impacton ability to earn, including "[e]nvironmental factors such asthe condition of the labor market, the chance of advancementor of being laid off, and the like." 4 F. Harper, F. James, &O. Gray, Law of Torts $ 25.8, pp. 550-551 (2d ed. 1986) (footnote omitted). Prediction of future employment may wellbe the most troublesome step in this wide-ranging enquiry.As the tripling of Rambo's own earnings shows, a claimant'sfuture ability to earn wages will vary as greatly as opportunity varies, and any estimate of wage-earning potential turnsin part on the probabilities over time that suitable jobswithin certain ranges of pay will actually be open. In thesecalculations, there is room for error.5 Cf. id., $ 25.8, at 5535 As a simplified example of the sort of calculation that would be required under this approach, a factfinder might decide in the present casethat Rambo has a 75% chance of keeping work as a crane operator with521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Court(to determine lost wage-earning capacity, juries must often"use their judgment (in effect, . . . speculate)"). That juriesin tort cases must routinely engage in such difficult predic-tions (compounded further by discounting for present value)is the price paid by the common-law approach for the finalityof a one-time lump-sum judgment.The second possible way to account for future developments would be to do in this situation just what the Actalready does through the modification provision in the runof cases: to wait and see, that is, to base calculation of diminished wage-earning capacity, and thus compensation, on current realities and to permit modifications reflecting the actual effects of an employee's disability as manifested overtime. This way, finality is exchanged for accuracy, both incompensating a worker for the actual economic effects of hisinjury, and in charging the employer and his insurer for thatamount alone.Metropolitan denies that the second, wait-and-see alternative is even open, arguing that $ 8(h) gives the factfinder onlytwo choices: either deny compensation altogether because aclaimant's actual wages have not diminished, or, if the ALJconcludes that the worker's current income does not fairlyrepresent his present wage-earning capacity, calculate theannual earnings of $60,000, and a 25% chance of being laid off from thatjob and remaining unemployed with no income because his injuries wouldprevent him from performing more strenuous work, for a weighted average future wage-earning capacity of $45,000. (($60,0002.75)~($02.25)$$45,000.) Of course, even if the factfinder somehow got the probabilities and earnings for each possible future state right, the weighted average future capacity would rarely correspond to actual developments. Inour hypothetical, Rambo's actual future capacity would be $15,000 a yearmore than his predicted capacity if he kept his job as a crane operator,and $45,000 less if he lost that job and found no other. Thus, if a compensation award were based on the weighted average, Rambo would necessarily end up either overcompensated or undercompensated, even though theAct might meet its objectives for the system as a whole.521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN134 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtextent of the worker's disability (and his consequent entitle-ment to compensation)in toto based on all relevant factors,including the future effects of the disability. See Brief forPetitioner 9. What we have already said, however, showsthe unsoundness of Metropolitan's two options.The practical effect of denying any compensation to a dis-abled claimant on the ground that he is presently able toearn as much as (or more than) before his injury would runafoul of the Act's mandate to account for the future effectsof disability in fashioning an award, since those effects wouldnot be reflected in the current award and the 1-year statuteof limitations for modification after denial of compensationwould foreclose responding to such effects on a wait-andsee basis as they might arise.6 On the other hand, trying tohonor that mandate by basing a present award on a comprehensive prediction of an inherently uncertain futurewould, as we have seen, almost always result in presentovercompensation or undercompensation. And it would bepassing strange to credit Congress with the intent to guarantee fairness to employers and employees by a wait-and-seeapproach in most cases where future effects are imperfectlyforeseeable, but to find no such intent in one class of cases,those in which wage-earning ability does not immediatelydecline.76 The one possible escape from this conclusion rests on an implausiblereading of the Act. A claimant could, arguably, preserve a right to compensation in the future by reapplying within the 1-year period and successively each year thereafter. See $ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922 (permitting modification "at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim"). Butthis would be a strange way to administer the Act, for its very premise isthat a claimant would repeatedly file reapplications knowing his disabilityto be without present effect and (on Metropolitan's theory) himself withoutany good-faith claim to the present compensation sought.7 The legislative history to the 1938 amendments to the Act, which added$ 8(h), indicates that Congress understood that the reference to future effects in the new subsection would interact with $ 22 by allowing compensation for permanent partial disability for employees whose job opportunities are narrowed by injury but whose wages have not declined:521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThere is moreover an even more fundamental objection toMetropolitan's proposed options. They implicitly reject thevery conclusion required to make sense of the combined pro-visions limiting claims and mandating consideration of futureeffects: that a disability whose substantial effects are onlypotential is nonetheless a present disability, albeit a presently nominal one. It is, indeed, this realization that pointstoward a way to employ the wait-and-see approach to provide for the future effects of disability when capacity doesnot immediately decline. It is simply "reasonable" and "inthe interest of justice" (to use the language of $ 8(h)) to re-flect merely nominal current disability with a correspondingly nominal award. Ordering nominal compensation holdsopen the possibility of a modified award if a future conjunction of injury, training, and employment opportunity shouldlater depress the worker's ability to earn wages below thepreinjury level, turning the potential disability into an actualone. It allows full scope to the mandate to consider the future effects of disability, it promotes accuracy, it preservesadministrative simplicity by obviating cumbersome enquiriesrelating to the entire range of possible future states of af-fairs,8 and it avoids imputing to Congress the unlikely intent"[Section 8(h)] provides for consideration of the effects of an injury . . .upon the employee's future ability to earn. . . .

RAMBOOpinion of the Courtto join a wait-and-see rule for most cases with a predict-the-future method when the disability results in no current decline in what the worker can earn.Our view, as it turns out, coincides on this point with theposition taken by the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), who is charged with the ad-ministration of the Act, and who also construes the Act aspermitting nominal compensation as a mechanism for takingfuture effects of disability into account when present wageearning ability remains undiminished. See Brief for Direc-tor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs 12-21, 24-31.The Secretary of Labor has delegated the bulk of her statutory authority to administer and enforce the Act, includingrulemaking power, to the Director, see Director, Office ofWorkers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 125-126 (1995);Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers'Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248, 262-263 (1997), andthe Director's reasonable interpretation of the Act brings atleast some added persuasive force to our conclusion, see, e. g.,Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.

Here it is enough to recall that in thosecases where an injury immediately depresses ability to earnwages under present conditions, the payment of actual compensation holds open the option of modification under $ 22even for future changes in condition whose probability of occurrence may well be remote at the time of the originalaward. Consistent application of the Act's wait-and-see approach thus suggests that nominal compensation permitting521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN137Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Courtfuture modification should not be limited to instances wherea decline in capacity can be shown to a high degree of statistical likelihood. Those courts to have dealt with the matterexplicitly have required a showing that there is a significantpossibility that a worker's wage-earning capacity will atsome future point fall below his preinjury wages, seeHole v.Miami Shipyards Corp., 640 F. 2d 769, 772 (CA5 1981); Randall v. Comfort Control, Inc., 725 F. 2d 791, 800 (CADC1984), and, in the absence of rulemaking by the agency specifying how substantial the possibility of future decline in ca-pacity must be to justify a nominal award, we adopt thisstandard.99 The OWCP Director argues that when the employee has the burden ofpersuasion, the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) preponderance ofthe evidence standard (see infra, at 139) requires him to show that aninjury-related future decline in wages is more likely than not to occur.Brief for Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs 22-23.The Director's position confuses the degree of certainty needed to find afact or element under the preponderance standard with the fact or elementto be so established, which in this case is the statistical odds that wageearning capacity will decline in the future. "The burden of showing something by a preponderance of the evidence . . . simply requires the trier offact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before [he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden topersuade the [judge] of the fact's existence." Concrete Pipe & Productsof Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.,508 U. S. 602, 622 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). In otherwords, the preponderance standard goes to how convincing the evidencein favor of a fact must be in comparison with the evidence against it beforethat fact may be found, but does not determine what facts must be provenas a substantive part of a claim or defense. See Greenwich Collieries v.Director, OWCP, 990 F. 2d 730, 736 (CA3 1993) ("A preponderance of theevidence is . . . [e]vidence which is . . . more convincing than the evidence. . . offered in opposition to it . . ." (internal quotation marks omitted)),aff'd, 512 U. S. 267 (1994). Unlike other standards of proof such as reasonable doubt or clear and convincing evidence, the preponderance standard"allows both parties to share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion,"Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 390 (1983) (internalquotation marks omitted), except that "when the evidence is evenly balanced, the [party with the burden of persuasion] must lose," Director, Of521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN138 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the CourtWe therefore hold that a worker is entitled to nominalcompensation when his work-related injury has not diminished his present wage-earning capacity under current cir-cumstances, but there is a significant potential that the injury will cause diminished capacity under future conditions.IIIThe application of this legal standard to the case before usdepends in part on how the burden of persuasion is allocated.Section 7(c) of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d), which applies toadjudications under the Act, see Director, Office of Workers'Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U. S.267, 270 (1994), places the burden of persuasion on the proponent of an order, id., at 272-281; when the evidence is evenlyfice of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512U. S. 267, 281 (1994). Thus, under the preponderance standard, proof thata future decline in capacity is more likely than not (in the sense that theevidence predicting such a decline is more convincing than the evidencepredicting none) would be required only if the fact of such a decline, ratherthan some degree of probability of its occurrence, were a substantive element of a claim for nominal compensation, which the Director does notmaintain.Even assuming that the Director's formally promulgated constructionof the LHWCA would be entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), seeDirector, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport NewsShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 134 (1995), we do not deferto the Director's interpretation here of the APA's provision for allocatingthe burden of persuasion under the preponderance of the evidence standard, for three reasons. (1) The APA is not a statute that the Director ischarged with administering. Cf. Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 148(1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting); Chevron, supra, at 842; Professional Reactor Operator Soc. v. NRC, 939 F. 2d 1047, 1051 (CADC 1991). (2) Thisinterpretation does not appear to be embodied in any regulation or similarbinding policy pronouncement to which such deference would apply. SeeSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740-741 (1996); 1K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 3.5, p. 120 (3d ed.1994). (3) The interpretation is couched in a logical non sequitur, as justexplained.521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)Opinion of the Courtbalanced, the proponent loses, see id., at 281. On the initialclaim for nominal compensation under the Act, then, the employee has the burden of showing by a preponderance of theevidence that he has been injured and that the odds are significant that his wage-earning capacity will fall below hispreinjury wages at some point in the future. But when anemployer seeks modification of previously awarded compensation, the employer is the proponent of the order with theburden of establishing a change in conditions justifying modification. In a case like this, where the prior award wasbased on a finding of economic harm resulting from an actualdecline in wage-earning capacity at the time the award wasentered, the employer satisfies this burden by showing thatas a result of a change in capacity the employee's wages haverisen to a level at or above his preinjury earnings. Oncethe employer makes this showing, $ 8(h) gives rise to thepresumption that the employee's wage-earning capacity isequal to his current, higher wage and, in the face of thispresumption, the burden shifts back to the claimant to showthat the likelihood of a future decline in capacity is sufficientfor an award of nominal compensation. We emphasize thatthe probability of a future decline is a matter of proof; it isnot to be assumed pro forma as an administrative convenience in the run of cases.In this case, the first award of compensation was based onthe parties' stipulation that Rambo suffered 221/2% permanent partial disability as a result of his injury, wherebyRambo established that the injury impaired his ability toundertake at least some types of previously available gainfullabor and thus prevented him from earning as much as hehad before his accident. Metropolitan sought termination ofthe award based solely on evidence, which the ALJ foundpersuasive, that Rambo is now able to earn market wagesas a crane operator significantly greater than his preinjuryearnings. There is therefore substantial evidence in therecord supporting the ALJ's decision to terminate actual (as521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtopposed to nominal) benefits, since under present conditionsRambo's capacity to earn wages is no longer depressed. Butthe ALJ failed to consider whether there is a significantpossibility that Rambo's wage-earning capacity will declineagain in the future.10 Because there is no evidence in therecord of the modification proceedings showing that Rambo'sphysical condition has improved to the point of full recovery,the parties' earlier stipulation of permanent partial disabilityat least raises the possibility that Rambo's ability to earnwill decline in the event he loses his current employment asa crane operator. The ALJ's order altogether terminatingbenefits must therefore be vacated for failure to considerwhether a future decline in Rambo's earning capacity issufficiently likely to justify nominal compensation. Sincethe ALJ is the factfinder under the Act, see $$ 21(b)(3), (c),33 U. S. C. $$ 921(b)(3), (c), however, the Court of Appealsshould have remanded to the agency for further findings offact, see, e. g., Randall v. Comfort Control, Inc., 725 F. 2d,at 799-800 (remanding for consideration of nominal award),instead of directing entry of a nominal award based on itsown appraisal of the evidence. We therefore vacate theNinth Circuit's judgment insofar as it directs entry of an10 The dissent argues that the ALJ expressly found that Rambo's present wages adequately reflect his future prospects. Post, at 148-150. Inour view, however, the language in the modification order relied on by thedissent addresses whether Rambo's current wages accurately reflect hisearning capacity under present market conditions, see supra, at 128 (current wages do not always reflect current capacity); Edwards v. Director,OWCP, 999 F. 2d 1374, 1375 (CA9 1993) (adopting OWCP Director's position that "earnings in post-injury employment must be sufficiently regularto establish true earning capacity"), not the distinct question whetherthere is a significant chance that his ability to earn will again decline inthe future. See App. 53 (ALJ characterized his task as "consider[ing]wage-earning capacity in an open labor market under normal employmentconditions"). The ALJ's failure to consider the latter question is not surprising, since prior to this case there was no governing authority fromthis Court or the Ninth Circuit approving nominal awards for possiblefuture declines.521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN141Cite as: 521 U.
