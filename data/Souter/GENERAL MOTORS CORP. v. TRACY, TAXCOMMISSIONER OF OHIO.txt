Thequestion here is whether this difference in tax treatment be-tween sales of gas by domestic utilities subject to regulationand sales of gas by other entities violates the CommerceClause or Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Wehold that it does not. IDuring the tax period at issue,1 Ohio levied a 5% tax onthe in-state sales of goods, including natural gas, see OhioRev. Code Ann. $$ 5739.02, 5739.025 (Supp. 1990), and it im-posed a parallel 5% use tax on goods purchased out-of-statefor use in Ohio. See $ 5741.02 (1986). Local jurisdictionswere authorized to levy certain additional taxes that increased these sales and use tax rates to as much as 7% insome municipalities. See $ 5739.025 (Supp. 1990); ReplyBrief for Petitioner 13, n. 11.Since 1935, when Ohio's first sales and use taxes wereimposed, the State has exempted natural gas sales by "nat-ural gas compan[ies]" from all state and local sales taxes.$ 5739.02(B)(7).2 Under Ohio law, "[a]ny person . . . [i]s anatural gas company when engaged in the business of supplying natural gas for lighting, power, or heating purposesto consumers within this state." $ 5727.01(D)(4) (1996); seealso $ 5727.01(E)(4) (Supp. 1990); $ 5727.01(E)(8) (1986). Itis undisputed that natural gas utilities (generally termed"local distribution companies" or LDC's) located in Ohio sat-isfy this definition of "natural gas company." The SupremeCourt of Ohio has, however, interpreted the statutory termto exclude non-LDC gas sellers, such as producers and independent marketers, see Chrysler Corp. v. Tracy, 73 Ohio St.1 The natural gas purchases that gave rise to petitioner's challenge weremade during the period from October 1, 1986, to June 30, 1990.2 The exemption was originally codified at Ohio Gen. Code Ann. $ 5546-2(6) (Baldwin 1952). As part of a general recodification in 1953, it wasmoved to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 5739.02(B)(7), where it remains today.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT283Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Court3d 26, 652 N. E. 2d 185 (1995), and the State has accordinglytreated their sales as outside the exemption and so subjectto the tax.The very question of such an exclusion, and consequenttaxation of gas sales or use, reflects a recent stage of evolution in the structure of the natural gas industry. Tradition-ally, the industry was divisible into three relatively distinctsegments: producers, interstate pipelines, and LDC's. Thismarket structure was possible largely because the NaturalGas Act of 1938 (NGA), 52 Stat. 821, 15 U. S. C. $ 717 et seq.,failed to require interstate pipelines to offer transportationservices to third parties wishing to ship gas. As a result,"interstate pipelines [were able] to use their monopoly powerover gas transportation to create and maintain monopsonypower in the market for the purchase of gas at the wellheadand monopoly power in the market for the sale of gas toLDCs." Pierce, The Evolution of Natural Gas RegulatoryPolicy, 10 Nat. Resources & Env't 53, 53-54 (Summer 1995)(hereinafter Pierce). For the most part, then, producerssold their gas to the pipelines, which resold it to utilities,which in turn provided local distribution to consumers. See,e. g., Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, 824 F. 2d 981,993 (CADC 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 1006 (1988); Mogel &Gregg, Appropriateness of Imposing Common Carrier Statuson Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 4 Energy L. J. 155,157 (1983).Congress took a first step toward increasing competitionin the natural gas market by enacting the Natural Gas PolicyAct of 1978, 92 Stat. 3350, 15 U. S. C. $ 3301 et seq., whichwas designed to phase out regulation of wellhead pricescharged by producers of natural gas, and to "promote gastransportation by interstate and intrastate pipelines" forthird parties. 57 Fed. Reg. 13271 (1992). Pipelines werereluctant to provide common carriage, however, when doingso would displace their own sales, see Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, supra, at 993, and in 1985, the Federal519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT284 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the CourtEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) took the furtherstep of promulgating Order No. 436, which contained an"open access" rule providing incentives for pipelines to offergas transportation services, see 50 Fed. Reg. 42408. In1992, this evolution culminated in FERC's Order No. 636,which required all interstate pipelines to "unbundle" theirtransportation services from their own natural gas sales andto provide common carriage services to buyers from othersources that wished to ship gas. See 57 Fed. Reg. 13267.Although FERC did not take the further step of requiringintrastate pipelines to provide local transportation servicesto ensure that gas sold by producers and independent mar-keters could get all the way to the point of consumption,3under the system of open access to interstate pipelines thathad emerged in the mid-1980's "larger industrial end-users"began increasingly to bypass utilities' local distribution net-works by "construct[ing] their own pipeline spurs to [interstate] pipeline[s] . . . ." Fagan, From Regulation to Deregulation: The Diminishing Role of the Small Consumer Withinthe Natural Gas Industry, 29 Tulsa L. J. 707, 723 (1994). Bypass posed a problem for LDC's, since the departure of largeend users from the system left the same fixed costs to bespread over a smaller customer base. The State of Ohioconsequently took steps in 1986 to keep some income fromlarge industrial customers within the utility system byadopting regulations that allowed industrial end users inOhio to buy natural gas from producers or independent marketers, pay interstate pipelines for interstate transportation,and pay LDC's for local transportation. See In re Commis3 Section 1(b) of the NGA, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U. S. C. $ 717(b), explicitlyexempts "local distribution of natural gas" from federal regulation. Inaddition, the Hinshaw Amendment to the NGA, 15 U. S.

Code Ann.$ 5739.02(B)(7) (Supp. 1990). In Chrysler Corp. v. Tracy, theOhio Supreme Court held that they do not. The court reasoned that independent marketers do not "suppl[y]" naturalgas as required by $ 5727.01(D)(4), because they do "not ownor control any physical assets to . . . distribute natural gas."73 Ohio St. 3d, at 28, 652 N. E. 2d, at 187. This determination of state law led in turn to the case before us now.During the tax period in question here, petitioner GeneralMotors Corporation (GMC) bought virtually all the naturalgas for its Ohio plants from out-of-state marketers, notLDC's.4 Respondent Tax Commissioner of Ohio applied theState's general use tax to GMC's purchases, and the StateBoard of Tax Appeals sustained that action. GMC appealedto the Supreme Court of Ohio on two grounds. GMC firstcontended that its purchases should be exempt from thesales tax because independent marketers fell within thestatutory definition of "natural gas company." The StateSupreme Court, citing its decision the same day inChrysler,rejected this argument. See General Motors Corp. v.Tracy, 73 Ohio St. 3d 29, 30, 652 N. E. 2d 188, 189 (1995).GMC also argued that denying the tax exemption to salesby marketers violated the Commerce and Equal ProtectionClauses. The Ohio court initially concluded that the State's4 App. 156. Pursuant to Ohio's regulations authorizing LDC's to provide local transportation services, GMC took delivery of much of this gasfrom local utilities. Id., at 156-157.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT286 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtregime did not violate the Commerce Clause because Ohiotaxes sales by "compan[ies] that d[o] not own any production,transportation, or distribution equipment" at the same rateregardless of "whether [the companies sell] natural gas instate or out-of-state." Id., at 31, 652 N. E. 2d, at 190. Thecourt then stepped back to rule, however, that GMC lackedstanding to bring its Commerce Clause challenge:"On close inspection, GM actually argues that thecommissioner's application burdens out-of-state vendorsof natural gas. However, GM is not a member of thatclass and lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of this application on that basis; our further commenton this question is inappropriate." Ibid.Finally, the court dismissed GMC's equal protection claimas "submerged in its Commerce Clause argument." Id., at31-32, 652 N. E. 2d, at 190. We granted GMC's petition forcertiorari to address the question of standing as well as theCommerce and Equal Protection Clause issues. 517 U. S.1118 (1996).IIThe Supreme Court of Ohio held GMC to be withoutstanding to raise this Commerce Clause challenge becausethe company is not one of the sellers said to suffer discrimination under the challenged tax laws. But cognizable injuryfrom unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce does not stop at members of the class against whom aState ultimately discriminates, and customers of that classmay also be injured, as in this case where the customer isliable for payment of the tax and as a result presumably paysmore for the gas it gets from out-of-state producers andmarketers. Consumers who suffer this sort of injury fromregulation forbidden under the Commerce Clause satisfy thestanding requirements of Article III. See generally Lujanv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992).519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT287Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the CourtOn similar facts, we held in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263 (1984), that in-state liquor wholesalers hadstanding to raise a Commerce Clause challenge to a Hawaiitax regime exempting certain alcohols produced in-statefrom liquor taxes. Although the wholesalers were notamong the class of out-of-state liquor producers allegedlyburdened by Hawaii's law, we reasoned that the wholesalerssuffered economic injury both because they were directly liable for the tax and because the tax raised the price of theirimported goods relative to the exempted in-state beverages.Id., at 267; see also Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325(1996) (in-state stockholder challenged tax regime imposinghigher taxes on stock from issuers with out-of-state opera-tions than on stock from purely in-state issuers); West LynnCreamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186 (1994) (in-state milkdealers challenged tax and subsidy scheme discriminatingagainst out-of-state milk producers). Bacchus applies withequal force here, and GMC "plainly ha[s] standing to challenge the tax in this Court," Bacchus Imports v. Dias, supra,at 267. We therefore turn to the merits.IIIAThe negative or dormant implication of the CommerceClause prohibits state taxation, see, e. g., Quill Corp. v.North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 312-313 (1992), or regulation,see, e. g., Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York StateLiquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 578-579 (1986), that dis-criminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerceand thereby "imped[es] free private trade in the nationalmarketplace,"Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 437 (1980).GMC claims that Ohio's differential tax treatment of naturalgas sales by marketers and regulated local utilities consti-tutes "facial" or "patent" discrimination in violation of theCommerce Clause, and it argues that differences in the na-ture of the businesses of LDC's and interstate marketers519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT288 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtcannot justify Ohio's differential treatment of these in-stateand out-of-state entities. Although the claim is not that theOhio tax scheme distinguishes in express terms between in-state and out-of-state entities, GMC argues that by grantingthe tax exemption solely to LDC's, which are in fact all lo-cated in Ohio, the State has "favor[ed] some in-state commerce while disfavoring all out-of-state commerce," Brief forPetitioner 16. That is, because the favored entities are alllocated within the State, "the tax exemption did not need tobe drafted explicitly along state lines in order to demonstrate its discriminatory design," Amerada Hess Corp. v.Director, Div. of Taxation, N. J. Dept. of Treasury, 490 U. S.66, 76 (1989). Assessing these arguments requires an understanding of the historical development of the contem-porary retail market for natural gas, to which we referredbefore and now turn in greater detail.BSince before the Civil War, gas manufactured from coaland other commodities had been used for lighting purposes,and of course it was understood that natural gas could beused the same way. See Dorner, Initial Phases of Regulation of the Gas Industry, in 1 Regulation of the Gas Industry$$ 2.03-2.06 (American Gas Assn. 1996) (hereinafter Dorner).By the early years of this century, areas in "proximity to thegas field[s],"West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229,246 (1911), did use natural gas for fuel, but it was not untilthe 1920's that the development of high-tensile steel and elec-tric welding permitted construction of high-pressure pipelines to transport natural gas from gas fields for distant con-sumption at relatively low cost. Pierce 53. By that time,the States' then-recent experiments with free market compe-tition in the manufactured gas and electricity industries haddramatically underscored the need for comprehensive regu-lation of the local gas market. Companies supplying manufactured gas proliferated in the latter half of the 19th century519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT289Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courtand, after initial efforts at regulation by statute at the statelevel proved unwieldy, the States generally left any regulation of the industry to local governments. See Dorner$$ 2.03, 2.04. Many of those municipalities honored the tenets of laissez-faire to the point of permitting multiple gasfranchisees to serve a single area and relying on competitionto protect the public interest. Ibid. The results were bothpredictable and disastrous, including an initial period of"wasteful competition," 5 followed by massive consolidationand the threat of monopolistic pricing.6 The public sufferedthrough essentially the same evolution in the electric indus-try.7 Thus, by the time natural gas became a widely mar5 During this period, " `[t]he public grew weary of the interminable ratewars which were invariably followed by a period of recoupment duringwhich the victorious would attempt to make the price of the battle of theconsumers by way of increased rates. Investors suffered heavy lossesthrough the manipulation of fly-by-night paper concerns operating with`nuisance' franchises. . . . Everybody suffered the inconvenience of citystreets being constantly torn up and replaced by installation and relocation of duplicate facilities. The situation in New York City alone, priorto the major gas company consolidations, threatened municipal chaos.' "Dorner $ 2.03 (quoting Welch, The Odyssey of Gas--A Record of IndustrialCourage, 24 Pub. Utils. Fortnightly 500, 501-502 (1939)).6 Reticence was not the order of the day. When, for example, the lasttwo surviving gas companies supplying the citizens of Brooklyn announcedtheir merger in October 1883, they also announced that gas prices wouldimmediately double.

Dorner, Beginnings of theGas Industry, in 1 Regulation of the Gas Industry $ 1.06 (American GasAssn. 1996). Again, after an initial period of unsuccessful regulation bystate statute, States mostly left regulation of the electric industry tomunicipal or local government.

Id., at 299. The results were "ruinous and shortlived." Ibid. For example, 45 mostly overlapping franchises weregranted for electric utility operation in Chicago between 1882 and 1905.By 1905, however, a single monopoly entity had emerged from the chaos,and customers ended up paying monopoly prices.

TRACYOpinion of the Courtketable commodity, the States had learned from chasteningexperience that public streets could not be continually tornup to lay competitors' pipes, that investments in parallel delivery systems for different fractions of a local market wouldlimit the value to consumers of any price competition, andthat competition would simply give over to monopoly in duecourse. It seemed virtually an economic necessity forStates to provide a single, local franchise with a businessopportunity free of competition from any source, within orwithout the State, so long as the creation of exclusive franchises under state law could be balanced by regulation andthe imposition of obligations to the consuming public uponthe franchised retailers.Almost as soon as the States began regulating natural gasretail monopolies, their power to do so was challenged byinterstate vendors as inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause. While recognizing the interstate characterof commerce in natural gas, the Court nonetheless affirmedthe States' power to regulate, as a matter of local concern, alldirect sales of gas to consumers within their borders, absentcongressional prohibition of such state regulation. See, e. g.,Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 252U. S. 23, 28-31 (1920); Public Util. Comm'n of Kan. v. Landon, 249 U. S. 236, 245-246 (1919). At the same time, theCourt concluded that the dormant Commerce Clause prevents the States from regulating interstate transportationor sales for resale of natural gas. See, e. g., Missouri ex rel.Barrett v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 265 U. S. 298, 307-310(1924); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 596-600, reaffirmed on rehearing, 263 U. S. 350 (1923). See generally Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Ill. Public ServiceCo., 314 U. S. 498, 504-505 (1942) (summarizing prior casesdistinguishing between permissible and impermissible stateregulation of commerce in natural gas). Thus, the Courtnever questioned the power of the States to regulate retail519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT291Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsales of gas within their respective jurisdictions. Dorner$ 2.06.8When federal regulation of the natural gas industry finallybegan in 1938, Congress, too, clearly recognized the value ofsuch state-regulated monopoly arrangements for the sale anddistribution of natural gas directly to local consumers.Thus, $ 1(b) of the NGA, 15 U. S. C. $ 717(b), explicitlyexempted "local distribution of natural gas" from federalregulation, even as the NGA authorized the Federal Power8 In Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n,461 U. S. 375 (1983), we rejected the bright-line distinction between wholesale and retail sales drawn by these older cases and concluded that stateregulation of wholesale sales of electricity transmitted in interstate commerce is not precluded by the Commerce Clause. Reasoning that utilitiesshould not be insulated from our contemporary dormant Commerce Clausejurisprudence by formalistic judge-made rules, id., at 391, we looked instead to " `the nature of the state regulation involved, the objective of thestate, and the effect of the regulation upon the national interest in thecommerce,' " id., at 390 (quoting Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Ill.Public Service Co., 314 U. S. 498, 505 (1942)), to determine whether Stateshave a sufficient interest in regulating wholesale rates within their borders, and had no problem concluding that States do indeed have such aninterest, with the result that state regulation of wholesale rates is notprecluded by the Commerce Clause (in the absence of pre-emptive congressional action), id., at 394-395. While the holding of Arkansas Electric thereby expanded both the permissible scope of state utility regulation and judicial recognition of the important state interests in suchregulation, the reasoning of the case equally implies that state regulationof retail sales is not, as a constitutional matter, immune from our ordinaryCommerce Clause jurisprudence, and to the extent that our earlier casesmay have implied such immunity they are no longer good law. Nothingin Arkansas Electric undermines the earlier cases' recognition of the powerful state interest in regulating sales to domestic consumers buying atretail, however, which we reaffirm here. In addition, Arkansas Electricdoes not disturb the relevance of the wholesale/retail distinction for construing the jurisdictional provisions of statutes such as the NGA, whichwe discuss immediately below. See id., at 380, and n. 3; see also Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 300-301 (1988) ("The NGA confers upon FERC exclusive jurisdiction over the transportation and sale ofnatural gas in interstate commerce for resale").519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT292 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v.

PanhandleEastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Ind., 332U. S. 507, 516-522 (1947). Thus, the NGA "was drawn withmeticulous regard for the continued exercise of state power,not to handicap or dilute it in any way," id., at 517-518; "thescheme was one of cooperative action between federal andstate agencies" to "protect consumers against exploitationat the hands of natural gas companies," id., at 520 (internalquotation marks omitted); and "Congress' action . . . was anunequivocal recognition of the vital interests of the statesand their people, consumers and industry alike, in the regulation of rates and service," id., at 521; see also PanhandleEastern Pipe Line Co. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 341U. S. 329, 334 (1951) ("Direct sales [of natural gas] for consumptive use were designedly left to state regulation" bythe NGA).

Panhandle-Indiana, supra,at 521.And Congress once again acknowledged the important roleof the States in regulating intrastate transportation and distribution of natural gas in 1953 when, in the wake of a deci-sion of this Court permitting the FPC to regulate intrastategas transportation by LDC's, see FPC v. East Ohio Gas Co.,338 U. S. 464 (1950), Congress amended the NGA to "leav[e]jurisdiction" over "companies engaged in the distribution" ofnatural gas "exclusively in the States, as always has beenintended." S. Rep. No. 817, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1953);see 15 U. S. C. $ 717(c).For 40 years, the complementary federal regulation of theinterstate market and congressionally approved state regulation of the intrastate gas trade thus endured unchanged inany way relevant to this case. The resulting market structure virtually precluded competition between LDC's andother potential suppliers of natural gas for direct sales toconsumers, including large industrial consumers. The sim-plicity of this dual system of federal and state regulationbegan to erode in 1978, however, when Congress first encour-aged interstate pipelines to provide transportation servicesto end users wishing to ship gas,9 and thereby moved towardproviding a real choice to those consumers who were able tobuy gas on the open market and were willing to take it freeof state-created obligations to the buyer. The upshot of congressional and regulatory developments over the next 15years was increasing opportunity for a consumer in that classto choose between gas sold by marketers and gas bundledwith rights and benefits mandated by state regulators as soldby LDC's. But amidst such changes, two things remainedthe same throughout the period involved in this case.

S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe LDC's could not exact "a greater or lesser compensationfor any services rendered . . . than [exacted] . . . from anyother [customer] for doing a like and contemporaneous serv-ice under substantially the same circumstances and conditions." Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 4905.33 (Supp. 1990).The State also required LDC's to serve all members ofthe public, without discrimination, throughout their fields ofoperations. See, e. g., Industrial Gas Co. v. Public UtilitiesComm'n of Ohio, 135 Ohio St. 408, 21 N. E. 2d 166 (1939).They could not "pick out good portions of a particular terri-tory, serve only select customers under private contract, andrefuse service . . . to . . . other users," id., at 413, 21 N. E. 2d,at 168, or terminate service except for reasons defined bystatute and by following statutory procedures, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. $$ 4933.12, 4933.121 (Supp. 1990). When serving"human needs" consumers including "residential [and] othercustomers . . . where the element of human welfare [was] thepredominant factor,"In re Commission Ordered Investigation of the Availability of Gas Transportation Service Provided by Ohio Gas Distribution Utilities to End-Use Customers, No. 85-800-GA-COI (Ohio Pub. Util. Comm'n, Aug.1, 1989), Ohio LDC's were required to provide a firm backupsupply of gas, see ibid., and administer specific protectiveschemes, as by helping to assure a degree of continued serv-ice to low-income customers despite unpaid bills. See,e. g.,Ohio Admin. Code 4901:1-18 (Ohio Monthly Record Nov.1991).IVThe fact that the local utilities continue to provide a product consisting of gas bundled with the services and protec-tions summarized above, a product thus different from themarketer's unbundled gas, raises a hurdle for GMC's claimsales tax. The record provides no support for this contention, and theconstitutionality of Ohio exempting from state sales tax utility sales thatare not price regulated is therefore not before the Court in this case.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT298 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtthat Ohio's differential tax treatment of natural gas utilitiesand independent marketers violates our " `virtually per serule of invalidity,' " Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman,511 U. S. 641, 647 (1994) (quoting Philadelphia v. New Jersey,437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)), prohibiting facial discriminationagainst interstate commerce.AConceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination12assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities. Al12 Although GMC raises only a "facial discrimination" challenge to Ohio'stax scheme, our cases have indicated that even nondiscriminatory statelegislation may be invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause, when, inthe words of the so-called Pike undue burden test, "the burden imposedon [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putativelocal benefits," Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970).There is, however, no clear line between these two strands of analysis,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476U. S. 573, 579 (1986), and several cases that have purported to apply theundue burden test (including Pike itself) arguably turned in whole or inpart on the discriminatory character of the challenged state regulations,see, e. g., Pike, supra, at 145 (declaring packing order "virtually per seillegal" because it required business operation to be performed in-state);Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662, 677 (1981)(plurality opinion of Powell, J.) (noting that in adopting invalidated trucklength regulation the State "seems to have hoped to limit the use of itshighways by deflecting some through traffic"); id., at 679-687 (Brennan,J., concurring in judgment) (emphasizing that truck-length regulationshould be invalidated solely in view of its protectionist purpose); see generally Regan, The Supreme Court and State Protectionism: Making Senseof the Dormant Commerce Clause, 84 Mich. L. Rev. 1091 (1986). Nonetheless, a small number of our cases have invalidated state laws under thedormant Commerce Clause that appear to have been genuinely nondiscriminatory, in the sense that they did not impose disparate treatmenton similarly situated in-state and out-of-state interests, where such lawsundermined a compelling need for national uniformity in regulation. SeeBibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U. S. 520 (1959) (conflict in statelaws governing truck mud flaps); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel.Sullivan, 325 U.

S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthough this central assumption has more often than not itselfremained dormant in this Court's opinions on state discrimination subject to review under the dormant CommerceClause, when the allegedly competing entities provide different products, as here, there is a threshold question whetherthe companies are indeed similarly situated for constitutionalpurposes. This is so for the simple reason that the differ-ence in products may mean that the different entities servedifferent markets, and would continue to do so even if thesupposedly discriminatory burden were removed. If in factthat should be the case, eliminating the tax or other regula-tory differential would not serve the dormant CommerceClause's fundamental objective of preserving a national mar-ket for competition undisturbed by preferential advantagesconferred by a State upon its residents or resident competi-tors. In Justice Jackson's now-famous words:"Our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, isthat every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have freeaccess to every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign statewill by customs duties or regulations exclude them.Likewise, every consumer may look to the free competi-tion from every producing area in the Nation to protectCommerce Clause cases also have invalidated statutes that may adverselyaffect interstate commerce by subjecting activities to inconsistent regulations"); L. Brilmayer, Conflict of Laws $ 3.2.3, pp. 144-148 (2d ed. 1995)(discussing Court's review of conflicting state laws under the dormantCommerce Clause). In the realm of taxation, the requirement of apportionment plays a similar role by assuring that interstate activities are notunjustly burdened by multistate taxation. See generally Oklahoma TaxComm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 184-185 (1995) (discussing"internal" and "external" consistency tests for apportionment of statetaxes). Of course, the fact that Ohio exempts local utilities from its salesand use taxes could not support any claim of undue burden in this nondiscriminatory sense, since the exemption itself does not give rise to conflicting regulation of any transaction or result in malapportionment of any tax.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT300 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v.

Hood & Sons, Inc. v.Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 539 (1949).See also, e. g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.

Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432U. S. 333, 350 (1977) (referring to "the Commerce Clause'soverriding requirement of a national `common market' ").Thus, in the absence of actual or prospective competition between the supposedly favored and disfavored entities in asingle market there can be no local preference, whether byexpress discrimination against interstate commerce or undueburden upon it, to which the dormant Commerce Clause mayapply. The dormant Commerce Clause protects marketsand participants in markets, not taxpayers as such.Our cases have, however, rarely discussed the comparabil-ity of taxed or regulated entities as operators in arguablydistinct markets; the closest approach to the facts here oc-curred in Alaska v. Arctic Maid, 366 U. S. 199 (1961). InArctic Maid, a 4% tax on the value of salmon taken fromterritorial waters by so-called freezer ships and frozen fortransport and later canning outside the State was challengedas discriminatory in the face of a 1% tax on the value of fishtaken from territorial waters and frozen by on-shore coldstorage facilities for later sale on the domestic fresh-frozenfish market. The State prevailed on the Court's holding thatthe claimants and cold storage facilities served separate markets, did not compete with one another, and thus could notproperly be compared for Commerce Clause purposes. Theproper comparison, the Court held, was between the freezer519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT301Cite as: 519 U.

Sincethe canners were taxed even more heavily than the freezerships, there was no unfavorable burden upon the latter.Id.,at 204. Although the Court's opinion did not discuss thepossibility that competition in the domestic fresh-frozen mar-ket might have occurred in the absence of the tax disparitybetween the two types of salmon freezers, the freezer shipshad made no attempt to compete in that market and neitherclaimed nor demonstrated an interest in entering it. SeeBrief for Respondents inAlaska v. Arctic Maid, O. T. 1960,No. 106, pp. 27-33.Arctic Maid provides a partial analogy to this case.Here, natural gas marketers did not serve the Ohio LDCs'core market of small, captive users, typified by residentialconsumers who want and need the bundled product. See,e. g., Darr, A State Regulatory Strategy for the TransitionalPhase of Gas Regulation, 12 Yale J. Reg. 69, 99 (1995) ("[T]helarge core residential customer base is bound to the LDCin what currently appears to be a natural-monopoly relationship"); App. 199 (a marketer from which GMC purchasedgas does not hold itself out to the general public as a gassupplier, but rather selectively contacts industrial end usersthat it has identified as potentially profitable customers).While this captive market is not geographically distinguished from the area served by the independent marketers,it is defined economically as comprising consumers who arecaptive to the need for bundled benefits. These are buyerswho live on sufficiently tight budgets to make the stabilityof rate important, and who cannot readily bear the risk oflosing a fuel supply in harsh natural or economic weather.See, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. FERC, 676F. 2d 763, 766, n. 5 (CADC 1982) ("[R]esidential users [ofnatural gas cannot] switch temporarily to other fuels and sothey must endure cold homes" if their gas supply is interrupted); Samuels, Reliability of Natural Gas Service for Cap519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT302 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courttive End-Users Under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order No. 636, 62 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 718, 749 (1994)("Gas service disruptions lasting just a few days can causesevere health risks to captive end-users"). They are alsobuyers without the high volume requirements needed tomake investment in the transaction costs of individual purchases on the open market economically feasible. Pierce, Intrastate Natural Gas Regulation: An Alternative Perspective, 9 Yale J. Reg. 407, 409-410 (1992) ("Purchasing gasservice [from marketers] requires considerable time and expertise. Its benefits are likely to exceed its costs only forconsumers who purchase very large quantities of gas"). Thedemands of this market historically arose free of any influence of differential taxation (since there was none during thepre-1978 period when only LDC's generally served endusers), and because the market's economic characteristicsappear to be independent of any effect attributable to theState's sales taxation as imposed today, there is good reasonto assume that any pricing changes that could result fromeliminating the sales tax differential challenged here wouldbe inadequate to create competition between LDC's andmarketers for the business of the utilities' core home market.On the other hand, one circumstance of this case is unlikewhat Arctic Maid assumed, for there is a possibility of competition between LDC's and marketers for the noncaptivemarket. Although the record before this Court reveals virtually nothing about the details of that competitive market,in the period under examination it presumably included bulkbuyers like GMC, which have no need for bundled protection,see, e. g., State Issue: Atlanta Gas Light Takes Step to Abandon Gas Sales by Unbundling Services for Non-Core Customers, Foster Natural Gas Report, June 20, 1996, p. 22 (indicating that prior to "unbundling" marketers accounted for 80%of sales to large commercial and industrial users in Georgia),and consumers of middling volumes of natural gas who found519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT303Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsome value in Ohio's state-imposed protections but notenough to offset lower price at some point, see, e. g., Pierobon, Small Customers: The Yellow Brick Road to Deregula-tion?, 134 Pub. Utils. Fortnightly, No. 6, pp. 14, 15 (1996)(marketers' efforts in California are increasingly directed toattracting consumers in the "small commercial sector," including "schools, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, laundromats,and master-metered apartments," which currently purchasebundled gas from utilities); Salpukas, New Choices for Natu-ral Gas: Retailers Find Users Puzzled as Industry Deregulates, N. Y. Times, Oct. 23, 1996, pp. D1, D4 (indicating thatsome natural gas marketers in New York City are attempting to lure "mom-and-pop businesses like restaurants anddry-cleaners" away from LDC's, with mixed success). Eliminating the sales tax differential at issue here might wellintensify competition between LDC's and marketers forcustomers in this noncaptive market.BIn sum, the LDCs' bundled product reflects the demand ofa market neither susceptible to competition by the interstatesellers nor likely to be served except by the regulated natu-ral monopolies that have historically supplied its needs. Sofar as this market is concerned, competition would not beserved by eliminating any tax differential as between sellers,and the dormant Commerce Clause has no job to do. Thereis, however, a further market where the respective sellers ofthe bundled and unbundled products apparently do competeand may compete further. Thus, the question raised by thiscase is whether the opportunities for competition betweenmarketers and LDC's in the noncaptive market requirestreating marketers and utilities as alike for dormant Commerce Clause purposes. Should we accord controlling sig-nificance to the noncaptive market in which they compete, orto the noncompetitive, captive market in which the local utili519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT304 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtties alone operate? Although there is no a priori answer, anumber of reasons support a decision to give the greaterweight to the captive market and the local utilities' singularrole in serving it, and hence to treat marketers and LDC'sas dissimilar for present purposes. First and most impor-tant, we must recognize an obligation to proceed cautiouslylest we imperil the delivery by regulated LDC's of bundledgas to the noncompetitive captive market. Second, as aCourt we lack the expertness and the institutional resourcesnecessary to predict the effects of judicial intervention invalidating Ohio's tax scheme on the utilities' capacity to servethis captive market. Finally, should intervention by the National Government be necessary, Congress has both the re-sources and the power to strike the balance between theneeds of the competitive and captive markets.1Where a choice is possible, as it is here, the importance oftraditional regulated service to the captive market makesa powerful case against any judicial treatment that mightjeopardize LDCs' continuing capacity to serve the captivemarket. Largely as a response to the monopolistic shakeoutthat brought an end to the era of unbridled competitionamong gas utilities, regulation of natural gas for the princi-pal benefit of householders and other consumers of relativelysmall quantities is the rule in every State in the Union.Congress has also long recognized the desirability of thesestate regulatory regimes. Supra, at 291-293. Indeed, halfa century ago we concluded that the NGA altogether exempts state regulation of retail sales of natural gas (includ-ing in-state sales to large industrial customers) from thestrictures of the dormant Commerce Clause, see PanhandleEastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Ind., 332U. S. 507 (1947), and to this day, notwithstanding the nationalregulatory revolution, Congress has done nothing to limit itsunbroken recognition of the state regulatory authority that519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT305Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courthas created and preserved the local monopolies.13 The clearimplication is that Congress finds the benefits of the bundledproduct for captive local buyers well within the realm ofwhat the States may reasonably promote and preserve.This Court has also recognized the importance of avoidingany jeopardy to service of the state-regulated captive market, and in circumstances remarkably similar to those of thepresent case. InPanhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Mich-igan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 341 U. S. 329 (1951), Ford MotorCompany had entered a contract with an interstate pipelinefor supply of gas at Ford's plant in Dearborn, Michigan, thusbypassing the local distribution company. The MichiganPublic Service Commission ordered the pipeline to cease anddesist from making direct sales of natural gas to the State'sindustrial customers without a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and the pipeline brought a CommerceClause challenge to the commission's action. The Court observed that"[a]ppellant asserts a right to compete for the cream ofthe volume business without regard to the local publicconvenience or necessity. Were appellant successful inthis venture, it would no doubt be reflected adverselyin [the LDC's] over-all costs of service and its rates tocustomers whose only source of supply is [the LDC].This clearly presents a situation of . . . vital interest tothe State of Michigan."Id., at 334.In view of the economic threat that competition for largeindustrial consumers posed to gas service to small captive13 In the present case, the parties have not briefed the question whetherthe present amended version of the NGA and related federal legislationcontinues the express Commerce Clause exemption for state regulationand taxation of retail natural gas sales recognized in Panhandle-Indiana,and we do not decide this issue. We note, however, that the language of$ 1(b) of the NGA, which the Panhandle-Indiana Court construed as creating the exemption, itself remains unchanged. (Compare 52 Stat. 821with 15 U. S. C. $ 717(b) (1994).)519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT306 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtusers, the Court again reaffirmed its longstanding doctrineupholding the States' power to regulate all direct in-statesales to consumers, even if such regulation resulted in anoutright prohibition of competition for even the largest endusers. Id., at 336-337; see also Panhandle-Indiana, supra(upholding state regulation of direct sales to large industrialusers as not pre-empted by the NGA or precluded by thedormant Commerce Clause).14The continuing importance of the States' interest in pro-tecting the captive market from the effects of competitionfor the largest consumers is underscored by the commonsense of our traditional recognition of the need to accommodate state health and safety regulation in applying dormantCommerce Clause principles. State regulation of naturalgas sales to consumers serves important interests in healthand safety in fairly obvious ways, in that requirements ofdependable supply and extended credit assure that individ-ual buyers of gas for domestic purposes are not frozen outof their houses in the cold months. We have consistentlyrecognized the legitimate state pursuit of such interests ascompatible with the Commerce Clause, which was " `neverintended to cut the States off from legislating on all subjectsrelating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens, thoughthe legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of thecountry.' "Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S.14 Under today's altered market structure, see supra, at 283-285, severalCourts of Appeals have held that the NGA confers jurisdiction on FERC,rather than the States, to regulate such bypass arrangements for supplying gas to large industrial consumers when the sale of gas itself occursoutside the State and an interstate pipeline merely transports the gas tothe industrial consumer for delivery in-state. See Cascade Natural GasCorp. v. FERC, 955 F. 2d 1412, 1414-1422 (CA10 1992); Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 887 F. 2d 1295, 1299-1301 (CA6 1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1079 (1990); Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. FERC, 883 F. 2d 117, 121-122 (CADC 1989), cert. denied,494 U. S. 1079 (1990). We express no view on the correctness of thesedecisions.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT307Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Court440, 443-444 (1960) (quoting Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99,103 (1876)). Just so may health and safety considerations beweighed in the process of deciding the threshold questionwhether the conditions entailing application of the dormantCommerce Clause are present.152The size of the captive market, its noncompetitive charac-ter, the values served by its traditional regulation: all counsel caution before making a choice that could strain the ca-pacity of the States to continue to demand the regulatorybenefits that have served the home market of low-volumeusers since natural gas became readily available. Here wehave to assume that any decision to treat the LDC's as simi-lar to the interstate marketers would change the LDCs' position in the noncaptive market in which (we are assuming)they compete, at least at the margins, by affecting the overall size of the LDCs' customer base. As we recognized inPanhandle, a change in the customer base could affect theLDCs' ability to continue to serve the captive market wherethere is no such competition.To be sure, what in fact would happen as a result of treating the marketers and LDC's alike we do not know. Wemight assume that eliminating the tax on marketers' saleswould leave those sellers stronger competitors in the noncap-tive market, especially at the market's boundaries, and thatany resulting contraction of the LDCs' total customer basewould increase the unit cost of the bundled product. Wemight also suppose that the State would not respond to ourdecision by subjecting the LDC's and marketers both to the15 Of course, if a State discriminates against out-of-state interests bydrawing geographical distinctions between entities that are otherwisesimilarly situated, such facial discrimination will be subject to a high levelof judicial scrutiny even if it is directed toward a legitimate health andsafety goal. See, e. g., Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626-628(1978); Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349, 353-354 (1951).519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT308 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtsame sales tax now imposed on marketers alone, since theutilities are already subject to a complicated scheme of property taxation quite different from the tax treatment of themarketers.16 It seems, in fact, far more likely that eliminating the tax challenged here would portend, among otherthings, some reduction of the total taxes levied againstLDC's, in order to strengthen their position in trying tocompete with marketers in the noncaptive market.The degree to which these very general suggestions mightprove right or wrong, however, is not really significant; thepoint is simply that all of them are nothing more than sug-gestions, pointedly couched in terms of assumption or supposition. This is necessarily so, simply because the Court isinstitutionally unsuited to gather the facts upon which economic predictions can be made, and professionally untrainedto make them. See,e. g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516U. S., at 341-342, and authorities cited therein; Hunter, Fed-eralism and State Taxation of Multistate Enterprises, 32Emory L. J. 89, 108 (1983) ("It is virtually impossible for acourt, with its limited resources, to determine with any degree of accuracy the costs to a town, county, or state of aparticular industry"); see also Smith, State DiscriminationsAgainst Interstate Commerce, 74 Calif. L. Rev. 1203, 1211(1986) (noting that "[e]ven expert economists" may have dif-ficulty determining "whether the overall economic benefits16 For example, public utilities pay personal property tax on 88% of truevalue, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 5727.111 (1996), while marketers pay personal property tax on 25% of their true value, $ 5711.22(D). Public utilities also pay a special tax assessment for the expenses of the Public UtilityCommission, $ 4905.10 (1991), and for the expenses of the Ohio ConsumerCounsel, $ 4911.18. Moreover, natural gas utilities must pay a gross receipts tax of 4.75% on gas sales, $ 5727.38 (1996), while marketers paynone. Independent marketers, for their part, are subject to a franchisetax, $ 5733.01, that does not apply to utilities, $ 5733.09(a). Thus, this salesand use tax challenge would not be the last available to marketers andtheir customers; the franchise tax, which also does not apply to utilities,is presumably next in line.519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT309Cite as: 519 U.

We are consequently ill qualified to developCommerce Clause doctrine dependent on any such predictivejudgments, and it behooves us to be as reticent about projecting the effect of applying the Commerce Clause here, aswe customarily are in declining to engage in elaborate analysis of real-world economic effects, Fulton Corp., supra, at341-342, or to consider subtle compensatory tax defenses,Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 105 (1994). The most wecan say is that modification of Ohio's tax scheme could subject LDC's to economic pressure that in turn could threatenthe preservation of an adequate customer base to supportcontinued provision of bundled services to the captive mar-ket. The conclusion counsels against taking the step oftreating the bundled gas seller like any other, with the con-sequent necessity of uniform taxation of all gas sales.3Prudence thus counsels against running the risk of weak-ening or destroying a regulatory scheme of public serviceand protection recognized by Congress despite its noncom-petitive, monopolistic character. Still less is that risk justifiable in light of Congress's own power and institutional com-petence to decide upon and effectuate any desirable changesin the scheme that has evolved. Congress has the capacityto investigate and analyze facts beyond anything the Judiciary could match, joined with the authority of the commercepower to run economic risks that the Judiciary should confront only when the constitutional or statutory mandate forjudicial choice is clear. See,e. g., Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S.367, 389 (1983) (Congress "may inform itself through factfinding procedures such as hearings that are not available tothe courts"). One need not adopt Justice Black's extremereticence in Commerce Clause jurisprudence to recognize inthis instance the soundness of his statement that a challenge519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT310 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. TRACYOpinion of the Courtlike the one before us "call[s] for Congressional investigation,consideration, and action. The Constitution gives thatbranch of government the power to regulate commerceamong the states, and until it acts I think we should enterthe field with extreme caution." Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.Minnesota, 322 U. S. 292, 302 (1944) (concurring opinion).This conclusion applies a fortiori here, because for a halfcentury Congress has been aware of our conclusion in Pan-handle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n ofInd., 332 U. S. 507 (1947), that the NGA exempts state regu-lation of in-state retail natural gas sales from the dormantCommerce Clause and in the years following that decisionhas only reaffirmed the power of the States in this regard.* * *Accordingly, we conclude that Ohio's regulatory responseto the needs of the local natural gas market has resulted ina noncompetitive bundled gas product that distinguishes itsregulated sellers from independent marketers to the pointthat the enterprises should not be considered "similarly situ-ated" for purposes of a claim of facial discrimination underthe Commerce Clause. GMC's argument that the State dis-criminates between regulated local gas utilities and unregulated marketers must therefore fail.CGMC also suggests that Ohio's tax regime "facially dis-criminates" because the State's sales and use tax exemptionwould not apply to sales by out-of-state LDC's. See, e. g.,Reply Brief for Petitioner 2, n. 1. As respondent points out,however, the Ohio courts might well extend the challengedexemption to out-of-state utilities if confronted with thequestion. Indeed, in Carnegie Natural Gas Co. v. Tracy,No. 94-K-526 (Ohio Bd. Tax App., Nov. 17, 1995), reportedin CCH Ohio Tax Rep. || 402-254, the Ohio Board of TaxAppeals accepted the argument of a Pennsylvania public util519us2$19M 06-03-99 20:31:11 PAGES OPFXPGT311Cite as: 519 U. S. 278 (1997)Opinion of the Courtity that insofar as the out-of-state utility sold natural gas toOhio consumers it qualified as a utility under Ohio Rev. CodeAnn. $ 5727.01 and was therefore exempt from the State'scorporate franchise tax. Out-of-state public utilities maytherefore also qualify for Ohio's sales and use tax exemption.Because "we have never deemed a hypothetical possibilityof favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgressesconstitutional commands," Associated Industries of Mo. v.Lohman, 511 U. S., at 654, this argument, too, must berejected. VFinally, GMC claims that Ohio's tax regime violates theEqual Protection Clause by treating LDCs' natural gas salesdifferently from those of producers and marketers. Onceagain, the hurdle facing GMC is a high one, since state taxclassifications require only a rational basis to satisfy theEqual Protection Clause. See,e. g., Amerada Hess Corp. v.Director, Div. of Taxation, N. J. Dept. of Treasury, 490 U. S.,at 80. Indeed, "in taxation, even more than in other fields,legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification."Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88 (1940).It is true, of course, that in some peculiar circumstancesstate tax classifications facially discriminating against inter-state commerce may violate the Equal Protection Clauseeven when they pass muster under the Commerce Clause.SeeMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 874-883 (1985).17 But as we explain in Part IV, supra, Ohio's17 Ward involved an Alabama statute that facially discriminated againstinterstate commerce by imposing a lower gross premiums tax on in-statethan out-of-state insurance companies. The case did not present a Commerce Clause violation only because Congress, in enacting the McCarranFerguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1011-1015, intended to authorize States toimpose taxes that burden interstate commerce in the insurance field.Ward, 470 U. S., at 880. We nonetheless invalidated Alabama's classification because "neither of the two purposes furthered by the [statute] . . . islegitimate under the Equal Protection Clause . . . ."

And in any event, there is unquestionably a rationalbasis for Ohio's distinction between these two kinds ofentities. * * *We conclude that Ohio's differential tax treatment ofpublic utilities and independent marketers violates neitherthe Commerce Clause nor the Equal Protection Clause andthat petitioner's claims are without merit otherwise. Thejudgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is affirmed.
