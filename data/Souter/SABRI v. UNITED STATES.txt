The question is whether 18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(2), proscribingbribery of state, local, and tribal officials of entities that receive at least $10,000 in federal funds, is a valid exercise ofcongressional authority under Article I of the Constitution.We hold that it is. IPetitioner Basim Omar Sabri is a real estate developerwho proposed to build a hotel and retail structure in thecity of Minneapolis. Sabri lacked confidence, however, in hisability to adapt to the lawful administration of licensing andzoning laws, and offered three separate bribes to a city coun-cilman, Brian Herron, according to the grand jury indictmentthat gave rise to this case. At the time the bribes wereallegedly offered (between July 2 and July 17, 2001), Herronserved as a member of the Board of Commissioners of theMinneapolis Community Development Agency (MCDA), apublic body created by the city council to fund housing and*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Cato Instituteby Gary Lawson, Robert A.

Count 3 alleged that Sabri offered Herron a commission of 10% on some $800,000 in community economicdevelopment grants that Sabri sought from the city, theMCDA, and other sources. Id., at A-66.The charges were brought under 18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(2),which imposes federal criminal penalties on anyone who"corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything ofvalue to any person, with intent to influence or rewardan agent of an organization or of a State, local or Indiantribal government, or any agency thereof, in connectionwith any business, transaction, or series of transactionsof such organization, government, or agency involvinganything of value of $5,000 or more."For criminal liability to lie, the statute requires that"the organization, government, or agency receiv[e], inany one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 undera Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy,loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." $ 666(b).In 2001, the City Council of Minneapolis administered about$29 million in federal funds paid to the city, and in the sameperiod, the MCDA received some $23 million of federalmoney. App. to Pet. for Cert.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfunds and the alleged bribe, as an element of liability. App.A-4. The Government responded that "even if an additional nexus between the bribery conduct and the federalfunds is required, the evidence in this case will easily meetsuch a standard" because Sabri's alleged actions related tofederal dollars. Id., at A-6. Although Sabri did not contradict this factual claim, the District Court agreed with himthat the law was facially invalid. A divided panel of theEighth Circuit reversed, holding that there was nothing fatalin the absence of an express requirement to prove some connection between a given bribe and federally pedigreed dol-lars, and that the statute was constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause in serving the objects of thecongressional spending power. 326 F. 3d 937 (2003). JudgeBye dissented out of concern about the implications of thelaw for dual sovereignty.Id., at 953-957.We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 944 (2003), to resolve asplit among the Courts of Appeals over the need to requireconnection between forbidden conduct and federal funds;compare, e. g., United States v. Grossi, 143 F. 3d 348 (CA71998) (no nexus requirement), andUnited States v. Lips-comb, 299 F. 3d 303 (CA5 2002) (same), with United Statesv. Zwick, 199 F. 3d 672 (CA3 1999) (nexus requirement), andUnited States v. Santopietro, 166 F. 3d 88 (CA2 1999) (same).We now affirm. IISabri raises what he calls a facial challenge to $ 666(a)(2):the law can never be applied constitutionally because it failsto require proof of any connection between a bribe or kick-back and some federal money. It is fatal, as he sees it, thatthe statute does not make the link an element of the crime,to be charged in the indictment and demonstrated beyond areasonable doubt. Thus, Sabri claims his attack meets thedemanding standard set out in United States v. Salerno, 481U. S. 739, 745 (1987), since he says no prosecution can satisfythe Constitution under this statute, owing to its failure to541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN605Cite as: 541 U. S. 600 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrequire proof that its particular application falls within Con-gress's jurisdiction to legislate. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12("This statute cannot be properly applied in any case").We can readily dispose of this position that, to qualify asa valid exercise of Article I power, the statute must requireproof of connection with federal money as an element of theoffense. We simply do not presume the unconstitutionalityof federal criminal statutes lacking explicit provision of ajurisdictional hook, and there is no occasion even to considerthe need for such a requirement where there is no reason tosuspect that enforcement of a criminal statute would extendbeyond a legitimate interest cognizable under Article I, $ 8.Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare,Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and it has corresponding authority under theNecessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18, to see to itthat taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are infact spent for the general welfare, and not frittered away ingraft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned offor corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding valuefor dollars. See generally McCulloch v. Maryland, 4Wheat. 316 (1819) (establishing review for means-ends rationality under the Necessary and Proper Clause). See alsoHodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981) (same); Hanna v. Plumer, 380U. S. 460, 472 (1965) (same). Congress does not have to sitby and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local andstate improbity. See, e. g., McCulloch, supra, at 417 (powerto " `establish post-offices and post-roads' " entails authorityto "punish those who steal letters"). Section 666(a)(2) addresses the problem at the sources of bribes, by rationalmeans, to safeguard the integrity of the state, local, andtribal recipients of federal dollars.It is true, just as Sabri says, that not every bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments covered by$ 666(b) will be traceably skimmed from specific federal pay541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN606 SABRI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtments, or show up in the guise of a quid pro quo for somedereliction in spending a federal grant. Cf.Salinas v.United States, 522 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1997) (The "expansive,unqualified" language of the statute "does not support theinterpretation that federal funds must be affected to violate$ 666(a)(1)(B)"). But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the reason thatcorruption does not have to be that limited to affect the fed-eral interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contrac-tors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value. Liquidity is nota financial term for nothing; money can be drained off herebecause a federal grant is pouring in there. And officialsare not any the less threatening to the objects behind federalspending just because they may accept general retainers.See Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 (1927) (majority opinion by Holmes, J.) (upholding federal law criminalizing fraud on a state bank member of federal system, evenwhere federal funds not directly implicated). It is certainlyenough that the statutes condition the offense on a thresholdamount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, suchas that provided here.For those of us who accept help from legislative history,it is worth noting that the legislative record confirms that$ 666(a)(2) is an instance of necessary and proper legislation.The design was generally to "protect the integrity of thevast sums of money distributed through Federal programsfrom theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery," seeS. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 370 (1983), in contrast to prior federallaw affording only two limited opportunities to prosecutesuch threats to the federal interest: 18 U. S. C. $ 641, the federal theft statute, and $ 201, the federal bribery law. Thoselaws had proven inadequate to the task. The former wentonly to outright theft of unadulterated federal funds, andprior to this Court's opinion in Dixson v. United States, 465U. S. 482 (1984), which came after passage of $ 666, the brib541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN607Cite as: 541 U. S. 600 (2004)Opinion of the Courtery statute had been interpreted by lower courts to barprosecution of bribes directed at state and local officials.See, e. g., United States v. Del Toro, 513 F. 2d 656, 661-663(CA2 1975) (overturning federal bribery conviction); see generally Salinas, 522 U. S., at 58-59 (recounting the limitationsof the pre-existing statutory framework). Thus we said that$ 666 "was designed to extend federal bribery prohibitions tobribes offered to state and local officials employed by agen-cies receiving federal funds,"id., at 58, thereby filling theregulatory gaps. Congress's decision to enact $ 666 onlyafter other legislation had failed to protect federal interestsis further indication that it was acting within the ambit ofthe Necessary and Proper Clause.Petitioner presses two more particular arguments againstthe constitutionality of $ 666(a)(2), neither of which helpshim. First, he says that $ 666 is all of a piece with the legislation that a majority of this Court held to exceed Congress'sauthority under the Commerce Clause in United States v.Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison,529 U. S. 598 (2000). But these precedents do not controlhere. In Lopez and Morrison, the Court struck down federal statutes regulating gun possession near schools andgender-motivated violence, respectively, because it found theeffects of those activities on interstate commerce insufficiently robust. The Court emphasized the noneconomic nature of the regulated conduct, commenting on the law atissue in Lopez, for example, "that by its terms [it] has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms." 514 U. S.,at 561. The Court rejected the Government's contentionsthat the gun law was valid Commerce Clause legislation because guns near schools ultimately bore on social prosperity and productivity, reasoning that on that logic, Commerce Clause authority would effectively know no limit.Cf. Morrison, supra, at 615-616 (rejecting comparable congressional justification for Violence Against Women Act of541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN608 SABRI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court1994). In order to uphold the legislation, the Court con-cluded, it would be necessary "to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressionalauthority under the Commerce Clause to a general policepower of the sort retained by the States." Lopez, 514U. S., at 567.No piling is needed here to show that Congress was withinits prerogative to protect spending objects from the menaceof local administrators on the take. The power to keep awatchful eye on expenditures and on the reliability of thosewho use public money is bound up with congressional author-ity to spend in the first place, and Sabri would be hardpressed to claim, in the words of the Lopez Court, that$ 666(a)(2) "has nothing to do with" the congressional spending power. Id., at 561.Sabri next argues that $ 666(a)(2) amounts to an undulycoercive, and impermissibly sweeping, condition on the grantof federal funds as judged under the criterion applied inSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987). This is not so.Section 666(a)(2) is authority to bring federal power to beardirectly on individuals who convert public spending into un-earned private gain, not a means for bringing federal economic might to bear on a State's own choices of publicpolicy.*IIIWe add an afterword on Sabri's technique for challenginghis indictment by facial attack on the underlying statute, andbegin by recalling that facial challenges are best when infre-quent. See,e. g., United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22(1960) (laws should not be invalidated by "reference to hypothetical cases"); Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Jack-son Vinegar Co., 226 U. S. 217, 219-220 (1912) (same). Al*In enacting $ 666, Congress addressed a legitimate federal concern bylicensing federal prosecution in an area historically of state concern. Inupholding the constitutionality of the law, we mean to express no view asto its soundness as a policy matter.541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN609Cite as: 541 U. S. 600 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthough passing on the validity of a law wholesale may beefficient in the abstract, any gain is often offset by losing thelessons taught by the particular, to which common lawmethod normally looks. Facial adjudication carries toomuch promise of "premature interpretatio[n] of statutes" onthe basis of factually barebones records.Raines, supra,at 22.As exemplified here, facial challenge can carry a furtherrisk that a skeptical approach by district courts may avoid.Sabri was able to call his challenge a facial one in the strict-est sense of saying that no application of the statute couldbe constitutional, only by claiming that proof of the congressional jurisdictional basis must be an element of the statute,a position that is of course not generally true at all. If thatparticular claim had been peeled away, it would have beenobvious that the acts charged against Sabri himself werewell within the limits of legitimate congressional concern.It would have been correspondingly clear that if Sabri wasmaking any substantive constitutional claim, it had to beseen as an overbreadth challenge; the most he could say wasthat the statute could not be enforced against him, becauseit could not be enforced against someone else whose behaviorwould be outside the scope of Congress's Article I authorityto legislate.Facial challenges of this sort are especially to be discouraged. Not only do they invite judgments on fact-poor records, but they entail a further departure from the norms ofadjudication in federal courts: overbreadth challenges callfor relaxing familiar requirements of standing, to allow a determination that the law would be unconstitutionally appliedto different parties and different circumstances from thoseat hand. See, e. g., Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 55-56,n. 22 (1999) (plurality opinion). Accordingly, we have recognized the validity of facial attacks alleging overbreadth(though not necessarily using that term) in relatively fewsettings, and, generally, on the strength of specific reasons541US2 Unit: $U50 [01-30-05 10:39:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN610 SABRI v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., concurring in judgmentweighty enough to overcome our well-founded reticence.See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973) (freespeech); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 (1964)(right to travel); Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, 938-946(2000) (abortion); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 532-535 (1997) (legislation under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). See generally Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Chal-lenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321,1351 (2000) (emphasizing role of various doctrinal tests indetermining viability of facial attack); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 24 (observing that overbreadthis a function of substantive First Amendment law). Outsidethese limited settings, and absent a good reason, we do notextend an invitation to bring overbreadth claims.IVWe remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is
