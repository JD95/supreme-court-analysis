The question here is when the 1-year statute of limitationsin 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, || 6(4), begins to run in a case of a prison-er's collateral attack on his federal sentence on the groundthat a state conviction used to enhance that sentence hassince been vacated. We hold that the period begins whena petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the priorconviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligencein state court, after entry of judgment in the federal casewith the enhanced sentence.IIn 1994, petitioner Robert Johnson, Jr., was indicted fordistributing cocaine base and related conspiracy. Followinghis guilty plea to a single count of distribution in violationof 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1) and 18 U. S. C. $ 2, the presentenceinvestigation report recommended that Johnson receive anenhanced sentence as a career offender under $ 4B1.1 of theFederal Sentencing Guidelines, owing to his two 1989 convic-tions by the State of Georgia for distributing cocaine. Without elaboration, Johnson filed an objection to the recommendation, which he withdrew at the sentencing hearing. TheDistrict Court imposed the enhancement and entered judgment on November 29, 1994.On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he shouldnot have been sentenced as a career offender because one of*Donald F. Samuel and Michael Kennedy McIntyre filed a brief for theNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as amici curiaeurging reversal.544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN299Cite as: 544 U.

The Superior Court foundthat the records did "not show an affirmative waiver of[Johnson's] right to an attorney" in any of the cases, App. 10,and entered an order of vacatur, that all seven convictionsbe reversed,ibid.Just over three months later, Johnson was back in the Federal District Court pro se with a motion under $ 2255 to va-cate the enhanced federal sentence following the vacatur ofone of its predicate state convictions. He claimed his motionwas timely because the order vacating the state judgmentwas "new evidence" not previously discoverable, and so thetrigger of a renewed limitation period.

The majority alsoagreed that Johnson had no equitable claim to toll the running of the 1-year period because he had waited too longbefore going back to the state court.Id., at 1226-1228.Judge Roney dissented, arguing that the state court's orderwas a "fact" supporting Johnson's $ 2255 motion, a fact notdiscoverable prior to the order's issuance. Id., at 1228-1229.Over one dissent, rehearing en banc was denied. 353 F. 3d1328 (2003).We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 965 (2004), to resolve adisagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whethervacatur of a prior state conviction used to enhance a federalsentence can start the 1-year limitation period under thefourth alternative of the $ 2255 rule. Compare 340 F. 3d1219 (case below) (vacatur not a trigger);Brackett v. UnitedStates, 270 F. 3d 60 (CA1 2001) (same), with United States v.Gadsen, 332 F. 3d 224 (CA4 2003) (vacatur a fact not pre-viously discoverable giving rise to a new 1-year period).We agree with Johnson that the state-court vacatur is amatter of fact for purposes of the limitation rule in the fourthparagraph. But we also hold that the statute allows the factof the state-court order to set the 1-year period running onlyif the petitioner has shown due diligence in seeking theorder. Applying that qualification, we affirm.IIThe Government shares Johnson's preliminary assumptionthat if he filed his $ 2255 motion in time, he is entitled to544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN303Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)Opinion of the Courtfederal resentencing now that the State has vacated one ofthe judgments supporting his enhanced sentence. Neitherthe enhancement provision of the Sentencing Guidelines ap-plied here, nor the mandatory enhancement under theArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e), hasbeen read to mean that the validity of a prior conviction supporting an enhanced federal sentence is beyond challenge.Cf. Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980) (validity ofprior conviction irrelevant under federal statute prohibitingpossession of a firearm by a felon). Our cases applyingthese provisions assume the contrary, that a defendant givena sentence enhanced for a prior conviction is entitled to areduction if the earlier conviction is vacated. Custis v.United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994); Daniels v. United States,532 U. S. 374 (2001).Such was the premise in Custis v. United States, supra,even though we held that the ACCA generally created noopportunity to attack a prior state conviction collaterally ata federal sentencing proceeding, 511 U. S., at 490, and thatthe Constitution demands no more, id., at 496-497. Wethought that Congress had not meant to make it so easy tochallenge final judgments that every occasion to enhance asentence for recidivism would turn a federal sentencingcourt into a forum for difficult and time-consuming reexaminations of stale state proceedings. Ibid. We recognizedonly one exception to this rule that collateral attacks wereoff-limits, and that was for challenges to state convictionsallegedly obtained in violation of the right to appointed counsel, an exception we thought necessary to avoid underminingGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). Custis v.United States, 511 U. S., at 494-496. As to challenges falling outside of that exception, we pointed out that a defendantwho successfully attacked his state conviction in state courtor on federal habeas review could then "apply for reopeningof any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences."Id., at 497.544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN304 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDaniels v. United States, supra, extended Custis to hold,subject to the same exception forGideon claims, that afederal prisoner may not attack a predicate state convictionthrough a $ 2255 motion challenging an enhanced federalsentence, 532 U. S., at 376, and again we stressed considera-tions of administration and finality,id., at 378-380. Again,too, we acknowledged that a prisoner could proceed under$ 2255 after successful review of the prior state convictionon federal habeas under $ 2254 or favorable resort to anypostconviction process available under state law, id., at 381.We simply added that if the prior conviction was no longeropen to direct or collateral attack in its own right, the federalprisoner could do nothing more about his sentence enhancement. Id., at 382.4This case presents the distinct issue of how soon a prisoner, successful in his state proceeding, must challenge thefederal sentence under $ 2255. The resolution turns on understanding what "facts" affecting an enhanced sentencecould most sensibly fall within that term as used in thefourth paragraph of the $ 2255 limitation provision, underwhich the one year runs from "the date on which the factssupporting the claim or claims presented could have beendiscovered through the exercise of due diligence." Johnsonsays that the order vacating his prior conviction is the factual matter supporting his $ 2255 claim, discovery of whichtriggers the refreshed 1-year period. The Court of Appealsmajority said no because it understood a legally operativeorder of vacatur to be a mandate of law or a consequence ofapplying law, and therefore distinct from a matter of " `fact' "4 The Daniels Court allowed that "there may be rare cases in which nochannel of review was actually available to a defendant with respect to aprior conviction, due to no fault of his own," in which case a prisoner mightbe able to use a motion under $ 2255 to challenge the prior conviction aswell as the federal sentence based on it. 532 U. S., at 383-384. As inDaniels, the circumstances of this case do not call for further explorationof that possibility.544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN305Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)Opinion of the Courtas Congress used the term in $ 2255. 340 F. 3d, at 1223.The United States does not endorse that law-fact distinction,but argues that the facts supporting Johnson's $ 2255 claim,for purposes of the fourth paragraph, are the facts on whichhe based his challenge to the validity of his state convictions.We think none of these positions is sound, at least in itsentirety. As for the Government's proposed reading, certainly it is true that the circumstances rendering the under-lying predicate conviction invalid are ultimate subjects offact supporting the $ 2255 claim, in the sense that proof ofthose facts (or the government's failure to negate them) isnecessary to vacate the prior state conviction and eliminatethe ground for the federal enhancement. But this is notenough to fit the Government's position comfortably intoparagraph four. The text of $ 2255, || 6(4), clearly links therunning of the limitation period to the discovery of the "factssupporting the claim or claims presented," but on the Government's view, the statute of limitations may begin to run(and may even expire) before the $ 2255 claim and its necessary predicate even exist. Prior to the federal conviction, apetitioner has no $ 2255 claim because he has no enhancedfederal sentence to challenge; and prior to the state vacatur,which Daniels makes a necessary condition for relief in mostcases, a petitioner cannot obtain relief under $ 2255. Cf. BayArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 195 (1997) (statutes oflimitations ordinarily do not begin to run until a plaintiff 'scomplete cause of action has accrued). Hence, it is highlydoubtful that in $ 2255 challenges to enhanced sentencesCongress would have meant to start the period runningunder paragraph four on the discoverability date of facts thatmay have no significance under federal law for years to comeand that cannot by themselves be the basis of a $ 2255 claim,Daniels v. United States, supra, at 376.There are further reasons against applying the fourthparagraph as the Government would. Congress does not544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN306 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtappear to have adopted a policy of enhancing federal sen-tences regardless of the validity of state convictions reliedon for the enhancement. Custis and Daniels were decidedon just the contrary, and unchallenged, understanding; itwould certainly push the limits of coherence for the Courtnow to apply the fourth paragraph in a way that would practically close the door to relief that each of those cases spe-cifically left open.5 Nor is there any reason to think Congress meant the limitation period to run earlier for the sakeof preserving finality of state convictions; States are capableof providing their own limitations periods (and most of themwould have barred Johnson's challenge).6Johnson's argument improves on the Government's pro-posal by pegging the limitation period to notice of the stateorder eliminating the predicate required for enhancement,which is almost always necessary and always sufficient forrelief. We do not find his proposal vulnerable to the pointmade by the majority of the Court of Appeals, that an ordervacating a conviction is legally expressive or operative lan-guage that may not be treated as a matter of fact within themeaning of the statute. We commonly speak of the "fact of5 It is also doubtful that Congress meant the federal limitation period tobegin running, let alone expire, at a time when a typical state convictwill have no inducement under federal law to act. On the Government'sreading, in fact, a defendant could be obligated to act at a time when hehad no real incentive for questioning the state conviction. Many of thoseconvictions that in time become predicates for enhancing later sentencesare, like the one here, the consequences of guilty pleas entered on termsdefendants are willing to accept. Thus, a federal limitation rule obligating a defendant to turn around and attack a state guilty plea he has justentered would in practice place most predicate convictions beyond challenge as a matter of federal law.6 At the time Johnson filed his state habeas petition, Georgia law wouldhave permitted him to wait indefinitely before seeking reversal of his 1989convictions. The Georgia Legislature amended the state habeas statutein 2004 to create a 4-year statute of limitations for petitions for writs ofhabeas corpus. Ga. Code Ann. $ 9-14-42 (Lexis Supp. 2004).544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN307Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)Opinion of the Courta prior conviction," e. g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S.466, 490 (2000), and an order vacating a predicate convictionis spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order enteringit. In either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proofor disproof like any other factual issue.But Johnson's take on the statute carries anomalies of itsown, one minor, one more serious. It is strange to say thatan order vacating a conviction has been "discovered," theterm used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speakabout the date on which it could have been discovered withdue diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of aproceeding in which the $ 2255 petitioner was the movingparty. By bringing that proceeding, the petitioner causesthe factual event to occur, after all, and unless his mail goesastray his prompt discovery of the crucial fact is virtuallyguaranteed through official notice.A more serious problem is Johnson's position that his$ 2255 petition is timely under paragraph four as long as hebrings it within a year of learning he succeeded in attackingthe prior conviction, no matter how long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding. If Johnsonwere right about this, a petitioner might wait a long timebefore raising any question about a predicate conviction, asthis very case demonstrates. Of course it may well be thatJohnson took his time because his basic sentence had yearsto run before the period of enhancement began. But lettinga petitioner wait for as long as the enhancement makes nodifference to his actual imprisonment, while the predicateconviction grows increasingly stale and the federal outcomeis subject to question, is certainly at odds with the provisionin paragraph four that the one year starts running when theoperative fact "could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence." And by maximizing the time thatjudgments are open to question, a rule allowing that kindof delay would thwart one of AEDPA's principal purposes,544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN308 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S., at 179; Woodford v. Garceau,538 U. S. 202, 206 (2003), a purpose that was also central toour decisions in Custis and Daniels, see supra, at 303-304.We think neither anomaly is serious enough, however, tojustify rejecting Johnson's basic argument that notice of theorder vacating the predicate conviction is the event thatstarts the one year running. Our job here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when the truth is that withDaniels not yet on the books AEDPA's drafters probablynever thought about the situation we face here. Of courseit is peculiar to speak of "discovering" the fact of the veryeventuality the petitioner himself has brought about, butwhen that fact is necessary to the $ 2255 claim, and treatingnotice of it as the trigger produces a more reasonable schemethan the alternatives, the scheme should be reconciled withthe statutory language if it can be. And here the fit is painless, if short on style.While it sounds odd to speak of discovering a fact one hasgenerated, a petitioner does not generate the fact of vacaturall by himself. He does, after all, have to learn of the court'sresponse in the state proceeding, and receiving notice of success can surely qualify as a kind of discovery falling withinthe statutory language.That leaves us with the question of how to implement thestatutory mandate that a petitioner act with due diligence indiscovering the crucial fact of the vacatur order that he himself seeks. The answer is that diligence can be shown byprompt action on the part of the petitioner as soon as he isin a position to realize that he has an interest in challengingthe prior conviction with its potential to enhance the latersentence. The important thing is to identify a particulartime when the course of the later federal prosecution clearlyshows that diligence is in order. That might be the date thefederal indictment is disclosed, the date of judgment, or thedate of finality after direct appeal. Picking the first datewould require the quickest response and serve finality best,544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN309Cite as: 544 U. S. 295 (2005)Opinion of the Courtbut it would produce some collateral litigation that federalacquittals would prove to have been needless, and it sharesthe same disconnection from the existence of a $ 2255 claimas the Government's view of the relevant "facts," see supra,at 305-306. If we picked the third date, collateral litigationwould be minimized, but finality would come late. Thisshapes up as a case for choosing the bowl of porridge be-tween the one too hot and the one too cold, and settling onthe date of judgment as the moment to activate due diligenceseems best to reflect the statutory text and its underlyingconcerns. After the entry of judgment, the subject of the$ 2255 claim has come into being, the significance of inactionis clear, and very little litigation would be wasted, since mostchallenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.The dissent, like Johnson, would dispense with any duediligence requirement in seeking the state vacatur orderitself, on the ground that the States can impose their ownlimitations periods on state collateral attacks, as most Statesdo,post, at 316 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). But the UnitedStates has an interest in the finality of sentences imposed byits own courts; $ 2255 is, after all, concerned directly withfederal cases. As to those federal cases, due diligence is nota "requirement of [our] own design," post, at 312, but an ex-plicit demand in the text of $ 2255, || 6(4), one that reflectsAEDPA's core purposes, supra, at 307-308. The require-ment of due diligence must therefore demand somethingmore than the dissent's willingness to accept no diligence atall, if the predicate conviction occurred in a State that itself imposes no limit of time for collaterally attacking itsconvictions.77 Certainly, as the dissent notes, post, at 318-319, "due diligence" is aninexact measure of how much delay is too much. But the imprecision hereis no greater than elsewhere in the law when diligence must be shown, andthe statute's use of an imprecise standard is no justification for deprivingthe statutory language of any meaning independent of corresponding statelaw, as the dissent would have us do. Post, at 319.544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN310 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe dissent suggests that due diligence is satisfied byprompt discovery of the existence of the order vacating thestate conviction. Post, at 314. Where one "discovers" afact that one has helped to generate, however, supra, at 308-309, whether it be the result of a court proceeding or of someother process begun at the petitioner's behest, it does notstrain logic to treat required diligence in the "discovery" ofthat fact as entailing diligence in the steps necessary for theexistence of that fact. To see why this is so, one need onlyconsider a more commonplace use of the paragraph four limitation rule. When a petitioner bases his $ 2255 claim on theresult of a DNA test, it is the result of the test that isthe "fac[t] supporting the claim" in the $ 2255 motion, and the1-year limitation period therefore begins to run from thedate the test result is "discovered." Yet unless it is to beread out of the statute, the due diligence requirement wouldsay that the test result only triggers a new 1-year periodif the petitioner began the testing process with reasonablepromptness once the DNA sample and testing technologywere available. Under the dissent's view, however, the petitioner could wait untold years (perhaps until the death of akey prosecution witness) before calling for the DNA test, yetonce he "discovered" the result of that test, he would get thebenefit of a rejuvenated 1-year period regardless of hislengthy delay. Such a result simply cannot be squared withthe statute's plain text and purpose.We accordingly apply the fourth paragraph in the situationbefore us by holding that from November 29, 1994, the datethe District Court entered judgment in his federal case,Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the statecourt order vacating his predicate conviction. Had he doneso, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the datehe received notice of that vacatur.88 Once a petitioner diligently has initiated state-court proceedings, anydelay in those proceedings that is not attributable to the petitioner willnot impair the availability of the paragraph four limitation rule, once those544US1 Unit: $U38 [11-07-07 19:20:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN311Cite as: 544 U.

Indeed, even if we moved theburden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federalconviction or to AEDPA's effective date two days later, Johnson would still have delayed unreasonably, having waitedover 21 months. Johnson has offered no explanation for thisdelay, beyond observing that he was acting pro se and lackedthe sophistication to understand the procedures. But wehave never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention whena statute's clear policy calls for promptness, and on this record we think Johnson fell far short of reasonable diligence inchallenging the state conviction. Since there is every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced astate vacatur order well over a year before he filed his $ 2255petition, the fourth paragraph of $ 2255 is unavailable, andJohnson does not suggest that his motion was timely underany other provision.We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.
