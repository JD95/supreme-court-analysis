The Government avoids reversal of a criminal convictionby showing that trial error, albeit raised by a timely objection, affected no substantial right of the defendant and wasthus harmless. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a). A defendantwho failed to object to trial error may nonetheless obtainreversal of a conviction by carrying the converse burden,showing among other things that plain error did affect hissubstantial rights. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).Rule 11(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure isa separate harmless-error rule applying only to errors committed under Rule 11, the rule meant to ensure that a guiltyplea is knowing and voluntary, by laying out the steps a trialjudge must take before accepting such a plea. Like Rule52(a), it provides that a failure to comply with Rule 11 that"does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."Rule 11(h) does not include a plain-error provision comparable to Rule 52(b).The first question here is whether a defendant who letsRule 11 error pass without objection in the trial court mustcarry the burdens of Rule 52(b) or whether even the silentdefendant can put the Government to the burden of prov-ing the Rule 11 error harmless.1 The second question is*Saul M. Pilchen and David M. Porter filed a brief for the NationalAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as amici curiae urgingaffirmance.1 This question is rightly before us even though the Government did noturge the Court of Appeals to adopt a plain-error standard. As the Courtof Appeals recognized, 224 F. 3d 1152, 1155 (CA9 2000), this position wassquarely barred by Circuit precedent holding that any Rule 11 error issubject to harmless-error review. United States v. Odedo, 154 F. 3d 937,940 (CA9 1998). Although the Government did not challenge Odedo ascontrolling precedent, we have previously held that such a claim is preserved if made by the current litigant in "the recent proceeding upon535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 535 U.

S. C.$$ 2113(a) and (d), and using and carrying a firearm duringand in relation to a crime of violence, under 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c). Vonn appeared that day before a Magistrate Judge,who advised him of his constitutional rights, including "theright to retain and to be represented by an attorney of [his]own choosing at each and every sta[g]e of the proceedings."App. 15. Vonn said that he had heard and understood hisrights, and the judge appointed counsel to represent him.On March 17, 1997, three days after being indicted, Vonn,along with his appointed counsel, appeared in court for hisarraignment. Again, the Magistrate Judge told Vonn abouthis rights, including the right to counsel at all stages of theproceedings. Vonn's counsel gave the court a form entitled"Statement of Defendant's Constitutional Rights," on whichwhich the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, and [thelitigant] did not concede in the current case the correctness of that precedent." United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 44-45 (1992). Althoughthere evidently was some confusion as to the Government's precise position in Odedo, presumably because the Government argued there, as here,that failure to raise a Rule 11 objection constitutes "waiver," the Court ofAppeals understood the Government to contend that "forfeited error" issubject to plain-error review. That, coupled with the fact that the Government did not concede below that Odedo was correctly decided, isenough for us to take up this question.535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of the CourtVonn said he understood his rights, including the right tocounsel. His counsel signed a separate statement that hewas satisfied that Vonn had read and understood the state-ment of his rights. The Clerk of Court then asked Vonnwhether he had heard and understood the court's explanationof his rights, and whether he had read and signed the statement, and Vonn said yes to each question.On May 12, 1997, Vonn came before the court and indicatedthat he would plead guilty to armed bank robbery but wouldgo to trial on the firearm charge. The court then addressedhim and, up to a point, followed Rule 11(c)(3) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure. The judge advised Vonn ofthe constitutional rights he would relinquish by pleadingguilty, but skipped the required advice that if Vonn weretried he would have "the right to the assistance of counsel."Several months later, the stakes went up when the grandjury returned a superseding indictment, charging Vonnunder an additional count of conspiracy to commit bank robbery. Although he first pleaded not guilty to this charge aswell as the firearm count, at a hearing on September 3, 1997,Vonn said he intended to change both pleas to guilty. Again,the court advised Vonn of rights waived by guilty pleas, butfailed to mention the right to counsel if he went to trial.This time, the prosecutor tried to draw the court's attentionto its error, saying that she did not "remember hearing theCourt inform the defendant of his right to assistance of counsel." Id., at 61. The court, however, may have mistakenthe remark as going to Rule 11(c)(2), and answered simplythat Vonn was represented by counsel.2Eight months later, Vonn moved to withdraw his guiltyplea on the firearm charge. He did not, however, cite Rule11 error but instead based his request on his own mistake2 Rule 11(c)(2) provides that "if the defendant is not represented by anattorney," the court must inform the defendant that he "has the right tobe represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceeding and, ifnecessary, one will be appointed to represent [him]."535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 535 U.

The court denied thismotion, and on June 22, 1998, sentenced Vonn to 97 monthsin prison.On appeal, Vonn sought to set aside not only the firearmconviction but the other two as well, for the first time mak-ing an issue of the District Judge's failure to advise him ofhis right to counsel at trial, as required by the Rule. TheCourt of Appeals agreed there had been error, and held thatVonn's failure to object before the District Court to its Rule11 omission was of no import, since Rule 11(h) "supersedesthe normal waiver rule," and subjects all Rule 11 violationsto harmless-error review, 224 F. 3d 1152, 1155 (CA9 2000)(citing United States v. Odedo, 154 F. 3d 937 (CA9 1998)).The consequence was to put the Government to the burdenof showing no effect on substantial rights.3 The court de-clined to "go beyond the plea proceeding in consideringwhether the defendant was aware of his rights," and did notaccept the record of Vonn's plea colloquies as evidence thatVonn was aware of his continuing right to counsel at trial.224 F. 3d, at 1155. It held the Government had failed toshoulder its burden to show the error harmless and vacatedVonn's convictions.We granted certiorari, 531 U.

Hence, the Court of Appeals in thiscase went no further than to reject the Government's waiver argument.4 Compare, e. g., 224 F. 3d, at 1155 (case below); United States v. Lyons,53 F. 3d 1321, 1322, n. 1 (CADC 1995), with United States v. GandiaMaysonet, 227 F. 3d 1, 5-6 (CA1 2000); United States v. Bashara, 27 F. 3d1174, 1178 (CA6 1994); United States v.

VONNOpinion of the Courtofficial record to see whether a defendant's substantial rightswere affected by a deviation from Rule 11.5 We think theCourt of Appeals was mistaken on each issue, and vacateand remand.IIRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure re-quires a judge to address a defendant about to enter a pleaof guilty, to ensure that he understands the law of his crimein relation to the facts of his case, as well as his rights as acriminal defendant. The Rule has evolved over the courseof 30 years from general scheme to detailed plan, which nowincludes a provision for dealing with a slip-up by the judgein applying the Rule itself. Subsection (h) reads that "[a]nyvariance from the procedures required by this rule whichdoes not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."The language comes close to tracking the text of Rule 52(a),providing generally for "harmless-error" review, that is, consideration of error raised by a defendant's timely objection,but subject to an opportunity on the Government's part tocarry the burden of showing that any error was harmless, ashaving no effect on the defendant's substantial rights. SeeFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a) ("Any error, defect, irregularityor variance which does not affect substantial rights shall bedisregarded"); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734(1993).Rule 52(a), however, has a companion in Rule 52(b), a"plain-error" rule covering issues not raised before the district court in a timely way: "Plain errors or defects affectingsubstantial rights may be noticed although they were notbrought to the attention of the court." When an appellatecourt considers error that qualifies as plain, the tables areturned on demonstrating the substantiality of any effect on5 Compare, e. g., 224 F. 3d, at 1155, with United States v.

S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the Courta defendant's rights: the defendant who sat silent at trial hasthe burden to show that his "substantial rights" were affected. Id., at 734-735. And because relief on plain-errorreview is in the discretion of the reviewing court, a defendant has the further burden to persuade the court that theerror " `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or publicreputation of judicial proceedings.' " Id., at 736 (quotingUnited States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)).The question here is whether Congress's importation ofthe harmless-error standard into Rule 11(h) without its com-panion plain-error rule was meant to eliminate a silent defendant's burdens under the Rule 52(b) plain-error review,and instead give him a right to subject the Government tothe burden of demonstrating harmlessness. If the answeris yes, a defendant loses nothing by failing to object to obvious Rule 11 error when it occurs. We think the answeris no.AVonn's most obvious recourse is to argue from the textitself: Rule 11(h) unequivocally provides that a trial judge's"variance" from the letter of the Rule 11 scheme shall bedisregarded if it does not affect substantial rights, the classicshorthand formulation of the harmless-error standard. Itincludes no exception for nonobjecting defendants.Despite this unqualified simplicity, however, Vonn does notargue that Rule 11 error must always be reviewed on the11(h) standard, with its burden on the Government to showan error harmless. Even though Rule 11(h) makes no distinction between direct and collateral review, Vonn does notclaim even that the variant of harmless-error review applicable on collateral attack, see Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S.619, 638 (1993), would apply when evaluating Rule 11 erroron habeas review. Rather, he concedes that the adoption of11(h) had no effect on the stringent standard for collateralreview of Rule 11 error under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.),as established by our holding inUnited States v. Timmreck,535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of the Court441 U. S. 780 (1979), that a defendant cannot overturn aguilty plea on collateral review absent a showing that theRule 11 proceeding was " `inconsistent with the rudimentarydemands of fair procedure' " or constituted a " `completemiscarriage of justice,' " id., at 783 (quoting Hill v. UnitedStates, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962)). The concession is prudent,for the Advisory Committee Notes explaining the adoptionof Rule 11(h) speak to a clear intent to leave Timmreck undisturbed,6 and there is no question of Timmreck's validityin the aftermath of the 1983 amendments.Whatever may be the significance of the text of Rule 11(h)for our issue, then, it cannot be as simple as the face of theprovision itself. Indeed, the closest Vonn gets to a persuasive argument that Rule 11 excuses a silent defendant fromthe burdens of plain-error review is his invocation of thecommon interpretive canon for dealing with a salient omission from statutory text. He claims that the specification ofharmless-error review in 11(h) shows an intent to excludethe standard with which harmless error is paired in Rule 52,the plain-error standard with its burdens on silent defendants. The congressional choice to express the one standardof review without its customary companion does not, however, speak with any clarity in Vonn's favor.6 In the absence of a clear legislative mandate, the Advisory CommitteeNotes provide a reliable source of insight into the meaning of a rule, especially when, as here, the rule was enacted precisely as the Advisory Committee proposed. See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U. S. 153, 165-166, n. 9 (1988) (where "Congress did not amend the Advisory Committee'sdraft in any way . . . the Committee's commentary is particularly relevantin determining the meaning of the document Congress enacted"). Although the Notes are the product of the Advisory Committee, and notCongress, they are transmitted to Congress before the rule is enactedinto law. See Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure, H. R. Doc.No. 98-55 (1983) (submitting to Congress amendments to the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure, including the addition of Rule 11(h), accompanied by the report of the Judicial Conference containing the AdvisoryCommittee Notes to the amendment).535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAt best, as we have said before, the canon that expressingone item of a commonly associated group or series excludesanother left unmentioned is only a guide, whose fallibilitycan be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any ex-clusion of its common relatives. SeePauley v. BethEnergyMines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 703 (1991); cf. Burns v. UnitedStates, 501 U. S. 129, 136 (1991) ("An inference drawn fromcongressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it iscontrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of con-gressional intent"). Here, the plausibility of an expressionexclusion reading of Rule 11(h) is subject to one strike without even considering what such a reading would mean inpractice, or examining the circumstances of adopting 11(h).For here the harmless- and plain-error alternatives are associated together in the formally enacted Rule 52, having apparently equal dignity with Rule 11(h), and applying by itsterms to error in the application of any other Rule of criminal procedure. To hold that the terms of Rule 11(h) implythat the latter half of Rule 52 has no application to Rule 11errors would consequently amount to finding a partial repealof Rule 52(b) by implication, a result sufficiently disfavored,Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1017 (1984), asto require strong support.Support, however, is not readily found. In the first place,even if we indulge Vonn with the assumption that Congressmeant to imply something by failing to pair a plain-errorprovision with the harmless-error statement in Rule 11(h),just what it would have meant is subject to argument. Vonnthinks the implication is that defendants who let Rule 11error pass without objection are relieved of the burden onsilent defendants generally under the plain-error rule, toshow the error plain, prejudicial, and disreputable to the judicial system. But, of course, this is not the only "implication" consistent with Congress's choice to say nothing aboutRule 11 plain error. It would be equally possible, as a mat535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of the Courtter of logic, to argue that if Rule 52(b) were implicitly madeinapplicable to Rule 11 errors, a defendant who failed to object to Rule 11 errors would have no right of review on directappeal whatever. A defendant's right to review of error helet pass in silence depends upon the plain-error rule; noplain-error rule, no direct review. Vonn has, then, merelyselected one possible interpretation of the supposedly inten-tional omission of a Rule 52(b) counterpart, even though logicwould equally allow another one, not to Vonn's liking.BRecognition of the equivocal character of any claimed im-plication of speaking solely in terms of harmless error forcesVonn to look beyond the text in hope of finding confirmationfor his reading as opposed to the one less hospitable to silentdefendants. And this effort leads him to claim support inMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459 (1969), and the de-velopments in the wake of that case culminating in the enactment of Rule 11(h). This approach, at least, gets us on theright track, for the one clearly expressed objective of Rule11(h) was to end the practice, then commonly followed, ofreversing automatically for any Rule 11 error, and thatpractice stemmed from an expansive reading of McCarthy.What that case did, and did not, hold is therefore significant.When McCarthy was decided, Rule 11 was relatively prim-itive, requiring without much detail that the trial court personally address a defendant proposing to plead guilty andestablish on the record that he was acting voluntarily, withan understanding of the charge and upon a factual basis sup-porting conviction.Id., at 462.7 When McCarthy stood be7 Prior to its amendment in 1975, Rule 11 provided, in relevant part:"The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not acceptsuch plea or a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily withunderstanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of theplea. . . . The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unlessit is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea."535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the Courtfore the District Court to plead guilty to tax evasion, how-ever, the judge's colloquy with him went no further thanMcCarthy's understanding of his right to a jury trial, theparticular sentencing possibilities, and the absence of anythreats or promises. There was no discussion of the ele-ments of the crime charged, or the facts that might supportit. Indeed, despite the allegation that McCarthy had acted"willfully and knowingly," his lawyer consistently argued atthe sentencing hearing that his client had merely been neglectful, ibid. Although defense counsel raised no objectionto the trial court's deficient practice under Rule 11, thisCourt reversed the conviction on direct review. The Courtrested the result solely on the trial judge's obvious failure toconform to the Rule, id., at 464, and emphasized that theRule's procedural safeguards served important constitutional interests in guarding against inadvertent and ignorantwaivers of constitutional rights, id., at 465. Although theGovernment asked to have the case remanded for furtherevidentiary hearing and an opportunity to show that McCarthy's plea had been made knowingly and voluntarily, theCourt said no and ordered the plea and resulting convictionvacated.Vonn does not, of course, claim that McCarthy held that asilent defendant had no plain-error burden, but he says thatthis must have been the Court's understanding, or it wouldhave taken McCarthy's failure to object to the trial judge'sRule 11 failings, combined with his failure to meet the requirements of the plain-error rule, as a bar to relief. Thisreasoning is unsound, however, for two reasons, the firstbeing that not a word was said in McCarthy about the plainerror rule, or for that matter about harmless error. Theopinion said nothing about Rule 52 or either of the rules byname. The parties' briefs said nothing. The only seriousissue was raised by the Government's request to remand thecase for a new evidentiary hearing on McCarthy's state ofmind when he entered the plea, and not even this had any535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of the Courtthing to do with either the harmless- or plain-error rule.Under the former, the Government's opportunity and burdenis to show the error harmless based on the entire recordbefore the reviewing court, seeUnited States v. Hasting, 461U. S. 499, 509, n. 7 (1983); under the plain-error rule the Gov-ernment likewise points to parts of the record to counter anyostensible showing of prejudice the defendant may make, seeUnited States v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 16 (1985). Under eitherrule, the Government's opportunity is to persuade with whatit has, not to initiate further litigation. Yet further litiga-tion is what the Government wanted inMcCarthy. It argued that if the Court did not think that the existing recorddemonstrated that McCarthy's plea had been knowing andvoluntary, the Court should remand for a further hearingwith new evidence affirmatively making this showing, 394U. S., at 469. When the Court said no, it made no referenceto harmless or plain error, but cited the object of Rule 11to eliminate time-wasting litigation after the fact about howknowing and voluntary a defendant really had been at anearlier hearing. Id., at 469-470. And it expressed intenseskepticism that any defendant would succeed, no matter howlittle he understood, once the evidence at a subsequent hearing showed that he had desired to plead. Id., at 469. Insum, McCarthy had nothing to do with the choice betweenharmless-error and plain-error review; the issue was simplywhether the Government could extend the litigation for additional evidence.Vonn's attempt to read the McCarthy Court's mind istherefore purely speculative. What is worse, however, hisspeculation is less plausible than the view that the Courtwould probably have held that McCarthy satisfied the plainerror burdens if that had mattered. There was no questionthat the trial judge had failed to observe Rule 11, and thefailing was obvious. So was the prejudice to McCarthy.Having had no explanation from the judge of the knowingand willful state of mind charged as of the time of the tax535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the Courtviolation, he pleaded guilty and was later sentenced at ahearing in which his lawyer repeatedly represented that McCarthy had been guilty of nothing but sloppiness.8 The con-tradiction between the plea and the denial of the mentalstate alleged bespoke the prejudice of an unknowing plea, towhich the judge's indifference was an affront to the integrityof the judicial system. While we need not religitate or re-writeMcCarthy at this point, it is safe to say that the actualopinion is not even speculative authority that the plain-errorrule stops short of Rule 11 errors.Nor is there any persuasive reason to think that when theAdvisory Committee and Congress later came to considerRule 11(h) they accepted the view Vonn erroneously attributes to this Court in McCarthy. The attention of the Advi-sory Committee to the problem of Rule 11 error was notdrawn by McCarthy so much as by events that subsequentlyinvested that case with a significance beyond its holding. In1975, a few years after McCarthy came down, Congresstransformed Rule 11 into a detailed formula for testing adefendant's readiness to proceed to enter a plea of guilty,obliging the judge to give specified advice about the charge,the applicable criminal statute, and even collateral law. TheCourt inMcCarthy had, for example, been content to saythat a defendant would need to know of the right againstself-incrimination and rights to jury trial and confrontationbefore he could knowingly plead. But the 1975 revision ofRule 11 required instruction on such further matters ascross-examination in addition to confrontation, see Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 11(c)(3); the right to counsel "at . . . trial" evenwhen the defendant stood in court with a lawyer next to him(as in this case), see ibid.; and even the consequences of any8 Nor did McCarthy claim that the guilty plea should be accepted on theAlford theory that a defendant may plead guilty while protesting innocence when he makes a conscious choice to plead simply to avoid the expenses or vicissitudes of trial.

VONNOpinion of the Courtperjury the defendant might commit at the plea hearing, seeRule 11(c)(5).Although the details newly required in Rule 11 colloquiesdid not necessarily equate to the importance of the overarching issues of knowledge and voluntariness already addressedin the earlier versions of the Rule, some Courts of Appealsfelt bound to treat all Rule 11 lapses as equal and to readMcCarthy as mandating automatic reversal for any one ofthem. See Advisory Committee's Notes on 1983 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1568(hereinafter Advisory Committee's Notes) (citing UnitedStates v.

This approach imposeda cost on Rule 11 mistakes that McCarthy neither requirednor justified, and by 1983 the practice of automatic reversalfor error threatening little prejudice to a defendant or disgrace to the legal system prompted further revision of Rule11. Advisory Committee's Notes 1568.The Advisory Committee reasoned that, although a rule ofper se reversal might have been justified at the time McCarthy was decided, "[a]n inevitable consequence of the 1975amendments was some increase in the risk that a trial judge,in a particular case, might inadvertently deviate to some degree from the procedure which a very literal reading of Rule11 would appear to require." Advisory Committee's Notes1568. After the amendments, "it became more apparentthan ever that Rule 11 should not be given such a crabbedinterpretation that ceremony was exalted over substance."Ibid.Vonn thinks the Advisory Committee's report also includesa signal that it meant to dispense with a silent defendant'splain-error burdens. He stresses that the report citedCourts of Appeals cases of "crabbed interpretation" that hadgiven relief to nonobjecting defendants. By proposing onlya harmless-error amendment to correct the mistakes made535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the Courtin these cases, he says, the Committee must have thoughtthat the Government's only answer to nonobjecting defendants should be to prove error harmless, if it could. But thisargument ignores the fact that these cases were not merelyinstances of automatic reversal, but were cited along withharmless-error cases as illustrations of the "considerable disagreement" that arose after McCarthy among Courts of Appeals in treating errors of trivial significance. See AdvisoryCommittee's Notes 1568. Given the Advisory Committee'sapparent focus on the disarray among courts, the citationsVonn points to cannot reliably be read to suggest that plainerror review should never apply to Rule 11 errors, when theAdvisory Committee Notes never made such an assertionand the reported cases cited by the Committee never mentioned the plain-error/harmless-error distinction.We think, rather, that the significance of Congress's choiceto adopt a harmless-error rule is best understood by takingthe Advisory Committee at its word. "It must . . . be emphasized that a harmless error provision has been added toRule 11 because some courts have read McCarthy as meaning that the general harmless error provision in Rule 52(a)cannot be utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings."Id., at 1569. The Committee said it was responding simply to a claim that the harmless-error rule did not apply.Having pinpointed that problem, it gave a pinpoint answer.If instead the Committee had taken note of claims that"Rule 52" did not apply, or that "neither harmless-error norplain-error rule applied," one could infer that enacting aharmless-error rule and nothing more was meant to rule outanything but harmless-error treatment. But by providingfor harmless-error review in response to nothing more thanthe claim that harmless-error review would itself be erroneous, the Advisory Committee implied nothing more than itsaid, and it certainly did not implicitly repeal Rule 52(b) sofar as it might cover a Rule 11 case.535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 UNITED STATES v.

A trialjudge is authorized to grant such a presentence motion ifthe defendant carries the burden of showing a "fair and justreason" for withdrawal, and a defendant who fails to movefor withdrawal before sentencing has no further recourse except "direct appeal or . . . motion under 28 U. S. C. 2255,"subject to the rules covering those later stages. Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 32(e). Whatever the "fair and just" standardmay require on presentence motions,9 the Advisory Committee Notes confirm the textual suggestion that the Rulecreates a " `near-presumption' " against granting motionsfiled after sentencing, Advisory Committee's Notes on 1983Amendment to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U. S. C. App.,p. 1621 (quoting United States v. Barker, 514 F. 2d 208, 219(CADC 1975)). This is only good sense; in acting as anincentive to think through a guilty plea before sentence isimposed, the Rule tends to separate meritorious secondthoughts (say, a defendant's doubts about his understanding)and mere sour grapes over a sentence once pronounced.The "near-presumption" concentrates plea litigation in thetrial courts, where genuine mistakes can be corrected easily,and promotes the finality required in a system as heavilydependent on guilty pleas as ours.9 The Courts of Appeals have held that a Rule 11 violation that is harmless under Rule 11(h) does not rise to the level of a "fair and just reason"for withdrawing a guilty plea. See United States v. Driver, 242 F. 3d 767,769 (CA7 2001) ("Even an established violation of Rule 11 can be harmlesserror . . . and thus not a `fair and just reason' to return to Square One");United States v. Siegel, 102 F. 3d 477, 481 (CA11 1996); United States v.Martinez-Molina, 64 F. 3d 719, 734 (CA1 1995).535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN73Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the CourtBut the incentive to think and act early when Rule 11 isat stake would prove less substantial if Vonn's position werelaw; a defendant could choose to say nothing about a judge'splain lapse under Rule 11 until the moment of taking a directappeal, at which time the burden would always fall on theGovernment to prove harmlessness. A defendant couldsimply relax and wait to see if the sentence later struck himas satisfactory; if not, his Rule 11 silence would have lefthim with clear but uncorrected Rule 11 error to place onthe Government's shoulders. This result might, perhaps, besufferable if there were merit in Vonn's objection that apply-ing the plain-error standard to a defendant who stays mumon Rule 11 error invites the judge to relax. The plain-errorrule, he says, would discount the judge's duty to advise thedefendant by obliging the defendant to advise the judge.But, rhetoric aside, that is always the point of the plain-errorrule: the value of finality requires defense counsel to be onhis toes, not just the judge, and the defendant who just sitsthere when a mistake can be fixed cannot just sit there whenhe speaks up later on.1010 Contrary to Justice Stevens's suggestion, post, at 78-80 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part), there is nothing "perverse"about conditioning the Government's harmless-error burden on an objection when the judge commits Rule 11 error. A defendant's right to counsel on entering a guilty plea is expressly recognized in Rule 11(c)(2), andcounsel is obliged to understand the Rule 11 requirements. It is fair toburden the defendant with his lawyer's obligation to do what is reasonablynecessary to render the guilty plea effectual and to refrain from triflingwith the court. It therefore makes sense to require counsel to call a Rule11 failing to the court's attention. It is perfectly true that an uncounseleddefendant may not, in fact, know enough to spot a Rule 11 error, but whena defendant chooses self-representation after a warning from the court ofthe perils this entails, see Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 835 (1975),Rule 11 silence is one of the perils he assumes. Any other approach is atodds with Congress's object in adopting Rule 11, recognized in McCarthyv. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 465 (1969), to combat defendants' "oftenfrivolous" attacks on the validity of their guilty pleas, by aiding the district judge in determining whether the defendant's plea was knowing and535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of the CourtIn sum, there are good reasons to doubt that expressing aharmless-error standard in Rule 11(h) was meant to carryany implication beyond its terms. At the very least, thereis no reason persuasive enough to think 11(h) was intendedto repeal Rule 52(b) for every Rule 11 case.IIIThe final question goes to the scope of an appellate court'senquiry into the effect of a Rule 11 violation, whatever thereview, plain error or harmless. The Court of Appeals con-fined itself to considering the record of "the plea proceeding," 224 F. 3d, at 1156, applying Circuit precedent recogniz-ing that the best evidence of a defendant's understandingwhen pleading guilty is the colloquy closest to the momenthe enters the plea. While there is no doubt that this position serves the object of Rule 11 to eliminate wasteful posthoc probes into a defendant's psyche, McCarthy, 394 U. S., at470, the Court of Appeals was more zealous than the policybehind the Rule demands. The Advisory Committee intended the effect of error to be assessed on an existing rec-ord, no question, but it did not mean to limit that recordstrictly to the plea proceedings: the enquiry " `must be re-solved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript' and theother portions (e. g., sentencing hearing) of the limited recordmade in such cases." Advisory Committee's Notes 1569(quoting United States v. Coronado, 554 F. 2d 166, 170, n. 5(CA5 1977)).True, language in McCarthy ostensibly supports the posi-tion taken by the Court of Appeals (which did not, however,rest on it); we admonished that "[t]here is no adequate substivoluntary and creating a record at the time of the plea supporting thatdecision.Vonn's final retort that application of the plain-error rule would tend toleave some "unconstitutional pleas" uncorrected obviates the question inthis case, which is who bears the burden of proving that Rule 11 error didor did not prejudice the defendant: the Government or the defendant?535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN75Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)Opinion of the Courttute for demonstrating in the record at the time the plea isentered the defendant's understanding of the nature of thecharge against him," 394 U. S., at 470 (emphasis in original).ButMcCarthy was decided before the enactment of Rule11(h), which came with the commentary just quoted, and McCarthy in any event was not a case with a record of anythingon point, even outside the Rule 11 hearing. The Government responded to the laconic plea colloquy not by referringto anything illuminating in the record; instead it brought upthe indictment, tried to draw speculative inferences fromconversations McCarthy probably had with his lawyer, andsought to present new evidence. The only serious alternative to "the record at the time the plea [was] entered" was anevidentiary hearing for further factfinding by the trial court.Here, however, there is a third source of information, outside the four corners of the transcript of the plea hearingand Rule 11 colloquy, but still part of the record. Transcripts brought to our attention show that Vonn was advisedof his right to trial counsel during his initial appearance before the Magistrate Judge and twice at his first arraignment.The record shows that four times either Vonn or his counselaffirmed that Vonn had heard or read a statement of hisrights and understood what they were. Because there arecircumstances in which defendants may be presumed to recall information provided to them prior to the plea proceeding, cf. Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 618 (1998) (adefendant with a copy of his indictment before pleadingguilty is presumed to know the nature of the charge againsthim), the record of Vonn's initial appearance and arraignmentis relevant in fact, and well within the Advisory Committee'sunderstanding of "other portions . . . of the limited record"that should be open to consideration. It may be considered here.The transcripts covering Vonn's first appearance and arraignment were not, however, presented to the Court of Appeals. Probably owing to that court's self-confinement to a535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN76 UNITED STATES v. VONNOpinion of Stevens, J.narrower record, it made no express ruling on the part ofthe Government's rehearing motion requesting to make thefirst-appearance and arraignment transcripts part of the appellate record. For that reason, even with the transcriptsnow in the parties' joint appendix filed with us, we shouldnot resolve their bearing on Vonn's claim before the Courtof Appeals has done so. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103 (2001).We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals's judgment andremand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
