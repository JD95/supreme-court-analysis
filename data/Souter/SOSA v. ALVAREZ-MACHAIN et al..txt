The two issues are whether respondent Alvarez-Machain'sallegation that the Drug Enforcement Administration instigated his abduction from Mexico for criminal trial in theUnited States supports a claim against the Governmentunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act), 28U. S. C. $$ 1346(b)(1), 2671-2680, and whether he may recoverunder the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U. S. C. $ 1350. Wehold that he is not entitled to a remedy under either statute.IWe have considered the underlying facts before, UnitedStates v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S. 655 (1992). In 1985,an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),Enrique Camarena-Salazar, was captured on assignment inMexico and taken to a house in Guadalajara, where he wastortured over the course of a 2-day interrogation, then murdered. Based in part on eyewitness testimony, DEA offi-cials in the United States came to believe that respondentHumberto Alvarez-Machain (Alvarez), a Mexican physician,was present at the house and acted to prolong the agent'slife in order to extend the interrogation and torture. Id.,at 657.In 1990, a federal grand jury indicted Alvarez for the tor-ture and murder of Camarena-Salazar, and the United StatesDistrict Court for the Central District of California issued aBill Lann Lee, Stanley M. Chesley, Paul De Marco, Burt Neuborne, andMichael D. Hausfeld; for Wendy A. Adams et al. by William J. Acevesand David S. Weissbrodt; and for Mary Robinson et al. by Harold HongjuKoh, John M.

ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtwarrant for his arrest. 331 F. 3d 604, 609 (CA9 2003) (enbanc). The DEA asked the Mexican Government for helpin getting Alvarez into the United States, but when the requests and negotiations proved fruitless, the DEA approveda plan to hire Mexican nationals to seize Alvarez and bringhim to the United States for trial. As so planned, a group ofMexicans, including petitioner Jose Francisco Sosa, abductedAlvarez from his house, held him overnight in a motel, andbrought him by private plane to El Paso, Texas, where hewas arrested by federal officers. Ibid.Once in American custody, Alvarez moved to dismiss theindictment on the ground that his seizure was "outrageousgovernmental conduct," Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S., at 658,and violated the extradition treaty between the UnitedStates and Mexico. The District Court agreed, the NinthCircuit affirmed, and we reversed, id., at 670, holding thatthe fact of Alvarez's forcible seizure did not affect the jurisdiction of a federal court. The case was tried in 1992, andended at the close of the Government's case, when the District Court granted Alvarez's motion for a judgment ofacquittal.In 1993, after returning to Mexico, Alvarez began the civilaction before us here. He sued Sosa, Mexican citizen andDEA operative Antonio Garate-Bustamante, five unnamedMexican civilians, the United States, and four DEA agents.331 F. 3d, at 610. So far as it matters here, Alvarez soughtdamages from the United States under the FTCA, allegingfalse arrest, and from Sosa under the ATS, for a violation ofthe law of nations. The former statute authorizes suit"for . . . personal injury . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government whileacting within the scope of his office or employment." 28U. S. C. $ 1346(b)(1). The latter provides in its entirety that"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of anycivil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN699Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtof the law of nations or a treaty of the United States."$ 1350.The District Court granted the Government's motion todismiss the FTCA claim, but awarded summary judgmentand $25,000 in damages to Alvarez on the ATS claim. Athree-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit then affirmed the ATSjudgment, but reversed the dismissal of the FTCA claim.266 F. 3d 1045 (2001).A divided en banc court came to the same conclusion. 331F. 3d, at 641. As for the ATS claim, the court called on itsown precedent, "that [the ATS] not only provides federalcourts with subject matter jurisdiction, but also creates acause of action for an alleged violation of the law of nations."Id., at 612. The Circuit then relied upon what it called the"clear and universally recognized norm prohibiting arbitraryarrest and detention," id., at 620, to support the conclusionthat Alvarez's arrest amounted to a tort in violation of international law. On the FTCA claim, the Ninth Circuit heldthat, because "the DEA had no authority to effect Alvarez'sarrest and detention in Mexico," id., at 608, the UnitedStates was liable to him under California law for the tort offalse arrest, id., at 640-641.We granted certiorari in these companion cases to clarifythe scope of both the FTCA and the ATS. 540 U. S. 1045(2003). We now reverse in each.IIThe Government seeks reversal of the judgment of liabil-ity under the FTCA on two principal grounds. It arguesthat the arrest could not have been tortious, because it wasauthorized by 21 U. S. C. $ 878, setting out the arrest authority of the DEA, and it says that in any event the liabilityasserted here falls within the FTCA exception to waiver ofsovereign immunity for claims "arising in a foreign country,"28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). We think the exception applies and decide on that ground.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN700 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtAThe FTCA "was designed primarily to remove the sover-eign immunity of the United States from suits in tort and,with certain specific exceptions, to render the Governmentliable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances." Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 6(1962); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 2674. The Act accordingly givesfederal district courts jurisdiction over claims against theUnited States for injury "caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government whileacting within the scope of his office or employment, undercircumstances where the United States, if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law ofthe place where the act or omission occurred." $ 1346(b)(1).But the Act also limits its waiver of sovereign immunity ina number of ways. See $ 2680 (no waiver as to, e. g., "[a]nyclaim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter," "[a]ny claim for damagescaused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine bythe United States," or "[a]ny claim arising from the activitiesof the Panama Canal Company").Here the significant limitation on the waiver of immunityis the Act's exception for "[a]ny claim arising in a foreigncountry," $ 2680(k), a provision that on its face seems plainlyapplicable to the facts of this action. In the Ninth Circuit'sview, once Alvarez was within the borders of the UnitedStates, his detention was not tortious, see 331 F. 3d, at 636-637; the appellate court suggested that the Government's lia-bility to Alvarez rested solely upon a false arrest claim.Id.,at 640-641. Alvarez's arrest, however, was said to be"false," and thus tortious, only because, and only to the ex-tent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.1 The actions1 In the Ninth Circuit's view, it was critical that "DEA agents had noauthority under federal law to execute an extraterritorial arrest of a suspect indicted in federal court in Los Angeles." 331 F. 3d, at 640. OnceAlvarez arrived in the United States, "the actions of domestic law enforce542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN701Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtin Mexico are thus most naturally understood as the kernelof a "claim arising in a foreign country," and barred from suitunder the exception to the waiver of immunity.Notwithstanding the straightforward language of the foreign country exception, the Ninth Circuit allowed the actionto proceed under what has come to be known as the "headquarters doctrine." Some Courts of Appeals, reasoning that"[t]he entire scheme of the FTCA focuses on the place wherethe negligent or wrongful act or omission of the governmentemployee occurred,"Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d 755,761 (CADC 1979), have concluded that the foreign countryexception does not exempt the United States from suit "foracts or omissions occurring here which have their operativeeffect in another country," id., at 762 (refusing to apply$ 2680(k) where a communique sent from the United Statesby a federal law enforcement officer resulted in plaintiff 'swrongful detention in Germany).2 Headquarters claims"typically involve allegations of negligent guidance in an of-fice within the United States of employees who cause damage while in a foreign country, or of activities which takeplace within a foreign country."Cominotto v.

ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtThe reasoning of the Ninth Circuit here was that, sinceAlvarez's abduction in Mexico was the direct result of wrongful acts of planning and direction by DEA agents located inCalifornia, "Alvarez's abduction fits the headquarters doctrine like a glove." 331 F. 3d, at 638."Working out of DEA offices in Los Angeles, [DEAagents] made the decision to kidnap Alvarez and . . .gave [their Mexican intermediary] precise instructionson whom to recruit, how to seize Alvarez, and how heshould be treated during the trip to the United States.DEA officials in Washington, D. C., approved the detailsof the operation. After Alvarez was abducted according to plan, DEA agents supervised his transportationinto the United States, telling the arrest team where toland the plane and obtaining clearance in El Paso forlanding. The United States, and California in particu-lar, served as command central for the operation carriedout in Mexico." Id., at 638-639.Thus, the Ninth Circuit held that Alvarez's claim did not"aris[e] in" a foreign country.The potential effect of this sort of headquarters analysisflashes the yellow caution light. "[I]t will virtually alwaysbe possible to assert that the negligent activity that injuredthe plaintiff [abroad] was the consequence of faulty training,selection or supervision--or even less than that, lack of careful training, selection or supervision--in the United States."Beattie v. United States, 756 F. 2d 91, 119 (CADC 1984)(Scalia, J., dissenting). Legal malpractice claims, Knisley v.United States, 817 F.

United States, Dept. of Army, 794 F. 2d 981,983-984 (CA5 1986), can all be repackaged as headquartersclaims based on a failure to train, a failure to warn, the offering of bad advice, or the adoption of a negligent policy. If542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN703Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtwe were to approve the headquarters exception to the for-eign country exception, the " `headquarters claim' [would]become a standard part of FTCA litigation" in cases poten-tially implicating the foreign country exception. Beattie,supra, at 119 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The headquarters doc-trine threatens to swallow the foreign country exceptionwhole, certainly at the pleadings stage.The need for skepticism is borne out by two considerations. One of them is pertinent to cases like this one, whereharm was arguably caused both by individual action in a foreign country as well as by planning in the United States;the other is suggested simply because the harm occurred onforeign soil. BAlthough not every headquarters case is rested on an ex-plicit analysis of proximate causation, this notion of cause isnecessary to connect the domestic breach of duty (at head-quarters) with the action in the foreign country (in a caselike this) producing the foreign harm or injury. It is neces-sary, in other words, to conclude that the act or omission athome headquarters was sufficiently close to the ultimate in-jury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make itreasonable to follow liability back to the headquarters behav-ior. Only in this way could the behavior at headquartersproperly be seen as the act or omission on which all FTCAliability must rest under $ 2675. See, e. g., Cominotto,supra, at 1130 ("[A] headquarters claim exists where negli-gent acts in the United States proximately cause harm in aforeign country"); Eaglin, supra, at 983 (noting that head-quarters cases require "a plausible proximate nexus or connection between acts or omissions in the United States andthe resulting damage or injury in a foreign country").Recognizing this connection of proximate cause betweendomestic behavior and foreign harm or injury is not, however, sufficient of itself to bar application of the foreign coun-try exception to a claim resting on that same foreign conse542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN704 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtquence. Proximate cause is causation substantial enoughand close enough to the harm to be recognized by law, but agiven proximate cause need not be, and frequently is not, theexclusive proximate cause of harm. See, e. g., 57A Am. Jur.2d $ 529 (2004) (discussing proper jury instructions in casesinvolving multiple proximate causes); Beattie, supra, at 121(Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[I]n the ordinary case there may beseveral points along the chain of causality" pertinent to theenquiry). Here, for example, assuming that the direction byDEA officials in California was a proximate cause of the ab-duction, the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico were justas surely proximate causes, as well. Thus, understandingthat California planning was a legal cause of the harm in noway eliminates the conclusion that the claim here arose fromharm proximately caused by acts in Mexico. At most, recognition of additional domestic causation under the headquar-ters doctrine leaves an open question whether the exceptionapplies to the claim. CNot only does domestic proximate causation under theheadquarters doctrine fail to eliminate application of the foreign country exception, but there is good reason to think thatCongress understood a claim "arising in" a foreign country insuch a way as to bar application of the headquarters doc-trine. There is good reason, that is, to conclude that Congress understood a claim "arising in a foreign country" to bea claim for injury or harm occurring in a foreign country.28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). This sense of "arising in" was the com-mon usage in state borrowing statutes contemporary withthe Act, which operated to determine which State's statuteof limitations should apply in cases involving transjurisdictional facts. When the FTCA was passed, the general rule,as set out in various state statutes, was that "a cause ofaction arising in another jurisdiction, which is barred by thelaws of that jurisdiction, will [also] be barred in the domesticcourts." 41 A. L. R. 4th 1025, 1029, $ 2 (1985). These bor542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN705Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrowing statutes were typically restricted by express termsto situations where a cause of action was time barred in theState "where [the] cause of action arose, or accrued, or orig-inated." 75 A. L. R. 203, 211 (1931) (emphasis in original).Critically for present purposes, these variations on thetheme of "arising in" were interpreted in tort cases in justthe same way that we read the FTCA today. A commenta-tor noted in 1962 that, for the purposes of these borrowingstatutes, "[t]he courts unanimously hold that a cause of actionsounding in tort arises in the jurisdiction where the last actnecessary to establish liability occurred"; i. e., "the jurisdic-tion in which injury was received." Ester, Borrowing Statutes of Limitation and Conflict of Laws, 15 U. Fla. L. Rev.33, 47.There is, moreover, specific reason to believe that using"arising in" as referring to place of harm was central to theobject of the foreign country exception. Any tort action in acourt of the United States based on the acts of a Governmentemployee causing harm outside the State of the district courtin which the action is filed requires a determination of thesource of the substantive law that will govern liability.When the FTCA was passed, the dominant principle inchoice-of-law analysis for tort cases was lex loci delicti:courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred. See Richards v. United States, 369 U. S., at11-12 ("The general conflict-of-laws rule, followed by a vastmajority of the States, is to apply the law of the place ofinjury to the substantive rights of the parties" (footnoteomitted)); see also Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws$ 379 (1934) (defendant's liability determined by "the law ofthe place of wrong"); 3 id., $ 377, Note 1 (place of wrong for3 See also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws 412 (1969) (hereinafter Restatement 2d) ("The original Restatement stated that, with minorexceptions, all substantive questions relating to the existence of a tortclaim are governed by the local law of the `place of wrong.' This wasdescribed . . . as `the state where the last event necessary to make an542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN706 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courttorts involving bodily harm is "the place where the harmfulforce takes effect upon the body" (emphasis in original)); ibid.(same principle for torts of fraud and torts involving harmto property).4 For a plaintiff injured in a foreign country,then, the presumptive choice in American courts underthe traditional rule would have been to apply foreign law todetermine the tortfeasor's liability. See, e. g., Day & Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U. S. 3 (1975) (per curiam)(noting that Texas would apply Cambodian law to wrongfuldeath action involving explosion in Cambodia of an artilleryround manufactured in United States);Thomas v. FMCCorp., 610 F. Supp. 912 (MD Ala. 1985) (applying Germanlaw to determine American manufacturer's liability fornegligently designing and manufacturing a Howitzer thatkilled decedent in Germany);Quandt v. Beech AircraftCorp., 317 F. Supp. 1009 (Del. 1970) (noting that Italian lawapplies to allegations of negligent manufacture in Kansasthat resulted in an airplane crash in Italy); Manos v. TransWorld Airlines, 295 F. Supp. 1170 (ND Ill. 1969) (applyingItalian law to determine American corporation's liability fornegligent manufacture of a plane that crashed in Italy); seealso, e. g., Dallas v. Whitney, 118 W. Va. 106, 188 S. E. 766(1936) (Ohio law applied where blasting operations on a WestVirginia highway caused property damage in Ohio); Camactor liable for an alleged tort takes place.' Since a tort is the product ofwrongful conduct and of resulting injury and since the injury follows theconduct, the state of the `last event' is the state where the injuryoccurred").4 The FTCA was passed with precisely these kinds of garden-varietytorts in mind. See S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 31 (1946)("With the expansion of governmental activities in recent years, it becomes especially important to grant to private individuals the right to suethe Government in respect to such torts as negligence in the operation ofvehicles"); see generally Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, 139-140(1950) (Congress was principally concerned with making the Governmentliable for ordinary torts that "would have been actionable if inflicted byan individual or a corporation").542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN707Cite as: 542 U.

W. 1092 (1890) (Arkan-sas law applied where a blasting of a rock in Indian territoryinflicted injury on plaintiff in Arkansas).The application of foreign substantive law exemplified inthese cases was, however, what Congress intended to avoidby the foreign country exception. In 1942, the House Committee on the Judiciary considered an early draft of theFTCA that would have exempted all claims "arising in a for-eign country in behalf of an alien." H. R. 5373, 77th Cong.,2d Sess., $ 303(12). The bill was then revised, at the sugges-tion of the Attorney General, to omit the last five words. Inexplaining the amendment to the House Committee on theJudiciary, Assistant Attorney General Shea said that"[c]laims arising in a foreign country have been ex-empted from this bill, H. R. 6463, whether or not theclaimant is an alien. Since liability is to be determinedby the law of the situs of the wrongful act or omissionit is wise to restrict the bill to claims arising in thiscountry. This seems desirable because the law of theparticular State is being applied. Otherwise, it willlead I think to a good deal of difficulty." Hearings onH. R. 5373 et al. before the House Committee on theJudiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1942).The amended version, which was enacted into law and consti-tutes the current text of the foreign country exception, 28U. S. C. $ 2680(k), thus codified Congress's "unwilling[ness] tosubject the United States to liabilities depending upon thelaws of a foreign power." United States v. Spelar, 338 U. S.217, 221 (1949). See alsoSami v. United States, 617 F. 2d,at 762 (noting Spelar's explanation but attempting to recastthe object behind the foreign country exception); Leaf v.United States, 588 F. 2d 733, 736, n. 3 (CA9 1978).The object being to avoid application of substantive foreign law, Congress evidently used the modifier "arising in aforeign country" to refer to claims based on foreign harm or542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN708 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtinjury, the fact that would trigger application of foreign lawto determine liability. That object, addressed by the quotedphrase, would obviously have been thwarted, however, byapplying the headquarters doctrine, for that doctrine wouldhave displaced the exception by recasting claims of foreigninjury as claims not arising in a foreign country becausesome planning or negligence at domestic headquarters wastheir cause.5 And that, in turn, would have resulted inapplying foreign law of the place of injury, in accordance withthe choice-of-law rule of the headquarters jurisdiction.Nor, as a practical matter, can it be said that the headquar-ters doctrine has outgrown its tension with the exception.It is true that the traditional approach to choice of substan-tive tort law has lost favor, Simson, The Choice-of-Law Revolution in the United States: Notes on Rereading VonMehren, 36 Cornell Int'l L. J. 125 (2002) ("The traditionalmethodology of place of wrong . . . has receded in importance,and new approaches and concepts such as governmental interest analysis, most significant relationship, and better ruleof law have taken over center stage" (footnotes omitted)).65 The application of foreign law might nonetheless have been avoided inheadquarters cases if courts had been instructed to apply the substantivetort law of the State where the federal act or omission occurred, regardless of where the ultimate harm transpired. But in Richards v. UnitedStates, 369 U. S. 1 (1962), we held that the Act requires "the whole law(including choice-of-law rules) . . . of the State where the [allegedly tortious federal] act or omission occurred," id., at 3, 11. Given the dominantAmerican choice-of-law approach at the time the Act was passed, thatwould have resulted in the application of foreign law in virtually any casewhere the plaintiff suffered injury overseas.6 See also Rydstrom, Modern Status of Rule that Substantive Rights ofParties to a Tort Action are Governed by the Law of the Place of theWrong, 29 A. L. R. 3d 603, 608, $ 2[a] (1970) ("[M]any courts [are] nowabandoning the orthodox rule that the substantive rights of the partiesare governed by the law of the place of the wrong" (footnotes omitted)).We express no opinion on the relative merits of the various approachesto choice questions; our discussion of the subject is intended only to indi542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN709Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtBut a good many States still employ essentially the samechoice-of-law analysis in tort cases that the First Restatement exemplified. Symeonides, Choice of Law in the Amer-ican Courts, 51 Am. J. Comp. L. 1, 4-5 (2003) ("Ten statescontinue to adhere to the traditional method in tort con-flicts"); see, e. g., Raskin v. Allison, 30 Kan. App. 2d 1240,1242, 1241, 57 P. 3d 30, 32 (2002) (under "traditional choice oflaw principles largely reflected in the original Restatement,"Mexican law applied to boating accident in Mexican watersbecause "the injuries were sustained in Mexican waters").Equally to the point is that in at least some cases thatthe Court of Appeals's approach would treat as arising atheadquarters, not the foreign country, even the later method-ologies of choice point to the application of foreign law. TheSecond Restatement itself, encouraging the general shift to-ward using flexible balancing analysis to inform choice oflaw,7 includes a default rule for tort cases rooted in the tradi-tional approach: "[i]n an action for a personal injury, the locallaw of the state where the injury occurred determines therights and liabilities of the parties, unless . . . some otherstate has a more significant relationship . . . to the occurrenceand the parties." Restatement 2d $ 146; see also id., Comment e ("On occasion, conduct and personal injury will occurin different states. In such instances, the local law of thestate of injury will usually be applied to determine most is-sues involving the tort"). In practice, then, the new dispensation frequently leads to the traditional application of thecate how, as a positive matter, transjurisdictional cases are likely to betreated today.7 Under the Second Restatement, tort liability is determined "by thelocal law of the state which . . . has the most significant relationship to theoccurrence and the parties," taking into account "the place where the injury occurred," "the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,""the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place ofbusiness of the parties," and "the place where the relationship, if any,between the parties is centered."

Morgan & Co., 170 Vt. 422, 750 A. 2d 1026 (2000)(applying Canadian law where a defective bicycle sold in Vermont caused injuries in Quebec).In sum, current flexibility in choice-of-law methodologygives no assurance against applying foreign substantive lawif federal courts follow headquarters doctrine to assume jurisdiction over tort claims against the Government for for-eign harm. Based on the experience just noted, the expectation is that application of the headquarters doctrine wouldin fact result in a substantial number of cases applying thevery foreign law the foreign country exception was meantto avoid.8Before concluding that headquarters analysis should haveno part in applying the foreign country exception, however,8 The courts that have applied the headquarters doctrine, believing it tobe intimated by our emphasis, in Richards v. United States, supra, onthe place of the occurrence of the negligent act, have acknowledged thepossibility that foreign law may govern FTCA claims as a function ofRichards's further holding that the whole law of the pertinent State (including its choice-of-law provisions) is to be applied. See, e. g., Leaf, 588F. 2d, at 736, n. 3. Some courts have attempted to defuse the resultingtension with the object behind the foreign country exception. See, e. g.,Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d 755, 763 (CADC 1979) (believing thatnorm against application of foreign law when contrary to forum policy issufficient to overcome possible conflict). We think that these attempts toresolve the tension give short shrift to the clear congressional mandateembodied by the foreign country exception. Cf. Shapiro, Choice of LawUnder the Federal Tort Claims Act: Richards and Renvoi Revisited, 70N. C. L. Rev. 641, 659-660 (1992) (noting that the Richards rule that thetotality of a State's law is to be consulted may undermine the object behind the foreign country exception).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN711Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courta word is needed to answer an argument for selective application of headquarters doctrine, that it ought to be permittedwhen a State's choice-of-law approach would not apply theforeign law of place of injury. See In re "Agent Orange"Product Liability Litigation, 580 F. Supp. 1242, 1254(EDNY 1984) (noting that the purpose of the exception didnot apply to the litigation at hand because foreign law wasnot implicated). The point would be well taken, of course,if Congress had written the exception to apply when foreignlaw would be applied. But that is not what Congress said.Its provision of an exception when a claim arises in a foreigncountry was written at a time when the phrase "arising in"was used in state statutes to express the position that aclaim arises where the harm occurs; and the odds are thatCongress meant simply this when it used the "arising in"language.9 Finally, even if it were not a stretch to equate"arising in a foreign country" with "implicating foreign law,"the result of accepting headquarters analysis for foreign injury cases in which no application of foreign law would ensuewould be a scheme of federal jurisdiction that would varyfrom State to State, benefiting or penalizing plaintiffs accordingly. The idea that Congress would have intended any9 It is difficult to reconcile the Government's contrary reading with thefact that two of the Act's other exceptions specifically reference an "act oromission." See 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(a) (exempting United States from liability for "[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of theGovernment, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation"); $ 2680(e) ("Any claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering [certain portions of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]"). The Government's request that weread that phrase into the foreign country exception, when it is clear thatCongress knew how to specify "act or omission" when it wanted to, runsafoul of the usual rule that "when the legislature uses certain language inone part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended." 2A N. Singer, Statutes andStatutory Construction $ 46:06, p. 194 (6th rev. ed. 2000).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN712 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtsuch jurisdictional variety is too implausible to drive theanalysis to the point of grafting even a selective headquarters exception onto the foreign country exception itself. Wetherefore hold that the FTCA's foreign country exceptionbars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreigncountry, regardless of where the tortious act or omissionoccurred.IIIAlvarez has also brought an action under the ATS againstpetitioner Sosa, who argues (as does the United States supporting him) that there is no relief under the ATS becausethe statute does no more than vest federal courts with jurisdiction, neither creating nor authorizing the courts to recognize any particular right of action without further congressional action. Although we agree the statute is in termsonly jurisdictional, we think that at the time of enactmentthe jurisdiction enabled federal courts to hear claims in avery limited category defined by the law of nations and recognized at common law. We do not believe, however, thatthe limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum common law claims understood in 1789should be taken as authority to recognize the right of actionasserted by Alvarez here.AJudge Friendly called the ATS a "legal Lohengrin," IITv. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1015 (CA2 1975); "no oneseems to know whence it came," ibid., and for over 170 yearsafter its enactment it provided jurisdiction in only one case.The first Congress passed it as part of the Judiciary Act of1789, in providing that the new federal district courts "shallalso have cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, or the circuit courts, as the case may be, of allcauses where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN713Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtlaw of nations or a treaty of the United States." Act ofSept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 9, 1 Stat. 77.10The parties and amici here advance radically different his-torical interpretations of this terse provision. Alvarez saysthat the ATS was intended not simply as a jurisdictionalgrant, but as authority for the creation of a new cause ofaction for torts in violation of international law. We thinkthat reading is implausible. As enacted in 1789, the ATSgave the district courts "cognizance" of certain causes of ac-tion, and the term bespoke a grant of jurisdiction, not powerto mold substantive law. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 81,pp. 447, 451 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (using "jurisdiction" interchangeably with "cognizance"). The fact that theATS was placed in $ 9 of the Judiciary Act, a statute otherwise exclusively concerned with federal-court jurisdiction,is itself support for its strictly jurisdictional nature. Norwould the distinction between jurisdiction and cause of ac-tion have been elided by the drafters of the Act or those whovoted on it. As Fisher Ames put it, "there is a substantialdifference between the jurisdiction of the courts and therules of decision." 1 Annals of Cong. 807 (Gales ed. 1834).It is unsurprising, then, that an authority on the historicalorigins of the ATS has written that "section 1350 clearly doesnot create a statutory cause of action," and that the contrary suggestion is "simply frivolous." Casto, The FederalCourts' Protective Jurisdiction over Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L. Rev. 467, 479, 480(1986) (hereinafter Casto, Law of Nations); cf. Dodge, TheConstitutionality of the Alien Tort Statute: Some Observa-tions on Text and Context, 42 Va. J. Int'l L. 687, 689 (2002).10 The statute has been slightly modified on a number of occasions sinceits original enactment. It now reads in its entirety: "The district courtsshall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tortonly, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the UnitedStates." 28 U.

ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtIn sum, we think the statute was intended as jurisdictionalin the sense of addressing the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject.But holding the ATS jurisdictional raises a new question,this one about the interaction between the ATS at the timeof its enactment and the ambient law of the era. Sosa wouldhave it that the ATS was stillborn because there could be noclaim for relief without a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action. Amici professors of federaljurisdiction and legal history take a different tack, that federal courts could entertain claims once the jurisdictionalgrant was on the books, because torts in violation of the lawof nations would have been recognized within the commonlaw of the time. Brief for Vikram Amar et al. asAmici Cu-riae. We think history and practice give the edge to thislatter position. 1"When the United States declared their independence,they were bound to receive the law of nations, in its modernstate of purity and refinement." Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall.199, 281 (1796) (Wilson, J.). In the years of the early Republic, this law of nations comprised two principal elements, thefirst covering the general norms governing the behavior ofnational states with each other: "the science which teachesthe rights subsisting between nations or states, and the obli-gations correspondent to those rights," E. de Vattel, Law ofNations, Preliminaries $ 3 (J. Chitty et al. transl. and ed.1883) (hereinafter Vattel) (footnote omitted), or "that code ofpublic instruction which defines the rights and prescribes theduties of nations, in their intercourse with each other," 1J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *1. This aspect ofthe law of nations thus occupied the executive and legislativedomains, not the judicial. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentar-ies on the Laws of England 68 (1769) (hereinafter Commentaries) ("[O]ffences against" the law of nations are "princi-pally incident to whole states or nations").542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN715Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThe law of nations included a second, more pedestrian ele-ment, however, that did fall within the judicial sphere, as abody of judge-made law regulating the conduct of individualssituated outside domestic boundaries and consequently carrying an international savor. To Blackstone, the law of na-tions in this sense was implicated "in mercantile questions,such as bills of exchange and the like; in all marine causes,relating to freight, average, demurrage, insurances, bottomry . . . ; [and] in all disputes relating to prizes, to ship-wrecks, to hostages, and ransom bills."Id., at 67. The lawmerchant emerged from the customary practices of international traders and admiralty required its own transnationalregulation. And it was the law of nations in this sense thatour precursors spoke about when the Court explained thestatus of coast fishing vessels in wartime grew from "ancientusage among civilized nations, beginning centuries ago, andgradually ripening into a rule of international law . . . ."The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S. 677, 686 (1900).There was, finally, a sphere in which these rules bindingindividuals for the benefit of other individuals overlappedwith the norms of state relationships. Blackstone referredto it when he mentioned three specific offenses against thelaw of nations addressed by the criminal law of England:violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of am-bassadors, and piracy. 4 Commentaries 68. An assaultagainst an ambassador, for example, impinged upon the sov-ereignty of the foreign nation and if not adequately redressed could rise to an issue of war. See Vattel 463-464.It was this narrow set of violations of the law of nations,admitting of a judicial remedy and at the same time threat-ening serious consequences in international affairs, that wasprobably on minds of the men who drafted the ATS with itsreference to tort.2Before there was any ATS, a distinctly American preoccu-pation with these hybrid international norms had taken542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN716 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtshape owing to the distribution of political power from independence through the period of confederation. The Continental Congress was hamstrung by its inability to "causeinfractions of treaties, or of the law of nations to be punished," J. Madison, Journal of the Constitutional Convention60 (E. Scott ed. 1893), and in 1781 the Congress implored theStates to vindicate rights under the law of nations. Inwords that echo Blackstone, the congressional resolutioncalled upon state legislatures to "provide expeditious, exemplary and adequate punishment" for "the violation of safeconducts or passports, . . . of hostility against such as are inamity . . . with the United States, . . . infractions of theimmunities of ambassadors and other public ministers . . .[and] infractions of treaties and conventions to which theUnited States are a party." 21 Journals of the ContinentalCongress 1136-1137 (G. Hunt ed. 1912) (hereinafter Journalsof the Continental Congress). The resolution recommendedthat the States "authorise suits . . . for damages by the partyinjured, and for compensation to the United States for damage sustained by them from an injury done to a foreignpower by a citizen." Id., at 1137; cf. Vattel 463-464 ("Whoever offends . . . a public minister . . . should be punished . . . ,and . . . the state should, at the expense of the delinquent,give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has been offendedin the person of his minister"). Apparently only one Stateacted upon the recommendation, see Public Records of theState of Connecticut, 1782, pp. 82, 83 (L. Larabee ed. 1982)(1942 compilation, exact date of Act unknown), but Congresshad done what it could to signal a commitment to enforcethe law of nations.Appreciation of the Continental Congress's incapacity todeal with this class of cases was intensified by the so-calledMarbois incident of May 1784, in which a French adventurer,De Longchamps, verbally and physically assaulted the Secretary of the French Legion in Philadelphia. See Respublica542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN717Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtv. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O. T. Phila. 1784).11 Congress called again for state legislation addressing such matters, and concern over the inadequate vindication of the lawof nations persisted through the time of the ConstitutionalConvention. See 1 Records of the Federal Convention of1787, p. 25 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (speech of J. Randolph).During the Convention itself, in fact, a New York City constable produced a reprise of the Marbois affair and SecretaryJay reported to Congress on the Dutch Ambassador's protest, with the explanation that " `the federal governmentdoes not appear . . . to be vested with any judicial Powerscompetent to the Cognizance and Judgment of such Cases.' "Casto, Law of Nations 494, and n. 152.The Framers responded by vesting the Supreme Courtwith original jurisdiction over "all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls." U. S.

TheJudiciary Act reinforced this Court's original jurisdictionover suits brought by diplomats, see 1 Stat. 80, ch. 20, $ 13,created alienage jurisdiction, $ 11, and, of course, includedthe ATS, $ 9.

ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtafter Randall) (discussing foreign affairs implications of theJudiciary Act); W. Casto, The Supreme Court in the EarlyRepublic 27-53 (1995).3Although Congress modified the draft of what became theJudiciary Act, see generally Warren, New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L. Rev.49 (1923), it made hardly any changes to the provisions onaliens, including what became the ATS, see Casto, Law ofNations 498. There is no record of congressional discussionabout private actions that might be subject to the jurisdictional provision, or about any need for further legislation tocreate private remedies; there is no record even of debate onthe section. Given the poverty of drafting history, moderncommentators have necessarily concentrated on the text, remarking on the innovative use of the word "tort," see, e. g.,Sweeney, A Tort only in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18Hastings Int'l & Comp. L. Rev. 445 (1995) (arguing that"tort" refers to the law of prize), and the statute's mixtureof terms expansive ("all suits"), see, e. g., Casto, Law of Nations 500, and restrictive ("for a tort only"), see, e. g., Randall28-31 (limiting suits to torts, as opposed to commercialactions, especially by British plaintiffs).12 The historicalscholarship has also placed the ATS within the competitionbetween federalist and antifederalist forces over the nationalrole in foreign relations. Id., at 22-23 (nonexclusiveness offederal jurisdiction under the ATS may reflect compromise).But despite considerable scholarly attention, it is fair to say12 The restriction may have served the different purpose of putting foreigners on notice that they would no longer be able to prosecute theirown criminal cases in federal court. Compare, e. g., 3 Commentaries 160(victims could start prosecutions) with the Judiciary Act $ 35 (creating theoffice of the district attorney). Cf. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 41, 42 (1794) (Britishconsul could not himself initiate criminal prosecution, but could provideevidence to the grand jury).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN719Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthat a consensus understanding of what Congress intendedhas proven elusive.Still, the history does tend to support two propositions.First, there is every reason to suppose that the First Congress did not pass the ATS as a jurisdictional convenience tobe placed on the shelf for use by a future Congress or statelegislature that might, someday, authorize the creation ofcauses of action or itself decide to make some element of thelaw of nations actionable for the benefit of foreigners. Theanxieties of the preconstitutional period cannot be ignoredeasily enough to think that the statute was not meant tohave a practical effect. Consider that the principal draftsman of the ATS was apparently Oliver Ellsworth,13 previously a member of the Continental Congress that hadpassed the 1781 resolution and a member of the ConnecticutLegislature that made good on that congressional request.See generally W. Brown, The Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905).Consider, too, that the First Congress was attentive enoughto the law of nations to recognize certain offenses expresslyas criminal, including the three mentioned by Blackstone.See An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes Againstthe United States, $ 8, 1 Stat. 113-114 (murder or robbery,or other capital crimes, punishable as piracy if committed onthe high seas), and $ 28, id., at 118 (violation of safe conductsand assaults against ambassadors punished by imprisonmentand fines described as "infract[ions of] the law of nations").It would have been passing strange for Ellsworth and thisvery Congress to vest federal courts expressly with jurisdiction to entertain civil causes brought by aliens alleging violations of the law of nations, but to no effect whatever untilthe Congress should take further action. There is too muchin the historical record to believe that Congress would haveenacted the ATS only to leave it lying fallow indefinitely.13 The ATS appears in Ellsworth's handwriting in the original version ofthe bill in the National Archives. Casto, Law of Nations 498, n. 169.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN720 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtThe second inference to be drawn from the history is thatCongress intended the ATS to furnish jurisdiction for a relatively modest set of actions alleging violations of the law ofnations. Uppermost in the legislative mind appears to havebeen offenses against ambassadors, see id., at 118; violationsof safe conduct were probably understood to be actionable,ibid., and individual actions arising out of prize captures andpiracy may well have also been contemplated, id., at 113-114.But the common law appears to have understood only thosethree of the hybrid variety as definite and actionable, or atany rate, to have assumed only a very limited set of claims.As Blackstone had put it, "offences against this law [of nations] are principally incident to whole states or nations,"and not individuals seeking relief in court. 4 Commentaries 68.4The sparse contemporaneous cases and legal materials referring to the ATS tend to confirm both inferences, thatsome, but few, torts in violation of the law of nations wereunderstood to be within the common law. In Bolchos v.Darrel, 3 F. Cas. 810 (No. 1,607) (SC 1795), the DistrictCourt's doubt about admiralty jurisdiction over a suit fordamages brought by a French privateer against the mortgagee of a British slave ship was assuaged by assuming thatthe ATS was a jurisdictional basis for the court's action.Nor is Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F. Cas. 942 (No. 9,895) (Pa.1793), to the contrary, a case in which the owners of a Britishship sought damages for its seizure in United States watersby a French privateer. The District Court said in dictumthat the ATS was not the proper vehicle for suit because "[i]tcannot be called a suit for a tort only, when the property, aswell as damages for the supposed trespass, are sought for."Id., at 948. But the judge gave no intimation that furtherlegislation would have been needed to give the DistrictCourt jurisdiction over a suit limited to damages.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN721Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThen there was the 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford, who was asked whether criminal prosecutionwas available against Americans who had taken part in theFrench plunder of a British slave colony in Sierra Leone. 1Op. Atty. Gen. 57. Bradford was uncertain, but he made itclear that a federal court was open for the prosecution of atort action growing out of the episode:"But there can be no doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostilityhave a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the UnitedStates; jurisdiction being expressly given to thesecourts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort only, inviolation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of the UnitedStates . . . ." Id., at 59.Although it is conceivable that Bradford (who had prosecuted in the Marbois incident, see Casto, Law of Nations 503,n. 201) assumed that there had been a violation of a treaty,1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 58, that is certainly not obvious, and itappears likely that Bradford understood the ATS to providejurisdiction over what must have amounted to common lawcauses of action.BAgainst these indications that the ATS was meant to underwrite litigation of a narrow set of common law actionsderived from the law of nations, Sosa raises two main objections. First, he claims that this conclusion makes no sensein view of the Continental Congress's 1781 recommendationto state legislatures to pass laws authorizing such suits.Sosa thinks state legislation would have been "absurd,"Reply Brief for Petitioner Sosa 5, if common law remedieshad been available. Second, Sosa juxtaposes Blackstone'streatise mentioning violations of the law of nations as occasions for criminal remedies, against the statute's innovativereference to "tort," as evidence that there was no familiar542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN722 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtset of legal actions for exercise of jurisdiction under the ATS.Neither argument is convincing.The notion that it would have been absurd for the Conti-nental Congress to recommend that States pass positive lawto duplicate remedies already available at common law restson a misunderstanding of the relationship between commonlaw and positive law in the late 18th century, when positivelaw was frequently relied upon to reinforce and give stand-ard expression to the "brooding omnipresence"14 of the common law then thought discoverable by reason. As Black-stone clarified the relation between positive law and the lawof nations, "those acts of parliament, which have from timeto time been made to enforce this universal law, or to facilitate the execution of [its] decisions, are not to be consideredas introductive of any new rule, but merely as declaratory ofthe old fundamental constitutions of the kingdom; withoutwhich it must cease to be a part of the civilized world." 4Commentaries 67. Indeed, Sosa's argument is underminedby the 1781 resolution on which he principally relies. Notwithstanding the undisputed fact (per Blackstone) that thecommon law afforded criminal law remedies for violations ofthe law of nations, the Continental Congress encouragedstate legislatures to pass criminal statutes to the same effect,and the first Congress did the same,supra, at 719.1514 See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205, 222 (1917) (Holmes,J., dissenting).15 Being consistent with the prevailing understanding of internationallaw, the 1781 resolution is sensibly understood as an act of internationalpolitics, for the recommendation was part of a program to assure the worldthat the new Republic would observe the law of nations. On the sameday it made its recommendation to state legislatures, the Continental Congress received a confidential report, detailing negotiations between American representatives and Versailles. 21 Journals of the Continental Congress 1137-1140. The King was concerned about the British capture ofthe ship Marquis de la Fayette on its way to Boston, id., at 1139, and he"expresse[d] a desire that the plan for the appointment of consuls should542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN723Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtNor are we convinced by Sosa's argument that legislationconferring a right of action is needed because Blackstonetreated international law offenses under the rubric of "publicwrongs," whereas the ATS uses a word, "tort," that was relatively uncommon in the legal vernacular of the day. It istrue that Blackstone did refer to what he deemed the threeprincipal offenses against the law of nations in the course ofdiscussing criminal sanctions, observing that it was in theinterest of sovereigns "to animadvert upon them with a be-coming severity, that the peace of the world may be maintained," 4 Commentaries 68.16 But Vattel explicitly linkedbe digested and adopted, as the Court of France wished to make it thebasis of some commercial arrangements between France and the UnitedStates," id., at 1140. The congressional resolution would not have beenall that Louis XVI wished for, but it was calculated to assure foreignpowers that Congress at least intended their concerns to be addressed inthe way they would have chosen. As a French legal treatise well knownto early American lawyers, see Helmholz, Use of the Civil Law in PostRevolutionary American Jurisprudence, 66 Tulane L. Rev. 1649 (1992), putit, "the laws ought to be written, to the end that the writing may fix thesense of the law, and determine the mind to conceive a just idea of thatwhich is established by the law, and that it not [be] left free for every oneto frame the law as he himself is pleased to understand it . . . ." 1 J.Domat, The Civil Law in its Natural Order 108 (W. Strahan transl. and L.Cushing ed. 1861). A congressional statement that common law was upto the task at hand might well have fallen short of impressing a continental readership.16 Petitioner says animadversion is "an archaic reference to the imposition of punishment." Reply Brief for Petitioner Sosa 4 (emphasis in original). That claim is somewhat exaggerated, however. To animadvertcarried the broader implication of "turn[ing] the attention officially orjudicially, tak[ing] legal cognizance of anything deserving of chastisementor censure; hence, to proceed by way of punishment or censure." 1 Oxford English Dictionary 474 (2d ed. 1989). Blackstone in fact used theterm in the context of property rights and damages. Of a man who isdisturbed in his enjoyment of "qualified property" "the law will animadvert hereon as an injury." 2 Commentaries 395. See also 9 Papers ofJames Madison 349 (R. Rutland ed. 1975) ("As yet foreign powers have notbeen rigorous in animadverting on us" for violations of the law of nations).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN724 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtthe criminal sanction for offenses against ambassadors withthe requirement that the state, "at the expense of the delinquent, give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has beenoffended in the person of his minister." Vattel 463-464.Cf. Stephens, Individuals Enforcing International Law: TheComparative and Historical Context, 52 DePaul L. Rev. 433,444 (2002) (observing that a "mixed approach to internationallaw violations, encompassing both criminal prosecution . . .and compensation to those injured through a civil suit, wouldhave been familiar to the founding generation"). The 1781resolution goes a step further in showing that a private rem-edy was thought necessary for diplomatic offenses under thelaw of nations. And the Attorney General's Letter of 1795,as well as the two early federal precedents discussing theATS, point to a prevalent assumption that Congress did notintend the ATS to sit on the shelf until some future timewhen it might enact further legislation.In sum, although the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action, the reasonable inference fromthe historical materials is that the statute was intended tohave practical effect the moment it became law. The juris-dictional grant is best read as having been enacted on theunderstanding that the common law would provide a causeof action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.IVWe think it is correct, then, to assume that the First Con-gress understood that the district courts would recognizeprivate causes of action for certain torts in violation of thelaw of nations, though we have found no basis to suspectCongress had any examples in mind beyond those torts cor-responding to Blackstone's three primary offenses: violationof safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy. We assume, too, that no development in the twocenturies from the enactment of $ 1350 to the birth of the542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN725Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtmodern line of cases beginning with Filartiga v. Pena-Irala,630 F. 2d 876 (CA2 1980), has categorically precluded federalcourts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations asan element of common law; Congress has not in any relevantway amended $ 1350 or limited civil common law power byanother statute. Still, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court shouldexercise in considering a new cause of action of this kind.Accordingly, we think courts should require any claim basedon the present-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and de-fined with a specificity comparable to the features of the18th-century paradigms we have recognized. This require-ment is fatal to Alvarez's claim.AA series of reasons argue for judicial caution when consid-ering the kinds of individual claims that might implementthe jurisdiction conferred by the early statute. First, theprevailing conception of the common law has changed since1789 in a way that counsels restraint in judicially applyinginternationally generated norms. When $ 1350 was enacted,the accepted conception was of the common law as "a tran-scendental body of law outside of any particular State butobligatory within it unless and until changed by statute."Black and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 533 (1928)(Holmes, J., dissenting). Now, however, in most cases wherea court is asked to state or formulate a common law principlein a new context, there is a general understanding that thelaw is not so much found or discovered as it is either madeor created. Holmes explained famously in 1881 that"in substance the growth of the law is legislative . . .[because t]he very considerations which judges mostrarely mention, and always with an apology, are the se-cret root from which the law draws all the juices of life.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN726 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtI mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient forthe community concerned." The Common Law 31-32(Howe ed. 1963).One need not accept the Holmesian view as far as its ultimateimplications to acknowledge that a judge deciding in relianceon an international norm will find a substantial element ofdiscretionary judgment in the decision.Second, along with, and in part driven by, that conceptualdevelopment in understanding common law has come anequally significant rethinking of the role of the federal courtsin making it.Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),was the watershed in which we denied the existence of anyfederal "general" common law, id., at 78, which largely with-drew to havens of specialty, some of them defined by expresscongressional authorization to devise a body of law directly,e. g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448(1957) (interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements);Fed. Rule Evid. 501 (evidentiary privileges in federal-question cases). Elsewhere, this Court has thought it wasin order to create federal common law rules in interstitialareas of particular federal interest.E. g., United States v.Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715, 726-727 (1979).17 Andalthough we have even assumed competence to make judicialrules of decision of particular importance to foreign rela-tions, such as the act of state doctrine, seeBanco Nacionalde Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 427 (1964), the generalpractice has been to look for legislative guidance before exer-cising innovative authority over substantive law. It wouldbe remarkable to take a more aggressive role in exercisinga jurisdiction that remained largely in shadow for much ofthe prior two centuries.17 See generally R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler'sThe Federal Courts and the Federal System, ch. 7 (5th ed. 2003); Friendly,In Praise of Erie--and of the New Federal Common Law, 39 N. Y.U. L. Rev. 383, 405-422 (1964).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN727Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThird, this Court has recently and repeatedly said that adecision to create a private right of action is one better leftto legislative judgment in the great majority of cases. Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68 (2001);Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286-287 (2001). Thecreation of a private right of action raises issues beyond themere consideration whether underlying primary conductshould be allowed or not, entailing, for example, a decisionto permit enforcement without the check imposed by prosecutorial discretion. Accordingly, even when Congress hasmade it clear by statute that a rule applies to purely domestic conduct, we are reluctant to infer intent to provide a private cause of action where the statute does not supply oneexpressly. While the absence of congressional action addressing private rights of action under an international normis more equivocal than its failure to provide such a rightwhen it creates a statute, the possible collateral consequences of making international rules privately actionableargue for judicial caution.Fourth, the subject of those collateral consequences is itself a reason for a high bar to new private causes of actionfor violating international law, for the potential implicationsfor the foreign relations of the United States of recognizingsuch causes should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and ExecutiveBranches in managing foreign affairs. It is one thing forAmerican courts to enforce constitutional limits on our ownState and Federal Governments' power, but quite another toconsider suits under rules that would go so far as to claim alimit on the power of foreign governments over their owncitizens, and to hold that a foreign government or its agenthas transgressed those limits. Cf. Sabbatino, supra, at 431-432. Yet modern international law is very much concernedwith just such questions, and apt to stimulate calls for vindicating private interests in $ 1350 cases. Since many attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN728 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtof new norms of international law would raise risks of ad-verse foreign policy consequences, they should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution. Cf. Tel-Oren v. LibyanArab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 813 (CADC 1984) (Bork, J.,concurring) (expressing doubt that $ 1350 should be read torequire "our courts [to] sit in judgment of the conduct offoreign officials in their own countries with respect to theirown citizens").The fifth reason is particularly important in light of thefirst four. We have no congressional mandate to seek outand define new and debatable violations of the law of nations,and modern indications of congressional understanding ofthe judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encour-aged greater judicial creativity. It is true that a clear mandate appears in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,106 Stat. 73, providing authority that "establish[es] an unambiguous and modern basis for" federal claims of torture andextrajudicial killing, H. R. Rep. No. 102-367, pt. 1, p. 3 (1991).But that affirmative authority is confined to specific subjectmatter, and although the legislative history includes the remark that $ 1350 should "remain intact to permit suits basedon other norms that already exist or may ripen in the futureinto rules of customary international law," id., at 4, Congressas a body has done nothing to promote such suits. Severaltimes, indeed, the Senate has expressly declined to give thefederal courts the task of interpreting and applying international human rights law, as when its ratification of the Inter-national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declared thatthe substantive provisions of the document were not self-executing. 138 Cong. Rec. 8071 (1992).BThese reasons argue for great caution in adapting the lawof nations to private rights.Justice Scalia, post, p. 739(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), concludes that caution is too hospitable, and a word is in order542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN729Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto summarize where we have come so far and to focus ourdifference with him on whether some norms of today's lawof nations may ever be recognized legitimately by federalcourts in the absence of congressional action beyond $ 1350.All Members of the Court agree that $ 1350 is only jurisdic-tional. We also agree, or at leastJustice Scalia does notdispute, post, at 739, 744, that the jurisdiction was originallyunderstood to be available to enforce a small number of in-ternational norms that a federal court could properly recognize as within the common law enforceable without furtherstatutory authority.Justice Scalia concludes, however,that two subsequent developments should be understood topreclude federal courts from recognizing any further international norms as judicially enforceable today, absent furthercongressional action. As described before, we now tend tounderstand common law not as a discoverable reflection ofuniversal reason but, in a positivistic way, as a product ofhuman choice. And we now adhere to a conception of limited judicial power first expressed in reorienting federal diversity jurisdiction, see Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.64 (1938), that federal courts have no authority to derive"general" common law.Whereas Justice Scalia sees these developments as sufficient to close the door to further independent judicial recognition of actionable international norms, other considerationspersuade us that the judicial power should be exercised onthe understanding that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping, and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today. Erie did not in terms bar any judicialrecognition of new substantive rules, no matter what the circumstances, and post-Erie understanding has identified limited enclaves in which federal courts may derive some substantive law in a common law way. For two centuries wehave affirmed that the domestic law of the United Statesrecognizes the law of nations. See, e. g., Sabbatino, 376U. S., at 423 ("[I]t is, of course, true that United States542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN730 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtcourts apply international law as a part of our own in appro-priate circumstances");18 The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S., at700 ("International law is part of our law, and must be ascer-tained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right dependingupon it are duly presented for their determination");TheNereide, 9 Cranch 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C. J.) ("[T]heCourt is bound by the law of nations which is a part of thelaw of the land"); see alsoTexas Industries, Inc. v. RadcliffMaterials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981) (recognizing that"international disputes implicating . . . our relations with foreign nations" are one of the "narrow areas" in which "federalcommon law" continues to exist). It would take some explaining to say now that federal courts must avert their gazeentirely from any international norm intended to protectindividuals.We think an attempt to justify such a position would beparticularly unconvincing in light of what we know aboutcongressional understanding bearing on this issue lying atthe intersection of the judicial and legislative powers. TheFirst Congress, which reflected the understanding of theframing generation and included some of the Framers, assumed that federal courts could properly identify some international norms as enforceable in the exercise of $ 1350 jurisdiction. We think it would be unreasonable to assume thatthe First Congress would have expected federal courts tolose all capacity to recognize enforceable international normssimply because the common law might lose some metaphysical cachet on the road to modern realism. Later Congresses18 Sabbatino itself did not directly apply international law, see 376 U. S.,at 421-423, but neither did it question the application of that law in appropriate cases, and it further endorsed the reasoning of a noted commentatorwho had argued that Erie should not preclude the continued applicationof international law in federal courts, 376 U. S., at 425 (citing Jessup, TheDoctrine of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins Applied to International Law, 33Am. J. Int'l L. 740 (1939)).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN731Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtseem to have shared our view. The position we take todayhas been assumed by some federal courts for 24 years, eversince the Second Circuit decided Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630F. 2d 876 (CA2 1980), and for practical purposes the point oftoday's disagreement has been focused since the exchangebetween Judge Edwards and Judge Bork in Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774 (CADC 1984). Congress,however, has not only expressed no disagreement with ourview of the proper exercise of the judicial power, but hasresponded to its most notable instance by enacting legislation supplementing the judicial determination in some detail.Seesupra, at 728 (discussing the Torture Victim ProtectionAct).While we agree with Justice Scalia to the point thatwe would welcome any congressional guidance in exercisingjurisdiction with such obvious potential to affect foreign rela-tions, nothing Congress has done is a reason for us to shutthe door to the law of nations entirely. It is enough to saythat Congress may do that at any time (explicitly, or implicitly by treaties or statutes that occupy the field), just as itmay modify or cancel any judicial decision so far as it restson recognizing an international norm as such.19CWe must still, however, derive a standard or set of stand-ards for assessing the particular claim Alvarez raises, and19 Our position does not, as Justice Scalia suggests, imply that everygrant of jurisdiction to a federal court carries with it an opportunity todevelop common law (so that the grant of federal-question jurisdictionwould be equally as good for our purposes as $ 1350), see post, at 745, n.Section 1350 was enacted on the congressional understanding that courtswould exercise jurisdiction by entertaining some common law claims derived from the law of nations; and we know of no reason to think thatfederal-question jurisdiction was extended subject to any comparable congressional assumption. Further, our holding today is consistent with thedivision of responsibilities between federal and state courts after Erie,see supra, at 726, 729-730, as a more expansive common law power relatedto 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 might not be.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN732 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtfor this action it suffices to look to the historical antecedents.Whatever the ultimate criteria for accepting a cause of action subject to jurisdiction under $ 1350, we are persuadedthat federal courts should not recognize private claims underfederal common law for violations of any international lawnorm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the historical paradigms familiar when$ 1350 was enacted. See, e. g., United States v. Smith, 5Wheat. 153, 163-180, n. a (1820) (illustrating the specificitywith which the law of nations defined piracy). This limitupon judicial recognition is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of the courts and judges who faced the issuebefore it reached this Court. See Filartiga, supra, at 890("[F]or purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become--like the pirate and slave trader before him--hostis humanigeneris, an enemy of all mankind"); Tel-Oren, supra, at 781(Edwards, J., concurring) (suggesting that the "limits of section 1350's reach" be defined by "a handful of heinous actions--each of which violates definable, universal and obligatory norms"); see also In re Estate of Marcos Human RightsLitigation, 25 F. 3d 1467, 1475 (CA9 1994) ("Actionable violations of international law must be of a norm that is specific, universal, and obligatory"). And the determinationwhether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a causeof action 20 should (and, indeed, inevitably must) involve anelement of judgment about the practical consequences of20 A related consideration is whether international law extends the scopeof liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued,if the defendant is a private actor such as a corporation or individual.Compare Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 791-795 (CADC1984) (Edwards, J., concurring) (insufficient consensus in 1984 that tortureby private actors violates international law), with Kadic v. Karadz*ic', 70F. 3d 232, 239-241 (CA2 1995) (sufficient consensus in 1995 that genocideby private actors violates international law).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN733Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtmaking that cause available to litigants in the federalcourts.21Thus, Alvarez's detention claim must be gauged againstthe current state of international law, looking to thosesources we have long, albeit cautiously, recognized.21 This requirement of clear definition is not meant to be the only principle limiting the availability of relief in the federal courts for violations ofcustomary international law, though it disposes of this action. For example, the European Commission argues as amicus curiae that basic principles of international law require that before asserting a claim in a foreignforum, the claimant must have exhausted any remedies available in thedomestic legal system, and perhaps in other forums such as internationalclaims tribunals. See Brief for European Commission as Amicus Curiae24, n. 54 (citing I. Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law 472-481(6th ed. 2003)); cf. Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, $ 2(b), 106 Stat.73 (exhaustion requirement). We would certainly consider this requirement in an appropriate case.Another possible limitation that we need not apply here is a policy ofcase-specific deference to the political branches. For example, there arenow pending in Federal District Court several class actions seeking damages from various corporations alleged to have participated in, or abetted,the regime of apartheid that formerly controlled South Africa. See In reSouth African Apartheid Litigation, 238 F. Supp. 2d 1379 (JPML 2002)(granting a motion to transfer the cases to the Southern District of NewYork). The Government of South Africa has said that these cases interfere with the policy embodied by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission,which "deliberately avoided a `victors' justice' approach to the crimes ofapartheid and chose instead one based on confession and absolution, informed by the principles of reconciliation, reconstruction, reparation andgoodwill." Declaration of Penuell Mpapa Maduna, Minister of Justice andConstitutional Development, Republic of South Africa, reprinted in App.to Brief for Government of Commonwealth of Australia et al. as AmiciCuriae 7a, || 3.2.1 (emphasis deleted). The United States has agreed.See Letter of William H. Taft IV, Legal Adviser, Dept. of State, to Shannen W. Coffin, Deputy Asst. Atty. Gen., Oct. 27, 2003, reprinted in id., at2a. In such cases, there is a strong argument that federal courts shouldgive serious weight to the Executive Branch's view of the case's impacton foreign policy. Cf. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677,701-702 (2004) (discussing the State Department's use of statements ofinterest in cases involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976,28 U. S.

Such works are re-sorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the speculationsof their authors concerning what the law ought to be,but for trustworthy evidence of what the law really is."The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S., at 700.To begin with, Alvarez cites two well-known internationalagreements that, despite their moral authority, have littleutility under the standard set out in this opinion. He saysthat his abduction by Sosa was an "arbitrary arrest" withinthe meaning of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(Declaration), G. A. Res. 217A (III), U. N. Doc. A/810 (1948).And he traces the rule against arbitrary arrest not only tothe Declaration, but also to article nine of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights (Covenant), Dec. 16,1966, 999 U. N. T. S. 171,22 to which the United States is aparty, and to various other conventions to which it is not.But the Declaration does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law. See Humphrey, TheUN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,in The International Protection of Human Rights 39, 50(E.

S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the Courtand " `not a treaty or international agreement . . . impos[ing]legal obligations' ").23 And, although the Covenant doesbind the United States as a matter of international law, theUnited States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itselfcreate obligations enforceable in the federal courts. Seesupra, at 728. Accordingly, Alvarez cannot say that theDeclaration and Covenant themselves establish the relevantand applicable rule of international law. He instead at-tempts to show that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law.Here, it is useful to examine Alvarez's complaint in greaterdetail. As he presently argues it, the claim does not rest onthe cross-border feature of his abduction.24 Although theDistrict Court granted relief in part on finding a violation ofinternational law in taking Alvarez across the border fromMexico to the United States, the Court of Appeals rejectedthat ground of liability for failure to identify a norm of requisite force prohibiting a forcible abduction across a border.Instead, it relied on the conclusion that the law of the UnitedStates did not authorize Alvarez's arrest, because the DEAlacked extraterritorial authority under 21 U. S. C. $ 878, andbecause Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(d)(2) limitedthe warrant for Alvarez's arrest to "the jurisdiction of theUnited States." 25 It is this position that Alvarez takes now:23 It has nevertheless had substantial indirect effect on international law.See Brownlie, supra, at 535 (calling the Declaration a "good example of aninformal prescription given legal significance by the actions of authoritative decision-makers").24 Alvarez's brief contains one footnote seeking to incorporate by reference his arguments on cross-border abductions before the Court of Appeals. Brief for Respondent Alvarez-Machain 47, n. 46. That is notenough to raise the question fairly, and we do not consider it.25 The Rule has since been moved and amended and now provides thata warrant may also be executed "anywhere else a federal statute authorizes an arrest." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4(c)(2).542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN736 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtthat his arrest was arbitrary and as such forbidden by international law not because it infringed the prerogatives ofMexico, but because no applicable law authorized it.26Alvarez thus invokes a general prohibition of "arbitrary"detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic lawof some government, regardless of the circumstances.Whether or not this is an accurate reading of the Covenant,Alvarez cites little authority that a rule so broad has thestatus of a binding customary norm today.27 He certainlycites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his broadrule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implicationswould be breathtaking. His rule would support a cause ofaction in federal court for any arrest, anywhere in the world,unauthorized by the law of the jurisdiction in which it tookplace, and would create a cause of action for any seizure ofan alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplantingthe actions under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and26 We have no occasion to decide whether Alvarez is right that 21 U. S. C.$ 878 did not authorize the arrest.27 Specifically, he relies on a survey of national constitutions, Bassiouni,Human Rights in the Context of Criminal Justice: Identifying International Procedural Protections and Equivalent Protections in National Constitutions, 3 Duke J. Comp. & Int'l L. 235, 260-261 (1993); a case from theInternational Court of Justice, United States v. Iran, 1980 I. C. J. 3, 42; andsome authority drawn from the federal courts, see Brief for RespondentAlvarez-Machain 49, n. 50. None of these suffice. The Bassiouni surveydoes show that many nations recognize a norm against arbitrary detention, but that consensus is at a high level of generality. The Iran case, inwhich the United States sought relief for the taking of its diplomatic andconsular staff as hostages, involved a different set of international normsand mentioned the problem of arbitrary detention only in passing; thedetention in that case was, moreover, far longer and harsher than Alvarez's. See 1980 I. C. J., at 42, || 91 ("detention of [United States] staff by agroup of armed militants" lasted "many months"). And the authorityfrom the federal courts, to the extent it supports Alvarez's position, reflects a more assertive view of federal judicial discretion over claims basedon customary international law than the position we take today.542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN737Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)Opinion of the CourtBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388(1971), that now provide damages remedies for such violations. It would create an action in federal court for arrestsby state officers who simply exceed their authority; and forthe violation of any limit that the law of any country mightplace on the authority of its own officers to arrest. And allof this assumes that Alvarez could establish that Sosa wasacting on behalf of a government when he made the arrest,for otherwise he would need a rule broader still.Alvarez's failure to marshal support for his proposed ruleis underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Rela-tions Law of the United States (1986), which says in its discussion of customary international human rights law that a"state violates international law if, as a matter of state policy, it practices, encourages, or condones . . . prolonged arbi-trary detention." 2id., $ 702. Although the Restatementdoes not explain its requirements of a "state policy" and of"prolonged" detention, the implication is clear. Any credi-ble invocation of a principle against arbitrary detention thatthe civilized world accepts as binding customary interna-tional law requires a factual basis beyond relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority. Even the Restate-ment's limits are only the beginning of the enquiry, becausealthough it is easy to say that some policies of prolongedarbitrary detentions are so bad that those who enforce thembecome enemies of the human race, it may be harder to saywhich policies cross that line with the certainty afforded byBlackstone's three common law offenses. In any event, thelabel would never fit the reckless policeman who botches hiswarrant, even though that same officer might pay damagesunder municipal law.E. g., Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551(2004).2828 In this action, Sosa might well have been liable under Mexican law.Alvarez asserted such a claim, but the District Court concluded that theapplicable law was the law of California, and that under California lawSosa had been privileged to make a citizen's arrest in Mexico.
