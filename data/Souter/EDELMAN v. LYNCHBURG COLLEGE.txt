The issue here is the valid-ity of an EEOC regulation permitting an otherwise timelyfiler to verify a charge after the time for filing has expired.We sustain the regulation.IOn June 6, 1997, respondent Lynchburg College denied academic tenure to petitioner Leonard Edelman, who faxed aletter to an EEOC field office on November 14, 1997, claiming "gender-based employment discrimination, exacerbatedby discrimination on the basis of . . . national origin and religion." App. 52. Edelman made no oath or affirmation.On November 26, 1997, Edelman's lawyer wrote to the fieldoffice requesting an interview with an EEOC investigatorand stating his "understanding that delay occasioned by theinterview will not compromise the filing date, which will remain as November 14, 1997." Id., at 54. An EEOC em-ployee replied to Edelman and advised him to arrange aninterview with a member of the field office. Without refer-ring to the lawyer's letter, the employee reminded Edelmanthat "a charge of discrimination must be filed within the timelimits imposed by law."Id., at 57. In Edelman's case, thefiling period was 300 days after the alleged discriminatorypractice.1After the interview, the EEOC sent Edelman a Form 5Charge of Discrimination for him to review and verify by1 A Title VII complainant generally has 180 days from the time of thealleged unlawful employment practice to file with the EEOC, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-5(e)(1) (1994 ed.), but a 300-day filing period applies if the chargingparty "institute[s] proceedings with a State or local agency with authorityto grant or seek relief " from unlawful employment practices. Ibid.; seealso EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 110 (1988).Virginia has such an agency, operating under a work-sharing agreementwith the EEOC. See Tinsley v. First Union Nat. Bank, 155 F. 3d 435,439-442 (CA4 1998).535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN110 EDELMAN v. LYNCHBURG COLLEGEOpinion of the Courtoath or affirmation. On April 15, 1998, 313 days after theJune 6, 1997, denial of tenure, the EEOC received the verified Form 5, which it forwarded to the College for response.After completing an investigation, the EEOC issued Edelman a notice of right to sue.Edelman first sued in a Virginia state court on variousstate-law claims, but later added a cause of action under TitleVII, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). The College then removedthe case to Federal District Court and moved to dismiss,claiming that Edelman's failure to file the verified Form 5with the EEOC within the applicable filing period was a barto subject-matter jurisdiction. Edelman replied that his November 1997 letter was a timely filed charge and that underan EEOC regulation, 29 CFR $ 1601.12(b) (1997),2 the verification on the Form 5 related back to the letter.The District Court found, however, that the Novemberletter was not a "charge" within the meaning of Title VIIbecause neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one,App. to Pet. for Cert. 22-24, with the consequence that therewas no timely filing to which the verification on Form 5 couldrelate back. After finding no ground for equitable tollingof the filing requirements, the District Court dismissed theTitle VII complaint and remanded the state-law claims. Id.,at 24-25.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 228 F.3d 503, 512 (CA4 2000). The majority held that the plainlanguage of the statute foreclosed the EEOC regulation2 The regulation provides in relevant part that "a charge is sufficientwhen the Commission receives from the person making the charge a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describegenerally the action or practices complained of. A charge may beamended to cure technical defects or omissions, including failure to verifythe charge, or to clarify and amplify allegations made therein. Suchamendments and amendments alleging additional acts which constituteunlawful employment practices related to or growing out of the subjectmatter of the original charge will relate back to the date the charge wasfirst received."535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN111Cite as: 535 U. S. 106 (2002)Opinion of the Courtallowing a later oath to relate back to an earlier charge.The majority reasoned that the verification and filing provisions in $ 706 of Title VII 3 were interdependent in defining"charge": "Because a charge requires verification . . . , andbecause a charge must be filed within the limitations period, . . . it follows that a charge must be verified within thelimitations period." Id., at 508.Judge Luttig concurred only in the judgment. Id., at 512-513. He said that although the majority probably had"the better interpretation" of the statute, id., at 513, itsreading of the filing and verification requirements as one wasnot compelled by the language, and the court was "bound togive deference" to the EEOC's construction, ibid. He nonetheless joined in the judgment for the District Court'sreasons.Because of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,4 wegranted certiorari, 533 U. S. 928 (2001), and now reverse.3 Section 706(b) reads in relevant part that "[w]henever a charge is filedby or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved, or by a memberof the Commission, alleging that an employer . . . has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall serve a notice of thecharge . . . on such employer . . . within ten days, and shall make aninvestigation thereof. Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Commission requires." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(b). As to filing, $ 706(e)(1) providesthat "[a] charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred andeighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred andnotice of the charge . . . shall be served upon the person against whomsuch charge is made within ten days thereafter, except that in a case ofan unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agencywith authority to grant or seek relief from such practice . . . , such chargeshall be filed . . . within three hundred days after the alleged unlawfulemployment practice occurred." $ 2000e-5(e)(1).4 Compare, e. g., 228 F. 3d 503, 509 (CA4 2000) (case below); Shempert v.Harwick Chemical Corp., 151 F. 3d 793, 796-797 (CA8 1998), with Philbinv.

LYNCHBURG COLLEGEOpinion of the CourtIIASection 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5, governs the filing of charges of discrimination with the EEOC. Section 706(b) requires "[c]harges"to "be in writing under oath or affirmation . . . contain[ing]such information and . . . in such form as the Commissionrequires." $ 2000e-5(b). Section 706(e)(1) provides that"[a] charge . . . shall be filed within one hundred and eighty[or in some cases, three hundred] days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." $ 2000e-5(e)(1).Neither provision defines "charge," which is likewise undefined elsewhere in the statute. Section 706(b) merely re-quires the verification of a charge, without saying when itmust be verified; $ 706(e)(1) provides that a charge must befiled within a given period, without indicating whether thecharge must be verified when filed. Neither provision incor-porates the other so as to give a definition by necessaryimplication.The assumption of the Court of Appeals that the two provisions must be read as one, with "charge" defined as "underoath or affirmation," was thus a structural and logical leap.Nor is the gap bridged by the rule of common sense thatstatutes are to be read as a whole, see United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984). Although reading the twoprovisions together would not be facially inconsistent, doingthat would ignore the two quite different objectives of thetiming and verification requirements, which stand in the wayof reading "charge" to subsume them both by definition.The point of the time limitation is to encourage a potentialcharging party to raise a discrimination claim before it getscert. denied, 495 U.

S. 106 (2002)Opinion of the Courtstale, for the sake of a reliable result and a speedy end toany illegal practice that proves out.5 The verification requirement has the different object of protecting employersfrom the disruption and expense of responding to a claimunless a complainant is serious enough and sure enough tosupport it by oath subject to liability for perjury.6 This object, however, demands an oath only by the time the em-ployer is obliged to respond to the charge, not at the timean employee files it with the EEOC. There is accordinglynothing plain in reading "charge" to require an oath by definition. Questionable would be the better word.BThe statute is thus open to interpretation and the regula-tion addresses a legitimate question. Before we touch onthe merits of the EEOC's position, however, two thresholdmatters about the status of the regulation can be given shortshrift. The first is whether the agency's rulemaking ex-ceeded its authority to adopt "suitable procedural regulations," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-12(a), and instead addressed a sub-stantive issue over which the EEOC has no rulemakingpower, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.244, 257 (1991);General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125,141 (1976). Although the College argues that the EEOC'sregulation "alter[s] a substantive requirement included byCongress in the statute," Brief for Respondent 32-33, thisis really nothing more than a recast of the plain languageargument; the College is merely restating the position we5 See Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 256-257 (1980)("Limitations periods, while guaranteeing the protection of the civil rightslaws to those who promptly assert their rights, also protect employersfrom the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisionsthat are long past").6 See EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U. S. 54, 76, n. 32 (1984) ("The functionof an oath is to impress upon its taker an awareness of his duty to tellthe truth").535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN114 EDELMAN v. LYNCHBURG COLLEGEOpinion of the Courtjust rejected, that Congress defined "charge" as a verifiedaccusation.The other issue insignificant in this case, however promi-nent it is in much of the litigation that goes on over agencyrulemaking, is the degree of deference owed to the regula-tion by reviewing courts. We agree with the Governmentas amicus that deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844(1984), does not necessarily require an agency's exercise ofexpress notice-and-comment rulemaking power,7 see Brieffor United States et al. as Amici Curiae 19, n. 11; we soobserved in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 230-231 (2001) ("[W]e have sometimes found reasons for Chevrondeference even when no such administrative formality wasrequired and none was afforded"). But there is no need toresolve any question of deference here. We find the EEOCrule not only a reasonable one, but the position we wouldadopt even if there were no formal rule and we were inter-preting the statute from scratch. Because we so clearlyagree with the EEOC, there is no occasion to defer and nopoint in asking what kind of deference, or how much.87 Title VII does not require the EEOC to utilize notice-and-commentprocedures. Section 713(a) of Title VII requires the procedural regulations to "be in conformity with the standards and limitations" of theAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $$ 551-559. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-12(a) (1994 ed.). And the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C.$ 553(b), excepts "rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice"from notice-and-comment procedures unless required by statute.8 We, of course, do not mean to say that the EEOC's position is the"only one permissible." See Commercial Office Products, 486 U. S., at125 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Theagency might, for example, have decided that the time to test the complainant's seriousness is before the agency expends any effort on the case,and so have required a verified complaint prior to interview. JusticeO'Connor suggests, see post, at 122 (opinion concurring in judgment),that recognizing this implies that a sphere of deference is appropriate, andso resolves the Chevron question. But not all deference is deferenceunder Chevron, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 234 (2001),535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 535 U. S. 106 (2002)Opinion of the CourtCA complaint to the EEOC starts the agency down the roadto investigation, conciliation, and enforcement, and it is nosmall thing to be called upon to respond. As we said before,the verification provision is meant to provide some degree ofinsurance against catchpenny claims of disgruntled, but notnecessarily aggrieved, employees. In requiring the oath oraffirmation, however, Congress presumably did not mean toaffect the nature of Title VII as "a remedial scheme in whichlaypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate theprocess." EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486U. S. 107, 124 (1988); Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U. S. 522, 527(1972). Construing $ 706 to permit the relation back of anoath omitted from an original filing ensures that the lay complainant, who may not know enough to verify on filing, willnot risk forfeiting his rights inadvertently. At the sametime, the EEOC looks out for the employer's interest byrefusing to call for any response to an otherwise sufficientcomplaint until the verification has been supplied.9We would be hard pressed to take issue with the EEOC'sposition after deciding Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757and there is no need to resolve deference issues when there is no needfor deference.9 The general practice of EEOC staff members is to prepare a formalcharge of discrimination for the complainant to review and to verify, oncethe allegations have been clarified. See Brief for United States et al. asAmici Curiae 24. The complainant must submit a verified charge beforethe agency will require a response from the employer. See Brief forUnited States et al. as Amici Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 16.Respondent argues that the employer will be prejudiced by these procedures because "there would be no deadline for verifying a charge." Brieffor Respondent 34, n. 26. But this is not our case, which simply challenges relation back per se, and our understanding is that the EEOC'sstandard practice is to caution complainants that if they fail to follow upon their initial unverified charge, the EEOC will not proceed further withthe complaint. See App. 57; Brief for United States et al. as AmiciCuriae on Pet. for Cert. 17.535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN116 EDELMAN v. LYNCHBURG COLLEGEOpinion of the Court(2001), last Term. In that case, we considered whether theFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 signature requiremententailed the dismissal of a notice of appeal that was timelyfiled in the district court but was not signed within the filingperiod. We held that while the timing and content require-ments for the notice of appeal were "jurisdictional in nature," nothing prevented later cure of the signature defect,532 U. S., at 765. There is no reason to think that relationback of the oath here is any less reasonable than relationback of the signature inBecker. Both are aimed at stem-ming the urge to litigate irresponsibly, and if relation backis a good rule for courts of law, it would be passing strangeto call it bad for an administrative agency.10 In fact, itwould be passing strange to disagree with the EEOC evenwithout Becker, for a long history of practice with oath requirements supports the relation-back cure.Where a statute or supplemental rule requires an oath,11courts have shown a high degree of consistency in acceptinglater verification as reaching back to an earlier, unverifiedfiling.12 This background law not only persuades by its reg10 We also note that Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedurepermits the relation back of amendments to pleadings under specifiedcircumstances.11 See, e. g., Rule C(6) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiraltyand Maritime Claims ("[A] person who asserts an interest in or rightagainst the property that is the subject of the [civil forfeiture] action mustfile a verified statement identifying the interest or right").12 See, e. g., United States v.

The Senator expressed his view that the amendment preserved what he believed to bean existing requirement under the 1964 Act that "charges are to be filedand made under oath in writing." Ibid. This understanding was neitherconfirmed nor denied, but Senator Williams, the bill's floor manager, suggested that rather than the "one coverall, blanket" definition proposed bySenator Allen, the oath requirement could be included at the beginning of535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN118 EDELMAN v.

Ibid. So modified, the amendment was adopted by voice voteand enacted into law.Besides refining the language of $ 706 of Title VII, the 1972 amendmentsextended the basic time period for filing a charge with the EEOC from90 to 180 days, and from 210 to 300 days in deferral States. Pub. L.92-261, 86 Stat. 104. Congress also added a requirement that the EEOCnotify employers within 10 days of receiving a filed charge. Ibid.

Brief for Respondent 24. We are asked, in other words, toconclude that Congress lengthened the time for filing charges only because Congress, at the same time, required that a charge necessarily beverified when first filed. The evidence for such a quid pro quo is, however, equivocal.16 See, e. g., Blue Bell Boots, Inc. v. EEOC, 418 F. 2d 355, 357 (CA6 1969);Georgia Power Co. v.
