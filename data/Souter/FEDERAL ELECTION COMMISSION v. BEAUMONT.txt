Since 1907, federal law has barred corporations from contributing directly to candidates for federal office. We holdthat applying the prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment.IThe current statute makes it "unlawful . . . for any corporation whatever . . . to make a contribution or expenditure inconnection with" certain federal elections, 90 Stat. 490, asrenumbered and amended, 2 U. S. C. $ 441b(a), "contributionor expenditure" each being defined to include "anything ofvalue," $ 441b(b)(2). The prohibition does not, however, forbid "the establishment, administration, and solicitation ofcontributions to a separate segregated fund to be utilized forpolitical purposes." $ 441b(b)(2)(C); see $ 431(4)(B). Such aPAC (so called after the political action committee that runsit) may be wholly controlled by the sponsoring corporation,whose employees and stockholders or members generallymay be solicited for contributions. See $$ 441b(b)(4)(B)-(C);Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to WorkComm., 459 U. S. 197, 200, n. 4 (1982). While federal lawrequires PACs to register and disclose their activities,$$ 432-434; see Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 253-254 (1986),the law leaves them free to make contributions as well asother expenditures in connection with federal elections,$ 441b(b)(2)(C).Respondents are a corporation known as North CarolinaRight to Life, Inc., three of its officers, and a North Carolinavoter (here, together, NCRL), who have sued the FederalElection Commission, the independent agency set up to"administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulatepolicy with respect to" the federal electoral laws. $ 437c539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN150 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

NCRL challenges the constitutionality of $ 441b andthe FEC's regulations implementing that section, 11 CFR$$ 114.2(b), 114.10 (2003), but only so far as they applyto NCRL. The corporation is organized under the laws ofNorth Carolina to provide counseling to pregnant womenand to urge alternatives to abortion, and as a nonprofitadvocacy corporation it is exempted from federal taxationby $ 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C.$ 501(c)(4).1 It has no shareholders and, although it receivessome donations from traditional business corporations, it is"overwhelmingly funded by private contributions from indi-viduals." App. 14. NCRL has made contributions and expenditures in connection with state elections, but not federal,owing to 2 U. S. C. $ 441b. Instead, it has established a PAC,the North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., Political Action Com-mittee, which has contributed to federal candidates. SeeNorth Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Bartlett, 168 F. 3d 705,709 (CA4 1999), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 1153 (2000).The District Court granted summary judgment to NCRLand held $ 441b unconstitutional as applied to the corporation, both as to direct contributions and independent expend-itures. 137 F. Supp. 2d 648 (EDNC 2000). A divided Courtof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, 278 F. 3d 261(2002), relying primarily on Massachusetts Citizens for Life,in which this Court held it unconstitutional to apply the stat-ute to independent expenditures by Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, Inc., a nonprofit advocacy corporation in some re1 Section 501(c)(4)(A) grants exemption to "[c]ivic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotionof social welfare, . . . the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively tocharitable, educational, or recreational purposes."

The Court of Appeals ruled, first, thatthe prohibition on independent expenditures may not beapplied to NCRL. Although the panel acknowledged thatMassachusetts Citizens for Life, unlike NCRL, had a formalpolicy against accepting corporate donations, see Massachu-setts Citizens for Life, supra, at 263-264 (describing this feature of the organization as "essential to our holding"), it nev-ertheless treated NCRL as materially indistinguishable fromMassachusetts Citizens for Life.To the point for present purposes, the Court of Appealswent on to hold the ban on direct contributions likewise un-constitutional as applied to NCRL. While the majority ofthe divided court recognized that regulation of campaigncontributions has received greater deference under FirstAmendment cases than regulation of independent expendi-tures, 278 F. 3d, at 274 (citingNixon v. Shrink MissouriGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 386-388 (2000)), it held theban on direct contributions unjustified as applied to "[Massachusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporations," which itthought "pose[d] no risk of `unfair deployment of wealth forpolitical purposes.' " 278 F. 3d, at 275 (quoting Massachu-setts Citizens for Life, supra, at 259). The Court of Appealsreasoned that "[t]he rationale utilized by the Court in [Mas-sachusetts Citizens for Life] to declare prohibitions on independent expenditures unconstitutional as applied to [the ad-vocacy corporation involved there] is equally applicable inthe context of direct contributions." 278 F. 3d, at 275.Judge Gregory dissented from the others on this point, sincehe saw no way to square their conclusion with this Court'sreasoning in National Right to Work. 278 F. 3d, at 282.After the Fourth Circuit divided 7 to 4 in denying rehear-ing en banc, the FEC petitioned for certiorari solely as tothe constitutionality of the ban on direct contributions.2 Be2 We thus have no occasion to say whether the Court of Appeals correctly held NCRL entitled to the so-called "Massachusetts Citizens forLife exception" to the statute's ban on independent expenditures.539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN152 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

We now reverse.IIAAny attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporatepolitical contributions goes against the current of a centuryof congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially"deleterious influences on federal elections," which we havecanvassed a number of times before. United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 585 (1957); see id., at 570-584;see also National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 208-209; Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 402-412 (1972); UnitedStates v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 113-115 (1948). The currentlaw grew out of a "popular feeling" in the late 19th century"that aggregated capital unduly influenced politics, an influence not stopping short of corruption." Automobile Workers, supra, at 570. A demand for congressional action gathered force in the campaign of 1904, which made a nationalissue of the political leverage exerted through corporate contributions, and after the election and new revelations of corporate political overreaching, President Theodore Rooseveltmade banning corporate political contributions a legislativepriority. R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts: TheMaking of Federal Campaign Finance Law 1-8 (1988); seeAutomobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 571-575. Although somecongressional proposals would have "prohibited political contributions by [only] certain classes of corporations," id., at573, the momentum was "for elections `free from the powerof money,' " id., at 575 (citation omitted), and Congress actedon the President's call for an outright ban, not with halfmeasures, but with the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864.This "first federal campaign finance law," Mutch, supra, at539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN153Cite as: 539 U. S. 146 (2003)Opinion of the Courtxvii, banned "any corporation whatever" from making"a money contribution in connection with" federal elections,34 Stat. 864-865.Since 1907, there has been continual congressional attention to corporate political activity, sometimes resulting in re-finement of the law, sometimes in overhaul.3 One feature,however, has stayed intact throughout this "careful legisla-tive adjustment of the federal electoral laws,"NationalRight to Work, supra, at 209, and much of the periodicamendment was meant to strengthen the original, core pro-hibition on direct corporate contributions. The ForeignCorrupt Practices Act of 1925, for example, broadened theban on contributions to include "anything of value," andcriminalized the act of receiving a contribution to match thecriminality of making one. Ch. 368, $$ 302, 313, 43 Stat.1070, 1074. So, in another instance, the 1947 Labor Manage-ment Relations Act drew labor unions permanently withinthe law's reach and invigorated the earlier prohibition to in-clude "expenditure[s]" as well. Ch. 120, $ 304, 61 Stat. 159;see Pipefitters, supra, at 402.Today, as in 1907, the law focuses on the "special characteristics of the corporate structure" that threaten the integrityof the political process.National Right to Work, 459 U. S.,at 209; see id., at 207; see also Austin v. Michigan Chamberof Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 658-659 (1990); MassachusettsCitizens for Life, 479 U. S., at 257-258; Federal ElectionComm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,470 U. S. 480, 500-501 (1985). As we explained it in Austin,3 See, e. g., Act of June 25, 1910, ch. 392, 36 Stat. 822; Act of Aug. 19,1911, ch. 33, 37 Stat. 25; Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, ch. 368, 43Stat. 1070; Act of July 19, 1940 (Hatch Act), 54 Stat. 767; War Labor Disputes Act, 1943, ch. 144, $ 9, 57 Stat. 167; Labor Management RelationsAct, 1947, $ 304, 61 Stat. 159; Act of Oct. 31, 1951, $ 21, 65 Stat. 718; FederalElection Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3; FECA Amendmentsof 1974, 88 Stat. 1263; FECA Amendments of 1976, 90 Stat. 475; FECAAmendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1339; Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of2002, 116 Stat. 81.539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN154 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. BEAUMONTOpinion of the Court"State law grants corporations special advantages--suchas limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets--that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploytheir resources in ways that maximize the return ontheir shareholders' investments. These state-createdadvantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also permit themto use `resources amassed in the economic marketplace'to obtain `an unfair advantage in the political marketplace.' " 494 U. S., at 658-659 (quoting MassachusettsCitizens for Life, supra, at 257).Hence, the public interest in "restrict[ing] the influence ofpolitical war chests funneled through the corporate form."National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra, at500-501; see National Right to Work, supra, at 207 ("[S]ubstantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form of organizationshould not be converted into political `war chests' whichcould be used to incur political debts from legislators").As these excerpts from recent opinions show, not only hasthe original ban on direct corporate contributions endured,but so have the original rationales for the law. In barring corporate earnings from conversion into political "warchests," the ban was and is intended to "preven[t] corruptionor the appearance of corruption." National ConservativePolitical Action Comm., supra, at 496-497; see also FirstNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 788, n. 26(1978) ("The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption] has never been doubted"). But the banhas always done further duty in protecting "the individualswho have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates from having thatmoney used to support political candidates to whom theymay be opposed." National Right to Work, supra, at 208;539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN155Cite as: 539 U. S. 146 (2003)Opinion of the Courtsee CIO, 335 U. S., at 113; see also Austin, supra, at 673-678(Brennan, J., concurring).Quite aside from war-chest corruption and the interests ofcontributors and owners, however, another reason for regulating corporate electoral involvement has emerged with re-strictions on individual contributions, and recent cases haverecognized that restricting contributions by various organizations hedges against their use as conduits for "circum-vention of [valid] contribution limits."Federal ElectionComm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,533 U. S. 431, 456, and n. 18 (2001); seeAustin, supra, at 664.To the degree that a corporation could contribute to politicalcandidates, the individuals "who created it, who own it, orwhom it employs," Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.King, 533 U. S. 158, 163 (2001), could exceed the boundsimposed on their own contributions by diverting moneythrough the corporation, cf. Colorado Republican, 533 U. S.,at 446-447. As we said on the subject of limiting coordinated expenditures by political parties, experience "demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the limitsof the current law, and it shows beyond serious doubt howcontribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced." Id., at 457.In sum, our cases on campaign finance regulation represent respect for the "legislative judgment that the specialcharacteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation." National Right to Work, supra,at 209-210. And we have understood that such deferenceto legislative choice is warranted particularly when Congressregulates campaign contributions, carrying as they do a plainthreat to political integrity and a plain warrant to counterthe appearance and reality of corruption and the misuse ofcorporate advantages. See, e. g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.1, 26-28, 47 (1976) (per curiam). As we said in ColoradoRepublican, "limits on contributions are more clearly justified by a link to political corruption than limits on other539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN156 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. BEAUMONTOpinion of the Courtkinds of . . . political spending are (corruption being under-stood not only as quid pro quo agreements, but also as undueinfluence on an officeholder's judgment, and the appearanceof such influence)." 533 U. S., at 440-441 (citation omitted).BThat historical prologue would discourage any broadsideattack on corporate campaign finance regulation or regulation of corporate contributions, and NCRL accordingly ques-tions $ 441b only to the extent the law places nonprofit advocacy corporations like itself under the general ban on directcontributions. But not even this more focused challenge canclaim a blank slate, for Judge Gregory rightly said in hisdissent that our explanation inNational Right to Work allbut decided the issue against NCRL's position.National Right to Work addressed the provision of $ 441brestricting a nonstock corporation to its membership whensoliciting contributions to its PAC,4 and we consideredwhether a nonprofit advocacy corporation without membersof the usual sort could be held to violate the law by solicitinga donation to its PAC from any individual who had at onetime contributed to the corporation. See 459 U. S., at 199-200. We sustained the FEC's position that a fund drive asbroad as this went beyond the solicitation of "members" per-mitted by $ 441b, and we invoked the history distilled abovein holding that the statutory restriction was no infringementon those First Amendment associational rights closely akinto speech. Id., at 206-209. We concluded that the congres-sional judgment to regulate corporate political involvement4 Section 441b(b)(4)(A) bars a corporation from soliciting contributionsto a PAC established by the corporation, except from stockholders or otherspecified categories of persons. Section 441b(b)(4)(C), the specific provision at issue in National Right to Work, provides, in relevant part, that$ 441b(b)(4)(A) "shall not prevent a . . . corporation without capital stock. . . from soliciting contributions to [a PAC established by the corporation]from members of such . . . corporation."539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN157Cite as: 539 U. S. 146 (2003)Opinion of the Court"warrants considerable deference" and "reflects a permissi-ble assessment of the dangers posed by [corporations] to theelectoral process." Id., at 207-211.It would be hard to read our conclusion inNational Rightto Work, that the PAC solicitation restrictions were constitu-tional, except on the practical understanding that the corporation's capacity to make contributions was legitimately limited to indirect donations within the scope allowed to PACs.See,e. g., id., at 208 (reviewing both "the statutory prohibitions and exceptions"). In fact, we specifically rejected theargument made here, that deference to congressional judgments about proper limits on corporate contributions turnson details of corporate form or the affluence of particularcorporations. In the same breath, we remarked on thebroad applicability of $ 441b to "corporations and laborunions without great financial resources, as well as thosemore fortunately situated," and made a point of refusing to"second-guess a legislative determination as to the need forprophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared."Id., at 210.Later cases have repeatedly acknowledged, without questioning, the reading of National Right to Work as generallyapproving the $ 441b prohibition on direct contributions,even by nonprofit corporations "without great financial resources." Ibid. In National Conservative Political Action Committee, for example, we not only spoke of NationalRight to Work as consistent with "the well-established constitutional validity of legislative regulation of corporate contributions to candidates for public office," but went on to reaffirm that the Court in that case had "rightly concluded thatCongress might include, along with labor unions and corporations traditionally prohibited from making contributions topolitical candidates, membership corporations, though contributions by the latter might not exhibit all of the evil thatcontributions by traditional economically organized corporations exhibit." 470 U. S., at 495, 500; see id., at 500 (describ539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN158 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. BEAUMONTOpinion of the Courting National Right to Work as giving "proper deference toa congressional determination of the need for a prophylacticrule"). Relying again on National Right to Work, we madea similar point inAustin when we sustained Michigan's banon direct corporate contributions, even though the ban "in-clude[d] within its scope closely held corporations that donot possess vast reservoirs of capital." 494 U. S., at 661."Although some closely held corporations, just as somepublicly held ones, may not have accumulated significantamounts of wealth, they receive from the State the specialbenefits conferred by the corporate structure and presentthe potential for distorting the political process. This potential for distortion justifies [the state law's] general applicability to all corporations." Ibid.But National Right to Work does not stand alone in itsbearing on the issue here, and equal significance must beaccorded to Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the very caseupon which NCRL and the Court of Appeals have placedprincipal reliance. There, we held the prohibition on independent expenditures under $ 441b unconstitutional asapplied to a nonprofit advocacy corporation. While themajority explained generally that the "potential for unfairdeployment of wealth for political purposes" fell short of justifying a ban on expenditures by groups like MassachusettsCitizens for Life that "do not pose that danger of corruption," the majority's response to the dissent pointed to a different resolution of the present case. 479 U. S., at 259.The Chief Justice's dissenting opinion noted that Massachusetts Citizens for Life "was not unlike" the corporationat issue in National Right to Work, which he read as supporting the ban on independent expenditures. 479 U. S., at269. Without disagreeing about the similarity of the twoorganizations, the majority nonetheless distinguished National Right to Work on the ground of its addressing regulation of contributions, not expenditures. See 479 U. S., at259-260 ("[R]estrictions on contributions require less com539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN159Cite as: 539 U.

"In light of the historical role of contributions in thecorruption of the electoral process, the need for a broad pro-phylactic rule [against contributions] was thus sufficient in[National Right to Work]." Id., at 260.CThe upshot is that, although we have never squarely heldagainst NCRL's position here, we could not hold for it without recasting our understanding of the risks of harm posedby corporate political contributions, of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent deferenceowed to legislative judgments on what to do about them.NCRL's efforts, however, fail to unsettle existing law on anyof these points.First, NCRL argues that on a class-wide basis "[Massa-chusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporations pose no potential of threat to the political system," so that the governmen-tal interest in combating corruption is as weak as the Courtheld it to be in relation to the particular corporation consid-ered inMassachusetts Citizens for Life. Brief for Re-spondents 19. But this generalization does not hold up.For present purposes, we will assume advocacy corporationsare generally different from traditional business corporations in the improbability that contributions they mightmake would end up supporting causes that some of theirmembers would not approve. See Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, supra, at 260-262.5 But concern about the corrupt5 That said, this concern is not wholly inapplicable to advocacy corporations, as "persons may desire that an organization use their contributionsto further a certain cause, but may not want the organization to use theirmoney to urge support for or opposition to political candidates solely onthe basis of that cause." Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U. S., at261. In any event, we have never intimated that the risk of corruptionalone is insufficient to support regulation of political contributions. See,e. g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 658-659(1990); Federal Election Comm'n v.

BEAUMONTOpinion of the Courting potential underlying the corporate ban may indeed beimplicated by advocacy corporations. They, like their forprofit counterparts, benefit from significant "state-createdadvantages," Austin, supra, at 659, and may well be able toamass substantial "political `war chests,' " National Right toWork, 459 U. S., at 207. Not all corporations that qualifyfor favorable tax treatment under $ 501(c)(4) of the InternalRevenue Code lack substantial resources, and the categorycovers some of the Nation's most politically powerful organi-zations, including the AARP, the National Rifle Association,and the Sierra Club.6 Nonprofit advocacy corporations are,moreover, no less susceptible than traditional business companies to misuse as conduits for circumventing the contribu-tion limits imposed on individuals. Cf.Austin, supra, at 664(noting that a nonprofit corporation is capable of "serv[ing] as a conduit for corporate political spending").7U. S. 197, 208 (1982); cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528U. S. 377, 388-389 (2000).6 See http://www.aarp.org/press/disclosure.html (as visited June 12, 2003)(available in Clerk of Court's case file) (AARP); http://www.give.org/reports/index.asp (as visited June 12, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court'scase file) (National Rifle Association and Sierra Club). These examplesanswer NCRL's argument that the Massachusetts Citizens for Life exception is "self-limiting." See Brief for Respondents 27 ("If [a MassachusettsCitizens for Life]-type corporation begins generating or receiving substantial business income or business corporation contributions, by definition, itautomatically is no longer [a Massachusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporation" (citing Federal Election Comm'n v.

Brief forRespondents 14-16. This argument, however, overlooks thebasic premise we have followed in setting First Amendmentstandards for reviewing political financial restrictions: thelevel of scrutiny is based on the importance of the "politicalactivity at issue" to effective speech or political association.Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U. S., at 259; see Colo-rado Republican, 533 U. S., at 440-442, and nn. 6-7; Nixon,528 U. S., at 386-388. Going back to Buckley v. Valeo, 424U. S. 1 (1976), restrictions on political contributions havebeen treated as merely "marginal" speech restrictions sub-ject to relatively complaisant review under the First Amendment, because contributions lie closer to the edges than tothe core of political expression. See Colorado Republican,supra, at 440.8 "While contributions may result in politicalexpression if spent by a candidate or an association . . . , thetransformation of contributions into political debate involvesments of $ 434(b)(3)(A)). Brief for Respondents 31. We rejected thisprecise argument, however, in Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431 (2001), where we concluded that it "ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directlycombating circumvention under actual political conditions." Id., at 462."The earmarking provision . . . would reach only the most clumsy attemptsto pass contributions through to candidates. To treat the earmarkingprovision as the outer limit of acceptable tailoring would disarm any serious effort to limit [circumvention]." Ibid.8 Within the realm of contributions generally, corporate contributionsare furthest from the core of political expression, since corporations' FirstAmendment speech and association interests are derived largely fromthose of their members, see, e. g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,357 U. S. 449, 458-459 (1958), and of the public in receiving information,see, e. g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 777 (1978).A ban on direct corporate contributions leaves individual members of corporations free to make their own contributions, and deprives the public oflittle or no material information.539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN162 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

This is the reason that instead of requiringcontribution regulations to be narrowly tailored to serve acompelling governmental interest, "a contribution limit involving `significant interference' with associational rights"passes muster if it satisfies the lesser demand of being" `closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest.' "Nixon, supra, at 387-388 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25);cf.Austin, 494 U. S., at 657; Buckley, supra, at 44-45.9Indeed, this recognition that degree of scrutiny turns onthe nature of the activity regulated is the only practical wayto square two leading cases: National Right to Work ap-proved strict solicitation limits on a PAC organized to makecontributions, see 459 U. S., at 201-202, whereas Massachusetts Citizens for Life applied a compelling interest test toinvalidate the ban on an advocacy corporation's expendituresin light of PAC regulatory burdens, see 479 U. S., at 252-255;see also id., at 265-266 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Each caseinvolved $ 441b, after all, and the same "ban" on the samecorporate "sources" of political activity applied in both cases.It is not that the difference between a ban and a limit isto be ignored; it is just that the time to consider it is whenapplying scrutiny at the level selected, not in selecting thestandard of review itself. But even when NCRL urges precisely that, and asserts that $ 441b is not sufficiently "closelydrawn," the claim still rests on a false premise, for NCRL issimply wrong in characterizing $ 441b as a complete ban.As we have said before, the section "permits some participation of unions and corporations in the federal electoral proc9 Judicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we dealwith a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchangedthroughout a century of "careful legislative adjustment."

National Right to Work, supra, at201; see also Austin, supra, at 660; Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, supra, at 252. The PAC option allows corporatepolitical participation without the temptation to use corpo-rate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds withthe sentiments of some shareholders or members, and it letsthe Government regulate campaign activity through registration and disclosure, see $$ 432-434, without jeopardizingthe associational rights of advocacy organizations' members,see NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 462(1958) (holding that "[c]ompelled disclosure of membershipin an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs"may violate the First Amendment).NCRL cannot prevail, then, simply by arguing that a banon an advocacy corporation's direct contributions is bad tailoring. NCRL would have to demonstrate that the law vio-lated the First Amendment in allowing contributions to bemade only through its PAC and subject to a PAC's adminis-trative burdens. But a unanimous Court in National Rightto Work did not think the regulatory burdens on PACs, in-cluding restrictions on their ability to solicit funds, rendereda PAC unconstitutional as an advocacy corporation's soleavenue for making political contributions. See 459 U. S., at201-202. There is no reason to think the burden on advo-cacy corporations is any greater today, or to reach a differentconclusion here. IIIThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
