The question is whether a tariff classification ruling by theUnited States Customs Service deserves judicial deference.The Federal Circuit rejected Customs's invocation of Chev-ron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837 (1984), in support of such a ruling, to which itgave no deference. We agree that a tariff classification hasno claim to judicial deference under Chevron, there being noindication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry theforce of law, but we hold that under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,323 U. S. 134 (1944), the ruling is eligible to claim respectaccording to its persuasiveness.IAImports are taxed under the Harmonized Tariff Scheduleof the United States (HTSUS), 19 U. S.

HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see also App. toPet. for Cert. 46a.Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated dayplanners under the "other" HTSUS subheading. In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issueda Headquarters ruling letter classifying Mead's day plannersas "Diaries . . . , bound" subject to tariff under subheading4820.10.20. That letter was short on explanation, App. toBrief in Opposition 4a-6a, but after Mead's protest, CustomsHeadquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned butnever published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet.for Cert. 28a-47a. This letter considered two definitions of"diary" from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past day's events, the second a bookincluding " `printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings;also . . . calendars . . . .' " Id., at 33a-34a (quoting OxfordEnglish Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)). Customs concluded that "diary" was not confined to the first, in partbecause the broader definition reflects commercial usageand hence the "commercial identity of these items in themarketplace." App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. As for the definition of "bound," Customs concluded that HTSUS was notreferring to "bookbinding," but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description andCoding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, whichspoke of binding by " `reinforcements or fittings of metal,plastics, etc.' " Id., at 45a.Customs rejected Mead's further protest of the secondHeadquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in theCourt of International Trade (CIT). The CIT granted theGovernment's motion for summary judgment, adopting Customs's reasoning without saying anything about deference.17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).Mead then went to the United States Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit. While the case was pending therethis Court decided United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG226 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.Opinion of the CourtU. S. 380 (1999), holding that Customs regulations receivethe deference described inChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Theappeals court requested briefing on the impact ofHaggar,and the Government argued that classification rulings, likeCustoms regulations, deserveChevron deference.The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and heldthat Customs classification rulings should not get Chevrondeference, owing to differences from the regulations at issuein Haggar. Rulings are not preceded by notice and com-ment as under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5U. S. C. $ 553, they "do not carry the force of law and are not,like regulations, intended to clarify the rights and obligations of importers beyond the specific case under review."185 F. 3d, at 1307. The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker Chevron claim even than InternalRevenue Service interpretive rulings, to which that courtgives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue from many locations and need not be published.185 F. 3d, at 1307-1308.The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference atall to the ruling classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agency's reasoning as to both "diary" and "bound."It thought that planners were not diaries because they hadno space for "relatively extensive notations about events,observations, feelings, or thoughts" in the past. Id., at1310. And it concluded that diaries "bound" in subheading4810.10.20 presupposed "unbound" diaries, such that treatingring-fastened diaries as "bound" would leave the "unbounddiary" an empty category. Id., at 1311.We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1202 (2000), in order toconsider the limits of Chevron deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute. We hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provisionqualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG227Cite as: 533 U. S. 218 (2001)Opinion of the Courtrules carrying the force of law, and that the agency inter-pretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority. Delegation of such authority maybe shown in a variety of ways, as by an agency's power toengage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressionalintent. The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify,although the possibility that it deserves some deferenceunder Skidmore leads us to vacate and remand.IIAWhen Congress has "explicitly left a gap for an agency tofill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agencyto elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,"Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843-844, and any ensuing regulationis binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary tothe statute.6 See id., at 844; United States v. Morton, 467U. S. 822, 834 (1984); APA, 5 U. S. C. $$ 706(2)(A), (D). Butwhether or not they enjoy any express delegation of authority on a particular question, agencies charged with applyinga statute necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices,and while not all of those choices bind judges to followthem, they certainly may influence courts facing questionsthe agencies have already answered. "[T]he well-reasonedviews of the agencies implementing a statute `constitute abody of experience and informed judgment to which courtsand litigants may properly resort for guidance,' "Bragdon v.Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 642 (1998) (quoting Skidmore, 323 U.

S. 555,565 (1980); Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, 437 U. S.443, 450 (1978). The fair measure of deference to an agencyadministering its own statute has been understood to varywith circumstances, and courts have looked to the degreeof the agency's care,7 its consistency,8 formality,9 and relative expertness,10 and to the persuasiveness of the agency'sposition, seeSkidmore, supra, at 139-140. The approachhas produced a spectrum of judicial responses, from greatrespect at one end, see, e. g., Aluminum Co. of America v.Central Lincoln Peoples' Util. Dist., 467 U. S. 380, 389-390(1984) (" `substantial deference' " to administrative construc-tion), to near indifference at the other, see, e. g., Bowen v.Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212-213 (1988)(interpretation advanced for the first time in a litigationbrief). Justice Jackson summed things up in Skidmore v.Swift & Co.:"The weight [accorded to an administrative] judgmentin a particular case will depend upon the thoroughnessevident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control." 323 U.

S. 218 (2001)Opinion of the CourtSince 1984, we have identified a category of interpretivechoices distinguished by an additional reason for judicialdeference. This Court in Chevron recognized that Congressnot only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that "[s]ometimes the legislative dele-gation to an agency on a particular question is implicit."467 U. S., at 844. Congress, that is, may not have expresslydelegated authority or responsibility to implement a particu-lar provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still be apparent from the agency's generally conferred authority andother statutory circumstances that Congress would expectthe agency to be able to speak with the force of law when itaddresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in theenacted law, even one about which "Congress did not actually have an intent" as to a particular result. Id., at 845.When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, areviewing court has no business rejecting an agency's exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agency'schosen resolution seems unwise, see id., at 845-846, but isobliged to accept the agency's position if Congress has notpreviously spoken to the point at issue and the agency's interpretation is reasonable, see id., at 842-845; cf. 5 U. S. C.$ 706(2) (a reviewing court shall set aside agency action,findings, and conclusions found to be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordancewith law").We have recognized a very good indicator of delegationmeriting Chevron treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for whichdeference is claimed. See, e. g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 257 (1991) (no Chevron deferenceto agency guideline where congressional delegation didnot include the power to " `promulgate rules or regulations' "(quoting General Elec. Co. v.

S. 576,596-597 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (where it is in doubtthat Congress actually intended to delegate particular interpretive authority to an agency, Chevron is "inapplicable").It is fair to assume generally that Congress contemplatesadministrative action with the effect of law when it provides for a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should under-lie a pronouncement of such force.11 Cf. Smiley v. Citibank(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741 (1996) (APA noticeand comment "designed to assure due deliberation"). Thus,the overwhelming number of our cases applying Chevrondeference have reviewed the fruits of notice-and-commentrulemaking or formal adjudication.12 That said, and as sig11 See Merrill & Hickman, Chevron's Domain, 89 Geo. L. J. 833, 872 (2001)("[I]f Chevron rests on a presumption about congressional intent, thenChevron should apply only where Congress would want Chevron to apply.In delineating the types of delegations of agency authority that triggerChevron deference, it is therefore important to determine whether aplausible case can be made that Congress would want such a delegation tomean that agencies enjoy primary interpretational authority").12 For rulemaking cases, see, e. g., Shalala v.

MEAD CORP.Opinion of the Courttion rulings with the force of law. We are not, of course,here making any global statement about Customs's authority, for it is true that the general rulemaking power con-ferred on Customs, see 19 U. S. C. $ 1624, authorizes someregulation with the force of law, or "legal norms," as we putit in Haggar, 526 U. S., at 391.14 It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitlyauthorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of "regulationsestablishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulingsprior to the entry of the merchandise concerned," 19 U. S. C.$ 1502(a).15 The reference to binding classifications does not,however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that wouldnaturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once thegoods classified are admitted into this country. And thoughthe statute's direction to disseminate "information" neces-sary to "secure" uniformity,ibid., seems to assume that aruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedentialvalue alone does not add up to Chevron entitlement; inter-pretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, seeStrauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463,1472-1473 (1992), and they enjoy noChevron status as aclass. In any event, any precedential claim of a classificationruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independentreview of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 28 U. S.

It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with theChevron regime.16It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itselfany indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmakingpretense in mind when it undertook to make classificationslike these. Customs does not generally engage in noticeand-comment practice when issuing them, and their treat-ment by the agency makes it clear that a letter's bindingcharacter as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customshas regarded a classification as conclusive only as betweenitself and the importer to whom it was issued, 19 CFR$ 177.9(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has givenadvance notice of intended change, $$ 177.9(a), (c). Otherimporters are in fact warned against assuming any right ofdetrimental reliance. $ 177.9(c).Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is toignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committeeon the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&R,Exhs. 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBABrief 20a-21a)). Any suggestion that rulings intended tohave the force of law are being churned out at a rate of10,000 a year at an agency's 46 scattered offices is simplyself-refuting. Although the circumstances are less startlinghere, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the rele-vant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separateor different from others; there is thus no indication that a16 Although Customs's decision "is presumed to be correct" on review,28 U.

C. $ 1625(c); and under its reg-ulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-andcomment procedures only when "changing a practice" so asto produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters deter-mines that "the matter is of sufficient importance to involvethe interests of domestic industry," 19 CFR $$ 177.10(c)(1),(2) (2000). The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generallyas rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest anyintent to create a Chevron patchwork of classification rul-ings, some with force of law, some without.In sum, classification rulings are best treated like "inter-pretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines." Christensen, 529 U. S., at 587.They are beyond the Chevron pale.CTo agree with the Court of Appeals that Customs rulingletters do not fall within Chevron is not, however, to placethem outside the pale of any deference whatever. Chevrondid nothing to eliminate Skidmore's holding that an agency'sinterpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the "specialized experience and broader investigations and information" available to the agency, 323 U. S.,at 139, and given the value of uniformity in its administrativeand judicial understandings of what a national law requires,id., at 140.

A classification ruling in this situation may therefore at least seek a respect proportional toits "power to persuade," Skidmore, supra, at 140; see alsoChristensen, 529 U. S., at 587; id., at 595 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 596-597 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such aruling may surely claim the merit of its writer's thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.DUnderlying the position we take here, like the positionexpressed by Justice Scalia in dissent, is a choice aboutthe best way to deal with an inescapable feature of the533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG236 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.Opinion of the Courtbody of congressional legislation authorizing administrativeaction. That feature is the great variety of ways in whichthe laws invest the Government's administrative arms withdiscretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in givingmeaning to Acts of Congress. Implementation of a statutemay occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defendagainst judicial challenge; it may occur in a central boardor office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted acrossthe country; its institutional lawmaking may be confinedto the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislativerulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to beworked out at the agency level.Although we all accept the position that the Judiciaryshould defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of thegreat range of its variety. If the primary objective is tosimplify the judicial process of giving or withholding def-erence, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevantor minimized. If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutoryauthority to produce only two varieties of administrativeaction, demanding either Chevron deference or none at all,then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency actionmust be taken into account. Justice Scalia's first priorityover the years has been to limit and simplify. The Court'schoice has been to tailor deference to variety.17 This accept17 Compare Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000)("Interpretations such as those in opinion letters--like interpretationscontained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law--do not warrant Chevron-styledeference"), and EEOC v.

S. 218 (2001)Opinion of the Courtance of the range of statutory variation has led the Court torecognize more than one variety of judicial deference, just asthe Court has recognized a variety of indicators that Congress would expect Chevron deference.18Our respective choices are repeated today. JusticeScalia would pose the question of deference as an eitheror choice. On his view that Chevron rendered Skidmoreanachronistic, when courts owe any deference it is Chevrondeference that they owe, post, at 250. Whether courts doowe deference in a given case turns, for him, on whether theagency action (if reasonable) is "authoritative," post, at 257.The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not frombreadth of delegation or the agency's procedure in implementing it, but is defined as the "official" position of anagency, ibid., and may ultimately be a function of administrative persistence alone, ante, at 258.The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in Chevron toeliminate Skidmore's recognition of various justifications fordeference depending on statutory circumstances and agencyaction; Chevron was simply a case recognizing that evenwithout express authority to fill a specific statutory gap,circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegationpresent a particularly insistent call for deference. Indeed,in holding here that Chevron left Skidmore intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent todelegate general authority to make rules with force of law,or where such authority was not invoked, we hold nothingmore than we said last Term in response to the particularin judgment) (urging Chevron treatment); see also INS v. CardozaFonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 453-455 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)(urging broader application of Chevron).18 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not markedby a hard-edged rule. But Chevron itself is a good example showingwhen Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showingwhen it is not. Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasonedchoices between the two examples, the way courts have always done.533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG238 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.Opinion of the Courtstatutory circumstances in Christensen, to which JusticeScalia then took exception, see 529 U. S., at 589, just as hedoes again today.We think, in sum, that Justice Scalia's efforts to sim-plify ultimately run afoul of Congress's indications that different statutes present different reasons for consideringrespect for the exercise of administrative authority or deference to it. Without being at odds with congressional intentmuch of the time, we believe that judicial responses to administrative action must continue to differentiate betweenChevron and Skidmore, and that continued recognition ofSkidmore is necessary for just the reasons Justice Jacksongave when that case was decided.19* * *Since the Skidmore assessment called for here ought to bemade in the first instance by the Court of Appeals for the19 Surely Justice Jackson's practical criteria, along with Chevron's concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guidepoststhan conclusory references to the "authoritative" or "official." Evenif those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive lawto every one of 10,000 "official" customs classifications rulings turned outeach year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nation'sentryways. Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting whatis "authoritative" or "official" to a pronouncement that expresses the"judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest levels,"as distinct from the pronouncements of "underlings," post, at 259, n. 6.But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the "highest level" at Customs is the source of the regulation atissue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of theSecretary of the Treasury. 526 U. S., at 386. The Commissioner did notissue the Headquarters ruling. What Justice Scalia has in mind hereis that because the Secretary approved the Government's position in itsbrief to this Court, Chevron deference is due. But if that is so, Chevrondeference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began,when central management at the highest level decided to defend theruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such butto the brief. This explains why the Court has not accepted JusticeScalia's position.533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG239Cite as: 533 U.
