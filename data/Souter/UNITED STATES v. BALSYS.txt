By administrative subpoena, the Office of Special Investigations of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice (OSI) sought testimony from the respondent,Aloyzas Balsys, about his wartime activities between 1940and 1944 and his immigration to the United States in 1961.Balsys declined to answer such questions, claiming the FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination, based onhis fear of prosecution by a foreign nation. We hold thatconcern with foreign prosecution is beyond the scope of theSelf-Incrimination Clause.IRespondent Aloyzas Balsys is a resident alien living inWoodhaven, New York, having obtained admission to thiscountry in 1961 under the Immigration and Nationality Act,8 U. S. C. $ 1201, on an immigrant visa and alien registrationissued at the American Consulate in Liverpool. In his application, he said that he had served in the Lithuanian armybetween 1934 and 1940, and had lived in hiding in Plateliai,Lithuania, between 1940 and 1944. Balsys swore that theinformation was true, and signed a statement of understanding that if his application contained any false informationor materially misleading statements, or concealed any material fact, he would be subject to criminal prosecution anddeportation.*Elizabeth Holtzman and Sanford Hausler filed a brief for the WorldJewish Congress et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.John D. Cline, Barbara E. Bergman, and John L.

BALSYSOpinion of the CourtOSI, which was created to institute denaturalization anddeportation proceedings against suspected Nazi war criminals, is now investigating whether, contrary to his repre-sentations, Balsys participated in Nazi persecution duringWorld War II. Such activity would subject him to deporta-tion for persecuting persons because of their race, religion,national origin, or political opinion under $$ 1182(a)(3)(E) and1251(a)(4)(D), as well as for lying on his visa applicationunder $$ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and 1251(a)(1)(A).When OSI issued a subpoena requiring Balsys to testifyat a deposition, he appeared and gave his name and address,but he refused to answer any other questions, such as thosedirected to his wartime activities in Europe between 1940-1945 and his immigration to the United States in 1961. Inresponse to all such questions, Balsys invoked the FifthAmendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination,claiming that his answers could subject him to criminalprosecution. He did not contend that he would incriminatehimself under domestic law,1 but claimed the privilege be-cause his responses could subject him to criminal prosecutionby Lithuania, Israel, and Germany.OSI responded with a petition in Federal District Court toenforce the subpoena under $ 1225(a). Although the DistrictCourt found that if Balsys were to provide the informationrequested, he would face a real and substantial danger ofprosecution by Lithuania and Israel (but not by Germany),it granted OSI's enforcement petition and ordered Balsys totestify, treating the Fifth Amendment as inapplicable to aclaim of incrimination solely under foreign law. 918 F. Supp.588 (EDNY 1996). Balsys appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court'sorder, holding that a witness with a real and substantial fearof prosecution by a foreign country may assert the FifthAmendment privilege to avoid giving testimony in a domes1 The Government advises us that the statute of limitation bars criminalprosecution for any misrepresentation.

U. S. Const.,Amdt. 5. Resident aliens such as Balsys are considered"persons" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and are en-titled to the same protections under the Clause as citizens.See Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596 (1953).The parties do not dispute that the Government seeks to"compel" testimony from Balsys that would make him "a wit-ness against himself." The question is whether there is arisk that Balsys's testimony will be used in a proceeding thatis a "criminal case."Balsys agrees that the risk that his testimony might sub-ject him to deportation is not a sufficient ground for asserting the privilege, given the civil character of a deportationproceeding. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032,1038-1039 (1984). If, however, Balsys could demonstrate2 See United States v. Gecas, 120 F. 3d 1419 (CA11 1997) (en banc) (holding that the privilege cannot be invoked based on fear of prosecutionabroad); United States v.

S. 472 (1972) (finding that because thepetitioner did not face a "real and substantial" risk of foreign prosecution,it was unnecessary to decide whether the privilege can be asserted basedon fear of foreign prosecution); Parker v.

BALSYSOpinion of the Courtthat any testimony he might give in the deportation investi-gation could be used in a criminal proceeding against himbrought by the Government of either the United States orone of the States, he would be entitled to invoke the privilege. It "can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or crimi-nal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory,"in which the witness reasonably believes that the informa-tion sought, or discoverable as a result of his testimony, couldbe used in a subsequent state or federal criminal proceeding.Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 444-445 (1972); seealso McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40 (1924) (the privilege "applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wher-ever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it"). But Balsys makes no such claim,contending rather that his entitlement to invoke the privilege arises because of a real and substantial fear that histestimony could be used against him by Lithuania or Israelin a criminal prosecution. The reasonableness of his fear isnot challenged by the Government, and we thus squarelyface the question whether a criminal prosecution by a foreigngovernment not subject to our constitutional guarantees presents a "criminal case" for purposes of the privilege againstself-incrimination.IIIBalsys relies in the first instance on the textual contrastbetween the Sixth Amendment, which clearly applies onlyto domestic criminal proceedings, and the Compelled SelfIncrimination Clause, with its facially broader referenceto "any criminal case." The same point is developed byBalsys's amici,3 who argue that "any criminal case" meansexactly that, regardless of the prosecuting authority. According to the argument, the Framers' use of the adjective"any" precludes recognition of the distinction raised by the3 See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al.as Amici Curiae 5.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN673Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the CourtGovernment, between prosecution by a jurisdiction that isitself bound to recognize the privilege and prosecution by aforeign jurisdiction that is not. But the argument overlooksthe cardinal rule to construe provisions in context. SeeKing v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Inthe Fifth Amendment context, the Clause in question occursin the company of guarantees of grand jury proceedings, de-fense against double jeopardy, due process, and compensation for property taking. Because none of these provisionsis implicated except by action of the government that itbinds, it would have been strange to choose such associatesfor a Clause meant to take a broader view, and it would bestrange to find such a sweep in the Clause now. See Whar-ton v. Wise, 153 U. S. 155, 169-170 (1894) (noscitur a sociis);see also Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995)(same). The oddity of such a reading would be especiallystark if the expansive language in question is open to anotherreasonable interpretation, as we think it is. Because theFifth Amendment opens by requiring a grand jury indict-ment or presentment "for a capital, or otherwise infamouscrime," 4 the phrase beginning with "any" in the subsequentSelf-Incrimination Clause may sensibly be read as making itclear that the privilege it provides is not so categoricallylimited. It is plausible to suppose the adjective was inserted only for that purpose, not as taking the further stepof defining the relevant prosecutorial jurisdiction internationally. We therefore take this to be the fair reading ofthe adjective "any," and we read the Clause contextually as4 As a whole, the Amendment reads as follows: "No person shall be heldto answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land ornaval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War orpublic danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to betwice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminalcase to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, orproperty, without due process of law; nor shall private property be takenfor public use, without just compensation."524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN674 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtapparently providing a witness with the right against com-pelled self-incrimination when reasonably fearing prosecution by the government whose power the Clause limits, butnot otherwise. Since there is no helpful legislative history,5and because there was no different common law practice atthe time of the framing, see Part III-C, infra; cf. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 563-564 (1892) (listinga sample of cases, including preframing cases, in which theprivilege was asserted, none of which involve fear of foreignprosecution), there is no reason to disregard the contextualreading. This Court's precedent has indeed adopted thatso-called same-sovereign interpretation.AThe currently received understanding of the Bill ofRights as instituted "to curtail and restrict the general powers granted to the Executive, Legislative, and JudicialBranches" of the National Government defined in the original constitutional articles, New York Times Co. v. United5 See Gecas, 120 F. 3d, at 1435 (noting that the Clause has "virtuallyno legislative history"); 5 The Founders' Constitution 262 (P. Kurland &R. Lerner eds. 1987) (indicating that the Clause as originally drafted andintroduced in the First Congress lacked the phrase "any criminal case,"which was added at the behest of Representative Lawrence on the groundthat the Clause would otherwise be "in some degree contrary to lawspassed").In recent years, scholarly attention has refined our knowledge of theprevious manifestations of the privilege against self-incrimination, thepresent culmination of such scholarship being R. Helmholz et al., The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination (1997). What we know of the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, however, givesno indication that the Framers had any sense of a privilege more comprehensive than common law practice then revealed. See Moglen, Takingthe Fifth: Reconsidering the Origins of the Constitutional PrivilegeAgainst Self-Incrimination, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 1086, 1123 (1994) ("[T]he legislative history of the Fifth Amendment adds little to our understandingof the history of the privilege"). As to the common law practice, see PartIII-C, infra.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN675Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the CourtStates, 403 U. S. 713, 716 (1971) (per curiam) (Black, J., con-curring) (emphasis deleted), was expressed early on in ChiefJustice Marshall's opinion for the Court in the leading caseofBarron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243,247 (1833): the Constitution's "limitations on power . . . arenaturally, and, we think, necessarily applicable to the gov-ernment created by the instrument," and not to "distinct[state] governments, framed by different persons and for dif-ferent purposes."To be sure, it would have been logically possible to decide(as inBarron) that the "distinct [state] governments . . .framed . . . for different purposes" were beyond the ambit ofthe Fifth Amendment, and at the same time to hold that theself-incrimination privilege, good against the National Government, was implicated by fear of prosecution in anotherjurisdiction. But after Barron and before the era of Fourteenth Amendment incorporation, that would have been anunlikely doctrinal combination, and no such improbable development occurred.The precursors of today's case were those raising the question of the significance for the federal privilege of possibleuse of testimony in state prosecution. Only a handful ofearly cases even touched on the problem. In Brown v.Walker, 161 U. S. 591 (1896), a witness raised the issue,claiming the privilege in a federal proceeding based on hisfear of prosecution by a State, but we found that a statuteunder which immunity from federal prosecution had beenconferred provided for immunity from state prosecution aswell, obviating any need to reach the issue raised. Id., at606-608. In Jack v. Kansas, 199 U. S. 372 (1905), a Fourteenth Amendment case, we affirmed a sentence for contempt imposed on a witness in a state proceeding who hadreceived immunity from state prosecution but refused to answer questions based on a fear that they would subject himto federal prosecution. Although there was no reasonablefear of a prosecution by the National Government in that524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN676 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtcase, we addressed the question whether a self-incriminationprivilege could be invoked in the one jurisdiction based onfear of prosecution by the other, saying that "[w]e think thelegal immunity is in regard to a prosecution in the same jurisdiction, and when that is fully given it is enough." Id., at382. A year later, in the course of considering whether afederal witness, immunized from federal prosecution, couldinvoke the privilege based on fear of state prosecution, weadopted the general proposition that "the possibility that in-formation given by the witness might be used" by the othergovernment is, as a matter of law, "a danger so unsubstantialand remote" that it fails to trigger the right to invoke theprivilege. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 69 (1906)."[I]f the argument were a sound one it might be carriedstill further and held to apply not only to state prosecutions within the same jurisdiction, but to prosecutionsunder the criminal laws of other States to which thewitness might have subjected himself. The questionhas been fully considered in England, and the conclusionreached by the courts of that country [is] that the onlydanger to be considered is one arising within the samejurisdiction and under the same sovereignty. Queen v.Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311[, 121 Eng. Rep. 730]; King of theTwo Sicilies v. Willcox, 7 State Trials (N. S.), 1049, 1068;State v. March, 1 Jones (N. Car.), 526; State v. Thomas,98 N. Car. 599." Ibid.A holding to this effect came when United States v. Murdock, 284 U. S. 141 (1931), "definitely settled" the questionwhether in a federal proceeding the privilege applied on account of fear of state prosecution, concluding "that one underexamination in a federal tribunal could not refuse to answeron account of probable incrimination under state law."United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 396 (1933)."The English rule of evidence against compulsory self-incrimination, on which historically that contained in524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN677Cite as: 524 U.

Willcox,7 State Trials (N. S.) 1049, 1068. Queen v. Boyes, 1B. & S., at 330[, 121 Eng. Rep., at 738]. This court hasheld that immunity against state prosecution is not essential to the validity of federal statutes declaring thata witness shall not be excused from giving evidence onthe ground that it will incriminate him, and also thatthe lack of state power to give witnesses protectionagainst federal prosecution does not defeat a state im-munity statute. The principle established is that fulland complete immunity against prosecution by the gov-ernment compelling the witness to answer is equivalentto the protection furnished by the rule against compul-sory self-incrimination.

Schweitzer, 357 U. S.371 (1958), overruled by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n ofN. Y. Harbor, 378 U.

S. 487 (1944),overruled byMurphy, supra, at 80.BIt has been suggested here that our precedent addressingfear of prosecution by a government other than the compelling authority fails to reflect the Murdock rule uniformly.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN678 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the CourtIn 1927 (prior to our decision in Murdock), in a case involvinga request for habeas relief from a deportation order, wedeclined to resolve whether "the Fifth Amendment guaran-tees immunity from self-incrimination under state statutes."United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927). Although we found that thewitness had waived his claim to the privilege, our decisionmight be read to suggest that there was some tension be-tween the reasoning of two of the cases discussed above,Hale v. Henkel and Brown v. Walker, and the analyses con-tained in two others, United States v. Saline Bank of Va., 1Pet. 100 (1828), and Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186 (1906).273 U. S., at 113. These last two cases have in fact beencited here for the claim that prior to due process incorpora-tion, the privilege could be asserted in a federal proceedingbased on fear of prosecution by a State.6 Saline Bank andBallmann are not, however, inconsistent with Murdock.In Saline Bank, we permitted the defendants to refusediscovery sought by the United States in federal court,where the defendants claimed that their responses would re-sult in incrimination under the laws of Virginia. "The ruleclearly is, that a party is not bound to make any discoverywhich would expose him to penalties, and this case fallswithin it." 1 Pet., at 104. But, for all the sweep of thisstatement, the opinion makes no mention of the FifthAmendment, and in Hale v. Henkel, we explained that "theprosecution [in Saline Bank] was under a state law whichimposed the penalty, and . . . the Federal court was simply6 The language in Vajtauer that has been cited in support of this suggestion says only that our conclusion that the witness waived his claim ofprivilege "makes it unnecessary for us to consider the extent to whichthe Fifth Amendment guarantees immunity from self-incrimination understate statutes or whether this case is to be controlled by Hale v. Henkel,201 U. S. 43; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 608; compare United Statesv. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100; Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186, 195." 273U.

The statelaw, which addresses prosecutions brought by the State, suggested the rule that the Saline Bank Court applied to thecase before it; the law provided that "no disclosure made byany party defendant to such suit in equity, and no books orpapers exhibited by him in answer to the bill, or under theorder of the Court, shall be used as evidence against him inany . . . prosecution under this law," quoted in 1 Pet., at 104.Saline Bank, then, may have turned on a reading of statestatutory law. Cf. McNaughton, Self-Incrimination UnderForeign Law, 45 Va. L. Rev. 1299, 1305-1306 (1959) (suggesting that Saline Bank represents "an application not of theprivilege against self-incrimination . . . but of the principlethat equity will not aid a forfeiture"). But see Ballmann,supra, at 195 (Holmes, J.) (suggesting that Saline Bank is aFifth Amendment case, though this view was soon repudiated by the Court in Hale, as just noted).Where Saline Bank is laconic, Ballmann is equivocal.While Ballmann specifically argued only the danger of incriminating himself under state law as his basis for invokingthe privilege in a federal proceeding, and we upheld his claimof privilege, our opinion indicates that we concluded thatBallmann might have had a fear of incrimination under federal law as well as under state law. While we did suggest,contrary to the Murdock rule, that Ballmann might havebeen able to invoke the privilege based on a fear of stateprosecution, the opinion says only that "[o]ne way or theother [due to the risk of incrimination under federal or statelaw] we are of opinion that Ballmann could not be requiredto produce his cash book if he set up that it would tend tocriminate him." 200 U. S., at 195-196. At its equivocalworst, Ballmann reigned for only two months. Hale v.Henkel explained that "the only danger to be considered isone arising within the same jurisdiction and under the samesovereignty," 201 U. S., at 69, and Ballmann and Saline524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN680 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the CourtBank were later, of course, superseded by Murdock withits unequivocal holding that prosecution in a state jurisdiction not bound by the Clause is beyond the purview of theprivilege.CIn 1964, our precedent took a turn away from the unquali-fied proposition that fear of prosecution outside the jurisdiction seeking to compel testimony did not implicate a Fifth orFourteenth Amendment privilege, as the case might be. InMurphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S.52 (1964), we reconsidered the converse of the situation inMurdock, whether a witness in a state proceeding who hadbeen granted immunity from state prosecution could invokethe privilege based on fear of prosecution on federal charges.In the course of enquiring into a work stoppage at severalNew Jersey piers, the Waterfront Commission of New YorkHarbor subpoenaed the defendants, who were given immunity from prosecution under the laws of New Jersey and NewYork. When the witnesses persisted in refusing to testifybased on their fear of federal prosecution, they were held incivil contempt, and the order was affirmed by New Jersey'shighest court. In re Application of the Waterfront Comm'nof N. Y. Harbor, 39 N. J. 436, 449, 189 A. 2d 36, 44 (1963).This Court held the defendants could be forced to testifynot because fear of federal prosecution was irrelevant butbecause the Self-Incrimination Clause barred the NationalGovernment from using their state testimony or its fruits toobtain a federal conviction. We explained that "the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination protects a statewitness against incrimination under federal as well as statelaw and a federal witness against incrimination under stateas well as federal law." 378 U. S., at 77-78.Murphy is a case invested with two alternative rationales.Under the first, the result reached in Murphy was undoubtedly correct, given the decision rendered that very same dayin Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), which applied the524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN681Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtdoctrine of Fourteenth Amendment due process incorpora-tion to the Self-Incrimination Clause, so as to bind the Statesas well as the National Government to recognize the privi-lege. Id., at 3. Prior to Malloy, the Court had refused toimpose the privilege against self-incrimination against theStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, seeTwining v.New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), thus leaving state-court witnesses seeking exemption from compulsion to testify to theirrights under state law, as supplemented by the FourteenthAmendment's limitations on coerced confessions. Malloy,however, established that "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment secures against state invasion the same privilege that the FifthAmendment guarantees against federal infringement--theright of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speakin the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer nopenalty . . . for such silence." 378 U. S., at 8.As the Court immediately thereafter said inMurphy, Mal-loy "necessitate[d] a reconsideration" of the unqualified Murdock rule that a witness subject to testimonial compulsionin one jurisdiction, state or federal, could not plead fear ofprosecution in the other. 378 U. S., at 57. After Malloy,the Fifth Amendment limitation could no longer be seen asframed for one jurisdiction alone, each jurisdiction havinginstead become subject to the same claim of privilege flowingfrom the one limitation. Since fear of prosecution in the onejurisdiction bound by the Clause now implicated the veryprivilege binding upon the other, the Murphy opinion sensi-bly recognized that if a witness could not assert the privilegein such circumstances, the witness could be "whipsawed intoincriminating himself under both state and federal law eventhough the constitutional privilege against self-incriminationis applicable to each." 378 U. S., at 55 (internal quotationmarks omitted).7 The whipsawing was possible owing to a7 Prior to Murphy, such "whipsawing" efforts had been permissible, butarguably less outrageous since, as the opinion notes, "either the `compelling' government or the `using' government [was] a State, and, until today,524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN682 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtfeature unique to the guarantee against self-incriminationamong the several Fifth Amendment privileges. In the absence of waiver, the other such guarantees are purely andsimply binding on the government. But under the SelfIncrimination Clause, the government has an option to ex-change the stated privilege for an immunity to prosecutorialuse of any compelled inculpatory testimony. Kastigar v.United States, 406 U. S., at 448-449. The only condition onthe government when it decides to offer immunity in placeof the privilege to stay silent is the requirement to providean immunity as broad as the privilege itself. Id., at 449.After Malloy had held the privilege binding on the statejurisdictions as well as the National Government, it wouldtherefore have been intolerable to allow a prosecutor in oneor the other jurisdiction to eliminate the privilege by offering immunity less complete than the privilege's dual jurisdic-tional reach.Murphy accordingly held that a federal courtcould not receive testimony compelled by a State in the absence of a statute effectively providing for federal immunity,and it did this by imposing an exclusionary rule prohibitingthe National Government "from making any such use of com-pelled testimony and its fruits," 378 U. S., at 79 (footnoteomitted).This view ofMurphy as necessitated by Malloy wasadopted in the subsequent case of Kastigar v. United States,supra, at 456, n. 42 ("Reconsideration of the rule that theFifth Amendment privilege does not protect a witness in onejurisdiction against being compelled to give testimony thatcould be used to convict him in another jurisdiction wasmade necessary by the decision in Malloy v. Hogan"). Readthis way,Murphy rests upon the same understanding of theSelf-Incrimination Clause that Murdock recognized and towhich the earlier cases had pointed. Although the Clauseserves a variety of interests in one degree or another, seethe States were not deemed fully bound by the privilege against selfincrimination." 378 U. S., at 57, n. 6.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN683Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the CourtPart IV, infra, at its heart lies the principle that the courtsof a government from which a witness may reasonably fearprosecution may not in fairness compel the witness to furnishtestimonial evidence that may be used to prove his guilt.After Murphy, the immunity option open to the ExecutiveBranch could be exercised only on the understanding thatthe state and federal jurisdictions were as one, with a fed-erally mandated exclusionary rule filling the space betweenthe limits of state immunity statutes and the scope of theprivilege.8 As so understood, Murphy stands at odds withBalsys's claim.There is, however, a competing rationale inMurphy, in-vesting the Clause with a more expansive promise. TheMurphy majority opened the door to this view by reject-ing this Court's previous understanding of the Englishcommon-law evidentiary privilege against compelled self-incrimination, which could have informed the Framers' understanding of the Fifth Amendment privilege. See, e. g.,Murphy, 378 U. S., at 67 (rejecting Murdock's analysis of thescope of the privilege under English common law). Havingremoved what it saw as an unjustified, historically derived8 Of course, the judicial exclusion of compelled testimony functions asa fail-safe to ensure that compelled testimony is not admitted in a criminal proceeding. The general rule requires a grant of immunity prior tothe compelling of any testimony. We have said that the prediction thata court in a future criminal prosecution would be obligated to protectagainst the evidentiary use of compelled testimony is not enough to satisfythe privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U. S. 248, 261 (1983). The suggestion that a witness should relyon a subsequent motion to suppress rather than a prior grant of immunity"would [not] afford adequate protection. Without something more, [thewitness] would be compelled to surrender the very protection which theprivilege is designed to guarantee." Maness v. Meyers, 419 U. S. 449, 462(1975) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted).

BALSYSOpinion of the Courtlimitation on the privilege, the Murphy Court expressed acomparatively ambitious conceptualization of personal privacy underlying the Clause, one capable of supporting, if notdemanding, the scope of protection that Balsys claims. Asthe Court of Appeals recognized, if we take the Murphyopinion at face value, the expansive rationale can be claimedquite as legitimately as theMurdock-Malloy-Kastigar understanding of Murphy's result, and Balsys's claim accord-ingly requires us to decide whetherMurphy's innovativeside is as sound as its traditional one. We conclude that itis not.As support for the view that the Court had previously misunderstood the English rule, Murphy relied, first, on twopreconstitutional English cases, East India Co. v. Campbell,1 Ves. sen. 246, 27 Eng. Rep. 1010 (Ex. 1749), and Brownsword v. Edwards, 2 Ves. sen. 243, 28 Eng. Rep. 157(Ch. 1750), for the proposition that a witness in an Englishcourt was permitted to invoke the privilege based on fear ofprosecution in a foreign jurisdiction. See 378 U. S., at 58-59. Neither of these cases is on point as holding that proposition, however. In East India Co., a defendant before theCourt of Exchequer, seeking to avoid giving an explanationfor his possession of certain goods, claimed the privilege onthe ground that his testimony might subject him to a fine orcorporal punishment. The Court of Exchequer found thatthe defendant would be punishable in Calcutta, then an English Colony, and said it would "not oblige one to discoverthat, which, if he answers in the affirmative, will subject himto the punishment of a crime." 1 Ves. sen., at 247, 27 Eng.Rep., at 1011. In Brownsword, a defendant before theCourt of Chancery claimed the privilege on the ground thather testimony could render her liable to prosecution in anEnglish ecclesiastical court. "The general rule," the courtsaid, "is that no one is bound to answer so as to subject himself to punishment, whether that punishment arises by theecclesiastical law of the land." 2 Ves. sen., at 245, 28 Eng.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN685Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the CourtRep., at 158. Although this statement, like its counterpartin East India Co., is unqualified, neither case is authorityfor the proposition that fear of prosecution in foreign courtsimplicates the privilege. For in each of these cases, the judicial system to which the witness's fears related was subjectto the same legislative sovereignty that had created thecourts in which the privilege was claimed.9 In fact, whenthese cases were decided, and for years after adoption of theFifth Amendment, English authority was silent on whetherfear of prosecution by a foreign nation implicated the privilege, and the Vice-Chancellor so stated in 1851. See Kingof the Two Sicilies v. Willcox, 1 Sim. (N. S.) 301, 331, 61 Eng.Rep. 116, 128 (Ch. 1851) (observing, in the course of an opinion that clearly involved a claim of privilege based on thefear of prosecution by another sovereign, that there is an"absence of all authority on the point").Murphy, in fact, went on to discuss the case last cited, aswell as a subsequent one. The Murphy majority began byacknowledging that King of the Two Sicilies was not author-ity for attacking this Court's prior view of English law. 378U. S., at 60. In an opinion by Lord Cranworth, the Court ofChancery declined to allow defendants to assert the privilege9 Further, the courts of both jurisdictions, at least in some cases, recognized the privilege against self-incrimination. East India Co. makes specific reference to the fact that the witness's testimony might be incriminating under the laws of Calcutta. 1 Ves. sen., at 247, 27 Eng. Rep., at 1011("[T]hat he is punishable appears from the case of Omichund v. Barker[1 Atk. 21, 26 Eng. Rep. 15 (1744)], as a jurisdiction is erected in Calcuttafor criminal facts"). As of 1726, Calcutta was a "presidency town," whichwas subject to the civil jurisdiction of a "mayor's court." The mayor'scourt followed the English Rules of Evidence, which would have includedthe rule against self-incrimination. 1 Woodroffe & Ameer Ali's Law ofEvidence in India 13 (P. Ramaswami & S. Rajagopalan eds., 11th ed. 1962).The ecclesiastical courts of England also recognized something akin to theprivilege at this time in some cases. See Helmholz, Origins of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: The Role of the European Ius Commune,65 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 962, 969-974 (1990) (citing cases heard in ecclesiasticalcourts in which the privilege was recognized).524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN686 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtbased on their fear of prosecution in Sicily, for two reasons.1 Sim. (N. S.), at 329, 61 Eng. Rep., at 128. The first wasthe court's belief that the privilege speaks only to mattersthat might be criminal under the laws of England: "The rulerelied on by the Defendants, is one which exists merely byvirtue of our own municipal law, and must, I think, have ref-erence, exclusively, to matters penal by that law: to mattersas to which, if disclosed, the Judge would be able to say,as matter of law, whether it could or could not entail penalconsequences." For the second, the court relied on the un-likelihood that the defendants would ever leave England andbe subject to Sicilian prosecution.The Murphy majority nonetheless understood this rule tohave been undermined by the subsequent case of UnitedStates of America v. McRae, 3 L. R. Ch. 79 (1867). See 378U. S., at 61. In that suit brought by the United Statesagainst McRae in England to recover funds that he had collected there as a Confederate agent during the Civil War,the court recognized the privilege based on McRae's claimthat his testimony would incriminate him in the UnitedStates. The court distinguished the litigation then before itfrom King of the Two Sicilies, indicating that though itagreed with the general principles stated by Lord Cranworth, see 3 L. R. Ch., at 84, he had not needed to lay downthe broad proposition that invocation of the privilege wasappropriate only with regard to matters penal under England's own law, see id., at 85. The court did not say thatthe privilege could be invoked in any case involving fear ofprosecution under foreign law, however. Instead it notedtwo distinctions from King of the Two Sicilies, the first beingthat the "presumed ignorance of the Judge as to foreign law"on which King of the Two Sicilies rested has been "completely removed by the admitted statements upon the pleadings," 3 L. R. Ch., at 85; the second being that McRae presented the unusual circumstance that the party seeking tocompel the testimony, the United States, was also the party524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN687Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthat would prosecute any crime under its laws that mightthereby be revealed, id., at 87. The court's holding that theprivilege could be invoked in such circumstances does not,however, support a general application of the privilege inany case in which a witness fears prosecution under foreignlaw by a party not before the court. Thus, Murphy wenttoo far in saying that McRae overruled King of the Two Sicilies.10 See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 71. What is of more fundamental importance, however, is that even if McRae hadannounced a new development in English law going to theheart of King of the Two Sicilies, it would have been irrelevant to Fifth Amendment interpretation. The presumedinfluence of English law on the intentions of the Framershardly invests the Framers with clairvoyance, and subsequent English developments are not attributable to theFramers by some rule of renvoi. Cf. Brown, 161 U. S., at600 (citing Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264, 280 (1831)).Since McRae neither stated nor implied any disagreementwith Lord Cranworth's 1857 statement in King of the TwoSicilies that there was no clear prior authority on thequestion, the Murphy Court had no authority showing thatMurdock rested on unsound historical assumptions contradicted by opinions of the English courts.10 Murphy also cites Heriz v. Riera, 11 Sim. 318, 59 Eng. Rep. 896 (1840),as support for the claim that the English rule allowed invocation of theprivilege based on fear of prosecution abroad. See 378 U. S., at 63. Inthat case two Spanish women brought suit in England alleging that thedefendant had violated a contract that he entered into with their brotherand to which they were entitled to the proceeds as his heirs. The contractprovided that the plaintiffs' brother (and they as his heirs) were entitledto a share of the proceeds from a mercantile contract with the SpanishGovernment. The defendant responded that the contract was illegalunder the laws of Spain and hence unenforceable and resisted discoverybecause his answers might incriminate him under the Spanish code. Thecourt accepted the defendant's plea, though it is unclear whether the courtruled on the merits of the plaintiffs' claim or the self-incrimination issue.See Grant, Federalism and Self-Incrimination, 5 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 2 (1958).524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN688 UNITED STATES v.

First, we start with what we thinkis the most probable reading of the Clause in its FifthAmendment context, as limiting its principle to concern withprosecution by a sovereign that is itself bound by the Clause;the dissent instead emphasizes the Clause's facial breadth asconsistent with a broader principle. Second, we rely on theforce of our precedent, notably Murdock, as confirming thissame-sovereign principle, as adapted to reflect the post-Malloy requirement of immunity effective against both sovereigns subject to the one privilege under the National Con-stitution; the dissent attributes less force to Murdock, givingweight to its tension with the Saline Bank language, amongother things. Third, we rejectMurphy's restatement of thecommon-law background and read none of the common-lawcases as authority inconsistent with our contextual readingof the Clause, later confirmed by precedent such as Murdock;the dissent finds support in the common-law cases for Mur-phy's historical reexamination and the broader reading of theClause.

BALSYSOpinion of the Courtone who contests the basic same-sovereign principle, a bur-den that only clear, contrary, preframing common law mightcarry; since the dissent starts with a broader reading of theClause and a less potent view of Murdock, it does not requireMurphy and the common-law cases to satisfy such a burdenbefore definitively finding that a more expansive principleunderlies the Clause. IVThere remains, at least on the face of the Murphy majori-ty's opinion, a further invitation to revise the principle ofthe Clause from what Murdock recognized. The Murphymajority opens its discussion with a catalog of "Policies ofthe Privilege," 378 U. S., at 55 (citations and internal quota-tion marks omitted):"It reflects many of our fundamental values and mostnoble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject thosesuspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt; our preference for anaccusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of crimi-nal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statementswill be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; oursense of fair play which dictates a fair state-individualbalance by requiring the government to leave the indi-vidual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing himand by requiring the government in its contest with theindividual to shoulder the entire load; our respect for theinviolability of the human personality and of the right ofeach individual to a private enclave where he may leada private life, our distrust of self-deprecatory state-ments; and our realization that the privilege, whilesometimes a shelter to the guilty, is often a protectionto the innocent."Some of the policies listed would seem to point no furtherthan domestic arrangements and so raise no basis for anyprivilege looking beyond fear of domestic prosecution. Oth524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN691Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courters, however, might suggest a concern broad enough to en-compass foreign prosecutions and accordingly to support amore expansive theory of the privilege than the Murdockunderstanding would allow.The adoption of any such revised theory would, however,necessarily rest onMurphy's reading of preconstitutionalcommon-law cases as support for (or at least as opening thedoor to) the expansive view of the Framers' intent, whichwe and the commentators since Murphy have found to beunsupported. Once the Murphy majority's treatment of theEnglish cases is rejected as an indication of the meaning intended for the Clause, Murdock must be seen as precedentat odds with Balsys's claim. That precedent aside, however,we think there would be sound reasons to stop short of rest-ing an expansion of the Clause's scope on the highly generalstatements of policy expressed in the foregoing quotationfromMurphy. While its list does indeed catalog aspirationsfurthered by the Clause, its discussion does not even purportto weigh the host of competing policy concerns that would beraised in a legitimate reconsideration of the Clause's scope.AThe most general of Murphy's policy items ostensibly sug-gesting protection as comprehensive as that sought byBalsys is listed in the opinion as "the inviolability of thehuman personality and . . . the right of each individual to aprivate enclave where he may lead a private life." 378 U. S.,at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever elsethose terms might cover, protection of personal inviolabilityand the privacy of a testimonial enclave would necessarilyseem to include protection against the Government's veryintrusion through involuntary interrogation.12 If in fact12 We are assuming, arguendo, that the intrusion is a subject of theClause's protection. See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 57, n. 6; Gecas, 120 F. 3d,at 1462 (Birch, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494U. S. 259, 264 (1990) ("The privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN692 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtthese values were reliable guides to the actual scope of pro-tection under the Clause, they would be seen to demand avery high degree of protection indeed: "inviolability" is, afterall, an uncompromising term, and we know as well fromFourth Amendment law as from a layman's common sensethat breaches of privacy are complete at the moment of illicitintrusion, whatever use may or may not later be made oftheir fruits. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494U. S. 259, 264 (1990) (citingUnited States v. Calandra, 414U. S. 338, 354 (1974); United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,906 (1984)).The Fifth Amendment tradition, however, offers no suchdegree of protection. If the Government is ready to providethe requisite use and derivative use immunity, see Kastigar,406 U. S., at 453; see also Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70,84 (1973), the protection goes no further: no violation of personality is recognized and no claim of privilege will avail.13One might reply that the choice of the word "inviolability"was just unfortunate; while testimonial integrity may not beinviolable, it is sufficiently served by requiring the Government to pay a price in the form of use (and derivative use)immunity before a refusal to testify will be overruled. Butthat answer overlooks the fact that when a witness's response will raise no fear of criminal penalty, there is no protection for testimonial privacy at all. See United States v.Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-255 (1980).Thus, what we find in practice is not the protection of personal testimonial inviolability, but a conditional protection oftestimonial privacy subject to basic limits recognized beforeby the Fifth Amendment is a fundamental trial right of criminal defendants. Although conduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial mayultimately impair that right, a constitutional violation occurs only at trial"(citation omitted)).13 The practice of exchanging silence for immunity is unchallenged hereand presumably invulnerable, being apparently as old as the Fifth Amendment itself. See Kastigar, 406 U. S., at 445, and n. 13.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN693Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe framing 14 and refined through immunity doctrine in theintervening years. Since the Judiciary could not recognizefear of foreign prosecution and at the same time preservethe Government's existing rights to seek testimony in exchange for immunity (because domestic courts could notenforce the immunity abroad), it follows that extending protection as Balsys requests would change the balance of pri-vate and governmental interests that has seemingly beenaccepted for as long as there has been Fifth Amendmentdoctrine. The upshot is that accepting personal testimonial integrity or privacy as a prima facie justification forthe development Balsys seeks would threaten a significantchange in the scope of traditional domestic protection; to theextent, on the other hand, that the domestic tradition isthought worthy of preservation, an appeal to a general per-sonal testimonial integrity or privacy is not helpful. SeeDoe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 213, n. 11 (1988) (findingno violation of the privilege "[d]espite the impact upon theinviolability of the human personality"); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 762 (1966) (holding that a witness can-not rely on the privilege to decline to provide blood samples);ibid. ("[T]he privilege has never been given the full scopewhich the values that it helps to protect suggest").BMurphy's policy catalog would provide support, at a rathermore concrete level, for Balsys's argument that applicationof the privilege in situations like his would promote the pur-pose of preventing government overreaching, which on anyone's view lies at the core of the Clause's purposes. Thisargument begins with the premise that "cooperative internationalism" creates new incentives for the Government tofacilitate foreign criminal prosecutions. Because crime, likelegitimate trade, is increasingly international, a correspond14 See n. 13, supra.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN694 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courting degree of international cooperation is coming to charac-terize the enterprise of criminal prosecution.15 The missionof the OSI as shown in this case exemplifies the internationalcooperation that is said to undermine the legitimacy of treating separate governmental authorities as separate for pur-poses of liberty protection in domestic courts. Because theGovernment now has a significant interest in seeing individu-als convicted abroad for their crimes, it is subject to the sameincentive to overreach that has required application of theprivilege in the domestic context. Balsys says that this argument is nothing more than the reasoning of the MurphyCourt when it justified its recognition of a fear of state prosecution by looking to the significance of " `cooperative federal-ism,' " the teamwork of state and national officials to fightinterstate crime. 378 U. S., at 55-56.But Balsys invests Murphy's "cooperative federalism"with a significance unsupported by that opinion. We havealready pointed out that Murphy's expansion upon Murdockis not supported by Murphy's unsound historical reexamina-tion, but must rest onMurphy's other rationale, under whichits holding is a consequence of Malloy. That latter readingis essential to an understanding of "cooperative federalism."For the Murphy majority, "cooperative federalism" was notimportant standing alone, but simply because it underscoredthe significance of the Court's holding that afterMalloy itwould be unjustifiably formalistic for a federal court to ig-nore fear of state prosecution when ruling on a privilegeclaim. Thus, the Court described the "whipsaw" effect thatthe decision in Malloy would have created if fear of stateprosecution were not cognizable in a federal proceeding:"[The] policies and purposes [of the privilege] aredefeated when a witness can be whipsawed into incriminating himself under both state and federal law15 The Court of Appeals cited a considerable number of studies in thegrowing literature on the subject. 119 F. 3d 122, 130-131 (CA2 1997).524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN695Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courteven though the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable to each. This has becomeespecially true in our age of `cooperative federalism,'where the Federal and State Governments are waginga united front against many types of criminal activity."378 U. S., at 55-56 (citation and internal quotationmarks omitted).Since in this case there is no analog of Malloy, imposingthe Fifth Amendment beyond the National Government,there is no premise in Murphy for appealing to "cooperativeinternationalism" by analogy to "cooperative federalism."16Any analogy must, instead, be to the pre-Murphy era whenthe States were not bound by the privilege. Then, testimony compelled in a federal proceeding was admissible in astate prosecution, despite the fact that shared values andsimilar criminal statutes of the state and national jurisdic-tions presumably furnished incentive for overreaching by theGovernment to facilitate criminal prosecutions in the States.But even if Murphy were authority for considering "cooperative federalism" and "cooperative internationalism" asreasons supporting expansion of the scope of the privilege,16 There is indeed nothing comparable to the Fifth Amendment privilege in any supranational prohibition against compelled self-incriminationderived from any source, the privilege being "at best an emerging principle of international law." See Amann, A Whipsaw Cuts Both Ways,45 UCLA L. Rev. 1201, 1259 (1998) (hereinafter Amann).In the course of discussing the Eleventh Circuit case raising the sameissue as this one, Amann suggests nonetheless that the whipsaw rationalehas particular salience on these facts because along with the UnitedStates, Lithuania and Israel are signatories to the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights, Dec. 16, 1966, G. A. Res. 2200, which recognizes something akin to the privilege. See Amann 1233, n. 206. Thesignificance of being bound by the Covenant, however, is limited by itsprovision that the privilege is derogable and accordingly may be infringedif public emergency necessitates. Id., at 1259, n. 354. In any event,Balsys has made no claim under the Covenant, and its current enforceability in the courts of the signatories is an issue that is not before us.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN696 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtany extension would depend ultimately on an analysis of thelikely costs and benefits of extending the privilege as Balsysrequests. If such analysis were dispositive for us, we wouldconclude that Balsys has not shown that extension of theprotection would produce a benefit justifying the rule heseeks.The Court of Appeals directed careful attention to an eval-uation of what would be gained and lost on Balsys's view.It concluded, for example, that few domestic cases would beadversely affected by recognizing the privilege based uponfear of foreign prosecution, 119 F. 3d, at 135-137; 17 thatAmerican contempt sanctions for refusal to testify are so lenient in comparison to the likely consequences of foreignprosecution that a witness would probably refuse to testifyeven if the privilege were unavailable to him, id., at 142(Block, J., concurring); that by statute and treaty the UnitedStates could limit the occasions on which a reasonable fearof foreign prosecution could be shown, as by modifying extradition and deportation standards in cases involving theprivilege, id., at 138-139; and that because a witness's refusalto testify may be used as evidence in a civil proceeding, de-portation of people in Balsys's position would not necessarilybe thwarted by recognizing the privilege as he claims it, id.,at 136.The Court of Appeals accordingly thought the net burdenof the expanded privilege too negligible to justify denyingits expansion. We remain skeptical, however. While wewill not attempt to comment on every element of the Courtof Appeals's calculation, two of the points just noted wouldpresent difficulty. First, there is a question about the standard that should govern any decision to justify a truly discre-tionary ruling by making the assumption that it will inducethe Government to adopt legislation with international im-plications or to seek international agreements, in order to17 The assessment was, of course, necessarily based on experience underthe same-sovereign view of the privilege.524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN697Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmitigate the burdens that the ruling would otherwise im-pose. Because foreign relations are specifically committedby the Constitution to the political branches, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2,we would not make a discretionary judgment premised oninducing them to adopt policies in relation to other nationswithout squarely confronting the propriety of groundingjudicial action on such a premise.Second, the very assumption that a witness's silence maybe used against him in a deportation or extradition proceeding due to its civil nature, 119 F. 3d, at 136 (citing LopezMendoza, 468 U. S., at 1038-1039), raises serious questionsabout the likely gain from recognizing fear of foreign prosecution. For if a witness claiming the privilege ended up ina foreign jurisdiction that, for whatever reason, recognizedno privilege under its criminal law, the recognition of theprivilege in the American courts would have gained nothingfor the witness. This possibility, of course, presents a sharpcontrast with the consequences of recognizing the privilegebased on fear of domestic prosecution. If testimony is compelled, Murphy itself illustrates that domestic courts are noteven wholly dependent on immunity statutes to see that nouse will be made against the witness; the exclusionary principle will guarantee that. See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 79.Whatever the cost to the Government may be, the benefit tothe individual is not in doubt in a domestic proceeding.Since the likely gain to the witness fearing foreign prosecution is thus uncertain, the countervailing uncertaintyabout the loss of testimony to the United States cannot bedismissed as comparatively unimportant. That some testimony will be lost is highly probable, since the United Stateswill not be able to guarantee immunity if testimony iscompelled (absent some sort of cooperative internationalarrangement that we cannot assume will occur). While theCourt of Appeals is doubtless correct that the expected consequences of some foreign prosecutions may be so severethat a witness will refuse to testify no matter what, not524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN698 UNITED STATES v. BALSYSOpinion of the Courtevery foreign prosecution may measure up so harshly asagainst the expectable domestic consequences of contemptfor refusing to testify. We therefore must suppose that onBalsys's view some evidence will in fact be lost to the domestic courts, and we are accordingly unable to dismiss the po-sition of the United States in this case, that domestic lawenforcement would suffer serious consequences if fear offoreign prosecution were recognized as sufficient to invokethe privilege.In sum, the most we would feel able to conclude about thenet result of the benefits and burdens that would follow fromBalsys's view would be a Scotch verdict. If, then, precedentfor the traditional view of the scope of the Clause were notdispositive of the issue before us, if extending the scope ofthe privilege were open to consideration, we still would notfind that Balsys had shown that recognizing his claim wouldbe a sound resolution of the competing interests involved.VThis is not to say that cooperative conduct between theUnited States and foreign nations could not develop to apoint at which a claim could be made for recognizing fear offoreign prosecution under the Self-Incrimination Clause astraditionally understood. If it could be said that the UnitedStates and its allies had enacted substantially similar criminal codes aimed at prosecuting offenses of international char-acter, and if it could be shown that the United States wasgranting immunity from domestic prosecution for the pur-pose of obtaining evidence to be delivered to other nationsas prosecutors of a crime common to both countries, then anargument could be made that the Fifth Amendment shouldapply based on fear of foreign prosecution simply becausethat prosecution was not fairly characterized as distinctly"foreign." The point would be that the prosecution was asmuch on behalf of the United States as of the prosecutingnation, so that the division of labor between evidence gath524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN699Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courterer and prosecutor made one nation the agent of the other,rendering fear of foreign prosecution tantamount to fear ofa criminal case brought by the Government itself.Whether such an argument should be sustained may beleft at the least for another day, since its premises do not fitthis case. It is true that Balsys has shown that the UnitedStates has assumed an interest in foreign prosecution, asdemonstrated by OSI's mandate 18 and American treatyagreements 19 requiring the Government to give to Lithuaniaand Israel any evidence provided by Balsys. But this interest does not rise to the level of cooperative prosecution.There is no system of complementary substantive offenses18 According to Order No. 851-79, reprinted in App. 15-17, the OSI shall"[m]aintain liaison with foreign prosecution, investigation and intelligenceoffices; [u]se appropriate Government agency resources and personnel forinvestigations, guidance, information, and analysis; and [d]irect and coordinate the investigation, prosecution, and any other legal actions institutedin these cases with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorneys Offices, andother relevant Federal agencies."19 The United States and Lithuania have entered into an agreement thatprovides that the two governments "agree to cooperate in prosecution ofpersons who are alleged to have committed war crimes . . . agree to provide mutual legal assistance concerning the prosecution of persons suspected of having committed war crimes . . . will assist each other in thelocation of witnesses believed to possess relevant information about criminal actions . . . during World War II, and agree to intermediate andendeavor to make these witnesses available for the purpose of givingtestimony in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania toauthorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice."Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States Departmentof Justice and the Office of the Procurator General of the Republic of Lithuania Concerning Cooperation in the Pursuit of War Criminals, Aug. 3,1992, reprinted in App. in No. 96-6144 (CA2), pp. 396-397.The District Court found that though it had not been made aware of atreaty between the United States and Israel requiring disclosure of information related to war crimes, OSI had shared such information in the pastand that it would be consistent with OSI's mandate from the AttorneyGeneral for OSI to do so again. 918 F.

BALSYSStevens, J., concurringat issue here, and the mere support of one nation for theprosecutorial efforts of another does not transform theprosecution of the one into the prosecution of the other. Cf.Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 122-124 (1959) (rejectingdouble jeopardy claim where federal officials turned over allevidence they had gathered in connection with federal prosecution of defendant for use in subsequent state prosecutionof defendant). In this case there is no basis for concludingthat the privilege will lose its meaning without a rule pre-cluding compelled testimony when there is a real and substantial risk that such testimony will be used in a criminalprosecution abroad.* * *Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
