Montana's venue rules permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county againsta corporation incorporated elsewhere. This case presentsthe question whether the distinction in treatment offendsthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. We hold that it does not.Respondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnsonwere employed by petitioner Burlington Northern RailroadCompany, a corporation owing its existence to the laws ofDelaware and having a principal place of business in FortWorth, Texas. Ford and Johnson raised a claim under theFederal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, asamended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60, and brought suit in the statetrial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises inSheridan, Wyoming. In each case, Burlington moved tochange venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed tohave its principal place of business in that State. The trialcourt denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the WashingtonLegal Foundation by Daniel J. Popeo and Paul D.

FORDOpinion of the CourtThe Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two casesand affirmed the decisions of the trial court. 250 Mont. 188,819 P. 2d 169 (1991). Under the Montana venue rules, thecourt said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at 190, 819 P. 2d, at 171. The courtrejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rulesworked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amend-ment's Equal Protection Clause. The Montana venue rules,the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basisreview,id., at 193, 819 P. 2d, at 173, which was satisfied, atleast in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery byinjured railroad workers,id., at 194-195, 819 P. 2d, at 173-174. Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did noteven discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and John-son could have sued the corporation in the Federal DistrictCourt for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, amongother places. Id., at 197, 819 P. 2d, at 175. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1070 (1992), and, although our reasoningdiffers from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*A Montana statute provides that "the proper place of trialfor all civil actions is the county in which the defendants orany of them may reside at the commencement of the action."Mont. Code Ann. $ 25-2-118(1) (1991). But, "if none of thedefendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is anycounty the plaintiff designates in the complaint." $ 25-2-118(2). The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that acorporation does not "reside in the state" for venue purposesunless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e. g., Haugv. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P. 2d517, 519 (1989); Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont.469, 472-473, 499 P. 2d 774, 776 (1972); Hanlon v. GreatNorthern R.

S. 648 (1992)Opinion of the Court(1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Mon-tana county in which it has its principal place of business,see, e. g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont.521, 523, 740 P. 2d 676, 677 (1987);Platt v. Sears, Roebuck &Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P. 2d 336, 338 (1986). In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant,permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the onecounty where it has its principal place of business, while aplaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's56 counties. Burlington claims the distinction offends theEqual Protection Clause.The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to "deny toany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. Because the Montanavenue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamentalright nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion,they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless theyfail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends. See, e. g.,United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64 (1989); Dallasv. Stanglin, 490 U. S. 19, 25 (1989).Venue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the placeof trial. See, e. g., Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, 44, n. 10 (1977); Denver & R. G. W. R. Co.v. Trainmen, 387 U. S. 556, 560 (1967); Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612, 623 (1964); F. James & G. Hazard, CivilProcedure 47 (3d ed. 1985). The forum preferable to oneparty may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment ofsuch warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. UnitedStates Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 178(1980). In striking the balance between them, a State mayhave a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard toleratingsome play in the joints of governmental machinery. SeeBain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U. S. 499, 501 (1931).Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its504us2$88z 04-05-96 17:46:45 PAGES OPINPGT652 BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORDOpinion of the Courtconstitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weightto the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in thecounties of their choice under all circumstances. It isequally clear that a State might temper such an "any county"rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants'interests so justified.Here, Montana has decided that the any-county rule shouldgive way to a single-county rule where a defendant residesin Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff 's tactical ad-vantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of adefendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whetherthey have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See PowerManufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, 498 (1927)(Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decidedthat a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is tooslight to outweigh the plaintiff 's interest in suing in theforum of his choice.Burlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that sucha decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individualnonresident defendants. Nor does it argue that such a ruleis unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana. Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional asapplied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that notonly has its home office in some other State or country, butalso has a place of business in Montana that would qualifyas its "principal place of business" if it were a Montanacorporation.Burlington's claim fails. Montana could reasonably havedetermined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's conveniencein litigation than its other offices, that foreign corporations504us2$88z 04-05-96 17:46:45 PAGES OPINPGT653Cite as: 504 U. S. 648 (1992)Opinion of the Courtare unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana, andthat Montana's domestic corporations will probably keepheadquarters within the State. We cannot say, at least noton this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.Cf. G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 410 (1982); Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 585(1935). And upon them Montana may have premised thepolicy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeach-able, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant oflitigating in the county containing its home office is suffi-ciently significant to outweigh a plaintiff 's interest in suingin the county of his choice.Of course Montana's venue rules would have implementedthat policy judgment with greater precision if they hadturned on the location of a corporate defendant's principalplace of business, not on its State of incorporation. But thisis hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review,for "rational distinctions may be made with substantially lessthan mathematical exactitude." New Orleans v. Dukes, 427U. S. 297, 303 (1976); see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.,426 U. S. 794, 814 (1976); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic GasCo., 220 U. S. 61, 78 (1911). Montana may reasonably havethought that the location of a corporate defendant's principalplace of business would not be as readily verifiable as itsState of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the formerwould invite wasteful sideshows of venue litigation, and thatobviating the sideshows would be worth the loss in precision.These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry awayfrom the point of discharging its burden of showing that theunderinclusiveness and overinclusiveness of Montana's venuerules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment. See, e. g.,Brownell, supra, at 584. Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a schemebased on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complainof Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for504us2$88z 04-05-96 17:46:45 PAGES OPINPGT654 BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORDOpinion of the Courtdomicile. See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271U. S. 50, 53-55 (1926); cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.17, 21 (1960).Burlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case. Butit does not. InSaunders, we considered Arkansas' venuerules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation tothose counties where it maintained a place of business, 274U. S., at 491-492, but exposed foreign corporations to suit inany county, id., at 492. We held that the distinction lackeda rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporatedefendants of the equal protection of the laws. Id., at 494.The statutory provision challenged inSaunders, however,applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations sub-ject to its any-county rule probably had a place of businessin Arkansas. In contrast, most of the corporations subjectto Montana's any-county rule probably do not have theirprincipal place of business in Montana. Thus, Arkansas'special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assump-tion thatSaunders is still good law, see American MotoristsIns. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U. S. 637, 645, n. 6 (1976), its holdingdoes not invalidate Montana's venue rules.In sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest. The judg-ment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly
