The commencement of petitioner's civil treble-damagesaction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was timely only if the so-called "injuryand pattern discovery" rule governs the start of the 4-yearlimitations period. We hold that it does not.IIn February 1985, petitioner, Mark Rotella, was admittedto the Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion with a diagnosis ofmajor depression. Rotella v. Pederson, 144 F. 3d 892, 894(CA5 1998). He was discharged in 1986. In 1994, Brookhaven's parent company and one of its directors pleadedguilty to charges of criminal fraud perpetrated through improper relationships and illegal agreements between thecompany and its doctors. Rotella learned of the plea agreement that same year, and in 1997 he filed a civil RICO claimagainst respondents, a group of doctors and related businessentities, in Federal District Court.1*Daniel J. Popeo and Richard A. Samp filed a brief for the WashingtonLegal Foundation et al. as amici curiae urging affirmance.Philip Allen Lacovara, Evan M. Tager, and Gary E. Hughes filed abrief for the American Council of Life Insurance as amicus curiae.1 Rotella alleged that "a group of doctors and their related businessentities . . . improperly conspir[ed] to admit, treat, and retain him atBrookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion for reasons related to their own financialinterests rather than the patient's psychiatric condition." 147 F. 3d 438,439 (CA5 1998). As injuries, he alleged, among other things, confinement528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN552 ROTELLA v. WOODOpinion of the CourtRICO, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968 (1994 ed. and Supp. III),makes it criminal "to conduct" an "enterprise's affairsthrough a pattern of racketeering activity," 18 U. S. C.$ 1962(c), defined as behavior that violates certain other laws,either enumerated federal statutes or state laws addressingspecified topics and bearing specified penalties, 18 U. S. C.$ 1961(1) (Supp. III). "Pattern" is also a defined term re-quiring "at least two acts of racketeering activity . . . , thelast of which occurred within ten years . . . after the commis-sion of a prior act of racketeering activity." 18 U. S. C.$ 1961(5).RICO provides for civil actions (like this one) by which"[a]ny person injured in his business or property" by a RICOviolation may seek treble damages and attorney's fees. 18U. S. C. $ 1964(c) (Supp. III). Rotella alleged such injury, inthat respondents had conspired to admit, treat, and retainhim at Brookhaven not for any medical reason but simply tomaximize their profits. Respondents raised the statute oflimitations as a defense and sought summary judgment onthe ground that the period for bringing the civil action hadexpired before Rotella sued.Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc.,483 U. S. 143, 156 (1987), established a 4-year limitations pe-riod for civil RICO claims. The District Court held that theperiod began when Rotella discovered his injury, which heconcedes he did in 1986 at the latest. 147 F. 3d 438, 439(CA5 1998). Under this "injury discovery" rule, the limita-tions period expired in 1990, and the District Court accordingly ordered summary judgment for respondents. Rotellaappealed to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that the RICO limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff discovers(or should have discovered) both the injury and the patternfor an excessive period because of the conspiracy to draw down his andother patients' insurance coverage, loss of a number of personal items,and fraudulent charges for unnecessary treatment.

After the Fif th Circuit ruledagainst him, ibid., we granted certiorari to address a split ofauthority among the Courts of Appeals on whether thelimitations period is triggered in accordance with the "injuryand pattern discovery" rule invoked by Rotella. 526 U. S.1003 (1999). We now affirm.IIGiven civil RICO's want of any express limitations provision for civil enforcement actions, in Malley-Duff we undertook to derive one and determined that the limitationsperiod should take no account of differences among themultifarious predicate acts of racketeering activity coveredby the statute. Although we chose a uniform 4-year periodon a Clayton Act analogy, $ 4B, as added, 69 Stat. 283, 15U. S. C. $ 15b, we did not decide when the period began torun, and the question has divided the Courts of Appeals.Three distinct approaches emerged in the wake ofMalley-Duff. Some Circuits, like the Fifth in this case,applied an injury discovery accrual rule starting the clockwhen a plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury.See, e. g., Grimmett v. Brown, 75 F. 3d 506, 511 (CA9 1996);McCool v. Strata Oil Co., 972 F. 2d 1452, 1464-1465 (CA71992); Rodriguez v. Banco Central Corp., 917 F. 2d 664, 665-666 (CA1 1990); Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F. 2d1096, 1102 (CA2 1988); Pocahontas Supreme Coal Co. v.Bethlehem Steel Corp., 828 F. 2d 211, 220 (CA4 1987).Some applied the injury and pattern discovery rule thatRotella seeks, under which a civil RICO claim accrues onlywhen the claimant discovers, or should discover, both aninjury and a pattern of RICO activity. See, e. g., Caproniv. Prudential Securities, Inc., 15 F. 3d 614, 619-620 (CA61994); Granite Falls Bank v. Henrikson, 924 F. 2d 150, 154(CA8 1991); Bath v. Bushkin, Gaims, Gaines & Jonas, 913F. 2d 817, 820-821 (CA10 1990); Bivens Gardens Office528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN554 ROTELLA v. WOODOpinion of the CourtBuilding, Inc. v. Barnett Bank, 906 F. 2d 1546, 1554-1555(CA11 1990).The Third Circuit applied a "last predicate act" rule, seeKeystone Ins. Co. v. Houghton, 863 F. 2d 1125, 1130 (CA31988). Under this rule, the period began to run as soon asthe plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury andthe pattern of racketeering activity, but began to run anewupon each predicate act forming part of the same pattern.In Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179 (1997), we cutthe possibilities by one in rejecting the last predicate actrule. Since a pattern of predicate acts can continue indefinitely, with each separated by as many as 10 years, that rulemight have extended the limitations period to many decades,and so beyond any limit that Congress could have contemplated. See ibid. Preserving a right of action for such avast stretch of time would have thwarted the basic objectiveof repose underlying the very notion of a limitations period.See id., at 189. The last predicate act rule was likewise atodds with the model for civil RICO, the Clayton Act, underwhich "[g]enerally, a cause of action accrues and the statutebegins to run when a defendant commits an act that injuresa plaintiff 's business." Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U. S. 321, 338 (1971); Klehr, supra, at 188.The decision in Klehr left two candidates favored by various Courts of Appeals: some form of the injury discoveryrule (preferred by a majority of Circuits to have consideredit), and the injury and pattern discovery rule. Today,guided by principles enunciated in Klehr, we eliminate thelatter.22 We do not, however, settle upon a final rule. In addition to the possibilities entertained in the Courts of Appeals, Justice Scalia hasespoused an "injury occurrence" rule, under which discovery would beirrelevant, Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 198 (1997) (opinionconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), and our decision in Klehrleaves open the possibility of a straight injury occurrence rule. AmicusAmerican Council of Life Insurance urges us to adopt this injury occurrence rule in this case, see Brief for American Council of Life Insurance528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN555Cite as: 528 U. S. 549 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIIIWe think the minority injury and pattern discovery ruleunsound for a number of reasons. We start with the realization that under the provision recognizing the possibility offinding a pattern of racketeering in predicate acts 10 yearsapart, even an injury occurrence rule unsoftened by a discov-ery feature could in theory open the door to proof of predicate acts occurring 10 years before injury and 14 before com-mencement of litigation. A pattern discovery rule wouldallow proof of a defendant's acts even more remote from timeof trial and, hence, litigation even more at odds with thebasic policies of all limitations provisions: repose, eliminationof stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff 's opportunityfor recovery and a defendant's potential liabilities. See, e. g.,Klehr, supra, at 187; Malley-Duff, 483 U. S., at 150, 156; Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 270, 271 (1985).How long is too long is, of course, a matter of judgmentbased on experience, and it gives us great pause that theinjury and pattern discovery rule is an extension of the traditional federal accrual rule of injury discovery, and unwar-ranted by the injury discovery rule's rationale. Federalcourts, to be sure, generally apply a discovery accrual rulewhen a statute is silent on the issue, as civil RICO is here.Klehr, supra, at 191 (citing Connors v. Hallmark & Son CoalCo., 935 F. 2d 336, 342 (CADC 1991), and 1 C. Corman, Limi-tation of Actions $ 6.5.5.1, p. 449 (1991)). But in applying adiscovery accrual rule, we have been at pains to explain thatdiscovery of the injury, not discovery of the other elementsof a claim, is what starts the clock. In the circumstance ofmedical malpractice, where the cry for a discovery rule isloudest, we have been emphatic that the justification for adiscovery rule does not extend beyond the injury:"We are unconvinced that for statute of limitations pur-poses a plaintiff 's ignorance of his legal rights and hisas Amicus Curiae 5-14, but the parties have not focused on this option,and we would not pass upon it without more attentive advocacy.528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN556 ROTELLA v. WOODOpinion of the Courtignorance of the fact of his injury or its cause shouldreceive identical treatment. That he has been injuredin fact may be unknown or unknowable until the injurymanifests itself; and the facts about causation may be inthe control of the putative defendant, unavailable to theplaintiff or at least very difficult to obtain. The prospect is not so bleak for a plaintiff in possession of thecritical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflictedthe injury. He is no longer at the mercy of the latter.There are others who can tell him if he has beenwronged, and he need only ask." United States v.Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 122 (1979).A person suffering from inadequate treatment is thus re-sponsible for determining within the limitations period thenrunning whether the inadequacy was malpractice.We see no good reason for accepting a lesser degree ofresponsibility on the part of a RICO plaintiff. It is true, ofcourse, as Rotella points out, that RICO has a unique patternrequirement, see Malley-Duff, supra, at 154 ("[T]he heart ofany RICO complaint is the allegation of apattern of rack-eteering"); H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492U. S. 229, 236 (1989) (referring to "RICO's key requirementof a pattern of racketeering"). And it is true as well that apattern of predicate acts may well be complex, concealed, orfraudulent. But identifying professional negligence mayalso be a matter of real complexity, and its discovery is notrequired before the statute starts running.Kubrick, supra,at 122, 124. Although we said that the potential malpracticeplaintiff "need only ask" if he has been wronged by a doctor,considerable enquiry and investigation may be necessary before he can make a responsible judgment about the action-ability of the unsuccessful treatment he received. The fact,then, that a considerable effort may be required before aRICO plaintiff can tell whether a pattern of racketeering isdemonstrable does not place him in a significantly differentposition from the malpractice victim. A RICO plaintiff 's528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN557Cite as: 528 U. S. 549 (2000)Opinion of the Courtability to investigate the cause of his injuries is no more im-paired by his ignorance of the underlying RICO pattern thana malpractice plaintiff is thwarted by ignorance of the detailsof treatment decisions or of prevailing standards of medicalpractice.Nor does Rotella's argument gain strength from the factthat some patterns of racketeering will include fraud, whichis generally associated with a different accrual rule; we havealready found the connection between civil RICO and fraudto be an insufficient ground for recognizing a limitationsperiod beyond four years, Malley-Duff, supra, at 149, andthe lenient rule Rotella seeks would amount to backslidingfrom Malley-Duff.What is equally bad is that a less demanding basic discovery rule than federal law generally applies would clash withthe limitations imposed on Clayton Act suits. This is important because, as we have previously noted, there is a clearlegislative record of congressional reliance on the ClaytonAct when RICO was under consideration, see Sedima, S. P.R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 489 (1985), and we haverecognized before that the Clayton Act's injury-focused ac-crual rule was well established by the time civil RICO wasenacted. Klehr, 521 U. S., at 189. In rejecting a signifi-cantly different focus under RICO, therefore, we are honoring an analogy that Congress itself accepted and relied upon,and one that promotes the objectives of civil RICO as readilyas it furthers the objects of the Clayton Act. Both statutesshare a common congressional objective of encouraging civillitigation to supplement Government efforts to deter and pe-nalize the respectively prohibited practices. The object ofcivil RICO is thus not merely to compensate victims but toturn them into prosecutors, "private attorneys general,"dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.3 Id., at 1873 This objective of encouraging prompt litigation to combat racketeeringis the most obvious answer to Rotella's argument that the injury and pattern discovery rule should be adopted because "RICO is to be read528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN558 ROTELLA v. WOODOpinion of the Court(citing Malley-Duff, 483 U. S., at 151) (civil RICO specificallyhas a "further purpose [of] encouraging potential privateplaintiffs diligently to investigate"). The provision for tre-ble damages is accordingly justified by the expected benefitof suppressing racketeering activity, an object pursued thesooner the better. It would, accordingly, be strange to provide an unusually long basic limitations period that couldonly have the effect of postponing whatever public benefitcivil RICO might realize. The Clayton Act avoids any suchpolicy conflict by its accrual rule that "[g]enerally, a causeof action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff 's business,"Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U. S.,at 338, and the Clayton Act analogy reflects the clear intentof Congress to reject a potentially longer basic rule underRICO.In sum, any accrual rule softened by a pattern discoveryfeature would undercut every single policy we have mentioned. By tying the start of the limitations period to aplaintiff 's reasonable discovery of a pattern rather than tothe point of injury or its reasonable discovery, the rule wouldextend the potential limitations period for most civil RICOcases well beyond the time when a plaintiff 's cause of actionis complete,4 as this case shows. Rotella does not deny thatbroadly" and " `liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,' "Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 497-498 (1985) (quotingPub. L. 91-452, $ 904(a), 84 Stat. 947).4 Some Circuits apply injury and pattern discovery out of fear that whenthe injury precedes a second predicate act, the limitations period mightotherwise expire before the pattern is created. E. g., Granite Falls Bankv. Henrikson, 924 F. 2d 150, 154 (CA8 1991). Respondents argue that thisoverlooks the cardinal principle that a limitations period does not beginto run until the cause of action is complete. Rawlings v. Ray, 312 U. S.96, 98 (1941); see also United States v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569 (1954);Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875).The quandary is hypothetical here; Rotella does not dispute that hisinjury in 1986 completed the elements of his cause of action. Hence, we528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN559Cite as: 528 U. S. 549 (2000)Opinion of the Courthe knew of his injury in 1986 when it occurred, or that hiscivil RICO claim was complete and subject to suit at thattime. But under Rotella's rule, the clock would have startedonly in 1994, when he discovered the pattern of predicateacts (his assumption being that he could not reasonably havebeen expected to discover them sooner). A limitations period that would have begun to run only eight years aftera claim became ripe would bar repose, prove a godsend tostale claims, and doom any hope of certainty in identifyingpotential liability. Whatever disputes may arise about pinpointing the moment a plaintiff should have discovered aninjury to himself would be dwarfed by the controversy inherent in divining when a plaintiff should have discovered aracketeering pattern that might well be complex, concealedor fraudulent, and involve harm to parties wholly unrelatedto an injured plaintiff. The fact, as Rotella notes, that difficulty in identifying a pattern is inherent in civil RICO, seeH. J. Inc., 492 U. S., at 235, n. 2 (collecting cases), only rein-forces our reluctance to parlay the necessary complexity ofRICO into worse trouble in applying its limitations rule.Cf.Wilson, 471 U. S., at 270 (discussing need for firmly de-fined, easily applied rules). A pattern discovery rule wouldpatently disserve the congressional objective of a civil en-forcement scheme parallel to the Clayton Act regime, aimedat rewarding the swift who undertake litigation in the pub-lic good.Rotella has two remaining points about which a wordshould be said. We have already encountered his argumentthat differences between RICO and the Clayton Act rendertheir analogy inapt, and we have explained why neither theRICO pattern requirement nor the occurrence of fraud inneed not and do not decide whether civil RICO allows for a cause of actionwhen a second predicate act follows the injury, or what limitations accrualrule might apply in such a case. In any event, doubt about whether aharm might be actionable before a pattern is complete is a weak justification for the cost of a general pattern discovery rule.528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN560 ROTELLA v. WOODOpinion of the CourtRICO patterns is a good reason to ignore the Clayton Actmodel, seesupra, at 556-557. Here it remains only to respond to Rotella's argument that we ourselves undercut theforce of the Clayton Act analogy when we held that RICOhad no racketeering injury requirement comparable to theantitrust injury requirement under the Clayton Act, seeSedima, 473 U. S., at 495. This point not only fails to support but even cuts against Rotella's position. By eliminatingthe complication of anything like an antitrust injury elementwe have, to that extent, recognized a simpler RICO cause ofaction than its Clayton Act counterpart, and RICO's comparative simplicity in this respect surely does not support theadoption of a more protracted basic limitations period.Finally, Rotella returns to his point that RICO patternswill involve fraud in many cases, when he argues that unlessa pattern discovery rule is recognized, a RICO plaintiff willsometimes be barred from suit by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which provides that fraud must be pleaded withparticularity. While we will assume that Rule 9(b) willexact some cost, we are wary of allowing speculation aboutthat cost to control the resolution of the issue here. Rotellahas presented no case in which Rule 9(b) has effectivelybarred a claim like his, and he ignores the flexibility providedby Rule 11(b)(3), allowing pleadings based on evidence reasonably anticipated after further investigation or discovery.See, e. g., Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc. of Peoria,142 F. 3d 1041, 1050-1051 (CA7 1998) (relaxing particularityrequirements of Rule 9(b) where RICO plaintiff lacks accessto all facts necessary to detail claim). It is not that we meanto reject Rotella's concern about allowing "blameless ignorance" to defeat a claim, Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163,170 (1949); we simply do not think such a concern shouldcontrol the decision about the basic limitations rule. In rejecting pattern discovery as a basic rule, we do not unsettlethe understanding that federal statutes of limitations aregenerally subject to equitable principles of tolling, see Holm528US2 Unit: $U30 [06-15-01 20:48:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN561Cite as: 528 U. S. 549 (2000)Opinion of the Courtberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946), and where apattern remains obscure in the face of a plaintiff 's diligencein seeking to identify it, equitable tolling may be one answerto the plaintiff 's difficulty, complementing Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 11(b)(3). See ibid.; see generally Klehr, 521U. S., at 192-193 (noting distinctions between different equitable devices). The virtue of relying on equitable tolling liesin the very nature of such tolling as the exception, not therule.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
