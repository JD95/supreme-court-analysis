This case presents the question whether a motor carrierin bankruptcy may recover for undercharges based on tariffrates that are void as a matter of law under the InterstateCommerce Commission's regulations. We hold that the carrier may not rely on the filed but void tariff.IOn August 20, 1984, petitioner Security Services, Inc.,(then known as Riss International Corp.) filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission or ICC) a mileage(or distance) rate tariff having an effective date 30 days later.The tariff was received, accepted, and filed, and was neverrejected by the ICC. Although the tariff specified rates tobe charged per mile of carriage, it was not complete in itself,for it included no list of distances or map on which a shippercould rely in calculating charges for a given shipment. Forthe distance component of this mileage-based tariff, petitioner relied upon a Household Goods Carriers' Bureau(HGCB) Mileage Guide, its supplements, and subsequent issues. HGCB is itself not a carrier, but a publisher of dis-tance guides for use in tariff filings. The Mileage Guide isa 565-page volume of large format, which specifies the dis-tances in miles between various points of origin and destination, and contains maps and supplemental rules. The Mile-age Guide refers shippers to a separate HGCB tariff and itssupplements, filed with the ICC, for a list of the carriers whoare "participants" in the Mileage Guide. A participant is acarrier who pays HGCB a nominal fee and issues it a validpower of attorney. The first page of HGCB's Mileage Guidestates that it "MAY NOT BE EMPLOYED BY A CAR-RIER AS A GOVERNING PUBLICATION FOR THEPURPOSE OF DETERMINING INTERSTATE TRANS-PORTATION RATES BASED ON MILEAGE OR DISTANCE, UNLESS CARRIER IS SHOWN AS A PARTICI511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:44 PAGES OPINPGT434 SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.Opinion of the CourtPANT IN THE ABOVE NAMED TARIFF." HGCB, Mile-age Guide No. 12, p. 1 (Dec. 1982). HGCB filed a tariff supplement to its Mileage Guide, effective February 19, 1985,listing participants and canceling Riss's participation in theMileage Guide for failure to pay the nominal participation feeto HGCB. HGCB treats a power of attorney issued to it asvoid if not renewed by remitting the participation fee withina reasonable time after cancellation. Riss did not renew.On April 17, 1986, Riss contracted with respondent KmartCorporation to transport Kmart's goods at rates specified inthe contract, and from November 3, 1986, to December 29,1989, Riss transported goods for Kmart under the contract.Riss billed, and Kmart paid, at the contract rate. In November 1989, Riss filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition andwhile undergoing reorganization became Security Services.As debtor-in-possession, Security Services billed Kmart forundercharges (and interest) it was allegedly owed, based onthe difference between the contract rate Kmart paid and thetariff rates that Riss assertedly had on file with the ICC.Security Services argued that under the Interstate Commerce Act's filed rate doctrine, Kmart was liable for the tar-iff rates filed with the ICC, regardless of any contract ratenegotiated. Kmart refused to pay, and this suit ensued.The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted summary judgment for Kmart on the groundthat Security Services had no valid tariff on file with theICC (without which it could not collect for undercharges),because HGCB had canceled its participation in the MileageGuide. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.996 F. 2d 1516 (1993). The court reasoned that under ICCregulations Riss's tariff was void for nonparticipation in theHGCB Mileage Guide, that Riss had not filed any mileagesof its own to replace its canceled participation, and that theconsequently incomplete and void tariff could not support aclaim for undercharges. Id., at 1524. The court took theposition that, although the ICC regulations operated retroactively to void a filed tariff, that retroactive application was511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:44 PAGES OPINPGT435Cite as: 511 U.

Each carrier is responsible for ensuring thatit has rates on file with the ICC. $$ 10702, 10762. UnderICC regulations, a carrier has some choice about the formin which to state its rates, one possibility being a rate basedon mileage. A mileage rate has two components: the rateper mile and distances between shipping points. 49 CFR$ 1312.30 (1993). A carrier may file the distance portion ofthe rate by listing in its own tariff the distances between allrelevant points, by referring to a map attached to its tariff,or by referring to a separately filed distance guide, such asthe HGCB Mileage Guide. $ 1312.30(c)(1). Petitioner doesnot dispute that distance guides are themselves tariffs.Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 4.2 A carrier may refer to a tarifffiled by another carrier or by an agent only by formally "par-ticipating" in the referenced tariff, which may be done onlyby issuing a power of attorney (or concurrence) to the othercarrier or agent. 49 CFR $$ 1312.4(d), 1312.10, 1312.27(e)(1993). The Commission's void-for-nonparticipation regula-tion provides that "a carrier may not participate in a tariffissued in the name of another carrier or an agent unless apower of attorney or concurrence has been executed. Absent effective concurrences or powers of attorney, tariffsare void as a matter of law." $ 1312.4(d). Tariff agents like2 Amicus Overland Express, Inc., contends that participation in mileageguides is not required, citing Revision of Tariff Regulations, All Carriers,1 I. C. C. 2d 404, 425 (1984).

In responseto this enactment and changes in the carrier market, the ICC3 The ICC has apparently had a similar rule for many decades. In Cancelation of Participation in Agency Tariffs, 4 Fed. Reg. 4440 (1939), theCommission made clear that if an agent in whose tariff a carrier participated canceled the carrier's participation for nonpayment of dues or failureto follow the agent's rules, the carrier could no longer lawfully rely on theagent's tariffs and had to file its own tariffs to comply with the Act.511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:44 PAGES OPINPGT438 SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.Opinion of the Courtsimplified its tariff filing rules, as by eliminating the require-ment that the actual powers of attorney be filed with theICC. See 48 Fed. Reg. 31265, 31266 (1983); see also Revision of Tariff Regulations, All Carriers, 1 I. C. C. 2d 404,408 (1984). The ICC's rule that "participation" is required,however, remained in force. See id., at 434; see also 48 Fed.Reg. 31266 (1983) ("The obligation to limit tariff publicationto existing agency relationships remains, however, as a mat-ter of law"). Many shippers and carriers nevertheless responded to the very changes in the market that promptedthe ICC's revision of its rules by ignoring the rates the carriers had filed with the ICC and instead negotiating rates forcarriage lower than the filed rates. As a further result ofcompetitive pressures, many carriers also went bankrupt.A number of trustees and debtors-in-possession then attempted to recover as undercharges the difference betweenthe negotiated and filed rates. Since the market changesconvinced the ICC that strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine was no longer necessary under some circumstances,Maislin, 497 U. S., at 121, the ICC decided to follow a newpolicy of determining, case by case, whether it would be an"unreasonable practice" under 49 U. S. C. $ 10701 for a carrier (often by then bankrupt) to recover for underchargesfrom a shipper who had paid a negotiated, rather than filed,rate. See National Industrial Transportation League--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on Negotiated MotorCommon Carrier Rates, 3 I. C. C. 2d 99, 104-108 (1986);5 I. C. C. 2d 623, 628-634 (1989). In Maislin, we held thatthis ICC practice violated the core purposes of the Act,because "[b]y refusing to order collection of the filed ratesolely because the parties had agreed to a lower rate, theICC has permitted the very price discrimination that theAct by its terms seeks to prevent." 497 U. S., at 130 (citing49 U. S. C. $ 10741). Thus, we held that any bankruptcytrustee or debtor-in-possession was entitled to recover forundercharges based on effective, filed rates.511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT439Cite as: 511 U. S. 431 (1994)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner argues that the effect of the void-for-nonparticipation rule is to allow transactions to be governed bysecretly negotiated rates, rather than the publicly filed ratesmandated by the Act. Petitioner would thus have us see theICC's recent enforcement of its void-for-nonparticipationregulation as merely an attempt to evade Maislin and undermine the filed rate doctrine by keeping trustees or debtorsin-possession from recovering for undercharges.The argument is an odd one.4 The filed rate requirementmandates that carriers charge the rates filed in a tariff. Weheld in Maislin, supra, that the requirement was not subjectto discretionary enforcement when raised against a shipper4 We have no occasion even to reach its factual predicate, which is vigorously disputed. Security Services argues that the agency failed toenforce its regulation from amendment in 1984 until 1993. Petitionercontends that the ICC routinely accepted tariffs containing methodsfor computing distances that were not authorized by 49 CFR $ 1312.30(c)(1993), and that from 1984 to 1988, approximately 40 percent of all motorcarriers filing distance rate tariffs referring to HGCB mileage guides didso without formally participating in them. See Overland Express, 996 F.2d, at 359. Petitioner states that the ICC took no action after discoveringthese failures to participate. The Government argues that the ICC currently enforces its void-for-nonparticipation rule. It represents, for example, that in fiscal year 1993, the ICC "entered 24 consent decrees withcarriers who had let their participations in mileage guides and other tariffslapse, . . . sought and obtained one injunction, and . . . issued an orderpursuant to its broad remedial powers" directing carriers who had let theirparticipation in the HGCB lapse either to renew their participation or"strike any reference" to the Mileage Guide in their tariffs. Tr. of OralArg. 42. The Government also disputes the assertion that 40 percent ofcarriers referring to an HGCB guide failed to participate in the guide.The Government and Kmart claim that HGCB found only 111 such failuresamong the filings of some 12,800 carriers who referred to HGCB guides,and that the ICC has taken action for failure to participate.

KMART CORP.Opinion of the Courtwho had agreed with a carrier to a negotiated rate lowerthan the rate on file. When the carrier's bankruptcyprompted second thoughts about the wisdom of the agree-ment, the carrier and its creditors obtained the benefit of therequirement. Here, as in Jasper Wyman, supra, the carrierseeks to escape its burden by recovering for underchargeseven though in effect it had no rates on file because its tarifflacked an essential element. The filed rate rule applied hereto bar the carrier's recovery is the same rule that was ap-plied to bar the shipper's defense. Nor is the rule somehowmore technical or less equitable when applied against Secu-rity Services. It can hardly be gainsaid that a carrier employing distance rates without purporting to be bound bystated distances would be just as well placed to discriminateamong shippers by measuring with rubber instruments as itwould be by charging shippers for a stated distance at mutable rates per mile. While some may debate in other forumsabout the wisdom of the filed rate doctrine, it is enough tosay here that the carriers cannot have it both ways.5IIIPetitioner is left to invoke the limitations on the ICC'sauthority to declare a rate void retroactively, and the "technical defect" rule.6 Neither is availing.5 Both Justice Thomas, post, at 451, and n. 3, and Justice Ginsburg,post, at 457-458, argue that the effect of today's ruling is to validate secretly negotiated rates. Indeed, Justice Thomas goes so far as to suggest that our opinion would allow the ICC to circumvent Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116 (1990), merely bydeclaring that a filed rate is void whenever another rate is negotiated,post, at 455. But our opinion does nothing of the kind. The InterstateCommerce Act states that carriers may provide transportation "only ifthe rate for the transportation or service is contained in a tariff that is ineffect" under the provisions of the Act, 49 U. S. C. $ 10761(a), and the Actprovides for civil and criminal penalties for failure to maintain such rates,and to charge or pay them. See generally $$ 11901-11904.6 Justice Thomas in dissent argues that we ignore petitioner's "broaderargument . . . that the rule is not within the Commission's authority."See post, at 453, n. 4. But petitioner's question presented was whether511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT441Cite as: 511 U. S. 431 (1994)Opinion of the CourtAThe Court of Appeals believed, 996 F. 2d, at 1524-1526,as petitioner now argues, that the void-for-nonparticipationrule retroactively voids rates and is thus subject to the anal-ysis we applied inAmerican Trucking, 467 U. S., at 361-364,367. See also Overland Express, 996 F. 2d, at 360. InAmerican Trucking, we held that the Commission could ret-roactively void effective tariffs ab initio only if the action"further[s] a specific statutory mandate of the Commission"and is "directly and closely tied to that mandate." 467 U. S.,at 367. But the rule is not apposite here, for the void-for-nonparticipation regulation does not apply retroactively.The ICC did not, as in American Trucking, void a rate for aperiod during which an effective rate was filed. The ICC'sregulations operate to void tariffs that would otherwiseapply to future transactions, by providing that the rate becomes inapplicable when the tariff reference to the MileageGuide is canceled, i. e., from the moment at which examination of the tariff filings would show that the carrier's tariffis incomplete, 49 CFR $ 1312.10(a) (1993), after which theshipper would be unable to rely on the incomplete tariff tocalculate the applicable charges.7 Transactions occurringbefore cancellation of the power of attorney are governed by"the Interstate Commerce Commission has discretionary authority to retroactively void an effective tariff." Brief for Petitioner i. On the samepage cited by Justice Thomas for petitioner's "broader argument," petitioner in fact describes the ICC rule as "treating [tariffs] as retroactivelyvoid," id., at 20, and petitioner concludes the section by arguing that theICC has no power "to retroactively void effective tariffs." Id., at 24.Petitioner's argument in that section is that the Interstate CommerceAct "prescribes the remedies available to Kmart," id., at 17, not that theregulation is ultra vires. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for petitioner stated that the ICC's void-for-nonparticipation rule "is authorized.The rule is proper, but the application of the rule . . . is contrary to law."Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.7 If a canceled participation is renewed before the effective cancellationdate, participation may be restored on five days' notice by filing anamended tariff. 49 CFR $ 1312.39(a) (1993).511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT442 SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.Opinion of the Courtthe filed rate; transactions occurring after cancellation wouldhave no filed mileages to which a carrier's per-mile tariffrates would apply to determine charges due. The regula-tion does not require any ICC "retroactive rejection" of afiled rate, or indeed any agency action at all. The regulationworks like an expiration date on an otherwise valid tariff invoiding its future application, in accordance with $ 1312.23(a).Neither regulation works a retroactive voiding. We thusdisagree with the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-bia Circuit, which held that once a tariff is in effect, a regulation that voids the tariff operates retroactively. OverlandExpress, supra, at 360.Here, petitioner's tariff reference to the HGCB MileageGuide became void as a matter of law and its tariff filingsincomplete on their face on February 19, 1985, when HGCBcanceled its participation in the Mileage Guide by filing asupplemental tariff. The transactions with Kmart occurredafter that date. BNor does the "technical defect" rule apply here. Underour cases, neither procedural irregularity nor unreasonableness nullifies a filed rate; the shipper's remedy for irregular-ity or unreasonable rates is damages. See,e. g., BerwindWhite Coal Mining Co. v. Chicago & Erie R. Co., 235 U. S.371 (1914); Davis v. Portland Seed Co., 264 U. S. 403 (1924).In Berwind-White, the Court held that filed tariffs fallingshort of full compliance in stylistic matters were still "adequate to give notice" and so could support a carrier's claimagainst a shipper for charges due. 235 U. S., at 375. InDavis, the effect of applying the carrier's tariff violated aformer statutory bar to charging less for a longer distancethan for a shorter one over the same route, other thingsbeing equal. The Court rejected the position that thehigher rate was void and the lower rate legally applicable,so that damages would depend upon the difference betweenthe two, and held that the shipper's remedy was instead to511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT443Cite as: 511 U. S. 431 (1994)Opinion of the Courtbe measured by its actual damages from having beencharged the higher rate as compared to a reasonable one.264 U. S., at 424-426.8Unlike the shippers in the "technical defect" cases, theshipper here could not determine the carrier's rates, sinceunder the regulations, distance tariffs are incomplete oncethe carrier's participation in the Mileage Guide has beencanceled by the agent's filing. See 49 CFR $$ 1312.4(d),1312.10(a), 1312.30 (1993). We are dealing not with a com-plete tariff subject to some blemish independently remediable, but with an incomplete tariff insufficient to support areliable calculation of charges. Security Services, however,questions the distinction by arguing that a shipper is unlikely to search for the list of participating carriers and todetermine from the agent's supplemental tariffs that a carri-er's participation has been canceled. Rather, a shipper islikely only to follow the reference in the carrier's tariff to theHGCB Mileage Guide, and can fully calculate the applicablecharges. But the likelihood or unlikelihood of a shipper'sactually reading all the applicable tariffs is simply irrelevant,for carriers and shippers alike are charged with construc-tive notice of tariff filings,Kansas City Southern R. Co. v.Carl, 227 U. S. 639, 653 (1913); Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S., at266, and the fact that shippers may take shortcuts throughthe filings cannot convert an incomplete tariff into a complete one. In sum, a tariff that refers to another tariff foressential information, which tariff in turn states that thecarrier may not refer to it, does not provide the "adequatenotice" of rates to be charged that our "technical defect"cases require.8 See also Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Cisco Oil Mill, 204 U. S. 449 (1907)(Tariff rates filed with ICC and furnished to freight officers of railroad arelegally operative despite railroad's failure to post two copies in each railroad depot); Genstar Chemical Ltd. v.

KMART CORP.Thomas, J., dissentingIVWhen a carrier relies on a mileage guide filed by anothercarrier or agent, under ICC regulations the carrier must participate in the guide by maintaining a power of attorney;when a carrier fails to maintain its power of attorney andits participation is canceled by its former agent's filing ofan appropriate tariff, the carrier's tariff is void. Trusteesin bankruptcy and debtors-in-possession may rely on thefiled rate doctrine to collect for undercharges,Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.
