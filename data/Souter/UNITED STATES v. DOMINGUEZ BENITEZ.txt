Respondent claims the right to withdraw his plea of guiltyas a consequence of the District Court's failure to give oneof the warnings required by Federal Rule of Criminal Proce-dure 11. Because the claim of Rule 11 error was not preserved by timely objection, the plain-error standard of Rule52(b) applies, with its requirement to prove effect on substantial rights. The question is what showing must thus bemade to obtain relief for an unpreserved Rule 11 failing, andwe hold that a defendant is obliged to show a reasonableprobability that, but for the error, he would not have enteredthe plea.IIn early May 1999, a confidential informant working withlaw enforcement arranged through respondent Carlos Do-minguez Benitez (hereinafter Dominguez) to buy severalpounds of methamphetamine. First, the informant got asample from Dominguez, and a week later Dominguez wentto a restaurant in Anaheim, California, to consummate thesale in the company of two confederates, one of whombrought a shopping bag with over a kilogram of the drugs.The meeting ended when the informant gave a signal andofficers arrested the dealers. Dominguez confessed to selling the methamphetamine and gave information about hissupplier and confederates.*Stevan A.

S. 74 (2004)Opinion of the CourtA federal grand jury indicted Dominguez on two counts:conspiracy to possess more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, and possession of 1,391 grams of a methamphetaminemixture, both with intent to distribute. On the conspiracycount, Dominguez faced a statutory, mandatory minimumsentence of 10 years, with a maximum of life. 84 Stat. 1260,21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A), 846. The District Court ap-pointed counsel, who began talking with the Governmentabout a plea agreement.In September 1999, the District Court received the first ofseveral letters from Dominguez,1 in which he asked for a newlawyer and expressed discomfort with the plea agreementhis counsel was encouraging him to sign. On counsel's mo-tion, the court held a status conference, at which Dominguezspoke to the judge. Again he said he was dissatisfied withhis representation, and wanted a "better deal." The courtasked whether he was "talking about a disposition . . . otherthan trial," and Dominguez answered, "At no time have Idecided to go to any trial." App. 46-47. Counsel spoke tothe same effect later in the proceeding, when he said that hehad "told [the prosecutor] all along that there won't be a trialon the [date set] based on my client's representations that hedoesn't want a trial." Id., at 51. The court explained toDominguez that it could not help him in plea negotiations,and found no reason to change counsel.Shortly after that, the parties agreed that Dominguezwould plead guilty to the conspiracy, and the Governmentwould dismiss the possession charge. The Government stipulated that Dominguez would receive what is known as asafety-valve reduction of two levels. See United StatesSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $$ 2D1.1(b)(6),1 Dominguez speaks and writes Spanish, not English. A certified translator was present for the hearings in court we describe, and for the pleaagreement. Some of the letters are in English, and the record does notshow who translated them or assisted Dominguez in writing them.542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN78 UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZOpinion of the Court5C1.2 (Nov. 1999) (hereinafter USSG).2 The safety valvewas important because it would allow the court to invoke 18U. S. C. $ 3553(f ), authorizing a sentence below the otherwisemandatory minimum in certain cases of diminished culpability, the only chance Dominguez had for a sentence under 10years. That chance turned on satisfying five conditions, onegoing to Dominguez's criminal history, which the agreementdid not address. The agreement did, however, warn Dominguez that it did not bind the sentencing court, and that Do-minguez could not withdraw his plea if the court did notaccept the Government's stipulations or recommendations.At a hearing the next day, Dominguez changed his plea toguilty. In the plea colloquy, the court gave almost all therequired Rule 11 warnings, including the warning that theplea agreement did not bind the court, but the judge failedto mention that Dominguez could not withdraw his plea ifthe court did not accept the Government's recommendations.See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(B).3When the Probation Office subsequently issued its report,it found that Dominguez had three prior convictions, two ofthem under other names, which neither defense counsel northe prosecutor had known at the time of the plea negotiations. The upshot was that Dominguez was ineligible forthe safety valve, and so had no chance to escape the sentenceof 10 years. After receiving two more letters from Domin-guez complaining about the quality of counsel's representa2 The agreement also contemplated that Dominguez's total offense levelunder the Guidelines would be 27, after considering the safety valve anda downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Assuming so,and assuming he had no (or minimal) criminal history, his sentence couldhave been as low as 70 months. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table).3 At the time of the plea hearing, the requirement appeared at FederalRule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(2). It has not changed in substance.We refer to the current Rule in the text of this opinion, and do likewisefor Rules 11(h) and 52(b), each of which has also received a stylisticamendment.542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN79Cite as: 542 U. S. 74 (2004)Opinion of the Courttion, the District Court sentenced Dominguez to the manda-tory minimum. At the sentencing hearing, all counsel toldthe court that they had thought Dominguez might at leasthave been eligible for the safety-valve mitigation, but agreedthat with three convictions, he was not. Dominguez told thecourt that he had "never had any knowledge about the pointsof responsibility, the safety valve, or anything like that."App. 109. The court replied that in light of the "lengthychange of plea proceedings" it was "difficult . . . to acceptwhat" Dominguez said. Id., at 112.On appeal, Dominguez argued that the District Court'sfailure to warn him, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that hecould not withdraw his guilty plea if the court did not accept the Government's recommendations required reversal.After waiting for United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55 (2002),a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitagreed, 310 F. 3d 1221 (2002), and cited United States v.Olano, 507 U. S. 725 (1993), in applying the plain-error standard. The court held that the District Court had indeederred; and that the error was plain, affected Dominguez'ssubstantial rights, and required correction in the interestsof justice.To show that substantial rights were affected, the Courtof Appeals required Dominguez to "prove that the court'serror was not minor or technical and that he did not understand the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea."310 F. 3d, at 1225.4 The court rejected the Government'sarguments that the written plea agreement or the DistrictCourt's other statements in the plea colloquy sufficiently advised Dominguez of his rights, given Dominguez's inabilityto speak English and the assurances of both counsel thathe would likely qualify under the safety-valve provision.Judge Tallman dissented, with the warning that the majori4 Other Courts of Appeals employed different tests.

S. 1072 (2003), on the ques-tion "[w]hether, in order to show that a violation of FederalRule of Criminal Procedure 11 constitutes reversible plainerror, a defendant must demonstrate that he would not havepleaded guilty if the violation had not occurred." Pet. forCert. (I). We now reverse.IIABecause the Government agreed to make a nonbindingsentencing recommendation, Rule 11(c)(3)(B) required thecourt to "advise the defendant that the defendant has noright to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow therecommendation or request." Rule 11, however, instructsthat not every violation of its terms calls for reversal of conviction by entitling the defendant to withdraw his guiltyplea. "A variance from the requirements of this rule isharmless error if it does not affect substantial rights." Fed.Rule Crim. Proc. 11(h).5In Vonn, we considered the standard that applies when adefendant is dilatory in raising Rule 11 error, and held thatreversal is not in order unless the error is plain. 535 U. S.,at 63; seeOlano, supra, at 731-737. Although we explainedthat in assessing the effect of Rule 11 error, a reviewingcourt must look to the entire record, not to the plea proceed-ings alone, Vonn, supra, at 74-75, we did not formulate thestandard for determining whether a defendant has shown, asthe plain-error standard requires, Olano, supra, at 734-735,an effect on his substantial rights.5 Congress gave the courts this instruction in 1983, in partial responseto this Court's decision in McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459 (1969),which it felt had caused too many reversals for reasons that were tooinsubstantial. See United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 66-71 (2002) (discussing the history of Rule 11(h)).542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN81Cite as: 542 U. S. 74 (2004)Opinion of the CourtBIt is only for certain structural errors undermining thefairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole that even preserved error requires reversal without regard to the mistake's effect on the proceeding. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309-310 (1991) (giving examples).Dominguez does not argue that either Rule 11 error generally or the Rule 11 error here is structural in this sense.6Otherwise, relief for error is tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as "error that affectssubstantial rights," used in Rule 52, has previously beentaken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcomeof a judicial proceeding. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328U. S. 750 (1946). To affect "substantial rights," see 28U. S. C. $ 2111, an error must have "substantial and injuriouseffect or influence in determining the . . . verdict." Kotteakos, supra, at 776.7 In cases where the burden of demonstrating prejudice (or materiality) is on the defendant seeking relief, we have invoked a standard with similaritiesto the Kotteakos formulation in requiring the showing of6 The argument, if made, would not prevail. The omission of a singleRule 11 warning without more is not colorably structural. Cf. UnitedStates v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 783-784 (1979) (holding that Rule 11error without more is not cognizable on collateral review).7 When the Government has the burden of addressing prejudice, as inexcusing preserved error as harmless on direct review of the criminalconviction, it is not enough to negate an effect on the outcome of the case.See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967) ("[T]he court must beable to declare a belief that [constitutional error] was harmless beyond areasonable doubt"). When the Government has the burden of showingthat constitutional trial error is harmless because it comes up on collateralreview, the heightened interest in finality generally calls for the Government to meet the more lenient Kotteakos standard. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 638 (1993). If the burden is on a defendant to showprejudice in the first instance, of course, it would be easier to show areasonable doubt that constitutional error affected a trial than to show alikely effect on the outcome or verdict.542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN82 UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZOpinion of the Court"a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed],the result of the proceeding would have been different."United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion ofBlackmun, J.) (adopting the prejudice standard of Stricklandv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984), for claims underBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963) (internal quotationmarks omitted)); 473 U. S., at 685 (White, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment) (same).8No reason has appeared for treating the phrase "affectingsubstantial rights" as untethered to a prejudice requirementwhen applying Olano to this nonstructural error, or fordoubting that Bagley is a sensible model to follow. As Vonnmakes clear, the burden of establishing entitlement to relieffor plain error is on the defendant claiming it, and for severalreasons, we think that burden should not be too easy fordefendants in Dominguez's position. First, the standardshould enforce the policies that underpin Rule 52(b) generally, to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief forunpreserved error. See Vonn, 535 U. S., at 73. Second, itshould respect the particular importance of the finality ofguilty pleas, which usually rest, after all, on a defendant's8 This standard is similar to one already applied by some Courts of Appeals, though those courts have not drawn a direct connection to Strickland and Bagley, and in some cases understood themselves to be reviewing for harmless, rather than plain, error. See United States v. Martinez,289 F. 3d 1023, 1029 (CA7 2002) (on plain-error review, asking "whetherany Rule 11 violations would have likely affected [the defendant's] willingness to plead guilty"); see also United States v. Johnson, 1 F. 3d 296,302 (CA5 1993) (en banc) (on harmless-error review, asking "whether thedefendant's knowledge and comprehension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty");cf. United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734-735 (1993) (the main difference as to substantial rights in the harmless- and plain-error analyses isthat the burden of persuasion shifts from Government to defendant).542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN83Cite as: 542 U. S. 74 (2004)Opinion of the Courtprofession of guilt in open court, and are indispensable inthe operation of the modern criminal justice system. SeeUnited States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784 (1979). And,in this case, these reasons are complemented by the fact,worth repeating, that the violation claimed was of Rule 11,not of due process.We hold, therefore, that a defendant who seeks reversal ofhis conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must showa reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would nothave entered the plea. A defendant must thus satisfy thejudgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is "sufficientto undermine confidence in the outcome" of the proceeding.Strickland, supra, at 694; Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion ofBlackmun, J. (internal quotation marks omitted)).99 One significant difference, however, between Rule 11 claims and claimsunder Strickland and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), is that thelatter may be raised in postconviction proceedings such as a petition forhabeas corpus, or a motion to vacate a sentence under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255.Those proceedings permit greater development of the record. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500 (2003) (Strickland claims are not procedurally defaulted when brought for the first time on $ 2255, because of theadvantages of that form of proceeding for hearing such cases). For Rule11 claims, by contrast, that way is open only in the most egregious cases.Timmreck, supra; see also Vonn, 535 U. S., at 64 (noting that Rule 11(h)was not meant to disturb Timmreck). A defendant will rarely, if ever, beable to obtain relief for Rule 11 violations under $ 2255; and relief on directappeal, given the plain-error standard that will apply in many cases, willbe difficult to get, as it should be. Cf. United States v. Raineri, 42 F. 3d36, 45 (CA1 1994) (Boudin, J.) ("[J]ust as there are many fair trials but fewperfect ones, so flaws are also to be expected in Rule 11 proceedings").Our rule does not, however, foreclose relief altogether. Thereasonable-probability standard is not the same as, and should not be confused with, a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance ofthe evidence that but for error things would have been different. SeeKyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434 (1995).542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN84 UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZOpinion of the CourtCWhat we have already said points to why the test appliedby the Court of Appeals in this case fell short. Its first element was whether the error was "minor or technical," 310F. 3d, at 1225, a phrase it took fromUnited States v. Graibe,946 F. 2d 1428 (CA9 1991), which in turn found it in the 1983commentary that accompanied the amendment to Rule 11(h).946 F. 2d, at 1433. But this element requires no examination of the effect of the omitted warning on a defendant'sdecision, a failing repeated to a significant extent by the second element of the Ninth Circuit's test, taken from UnitedStates v. Minore, 292 F. 3d 1109 (CA9 2002), which askswhether the defendant understood "the rights at issue whenhe entered his guilty plea." 310 F. 3d, at 1225. True, thisenquiry gets closer than the first to a consideration of thelikely effect of Rule 11 error on the defendant's decision toplead; assessing a claim that an error affected a defendant'sdecision to plead guilty must take into account any indicationthat the omission of a Rule 11 warning misled him. But thestandard of the Court of Appeals does not allow consider-ation of any record evidence tending to show that a misunderstanding was inconsequential to a defendant's decision, orevidence indicating the relative significance of other factsthat may have borne on his choice regardless of any Rule11 error.10Relevant evidence that the Court of Appeals thus passedover in this case included Dominguez's statement to the District Court that he did not intend to go to trial, and his coun10 This is another point of contrast with the constitutional questionwhether a defendant's guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We haveheld, for example, that when the record of a criminal conviction obtainedby guilty plea contains no evidence that a defendant knew of the rightshe was putatively waiving, the conviction must be reversed. Boykin v.Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969). We do not suggest that such a conviction could be saved even by overwhelming evidence that the defendantwould have pleaded guilty regardless.542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN85Cite as: 542 U. S. 74 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsel's confirmation of that representation, made at the samehearing. The neglected but relevant considerations also included the implications raised by Dominguez's protests atthe sentencing hearing. He claimed that when he pleadedguilty he had "never had any knowledge about the points ofresponsibility, the safety valve, or anything like that." App.109. These statements, if credited, would show that Dominguez was confused about the law that applied to his sentence,about which the court clearly informed him, but they do notsuggest any causal link between his confusion and the partic-ular Rule 11 violation on which he now seeks relief.Other matters that may be relevant but escape noticeunder the Ninth Circuit's test are the overall strength of theGovernment's case and any possible defenses that appearfrom the record, subjects that courts are accustomed to considering in a Strickland or Brady analysis. When the record made for a guilty plea and sentencing reveals evidence,as this one does, showing both a controlled sale of drugs toan informant and a confession, one can fairly ask a defendantseeking to withdraw his plea what he might ever havethought he could gain by going to trial. The point of thequestion is not to second-guess a defendant's actual decision;if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error, it is no matter that the choice may have beenfoolish. The point, rather, is to enquire whether the omittedwarning would have made the difference required by thestandard of reasonable probability; it is hard to see here howthe warning could have had an effect on Dominguez's assessment of his strategic position. And even if there were reason to think the warning from the bench could have mattered, there was the plea agreement, read to Dominguez inhis native Spanish, which specifically warned that he couldnot withdraw his plea if the court refused to accept theGovernment's recommendations. This fact, uncontested byDominguez, tends to show that the Rule 11 error made nodifference to the outcome here.542US1 Unit: $U60 [10-25-06 13:01:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN86 UNITED STATES v.
