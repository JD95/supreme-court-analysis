Subsection(g)(1)(D) speaks of a violation when someone suffers an "adverse effect" from any other failure to hew to the terms ofthe Act. Like the inspection and correction infractions,breaches of the statute with adverse consequences are addressed by specific terms governing relief:"In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this section in which the courtdetermines that the agency acted in a manner which wasintentional or willful, the United States shall be liableto the individual in an amount equal to the sum of--"(A) actual damages sustained by the individual as aresult of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall aperson entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of$1,000; and"(B) the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court." $ 552a(g)(4).11 The Privacy Act says nothing about standards of proof governing equitable relief that may be open to victims of adverse determinations or effects, although it may be that this inattention is explained by the generalprovisions for equitable relief within the Administrative Procedure Act(APA), 5 U.

Indeed, the District Court relied on the APA indetermining that it had jurisdiction to enforce the stipulated order prohibiting the Department of Labor from using Social Security numbers in multiparty captions.

CHAOOpinion of the CourtIIIDoe argues that subsection (g)(4)(A) entitles any plaintiffadversely affected by an intentional or willful violation tothe $1,000 minimum on proof of nothing more than a statu-tory violation: anyone suffering an adverse consequence ofintentional or willful disclosure is entitled to recovery. TheGovernment claims the minimum guarantee goes only to victims who prove some actual damages. We think the Gov-ernment has the better side of the argument.To begin with, the Government's position is supported bya straightforward textual analysis. When the statute getsto the point of guaranteeing the $1,000 minimum, it not onlyhas confined any eligibility to victims of adverse effectscaused by intentional or willful actions, but has provided ex-pressly for liability to such victims for "actual damages sustained." It has made specific provision, in other words, forwhat a victim within the limited class may recover. Whenthe very next clause of the sentence containing the explicitprovision guarantees $1,000 to a "person entitled to recovery," the simplest reading of that phrase looks back to theimmediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages, which is also the Act's sole provision for recoveringanything (as distinct from equitable relief). With such anobvious referent for "person entitled to recovery" in theplaintiff who sustains "actual damages," Doe's theory isimmediately questionable in ignoring the "actual damages"language so directly at hand and instead looking for "a person entitled to recovery" in a separate part of the statutedevoid of any mention either of recovery or of what mightbe recovered.Nor is it too strong to say that Doe does ignore statutorylanguage. When Doe reads the statute to mean that theUnited States shall be liable to any adversely affected subject of an intentional or willful violation, without more, hetreats willful action as the last fact necessary to make theGovernment "liable," and he is thus able to describe anyone540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 540 U. S. 614 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto whom it is liable as entitled to the $1,000 guarantee. Butthis way of reading the statute simply pays no attention tothe fact that the statute does not speak of liability (and con-sequent entitlement to recovery) in a freestanding, unqualified way, but in a limited way, by reference to enumerateddamages.2Doe's manner of reading "entitle[ment] to recovery" as sat-isfied by adverse effect caused by intentional or willful violation is in tension with more than the text, however. It is atodds with the traditional understanding that tort recoveryrequires not only wrongful act plus causation reaching tothe plaintiff, but proof of some harm for which damages canreasonably be assessed. See, e. g., W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts$ 30 (5th ed. 1984). Doe, instead, identifies a person as entitled to recover without any reference to proof of damages,actual or otherwise. Doe might respond that it makes senseto speak of a privacy tort victim as entitled to recover without reference to damages because analogous common lawwould not require him to show particular items of injury inorder to receive a dollar recovery. Traditionally, the com-mon law has provided such victims with a claim for "general"damages, which for privacy and defamation torts are pre-sumed damages: a monetary award calculated without reference to specific harm.32 Indeed, if adverse effect of intentional or willful violation were aloneenough to make a person entitled to recovery, then Congress could haveconditioned the entire subsection (g)(4)(A) as applying only to "a personentitled to recovery." That, of course, is not what Congress wrote. Aswe mentioned before, Congress used the entitled-to-recovery phrase onlyto describe those entitled to the $1,000 guarantee, and it spoke of entitlement and guarantee only after referring to an individual's actual damages,indicating that "actual damages" is a further touchstone of the entitlement.3 3 Restatement of Torts $ 621, Comment a (1938) ("It is not necessaryfor the plaintiff [who is seeking general damages in an action for defamation] to prove any specific harm to his reputation or any other loss causedthereby"); 4 id., $ 867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages are avail540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN622 DOE v. CHAOOpinion of the CourtSuch a rejoinder would not pass muster under the PrivacyAct, however, because a provision of the Act not previouslymentioned indicates beyond serious doubt that general dam-ages are not authorized for a statutory violation. An uncodified section of the Act established a Privacy ProtectionStudy Commission, which was charged, among its other jobs,to consider "whether the Federal Government should be lia-ble for general damages incurred by an individual as the result of a willful or intentional violation of the provisions ofsections 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) of title 5."4 $ 5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88Stat. 1907. Congress left the question of general damages,that is, for another day. Because presumed damages aretherefore clearly unavailable, we have no business treatingjust any adversely affected victim of an intentional or willfulviolation as entitled to recovery, without something more.This inference from the terms of the Commission's mandate is underscored by drafting history showing that Con-gress cut out the very language in the bill that would haveauthorized any presumed damages.5 The Senate bill wouldhave authorized an award of "actual and general damagesable for privacy torts "in the same way in which general damages aregiven for defamation," without proof of "pecuniary loss [or] physicalharm"); see also 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 621, Comment a (1976).4 The Commission ultimately recommended that the Act should "permitthe recovery of special and general damages . . . but in no case should aperson entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000 or morethan the sum of $10,000 for general damages in excess of the dollar amountof any special damages." Personal Privacy in an Information Society: TheReport of the Privacy Protection Study Commission 531 (July 1977).5 On this point, we do not understand Justice Ginsburg's dissent totake issue with our conclusion that Congress explicitly rejected the proposal to make presumed damages available for Privacy Act violations.Instead, Justice Ginsburg appears to argue only that Congress wouldhave wanted nonpecuniary harm to qualify as actual damages under subsection (g)(4)(A). Post, at 635, n. 4 (plaintiff may recover for emotionaldistress " `that he proves to have been actually suffered by him' " (quoting3 Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, at 402, Comment b)). That issue,however, is not before us today. See n. 12, infra.540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN623Cite as: 540 U. S. 614 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsustained by any person," with that language followed by theguarantee that "in no case shall a person entitled to recoveryreceive less than the sum of $1,000." S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2dSess., $ 303(c)(1) (1974). Although the provision for generaldamages would have covered presumed damages, see n. 3,supra, this language was trimmed from the final statute,subject to any later revision that might be recommended bythe Commission. The deletion of "general damages" fromthe bill is fairly seen, then, as a deliberate elimination of anypossibility of imputing harm and awarding presumed damages.6 The deletion thus precludes any hope of a sound in-terpretation of entitlement to recovery without reference toactual damages.7Finally, Doe's reading is open to the objection that no purpose is served by conditioning the guarantee on a person'sbeing entitled to recovery. As Doe treats the text, Congress could have accomplished its object simply by providingthat the Government would be liable to the individual foractual damages "but in no case . . . less than the sum of$1,000" plus fees and costs. Doe's reading leaves the reference to entitlement to recovery with no job to do, and itaccordingly accomplishes nothing.86 While theoretically there could also have been a third category, thatof "nominal damages," it is implausible that Congress intended tacitly torecognize a nominal damages remedy after eliminating the explicit reference to general damages.7 Justice Scalia does not join this paragraph or footnote 8.8 Justice Ginsburg responds that our reading is subject to a similarcriticism: "Congress more rationally [c]ould have written: `actual damages. . . but in no case shall a person who proves such damages [in any amount]receive less than $1,000.' " Post, at 630. Congress's use of the entitlement phrase actually contained in the statute, however, is explained bydrafting history. The first bill passed by the Senate authorized recoveryof both actual and general damages. See supra, at 622 and this page.At that point, when discussing eligibility for the $1,000 guarantee, it wasreasonable to refer to plaintiffs with either sort of damages by the generalterm "a person entitled to recovery." When subsequent amendment limited recovery to actual damages by eliminating the general, no one appar540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN624 DOE v. CHAOOpinion of the CourtIVThere are three loose ends. Doe's argument suggests itwould have been illogical for Congress to create a cause ofaction for anyone who suffers an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action, then deny recovery withoutactual damages. But this objection assumes that the language in subsection (g)(1)(D) recognizing a federal "civil ac-tion" on the part of someone adversely affected was meant,without more, to provide a complete cause of action, and ofcourse this is not so. A subsequent provision requires proofof intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect, and ifthe specific state of mind must be proven additionally, it isequally consistent with logic to require some actual damagesas well. Nor does our view deprive the language recogniz-ing a civil action by an adversely affected person of any independent effect, for it may readily be understood as having alimited but specific function: the reference in $ 552a(g)(1)(D)to "adverse effect" acts as a term of art identifying a poten-tial plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and causationrequirements of Article III standing, and who may conse-quently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal forwant of standing to sue. See Director, Office of Workers'Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding &Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 126 (1995) ("The phrase `personadversely affected or aggrieved' is a term of art used inmany statutes to designate those who have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision, within the agency or before the courts"); see also 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (providing reviewof agency action under the Administrative Procedure Actto individuals who have been "adversely affected or aggrieved"). That is, an individual subjected to an adverse efently thought to delete the inclusive reference to entitlement. But thisfailure to remove the old language did not affect its reference to "actualdamages," the term remaining from the original pair, "actual and general."540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN625Cite as: 540 U. S. 614 (2004)Opinion of the Courtfect has injury enough to open the courthouse door, but with-out more has no cause of action for damages under the Privacy Act.9Next, Doe also suggests there is something peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages, as a form of presumeddamages not requiring proof of amount, only to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages. But this approach parallels another remedial scheme that the draftersof the Privacy Act would probably have known about. Atcommon law, certain defamation torts were redressed bygeneral damages but only when a plaintiff first proved some"special harm," i. e., "harm of a material and generally ofa pecuniary nature." 3 Restatement of Torts $ 575, Comments a and b (1938) (discussing defamation torts that are"not actionable per se"); see also 3 Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 575, Comments a and b (1976) (same). Plaintiffsclaiming such torts could recover presumed damages only ifthey could demonstrate some actual, quantifiable pecuniaryloss. Because the recovery of presumed damages in thesecases was supplemental to compensation for specific harm, itwas hardly unprecedented for Congress to make a guaranteed minimum contingent upon some showing of actual damages, thereby avoiding giveaways to plaintiffs with nothing9 Nor are we convinced by the analysis mentioned in the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, that any plaintiff who can demonstrate thathe was adversely affected by intentional or willful agency action is entitledto costs and reasonable attorney's fees under 5 U. S. C. $ 552a(g)(4)(B),and is for that reason "a person entitled to recovery" under subsection(g)(4)(A). See 306 F. 3d 170, 188-189 (CA4 2002). Instead of treatingdamages as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees, see, e. g., 42U. S. C. $ 1988(b) (allowing "a reasonable attorney's fee" to a "prevailingparty" under many federal civil rights statutes); Alyeska Pipeline ServiceCo. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247-258 (1975) (discussing historyof American courts' power to award fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs),this analysis would treat costs and fees as the recovery entitling a plaintiffto minimum damages; it would get the cart before the horse.540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 DOE v. CHAOOpinion of the Courtmore than "abstract injuries," Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461U. S. 95, 101-102 (1983).10In a final effort to save his claim, Doe points to a pair ofstatutes with remedial provisions that are worded similarlyto $ 552a(g)(4). See Tax Reform Act of 1976, $ 1201(i)(2)(A),90 Stat. 1665-1666, 26 U. S. C. $ 6110( j)(2)(A); $ 1202(e)(1), 90Stat. 1687, 26 U. S. C. $ 7217(c) (1976 ed., Supp. V) (repealed1982); Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, $ 201,100 Stat. 1866, 18 U. S. C. $ 2707(c). He contends that legis-lative history of these subsequent enactments shows thatCongress sometimes used language similar to 5 U. S. C.$ 552a(g)(4) with the object of authorizing true liquidateddamages remedies. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 94-938, p. 348(1976) (discussing $ 1202(e)(1) of the Tax Reform Act); S. Rep.No. 99-541, p. 43 (1986) (discussing $ 201 of the ElectronicCommunications Privacy Act). There are two problemswith this argument. First, as to $ 1201(i)(2)(A) of the TaxReform Act, the text is too far different from the languageof the Privacy Act to serve as any sound basis for analogy;it does not include the critical limiting phrase "entitled torecovery." But even as to $ 1202(e)(1) of the Tax ReformAct and $ 201 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,the trouble with Doe's position is its reliance on the legis-lative histories of completely separate statutes passed wellafter the Privacy Act. Those of us who look to legisla-tive history have been wary about expecting to find reliableinterpretive help outside the record of the statute being con-strued, and we have said repeatedly that " `subsequent legis10 We also reject the related suggestion that the category of cases withactual damages not exceeding $1,000 is so small as to render the minimumaward meaningless under our reading. It is easy enough to imagine pecuniary expenses that might turn out to be reasonable in particular casesbut fall well short of $1,000: fees associated with running a credit report,for example, or the charge for a Valium prescription. Since we do notaddress the definition of actual damages today, see n. 12, infra, this challenge is too speculative to overcome our interpretation of the statute'splain language and history.540US2 Unit: $U21 [10-28-05 13:41:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 540 U.
