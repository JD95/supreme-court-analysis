The United States brought this quiet title action againstthe State of Idaho. The question is whether the NationalGovernment holds title, in trust for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe,to lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and theSt. Joe River. We hold that it does.IThe Coeur d'Alene Tribe once inhabited more than 3.5 mil-lion acres in what is now northern Idaho and northeasternWashington, including the area of Lake Coeur d'Alene andthe St. Joe River. 95 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1095-1096, 1099-1100(Idaho 1998).1 Tribal members traditionally used the lakeand its related waterways for food, fiber, transportation,recreation, and cultural activities. Id., at 1099-1102. TheTribe depended on submerged lands for everything fromwater potatoes harvested from the lake to fish weirs andtraps anchored in riverbeds and banks.Id., at 1100.Under an 1846 treaty with Great Britain, the UnitedStates acquired title to the region of Lake Coeur d'Alene,see Treaty in Regard to Limits Westward of the RockyMountains, 9 Stat. 869, subject to the aboriginal right ofpossession held by resident tribes, see generally OneidaIndian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661,667 (1974); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 486-493 (1982 ed.). In 1867, in the face of immigration into theTribe's aboriginal territory, 95 F.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtapparently unaware of this action until at least 1871, whenit petitioned the Government to set aside a reservation,id., at 1102-1103. The Tribe found the 1867 boundaries un-satisfactory, due in part to their failure to make adequateprovision for fishing and other uses of important waterways.When the Tribe petitioned the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a second time, it insisted on a reservation that includedkey river valleys because "we are not as yet quite up toliving on farming" and "for a while yet we need have somehunting and fishing." App. 27.Following further negotiations, the Tribe in 1873 agreedto relinquish (for compensation) all claims to its aboriginallands outside the bounds of a more substantial reservationthat negotiators for the United States agreed to "set apartand secure" "for the exclusive use of the Coeur d'Alene In-dians, and to protect . . . from settlement or occupancy byother persons." Id., at 33. The reservation boundariesdescribed in the agreement covered part of the St. Joe River(then called the St. Joseph), and all of Lake Coeur d'Aleneexcept a sliver cut off by the northern boundary. Id., at33-34; 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1095-1096.Although by its own terms the agreement was not binding without congressional approval, App. 36-37, later in1873 President Grant issued an Executive Order directingthat the reservation specified in the agreement be "with-drawn from sale and set apart as a reservation for the Curd'Ale` ne Indians." Exec. Order of Nov. 8, 1873, reprinted in1 C. Kapler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 837 (1904).The 1873 Executive Order set the northern boundary of thereservation directly across Lake Coeur d'Alene, which, theDistrict Court found, was contrary "to the usual practice ofmeandering a survey line along the mean high water mark."95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108; App. 14, 20 (expert trial testimony).22 Although the State did not challenge the District Court's factual findings below, it claims in its reply brief to us that it was "commonplace"for reservation boundaries to cross navigable waters.

S. 262 (2001)Opinion of the CourtAn 1883 Government survey fixed the reservation's totalarea at 598,499.85 acres, which the District Court found necessarily "included submerged lands within the reservationboundaries." 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108.As of 1885, Congress had neither ratified the 1873 agree-ment nor compensated the Tribe. This inaction promptedthe Tribe to petition the Government again, to "make withus a proper treaty of peace and friendship . . . by whichyour petitioners may be properly and fully compensatedfor such portion of their lands not now reserved to them;[and] that their present reserve may be confirmed to them."App. 350-351. In response, Congress authorized new negotiations to obtain the Tribe's agreement to cede land outsidethe borders of the 1873 reservation. Act of May 15, 1886,ch. 333, 24 Stat. 44. In 1887, the Tribe agreed to cede"all right, title, and claim which they now have, or everhad, to all lands in said Territories [Washington, Idaho,and Montana] and elsewhere, except the portion of landwithin the boundaries of their present reservation inthe Territory of Idaho, known as the Coeur d'Alene Res-ervation." App. 378.The Government, in return, promised to compensate theTribe, and agreed that"[i]n consideration of the foregoing cession and agree-ments . . . the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be heldforever as Indian land and as homes for the Coeurd'Alene Indians . . . and no part of said reservationshall ever be sold, occupied, open to white settlement,Petitioner 9. Ultimately, this factual dispute is of little consequence;the District Court found that the boundary and acreage calculationsshowed the understanding of the Government and the Tribe that submerged lands were included, 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108, and the State conceded on appeal that "[c]ertainly, . . . by 1888, the executive branch hadconstrued the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as including submergedlands."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtor otherwise disposed of without the consent of theIndians residing on said reservation." Id., at 379.As before, the agreement was not binding on either partyuntil ratified by Congress. Id., at 382.In January 1888, not having as yet ratified any agree-ment with the Tribe, the Senate expressed uncertainty aboutthe extent of the Tribe's reservation and adopted a resolu-tion directing the Secretary of the Interior to "inform theSenate as to the extent of the present area and boundariesof the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in the Territory ofIdaho," and specifically, "whether such area includes anyportion, and if so, about how much of the navigable watersof Lake Coeur d'Alene, and of Coeur d'Alene and St. JosephRivers." S. Misc. Doc. No. 36, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1888).The Secretary responded in February 1888 with a report ofthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stating that "the reservation appears to embrace all the navigable waters of LakeCoeur d'Alene, except a very small fragment cut off by thenorth boundary of the reservation," and that "[t]he St. Jo-seph River also flows through the reservation." S. Exec.Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1888). Based largely,it appears, on this report, Idaho conceded in the Courtof Appeals (as it does here) that the 1873 Executive Orderreservation included submerged lands. See Opening Brieffor Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), p. 17 ("Certainly, theState concedes that by 1888, the executive branch had construed the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as includingsubmerged lands"); Brief for Petitioner 17.In May 1888, shortly after receiving the Secretary's re-port, Congress passed an Act granting a right-of-way to theWashington and Idaho Railroad Company "for the extensionof its railroad through the lands in Idaho Territory set apartfor the use of the Coeur d'Alene Indians by executive order,commonly known as the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation."Act of May 30, 1888, ch. 336, $ 1, 25 Stat. 160.

Id., $ 3, 25 Stat. 161;see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 16.Congress was not prepared to ratify the 1887 agreement,however, owing to a growing desire to obtain for the publicnot only any interest of the Tribe in land outside the 1873reservation, but certain portions of the reservation itself.The House Committee on Indian Affairs later recalled thatthe 1887 agreement was not promptly ratified for"sundry reasons, among which was a desire on the partof the United States to acquire an additional area, towit, a certain valuable portion of the reservation specially dedicated to the exclusive use of said Indiansunder an Executive order of 1873, and which portionsof said lands, situate[d] on the northern end of saidreservation, is valuable and necessary to the citizensof the United States for sundry reasons. It containsnumerous, extensive, and valuable mineral ledges. Itcontains large bodies of valuable timber. . . . It con-tains a magnificent sheet of water, the Coeur d'AleneLake . . . ." H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.,4 (1890).But Congress did not simply alter the 1873 boundariesunilaterally. Instead, the Tribe was understood to be entitled beneficially to the reservation as then defined, and the1889 Indian Appropriations Act included a provision directing the Secretary of the Interior "to negotiate with theCoeur d'Alene tribe of Indians," and, specifically, to negotiate "for the purchase and release by said tribe of suchportions of its reservation not agricultural and valuablechiefly for minerals and timber as such tribe shall consentto sell." Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, $ 4, 25 Stat. 1002.Later that year, the Tribe and Government negotiatorsreached a new agreement under which the Tribe would cede533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN270 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe northern portion of the reservation, including approxi-mately two-thirds of Lake Coeur d'Alene, in exchange for$500,000. App. 198; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1113. Thenew boundary line, like the old one, ran across the lake,and General Simpson, a negotiator for the United States, re-assured the Tribe that "you still have the St. Joseph Riverand the lower part of the lake." App. 183. And, again,the agreement was not to be binding on either party untilboth it and the 1887 agreement were ratified by Congress.Id., at 199.On June 7, 1890, the Senate passed a bill ratifying boththe 1887 and 1889 agreements. S. 2828, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.(1890); 21 Cong. Rec. 5769-5770 (1890). On June 10, theSenate bill was referred to the House, where a parallel billhad already been reported by the House Committee on Indian Affairs. H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.(1890); see 21 Cong. Rec. 2775 (1890).On July 3, 1890, while the Senate bill was under consid-eration by the House Committee on Indian Affairs, Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act, admitting Idaho intothe Union "on an equal footing with the original States,"Act of July 3, 1890, ch. 656, 26 Stat. 215. The Statehood Act"accepted, ratified, and confirmed" the Idaho Constitution,ibid., which "forever disclaim[ed] all right and title to . . . alllands lying within [Idaho] owned or held by any Indians orIndian tribes" and provided that "until the title thereto shallhave been extinguished by the United States, the same shallbe subject to the disposition of the United States, and saidIndian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction andcontrol of the congress of the United States," Idaho Const.,Art. XXI, $ 19 (1890).A little over a month later, on August 19, 1890, the HouseCommittee on Indian Affairs reported that the Senate billratifying the 1887 and 1889 agreements was identical tothe House bill that it had already recommended. H. R. Rep.No. 2988, 51st Cong., 1st Sess. (1890). On March 3, 1891,Congress "accepted, ratified, and confirmed" both the 1887533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN271Cite as: 533 U.

The Act also directedthe Secretary of the Interior to convey to one Frederick Posta "portion of [the] reservation," id., at 1031, that the Tribehad purported to sell to Post in 1871.3 The property, locatedon the Spokane River and known as Post Falls, was described as "all three of the river channels and islands, withenough land on the north and south shores for water-powerand improvements." Ibid.In 1894, Congress approved yet another agreement withthe Tribe, this time for the cession of a lakeside townsitecalled Harrison, within the boundary of the ratified reservation. Act of Aug. 15, 1894, ch. 290, 28 Stat. 322, agreementreprinted in App. 389; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1117. Theagreement with the Tribe described the cession as cover-ing "all the land" embraced within a tract that included aportion of the lake. App. 392. Like the earlier railroadcession, this one was subject to compensation to the Tribeand no one else.The United States, acting in its own capacity and astrustee for the Tribe, initiated this action against the Stateof Idaho to quiet title (in the United States, to be held forthe use and benefit of the Tribe) to the submerged landswithin the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's current reservation, which encompass the lower third of Lake Coeurd'Alene and part of the St. Joe River.4 The Tribe inter3 See generally, e. g., Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County ofOneida, 414 U. S. 661, 667-668 (1974) (under common law and variousNonintercourse Acts, Indian title can only be extinguished with federalconsent).4 Because this action was brought by the United States, it does notimplicate the Eleventh Amendment bar raised when the Tribe pressedits own claim to the submerged lands in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribeof Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997). See Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,614 (1983).The United States's complaint was apparently motivated by Idaho'sissuance of permits for the construction of "docks, piers, floats, pilings,breakwaters, boat ramps and other such aids to navigation within the533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtvened to assert its interest in the submerged lands, andIdaho counterclaimed, seeking to quiet title in its own favor.Ibid. Following a 9-day trial, the District Court quietedtitle "in favor of the United States, as trustee, and the Coeurd'Alene Tribe of Idaho, as the beneficially interested partyof the trusteeship, to the bed and banks of the Coeur d'AleneLake and the St. Joe River lying within the current bound-aries of the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation." 95 F. Supp.2d, at 1117. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitaffirmed. 210 F. 3d 1067 (2000). We granted certiorari, 531U. S. 1050 (2000), and we now affirm.IIDue to the public importance of navigable waterways,ownership of the land underlying such waters is "stronglyidentified with the sovereign power of government." Mon-tana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 552 (1981). See generally Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261,284 (1997);United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Inorder to allow new States to enter the Union on an "equalfooting" with the original States with regard to this im-portant interest, "the United States early adopted and constantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands undernavigable waters in acquired territory . . . as held for theultimate benefit of future States." United States v. HoltState Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55 (1926); see also Shively v.Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 48-50 (1894). Therefore, in contrastto the law governing surface land held by the United States,see Scott v. Lattig, 227 U. S. 229, 244 (1913), the default ruleis that title to land under navigable waters passes from theUnited States to a newly admitted State. Shively, supra,at 26-50. Specifically, although Congress has the power before statehood to convey land beneath navigable waters,and to reserve such land for the United States, " `[a] courtsouthern one-third of Coeur d'Alene Lake."

S. 262 (2001)Opinion of the Courtdeciding a question of title to the bed of navigable watermust . . . begin with a strong presumption' against defeatof a State's title." Alaska, supra, at 34 (quoting Montana,supra, at 552).Armed with that presumption, we have looked to Con-gress's declarations and intent when we have had to resolveconflicts over submerged lands claimed to have been reserved or conveyed by the United States before statehood.Alaska, supra, at 36 ("Whether title to submerged landsrests with a State, of course, is ultimately a matter of federalintent");Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482 U. S.193, 201-202 (1987); Montana, supra, at 550-557; Holt StateBank, supra, at 57-59; Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. UnitedStates, 248 U. S. 78, 87-90 (1918); Shively, supra, at 48-51.The issue of congressional intent is refined somewhatwhen submerged lands are located within a tract that theNational Government has dealt with in some special waybefore statehood, as by reserving lands for a particularnational purpose such as a wildlife refuge or, as here, anIndian reservation. Because reserving submerged landsdoes not necessarily imply the intent "to defeat a futureState's title to the land," Utah Div. of State Lands, supra,at 202, we undertake a two-step enquiry in reservation cases.We ask whether Congress intended to include land undernavigable waters within the federal reservation and, if so,whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's titleto the submerged lands. Alaska, supra, at 36; Utah, supra,at 202.Our most recent case of this sort, United States v. Alaska,supra, addressed two parcels of land initially reserved notby Congress but, as here, by the Executive Branch. Weexplained that the two-step test of congressional intent issatisfied when an Executive reservation clearly includessubmerged lands, and Congress recognizes the reservationin a way that demonstrates an intent to defeat state title.Id., at 41-46, 55-61. We considered whether Congress was533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courton notice that the Executive reservation included submergedlands, see id., at 42, 45, 56, and whether the purpose of thereservation would have been compromised if the submergedlands had passed to the State, id., at 42-43, 45-46, 58.Where the purpose would have been undermined, we ex-plained, "[i]t is simply not plausible that the United Statessought to reserve only the upland portions of the area," id.,at 39-40.Here, Idaho has conceded that "the executive branch hadintended, or by 1888 had interpreted, the 1873 ExecutiveOrder Reservation to include submerged lands." Brief forPetitioner 17. The concession is a sound one. A right tocontrol the lakebed and adjacent waters was traditionallyimportant to the Tribe, which emphasized in its petitionto the Government that it continued to depend on fishing.Cf.Montana, supra, at 556 (finding no intent to include sub-merged lands within a reservation where the tribe did notdepend on fishing or use of navigable water). The DistrictCourt found that the acreage determination of the reservedarea in 1883 necessarily included the area of the lakebedwithin the unusual boundary line crossing the lake from eastto west. Cf. Alaska, supra, at 39 (concluding that a bound-ary following the ocean side of offshore islands necessarilyembraced submerged lands shoreward of the islands). Inlight of those findings and Idaho's concession, the partieshere concentrate on the second question, of Congress's intentto defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands.55 The District Court and Court of Appeals accepted the United States'sposition that it had reserved the submerged lands, and that Congressintended that reservation to defeat Idaho's title. They did not reachthe Tribe's alternative theory that, notwithstanding the scope of anyreservation, the Tribe retained aboriginal title to the submerged lands,which cannot be extinguished without explicit action by Congress, seeOneida Indian Nation, 414 U. S., at 667-668; cf. United States v. Winans,198 U. S. 371, 381 (1905) (explaining that a treaty ceding some aboriginallands to the United States and setting apart other lands as a reservation "was not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of rights from533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 533 U. S. 262 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIn the Court of Appeals, Idaho also conceded one pointcovered in this second part of the enquiry. It agreed thatafter the Secretary of the Interior's 1888 report that the res-ervation embraced nearly "all the navigable water of LakeCoeur d'Alene," S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess.,at 3, Congress was on notice that the Executive Order reservation included submerged lands. Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), at 11 ("[Congress was] informedthat the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embraced submergedlands"). Again, Idaho's concession was prudent in light ofthe District Court's findings of facts. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114("The evidence shows that prior to Idaho's statehood, Con-gress was on notice that the Executive Order of 1873 reserved for the benefit of the Tribe the submerged landswithin the boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation").The District Court did not merely impute to Congressknowledge of the land survey, but also explained how thesubmerged lands and related water rights had been con-tinuously important to the Tribe throughout the periodprior to congressional action confirming the reservation andgranting Idaho statehood. And the District Court made thefollowing findings about the period preceding negotiationsauthorized by Congress:"The facts demonstrate that an influx of non-Indians intothe Tribe's aboriginal territory prompted the FederalGovernment to negotiate with the Coeur d'Alenes inan attempt to confine the Tribe to a reservation andto obtain the Tribe's release of its aboriginal lands forsettlement. Before it would agree to these conditions,however, the Tribe demanded an enlarged reservationthat included the Lake and rivers. Thus, the FederalGovernment could only achieve its goals of promotingthem--a reservation of those not granted"). The Tribe does not press itsunextinguished-aboriginal-title argument here. See Brief for RespondentCoeur d'Alene Tribe 25, n. 12.533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsettlement, avoiding hostilities and extinguishing ab-original title by agreeing to a reservation that includedthe submerged lands." Id., at 1107.6This, in summary, was the background for the 1873 Execu-tive Order's inclusion of submerged lands, which in turnwere the subject of the 1888 request by the Senate to theSecretary of the Interior for advice about the Tribe's rightsover the "navigable waters of Lake Coeur d'Alene and theCoeur d'Alene and St. Joseph Rivers," S. Misc. Doc. No. 36,50th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1. As noted, the Secretary an-swered in the affirmative, S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong.,1st Sess., at 3, consistently with the survey indicating thatthe submerged lands were within the reservation. Thus,the District Court remarked that it would be difficult toimagine circumstances that could have made it more plainto Congress that submerged lands were within the reser-vation. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114.The manner in which Congress then proceeded to dealwith the Tribe shows clearly that preservation of the landwithin the reservation, absent contrary agreement with theTribe, was central to Congress's complementary objectivesof dealing with pressures of white settlement and estab-lishing the reservation by permanent legislation. The Tribehad shown its readiness to fight to preserve its land rightswhen in 1858 it defeated a force of the United States military,which it misunderstood as intending to take aboriginal lands.See H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., at 2-3. Theconcern with hostility arose again in 1873 before the reser-vation boundaries were established, when a surveyor on the6 See also Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Annual Report (1873), reprinted in App. 45 (explaining that Tribe was dissatisfied with a previousreservation and that the 1873 agreement was required "[f]or the purpose of extinguishing [the Tribe's] claim to all the tract of country claimedby them"). See generally Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 556(1981) (creation of Indian reservation is appropriate public purpose justifying defeat of state title to submerged lands).533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 533 U. S. 262 (2001)Opinion of the Courtscene had warned the Surveyor General that "[s]hould thefisheries be excluded there will in my opinion be trouble withthese Indians." App. 30.Hence, although the goal of extinguishing aboriginal titlecould have been achieved by congressional fiat, see Tee-HitTon Indians v. United States, 348 U. S. 272, 279-282 (1955),and Congress was free to define the reservation boundarieshowever it saw fit, the goal of avoiding hostility seeminglycould not have been attained without the agreement of theTribe. Congress in any event made it expressly plain thatits object was to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent. When in 1886 Congress took steps toward extinguishing aboriginal title to all lands outside the 1873 boundaries,it did so by authorizing negotiation of agreements cedingtitle for compensation. Soon after that, when Congress decided to seek a reduction in the size of the 1873 reservation itself, the Secretary of the Interior advised the Senateagainst fiddling with the scope of the reservation withoutthe Tribe's agreement. The report of February 1888 likewise urged that any move to diminish the reservation"should be done, if done at all, with the full and free consentof the Indians, and they should, of course, receive propercompensation for any land so taken." App. 129. Accordingly, after receiving the Secretary's report, Congress undertook in the 1889 Act to authorize negotiation with the Tribefor the consensual, compensated cession of such portions ofthe Tribe's reservation "as such tribe shall consent to sell,"Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, $ 4, 25 Stat. 1002. In the meantime it honored the reservation's recently clarified boundaries by requiring that the Tribe be compensated for theWashington and Idaho Railroad Company right-of-way, Actof May 30, 1888, ch. 336, $ 1, 25 Stat. 160.The facts, including the provisions of Acts of Congress in1886, 1888, and 1889, thus demonstrate that Congress understood its objective as turning on the Tribe's agreementto the abrogation of any land claim it might have and to any533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtreduction of the 1873 reservation's boundaries. The explicitstatutory provisions requiring agreement of the Tribe wereunchanged right through to the point of Congress's final 1891ratification of the reservation, in an Act that of course contained no cession by the Tribe of submerged lands withinthe reservation's outer boundaries. Nor, it should be added,is there any hint in the evidence that delay in final passageof the ratifying Act was meant to pull a fast one by allowingthe reservation's submerged lands to pass to Idaho under alegal presumption, by virtue of the Statehood Act approvedeight months before Congress took final action on the reservation. There is no evidence that the Act confirming thereservation was delayed for any reason but comparison ofthe respective House and Senate bills, to assure that theywere identical prior to the House's passage of the Senateversion.7The record thus answers the State's argument that, because the 1889 Act indicates that Congress sought to obtainportions of the reservation "valuable chiefly for mineralsand timber," Congress was not necessarily thinking onething or another about the balance of the reservation land.Reply Brief for Petitioner 6-7; see also Tr. of Oral Arg.12-13. The argument simply ignores the evidence that Congress did know that the reservation included submergedlands, and that it authorized the reservation's modificationsolely by agreement. The intent, in other words, was thatanything not consensually ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe's benefit, an objective flatly at odds withIdaho's view that Congress meant to transfer the balance7 Given the preceding discussion of, among other things, the earliercongressional Acts, it should go without saying that this reference tothe fact that the Senate passed the ratification Act before statehood isnot intended to suggest that the Senate action constituted the enactmentof an expression of intent on behalf of the whole Congress, let alone thatit was sufficient of itself to defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands.But cf. post, at 285 (Rehnquist, C.

Indeed, the implausibility of the State'scurrent position is underscored by the fact that it made acontrary argument in the Court of Appeals, where it em-phasized the District Court's finding that the 1889 Act wasan authorization "to negotiate with the Tribe for a release ofthe submerged lands," and recognized that "[Congress was]informed that the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embracedsubmerged lands." Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), at 11, 31.Idaho's position is at odds not only with evidence ofcongressional intent before statehood, but also with latercongressional understanding that statehood had not affectedthe submerged lands in question. Eight months after pass-ing the Statehood Act, Congress ratified the 1887 and 1889agreements in their entireties (including language in the1887 agreement that "the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shallbe held forever as Indian land"), with no signal that someof the land over which the parties to those agreements hadnegotiated had passed in the interim to Idaho. The ratifi-cation Act suggested in a further way Congress's understanding that the 1873 reservation's submerged lands hadnot passed to the State, by including a provision confirming the Tribe's sale of river channels to Frederick Post.Confirmation would have been beyond Congress's power iftitle to the submerged riverbed had already passed to theState.8 Finally, the Act of Congress ceding the portion of8 The State says that the conveyance to Post included land that wasoutside the boundary of the 1873 reservation.

That merely suggests the possibility that Congress intended to defeat the State's title to even more territory than the United States isclaiming here.The State also hypothesizes that the relevant portions of the SpokaneRiver may not have been considered navigable at the time of the conveyance, ibid., in which case the equal footing doctrine would not apply andthe conveyance would say nothing about Congress's intent with regard to533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN280 IDAHO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtreservation land for the townsite of Harrison confirms Con-gress's understanding that the lakebed within the reservation's boundaries was part of the reservation. Only threeyears after the Act confirming the reservation, the townsite cession was treated just as the right-of-way for the rail-road had been treated before statehood. The Tribe (and noone else) was compensated for a cession whose bounds sug-gested inclusion of submerged lands; the boundary lines didnot stop at the water's edge and meander the entire shore,but continued into the area of the lake to encompass submerged territory that the National Government simply couldnot have conveyed if it had passed to Idaho at the time ofstatehood.9In sum, Congress undertook to negotiate with the Coeurd'Alene Tribe for reduction in the territory of an Execu-tive Order reservation that Idaho concedes included the submerged lands at issue here. Congress was aware that thesubmerged lands were included and clearly intended to redefine the area of the reservation that covered them onlyby consensual transfer, in exchange for the guarantee thatthe Tribe would retain the remainder. There is no indicasubmerged lands underlying navigable waters. We need not resolve thisfactual question, which was not addressed below. Suffice it to say thatCongress's actions in 1891 were consistent with an understanding thatthe State did not have title to the riverbeds conveyed to Post, which,along with the later Harrison cession of part of the concededly navigable lake, is consistent with an understanding that no submerged landswithin the reservation's stated boundaries had passed to Idaho.9 Here, we agree with the dissent, post, at 284, that Congress cannot,after statehood, reserve or convey submerged lands that "ha[ve] alreadybeen bestowed" upon a State. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 26-28(1894) (citing Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845)). Our pointin mentioning Congress's actions after statehood is merely to confirmwhat Congress's prestatehood actions already make clear: that the landsat issue here were not bestowed upon Idaho at statehood, because Congress intended that they remain tribal reservation lands barring agreement to the contrary.533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 533 U.
