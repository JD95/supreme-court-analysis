Under Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of cap-ital murder, a separate jury proceeding is held as the first oftwo steps in deciding whether his sentence should be lifeimprisonment or death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(1) (1991). Atthe close of such aggravating and mitigating evidence as theprosecution and the defense may introduce, the trial judgecharges the jurors to weigh whatever aggravating and mitigating circumstances or factors they may find, and to reachan advisory verdict by majority vote. $ 921.141(2). Thejury does not report specific findings of aggravating and miti-gating circumstances, but if, at the second sentencing step,the judge decides upon death, he must issue a written state-ment of the circumstances he finds. $ 921.141(3). A deathsentence is then subject to automatic review by the SupremeCourt of Florida. $ 921.141(4).A Florida trial court sentenced petitioner to death aftera jury so recommended, and the Supreme Court of Floridaaffirmed. We must determine whether, as petitioner claims,the sentencer in his case weighed either of two aggravatingfactors that he claims were invalid, and if so, whether theState Supreme Court cured the error by holding it harmless.*Steven M.

FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtWe answer yes to the first question and no to the second,and therefore vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court ofFlorida and remand. IOn New Year's Eve 1981, petitioner Dennis Sochor met awoman in a bar in Broward County, Florida. Sochor triedto rape her after they had left together, and her resistanceangered him to the point of choking her to death. He wasindicted for first-degree murder and kidnaping and, after ajury trial, was found guilty of each offense.At the penalty hearing, aggravating and mitigating evi-dence was offered, and the jury was instructed on the possibility of finding four aggravating circumstances, two of whichwere that"the crime for which the defendant is to be sentencedwas especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel, and [that]the crime for which the defendant is to be sentencedwas committed in a cold, calculated and premeditatedmanner, without any pretense of moral or legal justifi-cation." App. 326-327.The judge then explained to the jury that it could find certainstatutory and any nonstatutory mitigating circumstances,which were to be weighed against any aggravating ones.By a vote of 10 to 2, the jury recommended the death penalty for the murder. The trial court adopted the jury's rec-ommendation, finding all four aggravating circumstances asdefined in the jury instructions and no circumstances inmitigation.The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. 580 So. 2d 595(1991). It declined to reverse for unconstitutional vagueness in the trial judge's instruction that the jury could findas an aggravating factor that "the crime for which thedefendant is to be sentenced was especially wicked, evil,atrocious or cruel" (hereinafter, for brevity, the heinousnessfactor, after the statute's words "heinous, atrocious, or504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT531Cite as: 504 U.

The court held theissue waived for failure to object and the claim lacking meritin any event. 580 So. 2d, at 602-603, and n. 10. The courtalso rejected Sochor's claim of insufficient evidence to support the trial judge's finding of the heinousness factor, citingevidence of the victim's extreme anxiety and fear before shedied. The State Supreme Court did agree with Sochor,however, that the evidence failed to support the trial judge'sfinding that "the crime . . . was committed in a cold, calcu-lated, and premeditated manner without any pretense ofmoral or legal justification" (hereinafter the coldness factor),holding this factor to require a "heightened" degree of premeditation not shown in this case. Id., at 603. The StateSupreme Court affirmed the death sentence notwithstandingthe error, saying that:"[1] We . . . disagree with Sochor's claim that his deathsentence is disproportionate. [2] The trial court carefully weighed the aggravating factors against the lackof any mitigating factors and concluded that death waswarranted. [3] Even after removing the aggravatingfactor of cold, calculated, and premeditated there stillremain three aggravating factors to be weighed againstno mitigating circumstances. [4] Striking one aggravating factor when there are no mitigating circum-stances does not necessarily require resentencing.Robinson v. State, 574 So. 2d 108 (Fla. 1991); Holton v.State, 573 So. 2d 284 (Fla. 1990); James v. State, 453So. 2d 786 (Fla.), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1098 . . . (1984);Francois v.

[5] Under the circumstancesof this case, and in comparison with other death cases,we find Sochor's sentence of death proportionate to hiscrime.E. g., Hitchcock v. State, 578 So. 2d 685 (Fla.1990); Tompkins[ v. State, 502 So. 2d 415 (Fla. 1986),cert. denied, 483 U. S. 1033 (1987)]; Doyle[ v. State, 460So. 2d 353 (Fla. 1984)]." Id., at 604.504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT532 SOCHOR v. FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtSochor petitioned for a writ of certiorari, raising four ques-tions. We granted review limited to the following two: (1)"Did the application of Florida's [heinousness factor] violatethe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?" and (2) "Did theFlorida Supreme Court's review of petitioner's death sen-tence violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments wherethat court upheld the sentence even though the trial courthad instructed the jury on, and had applied, an improper aggravating circumstance, [in that] the Florida Supreme Courtdid not reweigh the evidence or conduct a harmless erroranalysis as to the effect of improper use of the circumstanceon the jury's penalty verdict?" Pet. for Cert. ii; see 502U. S. 967 (1991). IIIn a weighing State like Florida, there is Eighth Amend-ment error when the sentencer weighs an "invalid" aggravating circumstance in reaching the ultimate decision to im-pose a death sentence. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494U. S. 738, 752 (1990). Employing an invalid aggravating fac-tor in the weighing process "creates the possibility . . . ofrandomness," Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 236 (1992), byplacing a "thumb [on] death's side of the scale," id., at 232,thus "creat[ing] the risk [of] treat[ing] the defendant as moredeserving of the death penalty,"id., at 235. Even whenother valid aggravating factors exist, merely affirming a sentence reached by weighing an invalid aggravating factor de-prives a defendant of "the individualized treatment thatwould result from actual reweighing of the mix of mitigatingfactors and aggravating circumstances." Clemons, supra,at 752 (citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982)); see Parker v. Dug-ger, 498 U. S. 308, 321 (1991). While federal law does notrequire the state appellate court to remand for resentencing,it must, short of remand, either itself reweigh without theinvalid aggravating factor or determine that weighing theinvalid factor was harmless error. Id., at 320.504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT533Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAFlorida's capital sentencing statute allows application ofthe heinousness factor if "[t]he capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel." Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(5)(h)(1991). Sochor first argues that the jury instruction on theheinousness factor was invalid in that the statutory definition is unconstitutionally vague, see Maynard v. Cartwright,486 U. S. 356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980),and the instruction failed to narrow the meaning enough tocure the defect. This error goes to the ultimate sentence,Sochor claims, because a Florida jury is "the sentencer" forClemons purposes, or at the least one of "the sentencer's"constituent elements. This is so because the trial judgedoes not render wholly independent judgment, but must accord deference to the jury's recommendation. See Tedder v.State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (life verdict); Grossmanv. State, 525 So. 2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988) (death verdict),cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071 (1989). Hence, the argumentruns, error at the jury stage taints a death sentence, even ifthe trial judge's decision is otherwise error free. Cf. Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985). While Sochorconcedes that the general advisory jury verdict does not reveal whether the jury did find and weigh the heinousnessfactor, he seems to argue that the possibility that the juryweighed an invalid factor is enough to require cure.This argument faces a hurdle, however, in the rule thatthis Court lacks jurisdiction to review a state court's resolution of an issue of federal law if the state court's decisionrests on an adequate and independent state ground, see Herbv. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945), as it will if thestate court's opinion "indicates clearly and expressly" thatthe state ground is an alternative holding, see Michigan v.Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983); see also Harris v. Reed,489 U. S. 255, 264, n. 10 (1989); Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296U. S. 207, 210 (1935).504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT534 SOCHOR v. FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtThe Supreme Court of Florida said this about petitioner'sclaim that the trial judge's instruction on the heinousnessfactor was unconstitutional:"Sochor's next claim, regarding alleged errors in thepenalty jury instructions, likewise must fail. None ofthe complained-of jury instructions were objected toat trial, and, thus, they are not preserved for appeal.Vaught v. State, 410 So. 2d 147 (Fla. 1982). In anyevent, Sochor's claims here have no merit.10"10. . . . . We reject without discussion Sochor's . . . claims . . . thatthe instructions as to the aggravating factors of heinous, atrocious,or cruel and cold, calculated, and premeditated were improper . . . ."580 So. 2d, at 602-603, and n. 10.The quoted passage indicates with requisite clarity that therejection of Sochor's claim was based on the alternative stateground that the claim was "not preserved for appeal," andSochor has said nothing in this Court to persuade us thatthis state ground is either not adequate or not independent.Hence, we hold ourselves to be without authority to addressSochor's claim based on the jury instruction about the heinousness factor.**Justice Stevens's dissenting conclusion that we do have jurisdiction,post, at 547-549, is mistaken. First, the suggestion that Sochor's pretrialmotion objecting to the vagueness of Florida's heinousness factor preserved his objection to the heinousness instruction to the jury, post, at547, ignores the settled rule of Florida procedure that, in order to preservean objection, a party must object after the trial judge has instructed thejury. See, e. g., Harris v. State, 438 So. 2d 787, 795 (Fla. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U. S. 963 (1984); Vazquez v. State, 518 So. 2d 1348, 1350 (Fla. App.1987); Walker v. State, 473 So. 2d 694, 697-698 (Fla. App. 1985). Whilethe rule is subject to a limited exception for an advance request for aspecific jury instruction that is explicitly denied, see, e. g., State v. Heathcoat, 442 So. 2d 955, 957 (Fla. 1983); Buford v. Wainwright, 428 So. 2d504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT535Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the CourtBSochor maintains that the same Eighth Amendment viola-tion occurred again when the trial judge, who both parties1389, 1390 (Fla.), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 956 (1983); De Parias v. State, 562So. 2d 434, 435 (Fla. App. 1990), Sochor gets no benefit from this exception,because he never asked for a specific instruction.Second, Justice Stevens states that "the Florida Supreme Court, farfrom providing us with a plain statement that petitioner's claim was procedurally barred, has merely said that the claim was not preserved for appeal, and has given even further indication that petitioner's claim was notprocedurally barred by proceeding to the merits, albeit in the alternative."Post, at 547-548 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It isdifficult to comprehend why the State Supreme Court's statement that"the claim was not preserved for appeal" would not amount to "a plainstatement that petitioner's claim was procedurally barred," especiallysince there is no reason to believe that error of the kind Sochor allegedcannot be waived under Florida law, see this note, infra. It is even moredifficult to comprehend why the fact that the State Supreme Court restedupon this state ground merely in the alternative would somehow save ourjurisdiction. See supra, at 533.Third, Justice Stevens suggests that, in holding Sochor's claimwaived, the Supreme Court of Florida implied that the claim did not implicate "fundamental error," and that this in turn implied a rejection of Sochor's claim of "error," presumably because all federal constitutional error(or at least the kind claimed by Sochor) would automatically be "fundamental." Post, at 548-549. To say that this is "the most reasonable explanation," Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983), of the court's summary statement that Sochor's claim was "not preserved for appeal," see580 So. 2d, at 602-603, is an Olympic stretch, see Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S.255, 274-276 (1989) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In any event, we know ofno Florida authority supporting Justice Stevens's suggestion that allfederal constitutional error (or even the kind claimed by Sochor) would beautomatically "fundamental." Indeed, where, as here, valid aggravatingfactors would remain, instructional error involving another factor is not"fundamental." See Occhicone v. State, 570 So. 2d 902, 906 (Fla. 1990),cert. denied, 500 U. S. 938 (1991).Finally, Justice Stevens's suggestion that the State waived itsindependent-state-ground defense, post, at 548-549, forgets that this defense goes to our jurisdiction and therefore cannot be waived. See supra,at 533.504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT536 SOCHOR v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtagree is at least a constituent part of "the sentencer,"weighed the heinousness factor himself. To be sure, Sochoracknowledges the rule in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639(1990), where we held it was no error for a trial judge toweigh an aggravating factor defined by statute with impermissible vagueness, when the State Supreme Court had con-strued the statutory language narrowly in a prior case.Id.,at 653. We presumed that the trial judge had been familiarwith the authoritative construction, which gave significantguidance. Ibid. Sochor nonetheless argues that Walton isno help to the State, because Florida's heinousness factor hasnot been subjected to the limitation of a narrow constructionfrom the State Supreme Court.In State v. Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1 (1973), cert. denied, 416U. S. 943 (1974), the Supreme Court of Florida construed thestatutory definition of the heinousness factor:"It is our interpretation that heinous means extremelywicked or shockingly evil; that atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile; and, that cruel means designed toinflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to,or even enjoyment of, the suffering of others. What isintended to be included are those capital crimes wherethe actual commission of the capital felony was accompa-nied by such additional acts as to set the crime apartfrom the norm of capital felonies--the conscienceless orpitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to thevictim." 283 So. 2d, at 9.Understanding the factor, as defined in Dixon, to apply onlyto a "conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarilytorturous to the victim," we held in Proffitt v. Florida, 428U. S. 242 (1976), that the sentencer had adequate guidance.See id., at 255-256 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Sochor contends, however, that the State Supreme Court'spost-Proffitt cases have not adhered to Dixon's limitation as504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT537Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the Courtstated in Proffitt, but instead evince inconsistent and overbroad constructions that leave a trial court without sufficientguidance. And we may well agree with him that the Supreme Court of Florida has not confined its discussions onthe matter to the Dixon language we approved in Proffitt,but has on occasion continued to invoke the entire Dixonstatement quoted above, perhaps thinking that Proffitt approved it all. See, e. g., Porter v. State, 564 So. 2d 1060(1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1110 (1991); Cherry v. State,544 So. 2d 184, 187 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1090 (1990);Lucas v. State, 376 So. 2d 1149, 1153 (1979).But however much that may be troubling in the abstract,it need not trouble us here, for our review of Florida lawindicates that the State Supreme Court has consistently heldthat heinousness is properly found if the defendant strangleda conscious victim. See Hitchcock v. State, 578 So. 2d 685,692-693 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 912 (1991); Holton v.State, 573 So. 2d 284, 292 (1990); Tompkins v. State, 502So. 2d 415, 421 (1986); Johnson v. State, 465 So. 2d 499, 507,cert. denied, 474 U. S. 865 (1985); Adams v. State, 412 So. 2d850, cert. denied, 459 U. S. 882 (1982). Cf. Rhodes v. State,547 So. 2d 1201, 1208 (1989) (strangulation of semiconsciousvictim not heinous); Herzog v. State, 439 So. 2d 1372 (1983)(same). We must presume the trial judge to have been familiar with this body of case law, see Walton, 497 U. S., at653, which, at a minimum, gave the trial judge "[some] guidance," id., at 654. Since the Eighth Amendment requires nomore, we infer no error merely from the fact that the trialjudge weighed the heinousness factor. While Sochor responds that the State Supreme Court's interpretation of theheinousness factor has left Florida trial judges without sufficient guidance in other factual situations, we fail to see howthat supports the conclusion that the trial judge was withoutsufficient guidance in the case at hand. See generally Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 361-364.504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT538 SOCHOR v. FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtIIISochor also claims that when "the sentencer" weighed thecoldness factor there was Eighth Amendment error thatwent uncorrected in the State Supreme Court.AFirst, Sochor complains of consideration of the coldnessfactor by the jury, the first step in his argument being thatthe coldness factor was "invalid" in that it was unsupportedby the evidence; the second step, that the jury in the instantcase "weighed" the coldness factor; and the third and laststep, that in Florida the jury is at least a constituent part of"the sentencer" for Clemons purposes. The argument fails,however, for the second step is fatally flawed. Because thejury in Florida does not reveal the aggravating factors onwhich it relies, we cannot know whether this jury actuallyrelied on the coldness factor. If it did not, there was noEighth Amendment violation. Thus, Sochor implicitly suggests that, if the jury was allowed to rely on any of two ormore independent grounds, one of which is infirm, we shouldpresume that the resulting general verdict rested on the in-firm ground and must be set aside. SeeMills v. Maryland,486 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1988); cf. Stromberg v. California,283 U. S. 359, 368 (1931). Just this Term, however, we heldit was no violation of due process that a trial court instructeda jury on two different legal theories, one supported by theevidence, the other not. SeeGriffin v. United States, 502U. S. 46 (1991). We reasoned that although a jury is unlikelyto disregard a theory flawed in law, it is indeed likely todisregard an option simply unsupported by evidence. Id., at59-60. We see no occasion for different reasoning here, andaccordingly decline to presume jury error.BSochor next complains that Eighth Amendment error inthe trial judge's weighing of the coldness factor was left uncured by the State Supreme Court.504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT539Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the Court1We can start from some points of agreement. The partiesagree that, in Florida, the trial judge is at least a constituentpart of "the sentencer" for Clemons purposes, and there is,of course, no doubt that the trial judge "weighed" the coldness factor, as he said in his sentencing order. Nor is thereany question that the coldness factor was "invalid" forClemons purposes, since Parker applied the Clemons rule wherea trial judge had weighed two aggravating circumstancesthat were invalid in the sense that the Supreme Court ofFlorida had found them to be unsupported by the evidence.See 498 U. S., at 311. It follows that Eighth Amendmenterror did occur when the trial judge weighed the coldnessfactor in the instant case. What is in issue is the adequacyof the State Supreme Court's effort to cure the error underthe rule announced in Clemons, that a sentence so taintedrequires appellate reweighing or review for harmlessness.2We noted in Parker that the Supreme Court of Floridawill generally not reweigh evidence independently, 498 U. S.,at 319 (citing Hudson v. State, 538 So. 2d 829, 831 (per curiam), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 875 (1989); Brown v. Wainwright, 392 So. 2d 1327, 1331-1332 (1981) (per curiam)), andthe parties agree that, to this extent at least, our perceptionof Florida law was correct. The State argues, nonetheless,that, in this case, the State Supreme Court did support thedeath verdict adequately by performing harmless-error anal-ysis. It relies on the excerpt from the state court's opinionquoted above, and particularly on the second through fourthsentences, as "declar[ing] a belief that" the trial judge'sweighing of the coldness factor "was harmless beyond a rea-sonable doubt" in that it "did not contribute to the [sentence]obtained." Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967).This, however, is far from apparent. Not only does theState Supreme Court's opinion fail so much as to mention504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT540 SOCHOR v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Court"harmless error," see Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 406(1991), but the quoted sentences numbered one and five expressly refer to the quite different enquiry whether Sochor'ssentence was proportional.The State tries to counter this deficiency by arguing thatthe four cases cited following the fourth sentence of thequoted passage were harmless-error cases, citation to whichwas a shorthand signal that the court had reviewed this record for harmless error as well. But the citations come upshort. Only one of the four cases contains language givingan explicit indication that the State Supreme Court had performed harmless-error analysis. See Holton v. State, 573So. 2d 284, 293 (1990) ("We find the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"). The other three simply do not,and the result is ambiguity.Although we do not mean here to require a particular formulaic indication by state courts before their review forharmless federal error will pass federal scrutiny, a plainstatement that the judgment survives on such an enquiry isclearly preferable to allusions by citation. In any event,when the citations stop as far short of clarity as these do,they cannot even arguably substitute for explicit languagesignifying that the State Supreme Court reviewed for harmless error.IVIn sum, Eighth Amendment error occurred when the trialjudge weighed the coldness factor. Since the SupremeCourt of Florida did not explain or even "declare a beliefthat" this error "was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"in that "it did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained,"Chapman, supra, at 24, the error cannot be taken as curedby the State Supreme Court's consideration of the case. Itfollows that Sochor's sentence cannot stand on the existingrecord of appellate review. We vacate the judgment of the504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:58 PAGES OPINPGT541Cite as: 504 U.
