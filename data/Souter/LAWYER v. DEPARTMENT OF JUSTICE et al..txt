Appellant was one of several plaintiffs in this suit chal-lenging the configuration of a Florida legislative districtunder the Equal Protection Clause. All parties except ap-pellant reached a provisional settlement agreement and,after a fairness hearing, a three-judge District Court ap-proved the remedial districting plan proposed in the agreement. Appellant claims that the District Court acted with-out giving the State an adequate opportunity to make itsown redistricting choice by approving the remedial planwithout first adjudicating the legality of the original plan,that the court had no authority to approve any settlementover his objection, and that the remedial plan violates theConstitution. We hold that the State exercised the choiceto which it was entitled under our cases, that appellant hasno right to block the settlement, and that he has failed topoint up any unconstitutionality in the plan proposed.IAfter the 1990 Decennial Census, the Florida Legislatureadopted a reapportionment plan for Florida's 40 Senate districts and 120 House districts.

The state court was advised thatthe Governor had no intent to convene the legislature in extraordinary session and that neither the President of theSenate nor the Speaker of the House of Representativeswould convene his respective House. Ibid.; see also 815F. Supp., at 1556. The court concluded that a legislative impasse had occurred and, invoking authority under state law,revised the Senate redistricting plan to address the JusticeDepartment's objection. 601 So. 2d, at 545.The amended plan, known as Plan 330, called for an irregularly shaped Senate District 21, with a voting-age population45.8% black and 9.4% Hispanic and comprising portions offour counties in the Tampa Bay area. Id., at 546. The dis-trict included the central portions of Tampa in HillsboroughCounty, the eastern shore of Tampa Bay running south toBradenton in Manatee County, central portions of St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, a narrow projection eastwardthrough parts of Hillsborough and Polk Counties, and a narrow finger running north from St. Petersburg to Clearwater.See Juris. Statement 29a. Although the State SupremeCourt acknowledged that the district was "more contorted"than other possible plans and that black residents in differentparts of the district might have little in common besides theirrace, it decided that such concerns "must give way to racialand ethnic fairness."

Appellant argued that the DistrictCourt was required to hold Plan 330 unconstitutional beforeit could adopt a new districting plan, see id., at 16, but theDistrict Court disagreed, noting that "there is simply not alitigable issue with respect to what we have for shorthandpurposes referred to as liability and we ought simply then toproceed . . . to resolve the issue of the fairness of this proposed settlement and entertain any objections [concerningit]." Id., at 26.The District Court scheduled a hearing on the proposedplan for November 20, giving notice in 13 area newspapersand making details of the plan available for review in theclerk's office. See App. 161. Before the hearing, thesettling parties submitted evidence including affidavits anddeclarations addressing the factors considered in revisingDistrict 21, Record 188, and appellant submitted his ownremedial plan for a District 21 wholly contained within Hillsborough County, Record 172, at A4. At the hearing, counselfor the State Senate summarized the prehearing filings submitted by proponents of the settlement and the rationale behind the agreement. App. 160-172. The District Court denied appellant's motion for ruling on his motion for summaryjudgment on the legality of Plan 330, saying that "[i]t makes521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN574 LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEOpinion of the Courtno difference whether we grant the motion or not. . . . [I]fwe granted your motion, we would be in this precise posturewe are in now." Id., at 173. Appellant then argued thatDistrict 21, as redrawn in Plan 386, would still be unconstitutional because only race could explain its contours, see id.,at 175-188, and counsel for a former state legislator spoke tothe same effect,id., at 188-190.On March 19, 1996, the District Court approved the settle-ment. See 920 F. Supp. 1248, 1257 (MD Fla. 1996). Thepanel majority first held that it was not obliged to find theexisting District 21 unconstitutional in order to approve thesettlement. While recognizing the need to "guard againstany disingenuous adventures" by litigants, id., at 1252, n. 2,the majority noted that a State should not be deprived ofthe opportunity to avoid "an expensive and protracted contest and the possibility of an adverse and disruptive adjudication" by a rule insisting on "a public mea culpa" as thesole condition for dispensing with "a dispositive, specific determination of the controlling constitutional issue." Id., at1252, and n. 2. To balance the competing interests, thecourt required a showing of a substantial "evidentiary andlegal" basis for the plaintiffs' claim before the settlementwould be approved, id., at 1252, and it held the standardsatisfied. "Each party either states unequivocally that existing District 21 is unconstitutionally configured or concedes, for purposes of settlement, that the plaintiffs have established prima facie unconstitutionality." Id., at 1253, n. 3.The majority found that the "boundaries of current District21 are markedly uneven and, in some respects, extraordinary," id., at 1253, and that the district "bears at least someof the conspicuous signs of a racially conscious contrivance,"id., at 1255.The District Court then turned to the merits of Plan 386to determine whether its formation had been "dominated bythe single-minded focus" on race that it understood to beconstitutionally forbidden under Miller. 920 F.

The court observed that the November 20 hearing"produced but two dissenters, plaintiff Lawyer and a formerstate Senator, both of whom neither presented relevant evi-dence nor offered germane legal argument."Id., at 1255.The District Court concluded that a "constitutional objectionto the proposed District 21 is not established. In its shapeand composition, proposed District 21 is, all said and done,demonstrably benign and satisfactorily tidy, especially giventhe prevailing geography."Ibid. The court noted that thenew district's percentage of minority residents would ap-proximate the racial features of the region surroundingTampa Bay better than Plan 330 did, that the district'sboundaries would be "less strained and irregular" than thosein Plan 330, and that all candidates, regardless of race, wouldhave an opportunity to seek office, with "both a fair chanceto win and the usual risk of defeat."Id., at 1255, 1256.Chief Judge Tjoflat concurred specially. He agreed thatPlan 386 was constitutional but thought that the new plancould not be approved without a judicial determination thatPlan 330 was unconstitutional, as he concluded it was.

Appel3 We reject appellees' contention that appellant failed to preserve thisclaim for appeal. Appellant argued below that the District Court shouldrule on the legality of Plan 330 before approving a remedial plan, see, e. g.,Record 173, and appellant's statements asking that the state legislatureand Supreme Court be given the opportunity to redistrict following a find521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN576 LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEOpinion of the Courtlant relies on Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993), in whichwe recognized that " `reapportionment is primarily the dutyand responsibility of the State through its legislature orother body, rather than of a federal court' [and that] [a]bsentevidence that these state branches will fail timely to performthat duty, a federal court must neither affirmatively obstructstate apportionment nor permit federal litigation to be usedto impede it." Id., at 34 (quoting Chapman v. Meier, 420U. S. 1, 27 (1975)). Appellant cites Wise v. Lipscomb, 437U. S. 535 (1978), for the proposition that when a federal courtdeclares an existing apportionment plan unconstitutional, itshould, if possible, afford "a reasonable opportunity for thelegislature to meet constitutional requirements by adoptinga substitute measure rather than . . . devise and order intoeffect its own plan." Id., at 540 (opinion of White, J.). Appellant claims that the District Court's approval of the settlement agreement without first holding Plan 330 unconstitutional impaired the State's interest in exercising "primaryresponsibility for apportionment of [its] federal congressionaland state legislative districts," Growe, supra, at 34, and hadthe derivative effect of "eviscerat[ing] the individual rightsof " appellant, as a citizen and voter, to "the liberties derivedfrom the diffusion of sovereign power . . . to representativestate government," Brief for Appellant 26.The substance of what appellant claims as a right to thebenefit of political diffusion is nothing other than the ruledeclared in the cases he cites, that state redistricting responsibility should be accorded primacy to the extent possiblewhen a federal court exercises remedial power. See Growe,507 U. S., at 34. A State should be given the opportunity tomake its own redistricting decisions so long as that is practically possible and the State chooses to take the opportunity.ing of liability fairly encompass the claim he presents here. See 166Tr. 30-31, 36-37, 39, 40 (Oct. 26, 1995); 180 Tr. 15-16 (Nov. 2, 1995).521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN577Cite as: 521 U. S. 567 (1997)Opinion of the CourtIbid. When it does take the opportunity, the discretion ofthe federal court is limited except to the extent that the planitself runs afoul of federal law.In this case, the State has selected its opportunity by entering into the settlement agreement, which for reasons setout below in Part II-B it had every right to do. And ithas availed itself of that opportunity by proposing a planas embodied in the settlement agreement. There can be noquestion on the present record that proponents of the planincluded counsel authorized to represent the State itself, andthere is no reason to suppose that the State's attorney gen-eral lacked authority to propose a plan as an incident of hisauthority to represent the State in this litigation.4 The evi-dence, indeed, was entirely in his favor. The participationof counsel for each legislative chamber confirmed both thecontinuing refusal of the legislature to address the issue in4 The dissent argues that Article III, $ 16, of the Florida Constitutionprovides the exclusive means by which redistricting can take place. Seepost, at 585-586, and n. 2. But this article in terms provides only thatthe state legislature is bound to redistrict within a certain time after eachdecennial census, for which it may be required to convene. See Fla.Const., Art. III, $ 16(a). The dissent says that the state legislature is"implicitly authorized to reapportion" after an existing plan is held unconstitutional and, further, that the Supreme Court of Florida has "by implication" the authority to redraw districts in the event a federal court invalidates a redistricting plan on constitutional grounds. See post, at 585-586,n. 2. We disagree on this question of state law only insofar as the dissentviews this implicit authority to limit the broad discretion possessed by theattorney general of Florida in representing the State in litigation. See,e. g., Ervin v. Collins, 85 So. 2d 852, 854 (Fla. 1956) (noting that, underFlorida law, "the Attorney General as the chief law officer of the state andabsent express legislative restriction to the contrary, may exercise hispower and authority in the premises [the power to litigate] as the publicinterest may require"); see also State ex rel. Shevin v. Yarborough, 257So. 2d 891, 894-896 (Fla. 1972) (Ervin, J., specially concurring). Absent astate-court determination to the contrary, we do not see Article III, $ 16,as placing the attorney general's settling authority in doubt, over againsthis representation to the contrary.521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN578 LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEOpinion of the Courtformal session and the authority of the attorney general topropose the settlement plan on the State's behalf.5On these facts, the District Court's approval of the settle-ment agreement was entirely consistent with the principlesunderlying our cases that have granted relief on the groundthat a district court had failed to respect the affected government's entitlement to originate its own redistricting policy.Since the State, through its attorney general, has taken advantage of the option recognized in Growe and Wise to makeredistricting decisions in the first instance, there are no reasons in those cases to burden its exercise of choice by requir-ing a formal adjudication of unconstitutionality.BWe find no merit, either, in appellant's apparently distinctclaim that, regardless of any effect on the State's districtingresponsibility, the District Court was bound to adjudicateliability before settlement because appellant did not agreeto settle. See Brief for Appellant 27. "It has never beensupposed that one party--whether an original party, a party5 The District Court indicated that it would look to the Florida Houseand Senate as an initial matter to fashion any new districting plan, see Tr.14, 18-19, 21-22 (Sept. 27, 1995), and directed the state appellees to file amonthly "report informing the Court of any formal actions initiated byany public official or branch of government regarding Florida's senatorial`reapportionment plan.' " Record 78, at 5. The Florida Senate filed suchstatus reports as directed, indicating that apart from the ongoing litigation, no formal actions had been initiated by any public official or branchof state government regarding Florida's senatorial plan. Record 121,141, 160.The dissent challenges the authority of those representing the StateHouse and Senate to speak for those bodies and further claims that even ifthey were authorized, the District Court was required to "demand clearercredentials" on their part. See post, at 586. However this may be, theState was represented by the attorney general and it is by virtue of hisagreement as counsel that the State was a party to the agreement. Thesettlement and subsequent judgment do not, of course, prevent the statelegislature from redistricting yet again.

Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1797.1,p. 412 (2d ed. 1986) (fact of opposition does not necessitatedisapproval of class-action settlement under Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 23). While a settlement agreement subjectto court approval in a nonclass action may not impose dutiesor obligations on an unconsenting party or "dispose" of hisclaims, see Firefighters, supra, at 529, the agreement heredid none of those things. It disposed of appellant's claim notin the forbidden sense of cutting him off from a remedy towhich he was entitled, but only in the legitimate sense ofgranting him an element of the very relief he had sought.As a remedy for what appellant claimed to be an unconstitutional plan he had requested the elimination of that plan, andthe settlement and decree gave him that relief. To affordhim a right to the formality of a decree in addition to thesubstance of the relief sought would be to allow a sore winner to obscure the point of the suit. In most civil litigation,and in this suit in particular, "the judicial decree is not theend but the means.

To the contrary, the holding in Firefighters was expresslybased on the principle that "it is the parties' agreement that serves as thesource of the court's authority to enter any [consent] judgment at all," 478U.

But insofar as he would have been entitledto that following a formal decree of the court, he is now inthe same position he would have enjoyed if he had had sucha decree: his views on the merits of the proposed plan wereheard, and his right to attack it in this appeal is entirelyunimpaired. To the extent that he claims anything more, heis trying to do what we have previously said he may not do:to demand an adjudication that the State of Florida, represented by the attorney general, could indeed have demanded,see Growe, 507 U. S., at 34; Wise, 437 U. S., at 540 (opinionof White, J.), but instead waived.IIIThe District Court concluded that Plan 386 did not subordinate traditional districting principles to race.7 See 920F.

S. 567 (1997)Opinion of the Courtida Senate districts,8 and in shape does not stand out as different from numerous other Florida House and Senate districts. See App. 26, 60-75. While District 21 crosses abody of water and encompasses portions of three counties,evidence submitted showed that both features are commoncharacteristics of Florida legislative districts, being productsof the State's geography and the fact that 40 Senate districtsare superimposed on 67 counties. See id., at 28, 32-33.9Addressing composition, the District Court found that theresidents of District 21 "regard themselves as a community."920 F. Supp., at 1255. Evidence indicated that District 21comprises a predominantly urban, low-income population,the poorest of the nine districts in the Tampa Bay regionand among the poorest districts in the State, whose whiteand black members alike share a similarly depressed economic condition, see App. 30-31, 49-51, and interests thatreflect it, id., at 149-154. The fact that District 21 underPlan 386 is not a majority black district, the black voting-agepopulation being 36.2%, supports the District Court's findingthat the district is not a "safe" one for black-preferred candidates, but one that "offers to any candidate, without regardto race, the opportunity" to seek and be elected to office.920 F. Supp., at 1256.8 The distance is 50 miles and record evidence indicates that only 15 ofthe 40 Senate districts in Florida cover less distance from end-to-end.See App. 26.9 The Supreme Court of Florida has held that the presence in a districtof a body of water, even without a connecting bridge and even if suchdistricting necessitates land travel outside the district to reach other partsof the district, "does not violate this Court's standard for determiningcontiguity under the Florida Constitution." In re Constitutionality ofSenate Joint Resolution 2G, 597 So. 2d 276, 280 (Fla. 1992).In addition, only 9 of the State's 40 Senate districts are located withina single county, and 5 of those are within Dade County. See App. 33.Multicounty districting also increases the number of legislators who canspeak for each county, a districting goal traditionally pursued in the State.See id., at 32, and n. 7.521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN582 LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEOpinion of the CourtBased on these and other considerations,10 the DistrictCourt concluded that traditional districting principles hadnot been subordinated to race in drawing revised District 21.Appellant calls this finding clearly erroneous, charging thatDistrict 21 encompasses more than one county, crosses abody of water, is irregular in shape, lacks compactness, andcontains a percentage of black voters significantly higherthan the overall percentage of black voters in Hillsborough,Manatee, and Pinellas Counties. Brief for Appellant 40-45.Appellant's first four points ignore unrefuted evidence show-ing that on each of these points District 21 is no differentfrom what Florida's traditional districting principles couldbe expected to produce. Seesupra, at 580-581. As to appellant's final point, we have never suggested that the percentage of black residents in a district may not exceed thepercentage of black residents in any of the counties fromwhich the district is created, and have never recognized similar racial composition of different political districts as beingnecessary to avoid an inference of racial gerrymandering inany one of them. Since districting can be difficult, after all,just because racial composition varies from place to place,and counties and voting districts do not depend on commonprinciples of size and location, facts about the one do not assuch necessarily entail conclusions about the other.In short, the evidence amply supports the trial court'sviews that race did not predominate over Florida's traditional districting principles in drawing Plan 386. Appellanthas provided nothing that calls that conclusion into question,much less that points to any clear error.10 Record evidence indicates that the design of revised District 21 wasalso affected by the need to satisfy one-person, one-vote requirements,App. 28, the desire to retain the existing partisan balance in the Senate,id., at 31, and the desire to avoid out-of-cycle elections, id., at 28-29.
