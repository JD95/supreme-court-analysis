In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604 (1996) (Colorado I), weheld that spending limits set by the Federal Election Campaign Act were unconstitutional as applied to the ColoradoRepublican Party's independent expenditures in connectionwith a senatorial campaign. We remanded for considerationof the party's claim that all limits on expenditures by a political party in connection with congressional campaigns arefacially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as tospending coordinated with a candidate. Today we rejectthat facial challenge to the limits on parties' coordinatedexpenditures.IWe first examined the Federal Election Campaign Act of1971 in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam),where we held that the Act's limitations on contributions toa candidate's election campaign were generally constitutional, but that limitations on election expenditures werenot. Id., at 12-59. Later cases have respected this linebetween contributing and spending. See, e. g., Nixon v.Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.

COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the CourtComm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S.238, 259-260 (1986).The simplicity of the distinction is qualified, however, bythe Act's provision for a functional, not formal, definition of"contribution," which includes "expenditures made by anyperson in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or atthe request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorizedpolitical committees, or their agents," 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i).1 Expenditures coordinated with a candidate, thatis, are contributions under the Act.The Federal Election Commission (FEC or Commission)originally took the position that any expenditure by a political party in connection with a particular election for federaloffice was presumed to be coordinated with the party's candidate. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1 (1981); Brieffor Petitioner 6-7. The Commission thus operated on theassumption that all expenditure limits imposed on politicalparties were, in essence, contribution limits and thereforeconstitutional. Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T.1995, No. 95-489, pp. 28-30. Such limits include 2 U. S.

The Party defended in part with theclaim that the party expenditure limitations violated theFirst Amendment, and the principal opinion inColorado Iagreed that the limitations were unconstitutional as appliedto the advertising expenditures at issue. Unlike the Com-mission, the Members of the Court who joined the principalopinion thought the payments were "independent expendi-tures" as that term had been used in our prior cases, owingto the facts that the Party spent the money before select-ing its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement with potential nominees.

Buckley, 424 U. S.,at 14-23. But ever since we first reviewed the 1971 Act, wehave understood that limits on political expenditures deservecloser scrutiny than restrictions on political contributions.Ibid.; see also, e. g., Shrink Missouri, 528 U.

Shrink Missouri, supra, at386-388; Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, supra, at 19-23.A further reason for the distinction is that limits on contribu4 The limits applicable to Presidential campaigns were not at issue inColorado I, 518 U.

Colorado I, supra, at 625-626. The District Court rejected the nonseverability argument, 41 F.

S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the Courttions are more clearly justified by a link to political corrup-tion than limits on other kinds of unlimited political spendingare (corruption being understood not only as quid pro quoagreements, but also as undue influence on an officeholder'sjudgment, and the appearance of such influence, Shrink Mis-souri, supra, at 388-389). At least this is so where thespending is not coordinated with a candidate or his cam-paign.Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47.In Buckley we said that:"[u]nlike contributions, . . . independent expendituresmay well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. Theabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only un-dermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will begiven as a quid pro quo for improper commitments fromthe candidate." Ibid.Given these differences, we have routinely struck down limi-tations on independent expenditures by candidates, otherindividuals, and groups, see Federal Election Comm'n v.National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.480, 490-501 (1985) (political action committees); Buckley,supra, at 39-58 (individuals, groups, candidates, and cam-paigns),6 while repeatedly upholding contribution limits, seeShrink Missouri, supra (contributions by political action6 The expenditure limits invalidated in Buckley applied to candidatesand their campaigns, and to "persons." See 424 U. S., at 39-40, 51, 54, 58."Person" was defined as "an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation, or any other organization or group of persons." 18U. S. C. $ 591(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424 U. S., at 144-235 (appendix reprinting then-current Act). Although this language isbroad enough to cover political parties, id., at 19, and n. 19, 39, partieswith a candidate on the ballot were covered instead by the special PartyExpenditure Provision, which was not challenged on First Amendmentgrounds, id., at 58, n. 66.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

S. 182, 193-199 (1981) (contributions by individuals and associations); Buckley, supra, at 23-36 (contribu-tions by individuals, groups, and political committees).7The First Amendment line between spending and donatingis easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs)without any candidate's approval (or wink or nod), and contributions in the form of cash gifts to candidates. See, e. g.,Shrink Missouri, supra, at 386-388; Buckley, supra, at 19-23.8 But facts speak less clearly once the independence of7 The contribution limits at issue in Buckley applied to "persons" ("person" again defined as "an individual, partnership, committee, association,corporation or any other organization or group of persons," id., at 23).Certain groups (referred to under current law as "multicandidate politicalcommittees") that registered with the FEC and met other qualifications,including making contributions to five or more candidates for federal office, were subject to a higher limit. Id., at 35.The current contribution limits appear in 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a). They provide that "persons" (still broadly defined, see $ 431(11)) may contribute nomore than $1,000 to a candidate "with respect to any election for Federaloffice," $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $20,000 to thenational committees of a political party in any year. $ 441a(a)(1). Individuals are limited to a yearly contribution total of $25,000. $ 441a(a)(3)."[M]ulticandidate political committees" are limited to a $5,000 contributionto a candidate "with respect to any election," $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $15,000 to the national committees of a politicalparty in any year. $ 441a(a)(2). Unlike the party expenditure limits,these contribution limits are not adjusted for inflation.8 The Party does not challenge the constitutionality of limits on cashcontributions from parties to candidates, Brief for Respondent 49, n. 31,which, on the FEC's reading of the Act, are imposed on parties by thegenerally applicable contribution limits of 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a), see n. 16,infra. And the Party, unlike Justice Thomas, post, at 465 (dissentingopinion), does not call for the overruling of Buckley. Nor does the FECask us to revisit Buckley's general approach to expenditure limits, although some have argued that such limits could be justified in light ofpost-Buckley developments in campaign finance, see, e. g., Blasi, FreeSpeech and the Widening Gyre of Fundraising, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1281(1994); cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 409533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthe spending cannot be taken for granted, and money spentby an individual or PAC according to an arrangement with acandidate is therefore harder to classify. As already seen,Congress drew a functional, not a formal, line between contributions and expenditures when it provided that coor-dinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groupsare subject to the Act's contribution limits, 2 U. S. C.$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i);Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 611. In Buckley,the Court acknowledged Congress's functional classification,424 U. S., at 46-47, and n. 53, and observed that treatingcoordinated expenditures as contributions "prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordi-nated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions,"id., at 47. Buckley, in fact, enhanced the significance of thisfunctional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholdinglimitations on contributions (by individuals and nonpartygroups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures, id.,at 23-59.9Colorado I addressed the FEC's effort to stretch the func-tional treatment of coordinated expenditures further thanthe plain application of the statutory definition. As we said,the FEC argued that parties and candidates are coupled soclosely that all of a party's expenditures on an election cam-paign are coordinated with its candidate; becauseBuckleyhad treated some coordinated expenditures like contribu(2000) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("I would leave open the possibility thatCongress, or a state legislature, might devise a system in which thereare some limits on both expenditures and contributions, thus permitting officeholders to concentrate their time and efforts on official dutiesrather than on fundraising"); id., at 405 (Breyer, J., concurring) ("Suppose Buckley denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enactcomprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaign finance.If so, like Justice Kennedy, I believe the Constitution would requireus to reconsider Buckley").9 As noted, n. 6, supra, the Party Expenditure Provision itself was notchallenged on First Amendment grounds in Buckley, supra, at 58, n. 66.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN444 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courttions and upheld their limitation, the argument went, theParty Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to allparty election spending. See Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T. 1995, No. 95-489, at 28-30; see also Colorado I,supra, at 619-623. Colorado I held otherwise, however, theprincipal opinion's view being that some party expenditurescould be seen as "independent" for constitutional purposes.518 U. S., at 614. The principal opinion found no reason tosee these expenditures as more likely to serve or be seenas instruments of corruption than independent expendituresby anyone else. So there was no justification for subjectingparty election spending across the board to the kinds oflimits previously invalidated when applied to individualsand nonparty groups. The principal opinion observed that"[t]he independent expression of a political party's views is`core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates, or other politicalcommittees." Id., at 616. Since the FEC did not advanceany other convincing reason for refusing to draw theindependent-coordinated line accepted since Buckley, seeNational Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.,at 497-498; Buckley, supra, at 46-47, that was the end of thecase so far as it concerned independent spending. ColoradoI, supra, at 617-623.But that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties tobe treated functionally as contributions, the way coordinatedexpenditures by other entities are treated. Colorado Ifound no justification for placing parties at a disadvantagewhen spending independently; but was there a case for leaving them entirely free to coordinate unlimited spending withcandidates when others could not? The principal opinion inColorado I noted that coordinated expenditures "share someof the constitutionally relevant features of independent expenditures." 518 U. S., at 624. But it also observed that"many [party coordinated expenditures] are . . . virtually in533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN445Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the Courtdistinguishable from simple contributions." Ibid. Coordi-nated spending by a party, in other words, covers a spectrumof activity, as does coordinated spending by other politicalactors. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether aparty is otherwise in a different position from other politicalspeakers, giving it a claim to demand a generally higherstandard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can belimited. The issue is posed by two questions: does limitingcoordinated spending impose a unique burden on parties, andis there reason to think that coordinated spending by a partywould raise the risk of corruption posed when others spendin coordination with a candidate? The issue is best viewedthrough the positions developed by the Party and the Gov-ernment in this case.IIIThe Party's argument that its coordinated spending, likeits independent spending, should be left free from restrictionunder the Buckley line of cases boils down to this: becausea party's most important speech is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those candidates, anylimit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique FirstAmendment burden. See Brief for Respondent 26-31. Thepoint of organizing a party, the argument goes, is to run asuccessful candidate who shares the party's policy goals.Id., at 26. Therefore, while a campaign contribution is onlyone of several ways that individuals and nonparty groupsspeak and associate politically, see Shrink Missouri, 528U. S., at 386-387; Buckley, supra, at 20-22, financial supportof candidates is essential to the nature of political parties aswe know them. And coordination with a candidate is a party's natural way of operating, not merely an option that caneasily be avoided. Brief for Respondent 26. Limitation ofany party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, theParty contends, is therefore a serious, rather than incidental,imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, andthat justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than we have applied533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courtto analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. Butwhatever level of scrutiny is applied, the Party goes on toargue, the burden on a party reflects a fatal mismatch be-tween the effects of limiting coordinated party expendituresand the prevention of corruption or the appearance of it.Brief for Respondent 20-22, 25-32; see also 213 F. 3d, at1227.The Government's argument for treating coordinatedspending like contributions goes back toBuckley. There,the rationale for endorsing Congress's equation of coordi-nated expenditures and contributions was that the equation"prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions." 424 U. S., at 47. The idea was thatcoordinated expenditures are as useful to the candidate ascash, and that such "disguised contributions" might be given"as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate" (in contrast to independent expenditures, which arepoor sources of leverage for a spender because they mightbe duplicative or counterproductive from a candidate's pointof view). Ibid. In effect, therefore, Buckley subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonpartygroups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their cashcontributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limitto be " `closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest,' . . . though the dollar amount of the limit need not be`fine tun[ed],' " Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-388 (quotingBuckley, supra, at 25, 30).The Government develops this rationale a step further inapplying it here. Coordinated spending by a party shouldbe limited not only because it is like a party contribution,but for a further reason. A party's right to make unlimitedexpenditures coordinated with a candidate would induce individual and other nonparty contributors to give to the partyin order to finance coordinated spending for a favored candidate beyond the contribution limits binding on them. The533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the CourtGovernment points out that a degree of circumvention is oc-curring under present law (which allows unlimited independent spending and some coordinated spending). Individualsand nonparty groups who have reached the limit of directcontributions to a candidate give to a party with the under-standing that the contribution to the party will produceincreased party spending for the candidate's benefit. TheGovernment argues that if coordinated spending were unlimited, circumvention would increase: because coordinatedspending is as effective as direct contributions in supportinga candidate, an increased opportunity for coordinated spend-ing would aggravate the use of a party to funnel money to acandidate from individuals and nonparty groups, who wouldthus bypass the contribution limits thatBuckley upheld.IVEach of the competing positions is plausible at first blush.Our evaluation of the arguments, however, leads us to rejectthe Party's claim to suffer a burden unique in any way thatshould make a categorical difference under the First Amendment. On the other side, the Government's contentions areultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail in itscharacterization of party coordinated spending as the func-tional equivalent of contributions.AIn assessing the Party's argument, we start with a wordabout what the Party is not saying. First, we do not understand the Party to be arguing that the line betweenindependent and coordinated expenditures is conceptuallyunsound when applied to a political party instead of an indi-vidual or other association. See, e. g., Brief for Respondent29 (describing "independent party speech"). Indeed, thegood sense of recognizing the distinction between independence and coordination was implicit in the principal opinion inColorado I, which did not accept the notion of a "metaphysi533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courtcal identity" between party and candidate, 518 U. S., at 622-623, but rather decided that some of a party's expenditurescould be understood as being independent and therefore immune to limitation just as an individual's independent expenditure would be, id., at 619-623.Second, we do not understand the Party to be arguing thatassociations in general or political parties in particular mayclaim a variety of First Amendment protection that is different in kind from the speech and associational rights of theirmembers.10 The Party's point, rather, is best understood asa factual one: coordinated spending is essential to partiesbecause "a party and its candidate are joined at the hip,"Brief for Respondent 31, owing to the very conception of theparty as an organization formed to elect candidates. Parties, thus formed, have an especially strong working relationship with their candidates, id., at 26, and the speech thisspecial relationship facilitates is much more effective thanindependent speech, id., at 29.10 We have repeatedly held that political parties and other associationsderive rights from their members. E. g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279,288 (1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 214-215(1986); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622-623 (1984);NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 459-460 (1958);Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957). While some commentators have assumed that associations' rights are also limited to therights of the individuals who belong to them, e. g., Supreme Court, 1996Term, Leading Cases, Associational Rights of Political Parties, 111 Harv.L. Rev. 197, 315, n. 50 (1997), that view has been subject to debate, see,e. g., Gottlieb, Fleshing Out the Right of Association, 49 Albany L. Rev.825, 826, 836-837 (1985); see generally Issacharoff, Private Parties withPublic Purposes, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 274 (2001). There is some languagein our cases supporting the position that parties' rights are more than thesum of their members' rights, e. g., California Democratic Party v. Jones,530 U. S. 567, 575 (2000) (referring to the "special place" the First Amendment reserves for the process by which a political party selects a standardbearer); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 373(1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting), but we have never settled upon the natureof any such difference and have no reason to do so here.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the CourtThere are two basic arguments here. The first turns onthe relationship of a party to a candidate: a coordinated relationship between them so defines a party that it cannot func-tion as such without coordinated spending, the object ofwhich is a candidate's election. We think political historyand political reality belie this argument. The second argument turns on the nature of a party as uniquely able to spendin ways that promote candidate success. We think that thisargument is a double-edged sword, and one hardly limited topolitical parties.1The assertion that the party is so joined at the hip to can-didates that most of its spending must necessarily be coordinated spending is a statement at odds with the history ofnearly 30 years under the Act. It is well to remember thatever since the Act was amended in 1974, coordinated spend-ing by a party committee in a given race has been limitedby the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). See18 U. S. C. $ 608(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424U. S., at 194 (reprinting then-effective Party ExpenditureProvision). It was not until 1996 and the decision in Colorado I that any spending was allowed above that amount,and since then only independent spending has been unlimited. As a consequence, the Party's claim that coordinatedspending beyond the limit imposed by the Act is essential toits very function as a party amounts implicitly to saying thatfor almost three decades political parties have not been functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of thelaw. The Party, of course, does not in terms make eitherstatement, and we cannot accept either implication. Thereis no question about the closeness of candidates to partiesand no doubt that the Act affected parties' roles and theirexercise of power. But the political scientists who haveweighed in on this litigation observe that "there is little evi-dence to suggest that coordinated party spending limitsadopted by Congress have frustrated the ability of political533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courtparties to exercise their First Amendment rights to supporttheir candidates," and that "[i]n reality, political parties aredominant players, second only to the candidates themselves,in federal elections." Brief for Paul Allen Beck et al. asAmici Curiae 5-6. For the Party to claim after all theseyears of strictly limited coordinated spending that unlimitedcoordinated spending is essential to the nature and function-ing of parties is in reality to assert just that "metaphysicalidentity," 518 U. S., at 623, between free-spending party andcandidate that we could not accept inColorado I.112There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexcep-tionable premise that parties are organized for the purposeof electing candidates, Brief for Respondent 26 ("Partiesexist precisely to elect candidates that share the goals oftheir party"), so that imposing on the way parties serve thatfunction is uniquely burdensome. The fault here is not somuch metaphysics as myopia, a refusal to see how the powerof money actually works in the political structure.When we look directly at a party's function in getting andspending money, it would ignore reality to think that theparty role is adequately described by speaking generally of11 To say that history and common sense make us skeptical that partiesare uniquely incapacitated by the challenged limitations is not to denythat limiting parties' coordinated expenditures while permitting unlimitedindependent expenditures prompts parties to structure their spending ina way that they would not otherwise choose. See post, at 470. And weacknowledge below, infra, at 453-455, that limiting coordinated expenditures imposes some burden on parties' associational efficiency. But thevery evidence cited by the dissent suggests that it is nonetheless possiblefor parties, like individuals and nonparty groups, to speak independently.E. g., App. 218 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado) ("[I]t is likelythat parties will allocate an increasing amount of money to independent expenditure efforts in the future"); id., at 159 (affidavit of Donald K.Bain, Chairman of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee) (describing ability to make independent expenditures as "welcome").533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 533 U.

The money parties spendcomes from contributors with their own personal interests.PACs, for example, are frequent party contributors who (ac-cording to one of the Party's own experts) "do not pursuethe same objectives in electoral politics" that parties do.App. 180 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado). PACs"are most concerned with advancing their narrow interest[s]" and therefore "provide support to candidates whoshare their views, regardless of party affiliation."Ibid. Infact, many PACs naturally express their narrow interestsby contributing to both parties during the same electoralcycle,12 and sometimes even directly to two competing candi-dates in the same election, L. Sabato, PAC Power, Inside theWorld of Political Action Committees 88 (1984).13 Parties12 As former Senator Paul Simon explained, "I believe people contributeto party committees on both sides of the aisle for the same reason thatFederal Express does, because they want favors.

It is this party role, which functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors,that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. This partyrole, accordingly, provides good reason to view limits on coordinated spending by parties through the same lens appliedto such spending by donors, like PACs, that can use partiesas conduits for contributions meant to place candidatesunder obligation.FEC Disclosure Report, Search Results for AOL Time Warner Inc.

S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the Court3Insofar as the Party suggests that its strong working rela-tionship with candidates and its unique ability to speak incoordination with them should be taken into account in theFirst Amendment analysis, we agree. It is the accepted understanding that a party combines its members' power tospeak by aggregating contributions and broadcasting messages more widely than individual contributors generallycould afford to do, and the party marshals this power withgreater sophistication than individuals generally could, usingsuch mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate.In other words, the party is efficient in generating largesums to spend and in pinpointing effective ways to spendthem. Cf. Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 637 (Thomas, J., concur-ring in judgment and dissenting in part) ("Political associations allow citizens to pool their resources and make theiradvocacy more effective").It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency ingetting large sums and spending intelligently that limits ona party's coordinated spending should be scrutinized underan unusually high standard, and in fact any argument fromsophistication and power would cut both ways. On the onehand, one can seek the benefit of stricter scrutiny of a lawcapping party coordinated spending by emphasizing theheavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly thisefficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on theGovernment's view) places a party in a position to be usedto circumvent contribution limits that apply to individualsand PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limitsare aimed at reducing. As a consequence, what the Partycalls an unusual burden imposed by regulating its spendingis not a simple premise for arguing for tighter scrutiny oflimits on a party; it is the premise for a question pointing in533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courtthe opposite direction. If the coordinated spending of other,less efficient and perhaps less practiced political actors canbe limited consistently with the Constitution, why would theConstitution forbid regulation aimed at a party whose veryefficiency in channeling benefits to candidates threatens toundermine the contribution (and hence coordinated spending) limits to which those others are unquestionably subject?4The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy apower and experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in fact the assumption is too crude.While parties command bigger spending budgets than mostindividuals, some individuals could easily rival party commit-tees in spending. Rich political activists crop up, and theUnited States has known its Citizens Kane. Their moneyspeaks loudly, too, and they are therefore burdened by restrictions on its use just as parties are. And yet they arevalidly subject to coordinated spending limits, Buckley, 424U. S., at 46-47, and so are PACs, id., at 35-36, 46-47, whichmay amass bigger treasuries than most party members canspare for politics.15Just as rich donors, media executives, and PACs have themeans to speak as loudly as parties do, they would also havethe capacity to work effectively in tandem with a candidate,just as a party can do. While a candidate has no way ofcoordinating spending with every contributor, there is nothing hard about coordinating with someone with a fortune todonate, any more than a candidate would have difficulty incoordinating spending with an inner circle of personal politi-cal associates or with his own family. Yet all of them are15 By noting that other political actors are validly burdened by limitations on their coordinated spending, we do not mean to take a position asto the wisdom of policies that promote one source of campaign funding oranother. Cf. Brief for Respondent 27, n. 17 (citing academic support forexpanding the role of parties in campaign finance).533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the Courtsubject to coordinated spending limits upheld in Buckley,supra, at 53, n. 59. A party, indeed, is now like some ofthese political actors in yet another way: in its right underColorado I to spend money in support of a candidate withoutlegal limit so long as it spends independently. A party mayspend independently every cent it can raise wherever itthinks its candidate will shine, on every subject and anyviewpoint.A party is not, therefore, in a unique position. It is in thesame position as some individuals and PACs, as to whomcoordinated spending limits have already been held valid,Buckley, supra, at 46-47; and, indeed, a party is better off,for a party has the special privilege the others do not enjoy,of making coordinated expenditures up to the limit of theParty Expenditure Provision.165The Party's arguments for being treated differently fromother political actors subject to limitation on political spending under the Act do not pan out. Despite decades of limita-tion on coordinated spending, parties have not been rendereduseless. In reality, parties continue to organize to elect can-didates, and also function for the benefit of donors whoseobject is to place candidates under obligation, a fact that par-ties cannot escape. Indeed, parties' capacity to concentratepower to elect is the very capacity that apparently opensthem to exploitation as channels for circumventing contribution and coordinated spending limits binding on other politi-cal players. And some of these players could marshal thesame power and sophistication for the same electoral objec-tives as political parties themselves.16 This is the position of the FEC in the aftermath of Colorado I: that aparty committee may make coordinated expenditures up to the amount ofits expenditure limit, in addition to the amount of direct contributionspermitted by the generally applicable contribution limit. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, and n. 3.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the CourtWe accordingly apply to a party's coordinated spendinglimitation the same scrutiny we have applied to the otherpolitical actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate for a contribu-tion limit, enquiring whether the restriction is "closelydrawn" to match what we have recognized as the "suffi-ciently important" government interest in combating political corruption. Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 387-388(quotingBuckley, supra, at 25, 30).17 With the standardthus settled, the issue remains whether adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the limit under that stand-ard, on the theory that unlimited coordinated spending bya party raises the risk of corruption (and its appearance)through circumvention of valid contribution limits. Indeed,all Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a validtheory of corruption; the remaining bone of contention isevidentiary.1817 Whether a different characterization, and hence a different type ofscrutiny, could be appropriate in the context of an as-applied challengefocused on application of the limit to specific expenditures is a questionthat, as Justice Thomas notes, post, at 468, n. 2, we need not reach inthis facial challenge. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5 (noting that the FEChas solicited comments regarding possible criteria for identifying coordinated expenditures).The Party appears to argue that even if the Party Expenditure Provision is justified with regard to coordinated expenditures that amount tono more than payment of the candidate's bills, the limitation is faciallyinvalid because of its potential application to expenditures that involvemore of the party's own speech. Brief for Respondent 48-49. But theParty does not tell us what proportion of the spending falls in one categoryor the other, or otherwise lay the groundwork for its facial overbreadthclaim. Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973) (overbreadthmust be substantial to trigger facial invalidation).18 Apart from circumvention, the FEC also argues that the Party Expenditure Provision is justified by a concern with quid pro quo arrangements and similar corrupting relationships between candidates and partiesthemselves, see Brief for Petitioner 33-38. We find no need to reach thatargument because the evidence supports the long-recognized rationale ofcombating circumvention of contribution limits designed to combat thecorrupting influence of large contributions to candidates from individuals533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the CourtBSince there is no recent experience with unlimited coordi-nated spending, the question is whether experience underthe present law confirms a serious threat of abuse from theunlimited coordinated party spending as the Governmentcontends. Cf. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 208 (1992)(opinion of Blackmun, J.) (noting difficulty of mustering evidence to support long-enforced statutes). It clearly does.Despite years of enforcement of the challenged limits, substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates, donors, andparties test the limits of the current law, and it shows beyondserious doubt how contribution limits would be eroded if in-ducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaringparties' coordinated spending wide open.19and nonparty groups. The dissent does not take issue with this justification as a theoretical matter. See also 213 F. 3d 1221, 1232 (CA10 2000)(Court of Appeals acknowledging circumvention as a possible "avenue ofabuse").19 In Colorado I, the principal opinion suggested that the Party Expenditure Provision was not enacted out of "a special concern about the potentially `corrupting' effect of party expenditures, but rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what [Congress] saw as wastefuland excessive campaign spending." 518 U. S., at 618. That observationwas relevant to our examination of the Party Expenditure Provision asapplied to independent expenditures, see id., at 617-618, limits on whichwere invalidated with regard to other political actors in Buckley in partbecause they were justified by concern with wasteful campaign spending,Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57. Our point in Colorado I was that there was noevidence that Congress had a special motivation regarding parties thatwould justify limiting their independent expenditures after similar limitsimposed on other spenders had been invalidated. As for the Party Expenditure Provision's application to coordinated expenditures, on the otherhand, the evidence discussed in the text suggests that the anticircumvention rationale that justifies other coordinated expenditure limits, see Buckley, supra, at 46-47, is at work here as well. The dissent ignores thisdistinction, post, at 475, but neither the dissent nor the Party seriouslyargues that Congress was not concerned with circumvention of contribution limits using parties as conduits. All acknowledge that Congressenacted other measures prompted by just that concern. See post, at 481;533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN458 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

The same donormay give as much as another $20,000 each year to a nationalparty committee supporting the candidate.20 What a realistwould expect to occur has occurred. Donors give to theparty with the tacit understanding that the favored candidate will benefit. See App. 247 (declaration of Robert Hick-mott, former Democratic fundraiser and National FinanceDirector for Timothy Wirth's Senate campaign) ("We . . . toldcontributors who had made the maximum allowable contribution to the Wirth campaign but who wanted to do morethat they could raise money for the DSCC so that we couldget our maximum [Party Expenditure Provision] allocationfrom the DSCC");id., at 274 (declaration of Timothy Wirth)("I understood that when I raised funds for the DSCC, thedonors expected that I would receive the amount of theirdonations multiplied by a certain number that the DSCC haddetermined in advance, assuming the DSCC has raised otherfunds");id., at 166 (declaration of Leon G.

In the Democratic Party, at least,the method is known as "tallying," a system that helps toconnect donors to candidates through the accommodation of aparty. See App. 246-247 (Hickmott declaration) ("[The tallysystem] is an informal agreement between the DSCC andthe candidates' campaigns that if you help the DSCC raisecontributions, we will turn around and help your campaign");id., at 268 (declaration of former Senator Paul Simon) ("Do-nors would be told the money they contributed could be credited to any Senate candidate.

The dissent may be correct that the FEC considers tallyinglegal, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 3, but one thing is clear: tallyingis a sign that contribution limits are being diluted and could be dilutedfurther if the floodgates were open. Why, after all, does a party botherto tally? The obvious answer is that it wants to know who gets the benefit of the contributions to the party, as the record quotations attest. Seealso n. 23, infra. And the fact that the parties may not fund sure losers,stressed by the dissent (post, at 478-479), is irrelevant. The issue is whatwould become of contribution limits if parties could use unlimited coordinated spending to funnel contributions to those serious contenders whoare favored by the donors.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN460 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the Courtdone independently, and thus less desirably from the point ofview of a donor and his favored candidate. If suddenlyevery dollar of spending could be coordinated with the candi-date, the inducement to circumvent would almost certainlyintensify. Indeed, if a candidate could be assured that dona-tions through a party could result in funds passed throughto him for spending on virtually identical items as his owncampaign funds, a candidate enjoying the patronage of affluent contributors would have a strong incentive not merelyto direct donors to his party, but to promote circumventionas a step toward reducing the number of donors requiringtime-consuming cultivation. If a candidate could arrangefor a party committee to foot his bills, to be paid with $20,000contributions to the party by his supporters, the number ofdonors necessary to raise $1,000,000 could be reduced from500 (at $2,000 per cycle) to 46 (at $2,000 to the candidate and$20,000 to the party, without regard to donations outside theelection year).2323 Any such dollar-for-dollar pass-through would presumably be too obvious to escape the special provision on earmarking, 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(8),see infra, at 462. But the example illustrates the undeniable inducementto more subtle circumvention.The same enhanced value of coordinated spending that could be expected to promote greater circumvention of contribution limits for thebenefit of the candidate-fundraiser would probably enhance the power ofthe fundraiser to use circumvention as a tactic to increase personal powerand a claim to party leadership. The affluent nominee can already do thisto a limited extent, by directing donations to the party and making surethat the party knows who raised the money, and that the needier candidates who receive the benefit of party spending know whom to thank.The candidate can thus become a player beyond his own race, and thedonor's influence is multiplied. See generally App. 249 (Hickmott declaration) ("Incumbents who were not raising money for themselves becausethey were not up for reelection would sometimes raise money for otherSenators, or for challengers. They would send $20,000 to the DSCC andask that this be entered on another candidate's tally. They might do this,for example, if they were planning to run for a leadership position andwanted to obtain the support of the Senators they assisted"). If the effectiveness of party spending could be enhanced by limitless coordination,the ties of straitened candidates to prosperous ones and, vicariously, to533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN461Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)Opinion of the CourtVWhile this evidence rules out denying the potential forcorruption by circumvention, the Party does try to minimizethe threat. It says that most contributions to parties aresmall, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carriedthrough the party conduit. Brief for Respondent 14. Butsome contributions are not small; they can go up to $20,000,2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(1)(B),24 and the record shows that evenunder present law substantial donations turn the parties intomatchmakers whose special meetings and receptions givethe donors the chance to get their points across to the candidates.25 The Party again discounts the threat of outflankingcontribution limits on individuals and nonparty groups bystressing that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on coordinatedexpenditures. Brief for Respondent 34. But the fact thatparties may do well for themselves off incumbents does notdefuse concern over circumvention; if contributions to aparty were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates,there would be no reason for using the tallying system theway the witnesses have described it.large donors would be reinforced as well. Party officials who control distribution of coordinated expenditures would obviously form an additionallink in this chain. See id., at 164, 168 (Billings declaration) ("[The DSCC'sthree-member Executive Committee] basically made the decisions as tohow to distribute the money. . . . Taking away the limits on coordinatedexpenditures would result in a fundamental transferal of power to certainindividual Senators").24 In 1996, 46 percent of itemized (over $200) individual contributions tothe Democratic national party committees and 15 percent of such contributions to the Republican national party committees were $10,000 or more.Biersack & Haskell, Spitting on the Umpire: Political Parties, the FederalElection Campaign Act, and the 1996 Campaigns, in Financing the 1996Election 155, 160 (J.

COLORADOREPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.Opinion of the CourtFinally, the Party falls back to claiming that, even if thereis a threat of circumvention, the First Amendment demandsa response better tailored to that threat than a limitation onspending, even coordinated spending.Id., at 46-48. TheParty has two suggestions.First, it says that better crafted safeguards are in placealready, in particular the earmarking rule of $ 441a(a)(8),which provides that contributions that "are in any way ear-marked or otherwise directed through an intermediary orconduit to [a] candidate" are treated as contributions to thecandidate. The Party says that this provision either sufficesto address any risk of circumvention or would suffice if clarified to cover practices like tallying. Id., at 42, 47; see also213 F. 3d, at 1232. This position, however, ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention under actual political conditions. Donations aremade to a party by contributors who favor the party's candidates in races that affect them; donors are (of course) permitted to express their views and preferences to party officials;and the party is permitted (as we have held it must be) tospend money in its own right. When this is the environment for contributions going into a general party treasury,and candidate-fundraisers are rewarded with something lessobvious than dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs (distributedthrough contributions and party spending), circumvention isobviously very hard to trace. The earmarking provision,even if it dealt directly with tallying, would reach only themost clumsy attempts to pass contributions through to candidates. To treat the earmarking provision as the outer limitof acceptable tailoring would disarm any serious effort tolimit the corrosive effects of what Chief Judge Seymourcalled " `understandings' regarding what donors give whatamounts to the party, which candidates are to receive whatfunds from the party, and what interests particular donorsare seeking to promote," id., at 1241 (dissenting opinion); seealso Briffault, Political Parties and Campaign Finance Re533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 533 U.

Brief for Respondent 46-48. The Party thus invokesthe general rule that contribution limits take a lesser FirstAmendment toll, expenditure limits a greater one. Thatwas one strand of the reasoning in Buckley itself, which re-jected the argument that limitations on independent expenditures by individuals, groups, and candidates were justifiablein order to avoid circumvention of contribution limitations.424 U.

S., at 617.27In each of those cases, however, the Court's reasoning contained another strand. The analysis ultimately turned onthe understanding that the expenditures at issue were notpotential alter egos for contributions, but were independentand therefore functionally true expenditures, qualifying forthe most demanding First Amendment scrutiny employedinBuckley. Colorado I, supra, at 617; Buckley, supra, at44-47. Thus, in Colorado I we could not assume, "absent26 The Party's argument for relying on better earmarking enforcement,accepted by the dissent, post, at 481, would invite a corresponding attackon all contribution limits. As we said in Buckley, 424 U. S., at 27-28, andShrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390, the policy supporting contribution limits is the same as for laws against bribery. But we do not throw out thecontribution limits for unskillful tailoring; prohibitions on bribery, like theearmarking provision here, address only the "most blatant and specific"attempts at corruption, 424 U. S., at 28.27 The dissent therefore suggests, post, at 482, and the District Courtmistakenly concluded, see discussion n. 21, supra, that Colorado I disposedof the tailoring question for purposes of this case.533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v.

S., at 617.Here, however, just the opposite is true. There is no significant functional difference between a party's coordinatedexpenditure and a direct party contribution to the candidate, and there is good reason to expect that a party's rightof unlimited coordinated spending would attract increasedcontributions to parties to finance exactly that kind ofspending.28 Coordinated expenditures of money donated toa party are tailor-made to undermine contribution limits.Therefore the choice here is not, as in Buckley and ColoradoI, between a limit on pure contributions and pure expenditures.29 The choice is between limiting contributions and28 The dissent notes a superficial tension between this analysis and ourrecent statement in Bartnicki v.
