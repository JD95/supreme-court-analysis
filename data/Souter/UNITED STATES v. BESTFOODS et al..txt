The United States brought this action for the costs ofcleaning up industrial waste generated by a chemical plant.The issue before us, under the Comprehensive Environmen-tal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980(CERCLA), 94 Stat. 2767, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 9601 etseq., is whether a parent corporation that actively partici-pated in, and exercised control over, the operations of a subsidiary may, without more, be held liable as an operator of apolluting facility owned or operated by the subsidiary. Weanswer no, unless the corporate veil may be pierced. But acorporate parent that actively participated in, and exercisedcontrol over, the operations of the facility itself may be helddirectly liable in its own right as an operator of the facility.IIn 1980, CERCLA was enacted in response to the seriousenvironmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution.See Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, 475 U. S. 355, 358-359 (1986).

Shortly thereafter, when respondent Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) 4 examined the sitefor environmental damage, it found the land littered withthousands of leaking and even exploding drums of waste,and the soil and water saturated with noxious chemicals.MDNR sought a buyer for the property who would be will-ing to contribute toward its cleanup, and after extensive negotiations, respondent Aerojet-General Corp. arranged fortransfer of the site from the Story bankruptcy trustee in1977. Aerojet created a wholly owned California subsidiary,Cordova Chemical Company (Cordova/California), to purchase the property, and Cordova/California in turn createda wholly owned Michigan subsidiary, Cordova ChemicalCompany of Michigan (Cordova/Michigan), which manufac-tured chemicals at the site until 1986.5By 1981, the federal Environmental Protection Agencyhad undertaken to see the site cleaned up, and its long-termremedial plan called for expenditures well into the tens ofmillions of dollars. To recover some of that money, the4 The powers and responsibilities of MDNR have since been transferredto the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.5 Cordova/California and MDNR entered into a contract under whichCordova/California agreed to undertake certain cleanup actions, andMDNR agreed to share in the funding of those actions and to indemnifyCordova/California for various expenses. The Michigan Court of Appealshas held that this agreement requires MDNR to indemnify Aerojet andits Cordova subsidiaries for any CERCLA liability that they may incur inconnection with their activities at the Muskegon facility. See CordovaChemical Co. v. MDNR, 212 Mich. App. 144, 536 N. W. 2d 860 (1995), leaveto appeal denied, 453 Mich. 901, 554 N.

BESTFOODSOpinion of the CourtUnited States filed this action under $ 107 in 1989, nam-ing five defendants as responsible parties: CPC, Aerojet,Cordova/California, Cordova/Michigan, and Arnold Ott.6(By that time, Ott I and Ott II were defunct.) After theparties (and MDNR) had launched a flurry of contributionclaims, counterclaims, and cross-claims, the District Courtconsolidated the cases for trial in three phases: liability, rem-edy, and insurance coverage. So far, only the first phase hasbeen completed; in 1991, the District Court held a 15-daybench trial on the issue of liability. Because the parties stipulated that the Muskegon plant was a "facility" within themeaning of 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(9), that hazardous substanceshad been released at the facility, and that the United Stateshad incurred reimbursable response costs to clean up thesite, the trial focused on the issues of whether CPC andAerojet, as the parent corporations of Ott II and the Cordovacompanies, had "owned or operated" the facility within themeaning of $ 107(a)(2).The District Court said that operator liability may attachto a parent corporation both directly, when the parent itselfoperates the facility, and indirectly, when the corporate veilcan be pierced under state law. SeeCPC Int'l, Inc. v.Aerojet-General Corp., 777 F. Supp. 549, 572 (WD Mich.1991). The court explained that, while CERCLA imposesdirect liability in situations in which the corporate veil cannot be pierced under traditional concepts of corporate law,"the statute and its legislative history do not suggest thatCERCLA rejects entirely the crucial limits to liability thatare inherent to corporate law."Id., at 573. As the DistrictCourt put it:"a parent corporation is directly liable under section107(a)(2) as an operator only when it has exerted poweror influence over its subsidiary by actively participatingin and exercising control over the subsidiary's business6 Arnold Ott settled out of court with the Government on the eve of trial.524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 524 U. S. 51 (1998)Opinion of the Courtduring a period of disposal of hazardous waste. A par-ent's actual participation in and control over a subsidiary's functions and decision-making creates `operator'liability under CERCLA; a parent's mere oversight of asubsidiary's business in a manner appropriate and consistent with the investment relationship between a par-ent and its wholly owned subsidiary does not."Ibid.Applying that test to the facts of this case, the District Courtheld both CPC and Aerojet liable under $ 107(a)(2) as opera-tors. As to CPC, the court found it particularly telling thatCPC selected Ott II's board of directors and populated itsexecutive ranks with CPC officials, and that a CPC official,G. R. D. Williams, played a significant role in shaping Ott II'senvironmental compliance policy.After a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit reversed in part, United States v. Cordova/Michigan,59 F. 3d 584, that court granted rehearing en banc andvacated the panel decision, 67 F. 3d 586 (1995). This time,7 judges to 6, the court again reversed the District Courtin part. 113 F. 3d 572 (1997). The majority remarked onthe possibility that a parent company might be held directlyliable as an operator of a facility owned by its subsidiary:"At least conceivably, a parent might independently oper-ate the facility in the stead of its subsidiary; or, as a sortof joint venturer, actually operate the facility alongside itssubsidiary."Id., at 579. But the court refused to go anyfurther and rejected the District Court's analysis with theexplanation:"[W]here a parent corporation is sought to be held liable as an operator pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(2)based upon the extent of its control of its subsidiarywhich owns the facility, the parent will be liable onlywhen the requirements necessary to pierce the corporate veil [under state law] are met. In other words, . . .whether the parent will be liable as an operator depends524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courtupon whether the degree to which it controls its subsid-iary and the extent and manner of its involvement withthe facility, amount to the abuse of the corporate formthat will warrant piercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent andsubsidiary."Id., at 580.Applying Michigan veil-piercing law, the Court of Appealsdecided that neither CPC nor Aerojet7 was liable for controlling the actions of its subsidiaries, since the parent and sub-sidiary corporations maintained separate personalities andthe parents did not utilize the subsidiary corporate form toperpetrate fraud or subvert justice.We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1024 (1997), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits over the extent to which parentcorporations may be held liable under CERCLA for operat-ing facilities ostensibly under the control of their subsidiaries.8 We now vacate and remand.7 Unlike CPC, Aerojet does not base its defense in this Court on a claimthat, absent unusual circumstances, a parent company can be held liableas an operator of a facility only by piercing the corporate veil. Rather,Aerojet denies liability by claiming that (1) neither it nor its subsidiariesdisposed of hazardous substances during their operation of the facility, seeBrief for Respondents Aerojet-General Corp. et al. 27-36, and (2) it isentitled to a third-party defense under $ 107(b)(3) of CERCLA, 42 U. S. C.$ 9607(b)(3), see Brief for Respondents Aerojet-General Corp. et al. 38-46.The Court of Appeals expressed some measure of agreement with Aerojeton these points and instructed the District Court to consider them onremand. See 113 F. 3d, at 577, 583. These issues are not before thisCourt.8 Compare United States v.

Thus it is hornbook law that "the exercise of the `control' which stock ownership gives to the stockholders . . . will not create liability(CA1 1990) (parent actively involved in the affairs of its subsidiary maybe held directly liable as an operator of the facility, regardless of whetherthe corporate veil can be pierced), cert. denied, 498 U.

That `control' includesthe election of directors, the making of by-laws . . . and thedoing of all other acts incident to the legal status of stock-holders. Nor will a duplication of some or all of the directors or executive officers be fatal." Douglas 196 (footnotesomitted). Although this respect for corporate distinctionswhen the subsidiary is a polluter has been severely criticizedin the literature, see, e. g., Note, Liability of Parent Corpora-tions for Hazardous Waste Cleanup and Damages, 99 Harv.L. Rev. 986 (1986), nothing in CERCLA purports to rejectthis bedrock principle, and against this venerable commonlaw backdrop, the congressional silence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S.256, 266-267 (1979) ("[S]ilence is most eloquent, for such reticence while contemplating an important and controversialchange in existing law is unlikely"). The Government hasindeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as anowner or an operator under $ 107 simply because its subsidiary is subject to liability for owning or operating a polluting facility.But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporatelaw, applicable to the parent-subsidiary relationship as wellas generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and theshareholder held liable for the corporation's conduct when,inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misusedto accomplish certain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud,on the shareholder's behalf. See, e. g., Anderson v. Abbott,supra, at 362 ("[T]here are occasions when the limited liability sought to be obtained through the corporation will bequalified or denied"); Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic and Commerce Assn., 247 U.

Nothing inCERCLA purports to rewrite this well-settled rule, either.CERCLA is thus like many another congressional enactmentin giving no indication that "the entire corpus of state corpo-ration law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff 's causeof action is based upon a federal statute," Burks v. Lasker,441 U. S. 471, 478 (1979), and the failure of the statute tospeak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implicationsof corporate ownership demands application of the rule that"[i]n order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statutemust speak directly to the question addressed by the common law," United States v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534 (1993)(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appealswas accordingly correct in holding that when (but only when)the corporate veil may be pierced,9 may a parent corporation9 There is significant disagreement among courts and commentators overwhether, in enforcing CERCLA's indirect liability, courts should borrowstate law, or instead apply a federal common law of veil piercing. Compare, e. g., 113 F. 3d, at 584-585 (Merritt, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that federal common law should apply), LansfordCoaldale Joint Water Auth. v. Tonolli Corp., 4 F. 3d, at 1225 ("[G]iven thefederal interest in uniformity in the application of CERCLA, it is federalcommon law, and not state law, which governs when corporate veilpiercing is justified under CERCLA"), and Aronovsky & Fuller, Liability of Parent Corporations for Hazardous Substance Releases underCERCLA, 24 U.

BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courtbe charged with derivative CERCLA liability for its subsid-iary's actions.10IVAIf the Act rested liability entirely on ownership of a pollut-ing facility, this opinion might end here; but CERCLA liability may turn on operation as well as ownership, and nothingin the statute's terms bars a parent corporation from directliability for its own actions in operating a facility owned byits subsidiary. As Justice (then-Professor) Douglas noted almost 70 years ago, derivative liability cases are to be distin-guished from those in which "the alleged wrong can seemingly be traced to the parent through the conduit of its ownpersonnel and management" and "the parent is directly aparticipant in the wrong complained of." Douglas 207, 208.11(Mass. 1987) (noting that, since "federal common law draws upon state lawfor guidance, . . . the choice between state and federal [veil-piercing law]may in many cases present questions of academic interest, but little practical significance"). But cf. Note, Piercing the Corporate Law Veil: TheAlter Ego Doctrine Under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 853(1982) (arguing that federal common law need not mirror state law, because "federal common law should look to federal statutory policy ratherthan to state corporate law when deciding whether to pierce the corporateveil"). Since none of the parties challenges the Sixth Circuit's holdingthat CPC and Aerojet incurred no derivative liability, the question is notpresented in this case, and we do not address it further.10 Some courts and commentators have suggested that this indirect,veil-piercing approach can subject a parent corporation to liability only asan owner, and not as an operator. See, e. g., Lansford-Coaldale JointWater Auth. v. Tonolli Corp., supra, at 1220; Oswald, Bifurcation of theOwner and Operator Analysis under CERCLA, 72 Wash. U. L. Q. 223, 281-282 (1994) (hereinafter Oswald). We think it is otherwise, however. Ifa subsidiary that operates, but does not own, a facility is so pervasivelycontrolled by its parent for a sufficiently improper purpose to warrant veilpiercing, the parent may be held derivatively liable for the subsidiary'sacts as an operator.11 While this article was written together with Professor Shanks, thepassages quoted in this opinion were written solely by Justice Douglas.See Douglas 193, n. *.524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 524 U. S. 51 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn such instances, the parent is directly liable for its ownactions. See H. Henn & J. Alexander, Laws of Corporations347 (3d ed. 1983) (hereinafter Henn & Alexander) ("Apartfrom corporation law principles, a shareholder, whether anatural person or a corporation, may be liable on the groundthat such shareholder's activity resulted in the liability").The fact that a corporate subsidiary happens to own a polluting facility operated by its parent does nothing, then, to dis-place the rule that the parent "corporation is [itself] responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course ofits business,"Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S.344, 395 (1922), and whereas the rules of veil piercing limitderivative liability for the actions of another corporation,CERCLA's "operator" provision is concerned primarily withdirect liability for one's own actions. See, e. g., SidneyS. Arst Co. v. Pipefitters Welfare Ed. Fund, 25 F. 3d 417,420 (CA7 1994) ("[T]he direct, personal liability provided byCERCLA is distinct from the derivative liability that resultsfrom piercing the corporate veil" (internal quotation marksomitted)). It is this direct liability that is properly seen asbeing at issue here.Under the plain language of the statute, any person whooperates a polluting facility is directly liable for the costs ofcleaning up the pollution. See 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(2). Thisis so regardless of whether that person is the facility's owner,the owner's parent corporation or business partner, or evena saboteur who sneaks into the facility at night to dischargeits poisons out of malice. If any such act of operating a corporate subsidiary's facility is done on behalf of a parent corporation, the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationshipunder state corporate law is simply irrelevant to the issueof direct liability. See Riverside Market Dev. Corp. v. International Bldg. Prods., Inc., 931 F. 2d 327, 330 (CA5)("CERCLA prevents individuals from hiding behind the corporate shield when, as `operators,' they themselves actuallyparticipate in the wrongful conduct prohibited by the Act"),524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courtcert. denied, 502 U. S. 1004 (1991); United States v. KayserRoth Corp., 910 F. 2d 24, 26 (CA1 1990) ("[A] person who isan operator of a facility is not protected from liability by thelegal structure of ownership").12This much is easy to say: the difficulty comes in definingactions sufficient to constitute direct parental "operation."Here of course we may again rue the uselessness ofCERCLA's definition of a facility's "operator" as "any person. . . operating" the facility, 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(20)(A)(ii), whichleaves us to do the best we can to give the term its "ordinaryor natural meaning." Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,145 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a mechanical sense, to "operate" ordinarily means "[t]o control thefunctioning of; run: operate a sewing machine." AmericanHeritage Dictionary 1268 (3d ed. 1992); see also Webster'sNew International Dictionary 1707 (2d ed. 1958) ("to work;as, to operate a machine"). And in the organizational sensemore obviously intended by CERCLA, the word ordinarilymeans "[t]o conduct the affairs of; manage: operate a business." American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 1268; seealso Webster's New International Dictionary, supra, at 1707("to manage"). So, under CERCLA, an operator is simplysomeone who directs the workings of, manages, or conductsthe affairs of a facility. To sharpen the definition for purposes of CERCLA's concern with environmental contamination, an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operationsspecifically related to pollution, that is, operations having12 See Oswald 257 ("There are . . . instances . . . in which the parenthas not sufficiently overstepped the bounds of corporate separateness towarrant piercing, yet is involved enough in the facility's activities that itshould be held liable as an operator. Imagine, for example, a parent whostrictly observed corporate formalities, avoided intertwining officers anddirectors, and adequately capitalized its subsidiary, yet provided active,daily supervision and control over hazardous waste disposal activities ofthe subsidiary. Such a parent should not escape liability just because itsactivities do not justify a piercing of the subsidiary's veil").524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 524 U. S. 51 (1998)Opinion of the Courtto do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, ordecisions about compliance with environmental regulations.BWith this understanding, we are satisfied that the Courtof Appeals correctly rejected the District Court's analysis ofdirect liability. But we also think that the appeals courterred in limiting direct liability under the statute to a parent's sole or joint venture operation, so as to eliminate anypossible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the factsof this case. 1By emphasizing that "CPC is directly liable under section107(a)(2) as an operator because CPC actively participatedin and exerted significant control over Ott II's business anddecision-making," 777 F. Supp., at 574, the District Courtapplied the "actual control" test of whether the parent "actu-ally operated the business of its subsidiary," id., at 573, asseveral Circuits have employed it, see, e. g., United States v.Kayser-Roth Corp., supra, at 27 (operator liability "requiresactive involvement in the affairs of the subsidiary"); Jackson-ville Elec. Auth. v. Bernuth Corp., 996 F. 2d 1107, 1110(CA11 1993) (parent is liable if it "actually exercised controlover, or was otherwise intimately involved in the operationsof, the [subsidiary] corporation immediately responsible forthe operation of the facility" (internal quotation marksomitted)).The well-taken objection to the actual control test, however, is its fusion of direct and indirect liability; the test isadministered by asking a question about the relationship between the two corporations (an issue going to indirect liabil-ity) instead of a question about the parent's interaction withthe subsidiary's facility (the source of any direct liability).If, however, direct liability for the parent's operation of thefacility is to be kept distinct from derivative liability for thesubsidiary's own operation, the focus of the enquiry must524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courtnecessarily be different under the two tests. "The questionis not whether the parent operates the subsidiary, but ratherwhether it operates the facility, and that operation is evi-denced by participation in the activities of the facility, notthe subsidiary. Control of the subsidiary, if extensiveenough, gives rise to indirect liability under piercing doc-trine, not direct liability under the statutory language." Oswald 269; see also Schiavone v. Pearce, 79 F. 3d 248, 254(CA2 1996) ("Any liabilities [the parent] may have as anoperator, then, stem directly from its control over the plant").The District Court was therefore mistaken to rest its analysis on CPC's relationship with Ott II, premising liability onlittle more than "CPC's 100-percent ownership of Ott II" and"CPC's active participation in, and at times majority controlover, Ott II's board of directors." 777 F. Supp., at 575. Theanalysis should instead have rested on the relationship between CPC and the Muskegon facility itself.In addition to (and perhaps as a reflection of) the erroneous focus on the relationship between CPC and Ott II, eventhose findings of the District Court that might be taken tospeak to the extent of CPC's activity at the facility itselfare flawed, for the District Court wrongly assumed that theactions of the joint officers and directors are necessarily attributable to CPC. The District Court emphasized the factsthat CPC placed its own high-level officials on Ott II's boardof directors and in key management positions at Ott II, andthat those individuals made major policy decisions and conducted day-to-day operations at the facility: "Although OttII corporate officers set the day-to-day operating policies forthe company without any need to obtain formal approvalfrom CPC, CPC actively participated in this decision-makingbecause high-ranking CPC officers served in Ott II management positions." Id., at 559; see also id., at 575 (relying on"CPC's involvement in major decision-making and day-today operations through CPC officials who served within OttII management, including the positions of president and chief524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 524 U.

AB Volvo, 844 F. 2d 56, 57 (CA2),cert. denied, 488 U. S. 852 (1988); see also Kingston DryDock Co. v. Lake Champlain Transp. Co., 31 F. 2d 265, 267(CA2 1929) (L. Hand, J.) ("Control through the ownership ofshares does not fuse the corporations, even when the directors are common to each"); Henn & Alexander 355 (notingthat it is "normal" for a parent and subsidiary to "have identical directors and officers").This recognition that the corporate personalities remaindistinct has its corollary in the "well established principle [ofcorporate law] that directors and officers holding positionswith a parent and its subsidiary can and do `change hats'to represent the two corporations separately, despite theircommon ownership." Lusk v. Foxmeyer Health Corp., 129F. 3d 773, 779 (CA5 1997); see also Fisser v. InternationalBank, 282 F. 2d 231, 238 (CA2 1960).

BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courthere that dual officers and directors made policy decisionsand supervised activities at the facility. The Governmentwould have to show that, despite the general presumption tothe contrary, the officers and directors were acting in theircapacities as CPC officers and directors, and not as Ott IIofficers and directors, when they committed those acts.13The District Court made no such enquiry here, however, dis-regarding entirely this time-honored common-law rule.In sum, the District Court's focus on the relationship be-tween parent and subsidiary (rather than parent and facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actionsof dual officers and directors to the corporate parent, erroneously, even if unintentionally, treated CERCLA as though itdisplaced or fundamentally altered common-law standards oflimited liability. Indeed, if the evidence of common corpo-rate personnel acting at management and directorial levelswere enough to support a finding of a parent corporation'sdirect operator liability under CERCLA, then the possibilityof resort to veil piercing to establish indirect, derivative lia-bility for the subsidiary's violations would be academic.There would in essence be a relaxed, CERCLA-specific ruleof derivative liability that would banish traditional standardsand expectations from the law of CERCLA liability. But,as we have said, such a rule does not arise from congressional silence, and CERCLA's silence is dispositive.2We accordingly agree with the Court of Appeals that aparticipation-and-control test looking to the parent's supervi13 We do not attempt to recite the ways in which the Government couldshow that dual officers or directors were in fact acting on behalf of theparent. Here, it is prudent to say only that the presumption that an actis taken on behalf of the corporation for whom the officer claims to act isstrongest when the act is perfectly consistent with the norms of corporatebehavior, but wanes as the distance from those accepted norms approachesthe point of action by a dual officer plainly contrary to the interests of thesubsidiary yet nonetheless advantageous to the parent.524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 524 U. S. 51 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsion over the subsidiary, especially one that assumes thatdual officers always act on behalf of the parent, cannot beused to identify operation of a facility resulting in direct pa-rental liability. Nonetheless, a return to the ordinary meaning of the word "operate" in the organizational sense willindicate why we think that the Sixth Circuit stopped shortwhen it confined its examples of direct parental operation toexclusive or joint ventures, and declined to find at least thepossibility of direct operation by CPC in this case.In our enquiry into the meaning Congress presumably hadin mind when it used the verb "to operate," we recognizedthat the statute obviously meant something more than meremechanical activation of pumps and valves, and must be readto contemplate "operation" as including the exercise of direction over the facility's activities. See supra, at 66-67. TheCourt of Appeals recognized this by indicating that a parentcan be held directly liable when the parent operates the facility in the stead of its subsidiary or alongside the subsidiaryin some sort of a joint venture. See 113 F. 3d, at 579. Weanticipated a further possibility above, however, when weobserved that a dual officer or director might depart so farfrom the norms of parental influence exercised through dualofficeholding as to serve the parent, even when ostensiblyacting on behalf of the subsidiary in operating the facility.See n. 13, supra. Yet another possibility, suggested by thefacts of this case, is that an agent of the parent with no hatto wear but the parent's hat might manage or direct activities at the facility.Identifying such an occurrence calls for line-drawing yetagain, since the acts of direct operation that give rise to parental liability must necessarily be distinguished from theinterference that stems from the normal relationship between parent and subsidiary. Again norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by any CERCLA provision) are crucialreference points. Just as we may look to such norms inidentifying the limits of the presumption that a dual office524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODSOpinion of the Courtholder acts in his ostensible capacity, so here we may referto them in distinguishing a parental officer's oversight of asubsidiary from such an officer's control over the operationof the subsidiary's facility. "[A]ctivities that involve the facility but which are consistent with the parent's investorstatus, such as monitoring of the subsidiary's performance,supervision of the subsidiary's finance and capital budget decisions, and articulation of general policies and procedures,should not give rise to direct liability." Oswald 282. Thecritical question is whether, in degree and detail, actions di-rected to the facility by an agent of the parent alone areeccentric under accepted norms of parental oversight of asubsidiary's facility.There is, in fact, some evidence that CPC engaged in justthis type and degree of activity at the Muskegon plant. TheDistrict Court's opinion speaks of an agent of CPC alone whoplayed a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the operation of the plant. G. R. D. Williamsworked only for CPC; he was not an employee, officer, ordirector of Ott II, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, and thus, his actionswere of necessity taken only on behalf of CPC. The DistrictCourt found that "CPC became directly involved in environmental and regulatory matters through the work of . . . Williams, CPC's governmental and environmental affairs director. Williams . . . became heavily involved in environmentalissues at Ott II." 777 F. Supp., at 561. He "actively participated in and exerted control over a variety of Ott II environmental matters," ibid., and he "issued directives regardingOtt II's responses to regulatory inquiries," id., at 575.We think that these findings are enough to raise an issueof CPC's operation of the facility through Williams's actions,though we would draw no ultimate conclusion from thesefindings at this point. Not only would we be deciding in thefirst instance an issue on which the trial and appellate courtsdid not focus, but the very fact that the District Court didnot see the case as we do suggests that there may be still524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN73Cite as: 524 U. S. 51 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmore to be known about Williams's activities. Indeed, evenas the factual findings stand, the trial court offered little inthe way of concrete detail for its conclusions about Williams'srole in Ott II's environmental affairs, and the parties vigorously dispute the extent of Williams's involvement. Pru-dence thus counsels us to remand, on the theory of directoperation set out here, for reevaluation of Williams's role,and of the role of any other CPC agent who might be said tohave had a part in operating the Muskegon facility.14VThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions toreturn it to the District Court for further proceedings con-sistent with this opinion.
