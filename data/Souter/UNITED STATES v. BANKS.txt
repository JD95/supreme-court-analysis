Officers executing a warrant to search for cocaine in respondent Banks's apartment knocked and announced theirauthority. The question is whether their 15-to-20-secondwait before a forcible entry satisfied the Fourth Amendmentand 18 U. S. C. $ 3109. We hold that it did.IWith information that Banks was selling cocaine at home,North Las Vegas Police Department officers and FederalBureau of Investigation agents got a warrant to search histwo-bedroom apartment. As soon as they arrived there,about 2 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon, officers posted infront called out "police search warrant" and rapped hardenough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door.Brief for United States 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).There was no indication whether anyone was home, and afterwaiting for 15 to 20 seconds with no answer, the officersbroke open the front door with a battering ram. Banks wasin the shower and testified that he heard nothing until thecrash of the door, which brought him out dripping to confrontthe police. The search produced weapons, crack cocaine,and other evidence of drug dealing.In response to drug and firearms charges, Banks moved tosuppress evidence, arguing that the officers executing thesearch warrant waited an unreasonably short time beforeforcing entry, and so violated both the Fourth Amendmentand 18 U. S. C. $ 3109.1 The District Court denied the motion, and Banks pleaded guilty, reserving his right to challenge the search on appeal.1 The statute provides: "The officer may break open any outer or innerdoor or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, toexecute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, heis refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a personaiding him in the execution of the warrant."540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN34 UNITED STATES v. BANKSOpinion of the CourtA divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed and orderedsuppression of the evidence found. 282 F. 3d 699 (2002). Inassessing the reasonableness of the execution of the warrant,the panel majority set out a nonexhaustive list of "factorsthat an officer reasonably should consider" in deciding whento enter premises identified in a warrant, after knockingand announcing their presence but receiving no expressacknowledgment:"(a) size of the residence; (b) location of the residence;(c) location of the officers in relation to the main livingor sleeping areas of the residence; (d) time of day;(e) nature of the suspected offense; (f) evidence demonstrating the suspect's guilt; (g) suspect's prior convictions and, if any, the type of offense for which he wasconvicted; and (h) any other observations triggering thesenses of the officers that reasonably would lead oneto believe that immediate entry was necessary." Id.,at 704.The majority also defined four categories of intrusion afterknock and announcement, saying that the classification "aidsin the resolution of the essential question whether the entrymade herein was reasonable under the circumstances":"(1) entries in which exigent circumstances exist andnon-forcible entry is possible, permitting entry to bemade simultaneously with or shortly after announcement; (2) entries in which exigent circumstances existand forced entry by destruction of property is required,necessitating more specific inferences of exigency;(3) entries in which no exigent circumstances exist andnon-forcible entry is possible, requiring an explicit refusal of admittance or a lapse of a significant amount oftime; and (4) entries in which no exigent circumstancesexist and forced entry by destruction of property is required, mandating an explicit refusal of admittance or a540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN35Cite as: 540 U.

The majority held the 15-to-20-second delay afterknocking and announcing to be "[in]sufficient . . . to satisfythe constitutional safeguards." Id., at 705.Judge Fisher dissented, saying that the majority ought tocome out the other way based on the very grounds itstressed: Banks's small apartment, the loud knock and announcement, the suspected offense of dealing in cocaine, andthe time of the day. Judge Fisher thought the lapse of 15to 20 seconds was enough to support a reasonable inferencethat admittance had been constructively denied.Id., at 710.We granted certiorari to consider how to go about applying the standard of reasonableness to the length of timepolice with a warrant must wait before entering without permission after knocking and announcing their intent in a fel-ony case. 537 U. S. 1187 (2003). We now reverse.IIThere has never been a dispute that these officers wereobliged to knock and announce their intentions when executing the search warrant, an obligation they concededly hon-ored. Despite this agreement, we start with a word aboutstandards for requiring or dispensing with a knock and an-nouncement, since the same criteria bear on when the officers could legitimately enter after knocking.The Fourth Amendment says nothing specific about formalities in exercising a warrant's authorization, speaking tothe manner of searching as well as to the legitimacy ofsearching at all simply in terms of the right to be "secure. . . against unreasonable searches and seizures." Althoughthe notion of reasonable execution must therefore be fleshed540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN36 UNITED STATES v. BANKSOpinion of the Courtout, we have done that case by case, largely avoiding catego-ries and protocols for searches. Instead, we have treatedreasonableness as a function of the facts of cases so variousthat no template is likely to produce sounder results thanexamining the totality of circumstances in a given case; itis too hard to invent categories without giving short shriftto details that turn out to be important in a given instance,and without inflating marginal ones. See,e. g., Ohio v. Rob-inette, 519 U. S. 33, 39 (1996) ("[W]e have consistentlyeschewed bright-line rules, instead emphasizing the fact-specific nature of the reasonableness inquiry"); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 33 (1963) (reasonableness not susceptibleto Procrustean application); Go-Bart Importing Co. v. UnitedStates, 282 U. S. 344, 357 (1931) (no formula for determiningreasonableness; each case on its own facts and circumstances). We have, however, pointed out factual considera-tions of unusual, albeit not dispositive, significance.In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), we held thatthe common law knock-and-announce principle is one focusof the reasonableness enquiry; and we subsequently decidedthat although the standard generally requires the police toannounce their intent to search before entering closed prem-ises, the obligation gives way when officers "have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence,under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous orfutile, or . . . would inhibit the effective investigation of thecrime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence,"Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 394 (1997). When awarrant applicant gives reasonable grounds to expect futilityor to suspect that one or another such exigency already ex-ists or will arise instantly upon knocking, a magistrate judgeis acting within the Constitution to authorize a "no-knock"entry.2 And even when executing a warrant silent about2 Some States give magistrate judges the authority to issue "no-knock"warrants, and some do not. See, e. g., Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S.385, 396, n. 7 (1997) (collecting state statutes and cases).540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN37Cite as: 540 U.

Id., at 394, 396, n. 7.Since most people keep their doors locked, entering without knocking will normally do some damage, a circumstancetoo common to require a heightened justification when a reasonable suspicion of exigency already justifies an unwarnedentry. We have accordingly held that police in exigent circumstances may damage premises so far as necessary for ano-knock entrance without demonstrating the suspected riskin any more detail than the law demands for an unannouncedintrusion simply by lifting the latch.United States v. Ra-mirez, 523 U. S. 65, 70-71 (1998). Either way, it is enoughthat the officers had a reasonable suspicion of exigentcircumstances.3IIILike Ramirez, this case turns on the significance of exi-gency revealed by circumstances known to the officers, forthe only substantive difference between the two situationsgoes to the time at which the officers reasonably anticipatedsome danger calling for action without delay.4 Whereas the3 The standard for a no-knock entry stated in Richards applies on reasonable suspicion of exigency or futility. Because the facts here go toexigency, not futility, we speak of that alone.4 Ramirez and Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385 (1997), our casesaddressing the role of exigency in assessing the reasonableness of a noknock entry, involved searches by warrant for evidence of a felony, as doesthis case. In a different context governed by the Fourth Amendment, wehave held that the risk of losing evidence of a minor offense is insufficientto make it reasonable to enter a dwelling to make a warrantless arrest.See Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 (1984). Courts of Appeals haveapplied Welsh to warrantless entries simply to search for evidence, considering the gravity of the offense in determining whether exigent circumstances exist. See, e. g., United States v. Aquino, 836 F. 2d 1268, 1271-1273 (CA10 1988); United States v. Clement, 854 F. 2d 1116, 1120 (CA81988) (per curiam). We intimate nothing here about such warrantlessentry cases. Nor do we express a view on the significance of the existence of a warrant in evaluating whether exigency justifies action in540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN38 UNITED STATES v. BANKSOpinion of the CourtRamirez Magistrate Judge found in advance that the custom-ary warning would raise an immediate risk that a wantedfelon would elude capture or pose a threat to the officers, seeid., at 68, here the Government claims that a risk of losingevidence arose shortly after knocking and announcing. Al-though the police concededly arrived at Banks's door withoutreasonable suspicion of facts justifying a no-knock entry,they argue that announcing their presence started the clockrunning toward the moment of apprehension that Bankswould flush away the easily disposable cocaine, prompted byknowing the police would soon be coming in. While it washeld reasonable for the police inRamirez to enter forciblyupon arrival, the Government argues it was equally reasonable for the officers to go in with force here as soon as thedanger of disposal had ripened.Banks does not, of course, deny that exigency may developin the period beginning when officers with a warrant knockto be admitted, and the issue comes down to whether it wasreasonable to suspect imminent loss of evidence after the 15to 20 seconds the officers waited prior to forcing their way.Though we agree with Judge Fisher's dissenting opinion thatthis call is a close one, 282 F. 3d, at 707, we think that after15 or 20 seconds without a response, police could fairly suspect that cocaine would be gone if they were reticent anylonger. Courts of Appeals have, indeed, routinely held similar wait times to be reasonable in drug cases with similarfacts including easily disposable evidence (and some courtshave found even shorter ones to be reasonable enough).5knock-and-announce cases when the reason for the search is a minoroffense.5 Several Courts of Appeals have explicitly taken into account the riskof disposal of drug evidence as a factor in evaluating the reasonablenessof waiting time. See, e. g., United States v. Goodson, 165 F. 3d 610, 612,614 (CA8 1999) (holding a 20-second wait after a loud announcement at aone-story ranch reasonable); United States v. Spikes, 158 F. 3d 913, 925-927 (CA6 1998) (holding a 15-to-30-second wait in midmorning after a loudannouncement reasonable); United States v.

S. 31 (2003)Opinion of the CourtA look at Banks's counterarguments shows why thesecourts reached sensible results, for each of his reasons forsaying that 15 to 20 seconds was too brief rests on a mistakeabout the relevant enquiry: the fact that he was actually inthe shower and did not hear the officers is not to the point,and the same is true of the claim that it might have takenhim longer than 20 seconds if he had heard the knock andheaded straight for the door. As for the shower, it is enoughto say that the facts known to the police are what count injudging reasonable waiting time, cf.,e. g., Graham v. Connor,490 U. S. 386, 396 (1989) ("The `reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of areasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20vision of hindsight"), and there is no indication that the po-lice knew that Banks was in the shower and thus unawareof an impending search that he would otherwise have triedto frustrate.And the argument that 15 to 20 seconds was too short forBanks to have come to the door ignores the very risk thatjustified prompt entry. True, if the officers were to justifytheir timing here by claiming that Banks's failure to admitthem fairly suggested a refusal to let them in, Banks couldat least argue that no such suspicion can arise until an occu323 (CADC 1993) (holding a 15-second wait after a reasonably audibleannouncement at 7:45 a.m. on a weekday reasonable); United States v.Garcia, 983 F. 2d 1160, 1168 (CA1 1993) (holding a 10-second wait after aloud announcement reasonable); United States v. Jones, 133 F. 3d 358, 361-362 (CA5 1998) (per curiam) (relying specifically on the concept of exigency, holding a 15-to-20-second wait reasonable). See also United Statesv. Chavez-Miranda, 306 F. 3d 973, 981-982, n. 7 (CA9 2002) ("Banks appears to be a departure from our prior decisions. . . .

BANKSOpinion of the Courtpant has had time to get to the door,6 a time that will varywith the size of the establishment, perhaps five seconds toopen a motel room door, or several minutes to move througha townhouse. In this case, however, the police claim exigentneed to enter, and the crucial fact in examining their actionsis not time to reach the door but the particular exigencyclaimed. On the record here, what matters is the opportu-nity to get rid of cocaine, which a prudent dealer will keepnear a commode or kitchen sink. The significant circum-stances include the arrival of the police during the day, whenanyone inside would probably have been up and around, andthe sufficiency of 15 to 20 seconds for getting to the bathroomor the kitchen to start flushing cocaine down the drain.That is, when circumstances are exigent because a pushermay be near the point of putting his drugs beyond reach, itis imminent disposal, not travel time to the entrance, thatgoverns when the police may reasonably enter; since thebathroom and kitchen are usually in the interior of a dwelling, not the front hall, there is no reason generally to pegthe travel time to the location of the door, and no reliablebasis for giving the proprietor of a mansion a longer waitthan the resident of a bungalow, or an apartment likeBanks's. And 15 to 20 seconds does not seem an unrealisticguess about the time someone would need to get in a positionto rid his quarters of cocaine.Once the exigency had matured, of course, the officerswere not bound to learn anything more or wait any longerbefore going in, even though their entry entailed some harmto the building. Ramirez held that the exigent need of lawenforcement trumps a resident's interest in avoiding allproperty damage, see 523 U. S., at 70-71, and there is noreason to treat a post-knock exigency differently from theno-knock counterpart in Ramirez itself.6 It is probably unrealistic even on its own terms. The apartment was"small," 282 F. 3d 699, 704 (CA9 2002), and a man may walk the length oftoday's small apartment in 15 seconds.540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN41Cite as: 540 U. S. 31 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIVOur emphasis on totality analysis necessarily rejects posi-tions taken on each side of this case.Ramirez, for example,cannot be read with the breadth the Government espouses,as "reflect[ing] a general principle that the need to damageproperty in order to effectuate an entry to execute a searchwarrant should not be part of the analysis of whether theentry itself was reasonable." Brief for United States 18;Reply Brief for United States 4. At common law, theknock-and-announce rule was traditionally "justified in partby the belief that announcement generally would avoid `thedestruction or breaking of any house . . . by which greatdamage and inconvenience might ensue.' " Wilson, 514U. S., at 935-936 (quotingSemayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep. 91a,91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 196 (K. B. 1603)). One point in making an officer knock and announce, then, is to give a personinside the chance to save his door. That is why, in the casewith no reason to suspect an immediate risk of frustrationor futility in waiting at all, the reasonable wait time maywell be longer when police make a forced entry, since theyought to be more certain the occupant has had time to answer the door. It is hard to be more definite than that, with-out turning the notion of a reasonable time under all thecircumstances into a set of sub-rules as the Ninth Circuit hasbeen inclined to do. Suffice it to say that the need to damage property in the course of getting in is a good reason torequire more patience than it would be reasonable to expectif the door were open. Police seeking a stolen piano maybe able to spend more time to make sure they really needthe battering ram.On the other side, we disapprove of the Court of Appeals'sfour-part scheme for vetting knock-and-announce entries.To begin with, the demand for enhanced evidence of exigencybefore a door can reasonably be damaged by a warrantedno-knock intrusion was already bad law before the Court ofAppeals decided this case. In Ramirez (a case from the540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN42 UNITED STATES v. BANKSOpinion of the CourtNinth Circuit), we rejected an attempt to subdivide felonycases by accepting "mild exigency" for entry without property damage, but requiring "more specific inferences of exi-gency" before damage would be reasonable. 523 U. S., at69-71 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Ap-peals did not cite Ramirez.Nor did the appeals court cite United States v. Arvizu, 534U. S. 266 (2002) (again, from the Ninth Circuit). There, werecently disapproved a framework for making reasonablesuspicion determinations that attempted to reduce what theCircuit described as "troubling . . . uncertainty" in reason-ableness analysis, by "describ[ing] and clearly delimit[ing]"an officer's consideration of certain factors. Id., at 272, 275(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as inArvizu, theCourt of Appeals's overlay of a categorical scheme on thegeneral reasonableness analysis threatens to distort the "to-tality of the circumstances" principle, by replacing a stresson revealing facts with resort to pigeonholes. Id., at 274(internal quotation marks omitted). Attention to cocainerocks and pianos tells a lot about the chances of their respec-tive disposal and its bearing on reasonable time. Instructions couched in terms like "significant amount of time," and"an even more substantial amount of time," 282 F. 3d, at 704,tell very little. VLast, there is Banks's claim that the entry violated 18U. S. C. $ 3109.Ramirez held that the result should be thesame under the Fourth Amendment and $ 3109, permittingan officer to enter by force "if, after notice of his authorityand purpose, he is refused admittance." We explained thestatute's " `requirement of prior notice . . . before forcingentry . . . [as] codif[ying] a tradition embedded in AngloAmerican law,' " 523 U. S., at 72 (quoting Miller v. UnitedStates, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958)); see also Sabbath v. UnitedStates, 391 U. S. 585, 591, n. 8 (1968), and we held that $ 3109implicates the exceptions to the common law knock-and540US1 Unit: $$U4 [07-23-04 18:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN43Cite as: 540 U. S. 31 (2003)Opinion of the Courtannounce requirement that inform the Fourth Amendmentitself, 523 U. S., at 73. The upshot is that $ 3109 is subjectto an exigent circumstances exception, ibid., which qualifiesthe requirement of refusal after notice, just as it qualifies theobligation to announce in the first place. Absent exigency,the police must knock and receive an actual refusal or waitout the time necessary to infer one. But in a case like this,where the officers knocked and announced their presence,and forcibly entered after a reasonable suspicion of exigencyhad ripened, their entry satisfied $ 3109 as well as the FourthAmendment, even without refusal of admittance.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
