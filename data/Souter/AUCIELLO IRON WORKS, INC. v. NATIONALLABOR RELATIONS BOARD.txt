After a union election in 1977, theNLRB certified Shopmen's Local No. 501, a/w InternationalAssociation of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental IronWorkers, AFL-CIO (Union), as the collective-bargainingrepresentative of Auciello's employees. Over the followingyears, the company and the Union were able to negotiate aseries of collective-bargaining agreements, one of which ex-pired on September 25, 1988. Negotiations for a new onewere unsuccessful throughout September and October 1988,however, and when Auciello and the Union had not made anew contract by October 14, 1988, the employees went onstrike. Negotiations continued, nonetheless, and, on November 17, 1988, Auciello presented the Union with a com-plete contract proposal. On November 18, 1988, the picketing stopped, and nine days later, on a Sunday evening, theUnion telegraphed its acceptance of the outstanding offer.The very next day, however, Auciello told the Union that itdoubted that a majority of the bargaining unit's employeessupported the Union, and for that reason disavowed thecollective-bargaining agreement and denied it had any dutyto continue negotiating. Auciello traced its doubt to knowl-edge acquired before the Union accepted the contract offer,including the facts that 9 employees had crossed the picket517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT784 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Courtline, that 13 employees had given it signed forms indicatingtheir resignation from the Union, and that 16 had expresseddissatisfaction with the Union.In January 1989, the Board's General Counsel issued anadministrative complaint charging Auciello with violation of$$ 8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA.1 An Administrative LawJudge found that a contract existed between the parties andthat Auciello's withdrawal from it violated the Act. 303N. L. R. B. 562 (1991). The Board affirmed the Adminis-trative Law Judge's decision2; it treated Auciello's claim of1 Section 8(a) of the NLRA provides:"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise ofthe rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;. . . . ."(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of hisemployees, subject to the provisions of section 159(a) of this title." 29U. S. C. $ 158(a).Section 7 of the Act provides:"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, orassist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representativesof their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for thepurpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, andshall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities exceptto the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiringmembership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158(a)(3) of this title." 29 U. S. C. $ 157.2 The Board has developed a number of criteria to assess whether acollective-bargaining contract has been formed, see, e. g., AppalachianShale Products Co., 121 N. L. R. B. 1160 (1958), which may not alwayscoincide with those that would govern in the general area of contract law,see Ben Franklin Nat. Bank, 278 N. L. R. B. 986, 993-994 (1986). Weaccept for purposes of deciding this case the Board's conclusion that acontract was formed here within the meaning of the Act. Our review ofthis case is thus limited to the narrow question whether an employer maywithdraw from a collective-bargaining contract once formed when it possessed enough evidence to assert a good-faith doubt about the union's majority status at the time of formation.Auciello has suggested that the contract itself was invalid ab initiobecause the Union in fact lacked majority support at the time of accept517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT785Cite as: 517 U.

But when the Board applied to the Courtof Appeals for the First Circuit for enforcement of its order,the Court of Appeals declined on the ground that the Boardhad not adequately explained its refusal to consider Auciello's defense of good-faith doubt about the Union's majoritystatus. 980 F. 2d 804 (1992). On remand, the Board issueda supplemental opinion to justify its position, 317 N. L. R. B.364 (1995), and the Court of Appeals thereafter enforced theorder as resting on a "policy choice [both] . . . reasonable and. . . quite persuasive." 60 F. 3d 24, 27 (1995). We grantedcertiorari, 516 U. S. 1086 (1996), and now affirm.IIAThe object of the National Labor Relations Act is indus-trial peace and stability, fostered by collective-bargainingagreements providing for the orderly resolution of labordisputes between workers and employees. See 29 U. S. C.$ 141(b); Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482U. S. 27, 38 (1987) (Fall River Dyeing). To such ends, theBoard has adopted various presumptions about the existenceof majority support for a union within a bargaining unit, theance. Because the substantiation required to make this showing isgreater than that required to assert a good-faith doubt, see NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 788, n. 8 (1990), the Board hasnot taken a position on whether such a claim could excuse an employer'sdecision to repudiate an otherwise valid contract and disavow its duty tobargain with the union. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 7. Auciello concedesthat it failed to advance this claim in its answer to the General Counsel'scomplaint, Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 28, the Board never considered this question,and Auciello sought certiorari review only of the question whether an employer is bound by a union's acceptance in this context when "the Employer had a reasonable basis for a good faith doubt." Pet. for Cert. i.Accordingly, we conclude that this question is not properly before us anddecline to address it.517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT786 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v.

Aunion "usually is entitled to a conclusive presumption of ma-jority status for one year following" Board certification assuch a representative. Id., at 37. A union is likewise enti-tled under Board precedent to a conclusive3 presumption ofmajority status during the term of any collective-bargainingagreement, up to three years. SeeNLRB v.

"These presumptions are based not so much on an absolute certaintythat the union's majority status will not erode," Fall RiverDyeing, 482 U. S., at 38, as on the need to achieve "stabilityin collective-bargaining relationships."Ibid. (internal quo-tation marks omitted). They address our fickle nature by"enabl[ing] a union to concentrate on obtaining and fairlyadministering a collective-bargaining agreement" withoutworrying about the immediate risk of decertification and by"remov[ing] any temptation on the part of the employer toavoid good-faith bargaining" in an effort to undermine unionsupport.Ibid.There is a third presumption, though not a conclusive one.At the end of the certification year or upon expiration of thecollective-bargaining agreement, the presumption of majority status becomes a rebuttable one. See NLRB v. CurtinMatheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 778 (1990); see n. 6,infra. Then, an employer may overcome the presumption(when, for example, defending against an unfair labor practice charge) "by showing that, at the time of [its] refusal tobargain, either (1) the union did notin fact enjoy majority3 This presumption may be overcome only in unusual circumstances, see,e. g., Brooks v. NLRB, 348 U. S. 96, 98-99 (1954) (union dissolution, interalia); 3 T. Kheel, Labor Law $ 13A.04[5], p. 13A-26 (1995); R.

Curtin Matheson, supra, at 778 (emphasis in origi-nal).4 Auciello asks this Court to hold that it may raise thelatter defense even after a collective-bargaining contract pe-riod has apparently begun to run upon a union's acceptanceof an employer's outstanding offer.BThe same need for repose that first prompted the Boardto adopt the rule presuming the union's majority status during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement also ledthe Board to rule out an exception for the benefit of an employer with doubts arising from facts antedating the con-tract. The Board said that such an exception would allowan employer to control the timing of its assertion of good-faith doubt and thus to " `sit' on that doubt and . . . raise itafter the offer is accepted." 317 N. L. R. B., at 370. TheBoard thought that the risks associated with giving employers such "unilatera[l] control [over] a vital part of thecollective-bargaining process,"ibid., would undermine thestability of the collective-bargaining relationship,id., at 374,and thus outweigh any benefit that might in theory followfrom vindicating a doubt that ultimately proved to be sound.The Board's judgment in the matter is entitled to prevail.To affirm its rule of decision in this case, indeed, there is noneed to invoke the full measure of the "considerable defer4 Auciello maintains that Curtin Matheson requires reversal here sinceit appears that the employer in that case asserted its good-faith doubtafter the union's acceptance of the contract offer. Brief for Petitioner19-21. But the case is not authority on the issue of timing. The questionpresented was whether the Board "in evaluating an employer's claim thatit had a reasonable basis for doubting a union's majority support, mustpresume that striker replacements oppose the union." Curtin Matheson,494 U. S., at 777 (emphasis in original). We did not discuss or considerwhether the timing of the employer's assertion should affect the outcomeof that case, and the decision does not answer that question.517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT788 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v.

NLRB, 437 U. S.483, 500-501 (1978), through interstitial rulemaking that is"rational and consistent with the Act," Curtin Matheson,supra, at 787.It might be tempting to think that Auciello's doubt wasexpressed so soon after the apparent contract formation thatlittle would be lost by vindicating that doubt and wiping thecontractual slate clean, if in fact the company can make aconvincing case for the doubt it claims. On this view, theloss of repose would be slight. But if doubts about theunion's majority status would justify repudiating a contractone day after its ostensible formation, why should the samedoubt not serve as well a year into the contract's term? Auciello implicitly agrees on the need to provide some cutoff,but argues that the limit should be expressed as a "reasonable time" to repudiate the contract. Brief for Petitioner26-32. That is, it seeks case-by-case determinations of theappropriate time for asserting a good-faith doubt in place ofthe Board's bright-line rule cutting off the opportunity at themoment of apparent contract formation. Auciello's desire isnatural, but its argument fails to point up anything unreasonable in the Board's position.The Board's approach generally allows companies an adequate chance to act on their preacceptance doubts beforecontract formation, just as Auciello could have acted effectively under the Board's rule in this case. Auciello knewthat the picket line had been crossed and that a number ofits employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the Unionat least nine days before the contract's acceptance, and all ofthe resignation forms Auciello received were dated at leastfive days before the acceptance date. During the week preceding the apparent formation of the contract, Auciello hadat least three alternatives to doing nothing. It could havewithdrawn the outstanding offer and then, like its employ517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT789Cite as: 517 U.

S. 192, 198 (1986).5 "[I]f the Board determines, after investigation and hearing, that a question of representationexists, it directs an election by secret ballot and certifies theresult." Ibid. Following withdrawal, it could also have re-fused to bargain further on the basis of its good-faith doubt,leaving it to the Union to charge an unfair labor practice,against which it could defend on the basis of the doubt. Cf.Curtin Matheson, 494 U. S., at 778. And, of course, it couldhave withdrawn its offer to allow it time to investigate whileit continued to fulfill its duty to bargain in good faith withthe Union. The company thus had generous opportunitiesto avoid the presumption before the moment of acceptance.There may, to be sure, be cases where the opportunity requires prompt action,6 but labor negotiators are not the leastnimble, and the Board could reasonably have thought theprice of making more time for the sluggish was too high,since it would encourage bad-faith bargaining. As Auciellowould have it, any employer with genuine doubt about aunion's hold on its employees would be invited to go right onbargaining, with the prospect of locking in a favorable con-tract that it could, if it wished, then challenge. Here, forexample, if Auciello had acted before the Union's telegramby withdrawing its offer and declining further negotiationbased on its doubt (or petitioning for decertification), flameswould have been fanned, and if it ultimately had been obliged5 We assume, without deciding, that the withdrawal of an offer underthese circumstances could not serve as a basis for the filing of an unfairlabor practice complaint, which might trigger the "blocking charge" rulethat the NLRB concedes would be implicated by an employer's unlawfulwithdrawal of recognition. See Brief for Respondent 31, n. 10.6 We note that in the unusual circumstance in which evidence leadingthe employer to harbor such a doubt arises at the same time the unionaccepts the offer, the Board has agreed to examine such occurrences on acase-by-case basis. 317 N. L. R. B. 364, 374-375 (1995).517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT790 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Courtto bargain further, a favorable agreement would have beenmore difficult to obtain. But by saving its challenge untilafter a contract had apparently been formed, it could not endup with a worse agreement than the one it had. The Boardcould reasonably say that giving employers some flexibilityin raising their scruples would not be worth skewing bargaining relationships by such one-sided leverage, and the factthat any collective-bargaining agreement might be vulnerable to such a postformation challenge would hardly serve theAct's goal of achieving industrial peace by promoting stablecollective-bargaining relationships. Cf. Fall River Dyeing,482 U. S., at 38-39; Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB, 321 U. S. 702,705 (1944).Nor do we find anything compelling in Auciello's contention that its employees' statutory right "to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing" and torefrain from doing so, 29 U. S. C. $ 157, compels us to rejectthe Board's position. Although we take seriously the Act'scommand to respect "the free choice of employees" as wellas to "promot[e] stability in collective-bargaining relationships," Fall River Dyeing, supra, at 38 (internal quotationmarks omitted), we have rejected the position that employers may refuse to bargain whenever presented with evidencethat their employees no longer support their certified union."To allow employers to rely on employees' rights in refusingto bargain with the formally designated union is not conducive to [industrial peace], it is inimical to it." Brooks v.NLRB, 348 U. S. 96, 103 (1954). The Board is accordinglyentitled to suspicion when faced with an employer's benevolence as its workers' champion against their certified union,which is subject to a decertification petition from the workers if they want to file one. There is nothing unreasonablein giving a short leash to the employer as vindicator of itsemployees' organizational freedom.517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT791Cite as: 517 U. S. 781 (1996)Opinion of the CourtCMerits aside, Auciello also claims that the precedent ofGarment Workers v. NLRB, 366 U. S. 731 (1961), compelsreversal, but it does not. In Garment Workers, we held thata bona fide but mistaken belief in a union's majority statuscannot support an employer's agreement purporting to recognize a union newly organized but as yet uncertified. Weupheld the Board's rule out of concern that an employer anda union could make a deal giving the union " `a marked advantage over any other [union] in securing the adherence ofemployees,' " id., at 738 (quoting NLRB v. PennsylvaniaGreyhound Lines, Inc., 303 U. S. 261, 267 (1938)), therebydistorting the process by which employees elect the bargaining agent of their choice. 366 U. S., at 738-739. Here, incontrast, the Union continued to enjoy a rebuttable presumption of majority support, and the bargaining unit employeeshad ample opportunity to initiate decertification of the Unionbut apparently chose not to do so. With entire consistency,the Board may deny employers the power gained from recognizing a union, even when it flows from a good-faith but mistaken belief in a newly organized union's majority status, andat the same time deny them the power to disturb collectivebargaining agreements based on a doubt (without more) thatits employees' bargaining agent has retained majority status.Good-faith belief can neither force a union's precipitate recognition nor destroy a recognized union's contracting authority after the fact by intentional delay. There is, indeed, asymmetry in the two positions.* * *We hold that the Board reasonably found an employer'sprecontractual, good-faith doubt inadequate to support anexception to the conclusive presumption arising at the moment a collective-bargaining contract offer has been ac517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT792 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v.
