Pp. 779-780.Justice Souter, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded in Part Ithat Martinez's claim that his questioning alone was a violation of theFifth and Fourteenth Amendments subject to redress by a 42 U.

MARTINEZSyllabusprotection, could be recognized if a core guarantee, or the judicial capacity to protect it, would be placed at risk absent complementary protection, see, e. g., McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40. However, Martinez cannot make the "powerful showing" necessary to expandprotection of the privilege against self-incrimination to the point of thecivil liability he requests. Inherent in his purely Fifth Amendmentclaim is the risk of global application in every instance of interrogationproducing a statement inadmissible under the Fifth and FourteenthAmendments, or violating one of the complementary rules this Courthas accepted in aid of the core privilege. And Martinez has offered noreason to believe that this new rule is necessary in aid of the basicguarantee.

C. $ 1983, maintaining that Chavez's actions violated hisFifth Amendment right not to be "compelled in any criminalcase to be a witness against himself," as well as his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to be freefrom coercive questioning. The District Court grantedsummary judgment to Martinez as to Chavez's qualified immunity defense on both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. Chavez took an interlocutory appeal to theNinth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's denial ofqualified immunity. Martinez v. Oxnard, 270 F. 3d 852(2001). Applying Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001), theNinth Circuit first concluded that Chavez's actions, as alleged by Martinez, deprived Martinez of his rights under theFifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Ninth Circuit didnot attempt to explain how Martinez had been "compelled inany criminal case to be a witness against himself." Instead,the Ninth Circuit reiterated the holding of an earlier NinthCircuit case, Cooper v. Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1229 (1992)(en banc), that "the Fifth Amendment's purpose is to preventcoercive interrogation practices that are destructive ofhuman dignity," 270 F. 3d, at 857 (internal quotation marksomitted), and found that Chavez's "coercive questioning" ofMartinez violated his Fifth Amendment rights, "[e]venthough Martinez's statements were not used against him ina criminal proceeding," ibid. As to Martinez's due processclaim, the Ninth Circuit held that "a police officer violatesthe Fourteenth Amendment when he obtains a confessionby coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession issubsequently used at trial." Ibid.The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights asserted by Martinez were clearlyestablished by federal law, explaining that a reasonable officer "would have known that persistent interrogation of thesuspect despite repeated requests to stop violated the sus538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN766 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZOpinion of Thomas, J.pect's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be freefrom coercive interrogation." Id., at 858.We granted certiorari. 535 U. S. 1111 (2002).IIIn deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified im-munity, we must first determine whether the officer's allegedconduct violated a constitutional right. See Katz, 533 U. S.,at 201. If not, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity,and we need not consider whether the asserted right was"clearly established." Ibid. We conclude that Martinez'sallegations fail to state a violation of his constitutionalrights.A1The Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States bythe Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1(1964), requires that "[n]o person . . . shall be compelled inany criminal case to be a witness against himself." U. S.Const., Amdt. 5 (emphases added). We fail to see how,based on the text of the Fifth Amendment, Martinez canallege a violation of this right, since Martinez was neverprosecuted for a crime, let alone compelled to be a witnessagainst himself in a criminal case.Although Martinez contends that the meaning of "criminalcase" should encompass the entire criminal investigatoryprocess, including police interrogations, Brief for Respondent 23, we disagree. In our view, a "criminal case" at thevery least requires the initiation of legal proceedings. SeeBlyew v. United States, 13 Wall. 581, 595 (1872) ("The words`case' and `cause' are constantly used as synonyms in statutesand judicial decisions, each meaning a proceeding in court, asuit, or action" (emphasis added)); Black's Law Dictionary215 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "[c]ase" as "[a] general term foran action, cause, suit, or controversy at law . . . ; a questioncontested before a court of justice" (emphasis added)).

S. 760 (2003)Opinion of Thomas, J.need not decide today the precise moment when a "criminalcase" commences; it is enough to say that police questioningdoes not constitute a "case" any more than a private inves-tigator's precomplaint activities constitute a "civil case."Statements compelled by police interrogations of coursemay not be used against a defendant at trial, see Brown v.Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, 286 (1936), but it is not untiltheir use in a criminal case that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause occurs, see United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990) ("The privilege againstself-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment isa fundamental trial right of criminal defendants. Althoughconduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately impair that right, a constitutional violation occursonly at trial" (emphases added; citations omitted)); Withrowv. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 692 (1993) (describing the FifthAmendment as a " `trial right' "); id., at 705 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in part and dissenting in part) (describing "trueFifth Amendment claims" as "the extraction and use of com-pelled testimony" (emphasis altered)).Here, Martinez was never made to be a "witness" againsthimself in vi olation of the Fif th Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause because his statements were never ad-mitted as testimony against him in a criminal case. Nor washe ever placed under oath and exposed to " `the cruel tri-lemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt.' " Michiganv. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 445 (1974) (quoting Murphy v. Wa-terfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52, 55 (1964)).The text of the Self-Incrimination Clause simply cannot sup-port the Ninth Circuit's view that the mere use of compulsivequestioning, without more, violates the Constitution.2Nor can the Ninth Circuit's approach be reconciled withour case law. It is well established that the governmentmay compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN768 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZOpinion of Thomas, J.jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not thetarget of the criminal case in which he testifies. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 427 (1984); Kastigar v. UnitedStates, 406 U. S. 441, 443 (1972). Even for persons who havea legitimate fear that their statements may subject them tocriminal prosecution, we have long permitted the compulsionof incriminating testimony so long as those statements (orevidence derived from those statements) cannot be usedagainst the speaker in any criminal case. See Brown v.Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 602-604 (1896); Kastigar, supra, at458; United States v. Balsys, 524 U. S. 666, 671-672 (1998).We have also recognized that governments may penalizepublic employees and government contractors (with the lossof their jobs or government contracts) to induce them to re-spond to inquiries, so long as the answers elicited (and theirfruits) are immunized from use in any criminal case againstthe speaker. See Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 84-85(1973) ("[T]he State may insist that [contractors] . . . eitherrespond to relevant inquiries about the performance of theircontracts or suffer cancellation"); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,431 U. S. 801, 806 (1977) ("Public employees may constitutionally be discharged for refusing to answer potentially in-criminating questions concerning their official duties if theyhave not been required to surrender their constitutional im-munity" against later use of statements in criminal proceedings).2 By contrast, no "penalty" may ever be imposed on2 The government may not, however, penalize public employees and government contractors to induce them to waive their immunity from the useof their compelled statements in subsequent criminal proceedings. SeeUniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation ofCity of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70(1973), and this is true even though immunity is not itself a right securedby the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause, but rather a prophylactic rulewe have constructed to protect the Fifth Amendment's right from invasion. See Part II-A-3, infra. Once an immunity waiver is signed, thesignatory is unable to assert a Fifth Amendment objection to the subsequent use of his statements in a criminal case, even if his statements were538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN769Cite as: 538 U. S. 760 (2003)Opinion of Thomas, J.someone who exercises his core Fifth Amendment right notto be a "witness" against himself in a "criminal case." SeeGriffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965) (the trialcourt's and the prosecutor's comments on the defendant'sfailure to testify violates the Self-Incrimination Clause of theFifth Amendment). Our holdings in these cases demonstrate that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, mere co-ercion does not violate the text of the Self-IncriminationClause absent use of the compelled statements in a criminalcase against the witness.We fail to see how Martinez was any more "compelled inany criminal case to be a witness against himself " than animmunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt.One difference, perhaps, is that the immunized witnessknows that his statements will not, and may not, be usedagainst him, whereas Martinez likely did not. But this doesnot make the statements of the immunized witness any less"compelled" and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that coercive police interrogations, absent the use ofthe involuntary statements in a criminal case, violate theFifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause. Moreover,our cases provide that those subjected to coercive police interrogations have an automatic protection from the use oftheir involuntary statements (or evidence derived from theirstatements) in any subsequent criminal trial. Oregon v. El-stad, 470 U. S. 298, 307-308 (1985); United States v. Blue, 384U. S. 251, 255 (1966); Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556, 558(1954); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 155 (1944). Seealso Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U. S. 248, 278 (1983) (Black-mun, J., concurring in judgment); Williams v. United States,401 U. S. 646, 662 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in result).This protection is, in fact, coextensive with the use and dein fact compelled. A waiver of immunity is therefore a prospectivewaiver of the core self-incrimination right in any subsequent criminal proceeding, and States cannot condition public employment on the waiver ofconstitutional rights, Lefkowitz, supra, at 85.538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN770 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZOpinion of Thomas, J.rivative use immunity mandated by Kastigar when the gov-ernment compels testimony from a reluctant witness. See406 U. S., at 453. Accordingly, the fact that Martinez didnot know his statements could not be used against him doesnot change our view that no violation of the Fifth Amend-ment's Self-Incrimination Clause occurred here.3Although our cases have permitted the Fifth Amendment'sself-incrimination privilege to be asserted in noncriminalcases, see id., at 444-445 (recognizing that the "FifthAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. . . can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, ad-ministrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory . . .");Lefkowitz v. Turley, supra, at 77 (stating that the FifthAmendment privilege allows one "not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal,formal or informal, where the answers might incriminatehim in future criminal proceedings"), that does not alter ourconclusion that a violation of the constitutionalright againstself-incrimination occurs only if one has been compelled tobe a witness against himself in a criminal case.In the Fifth Amendment context, we have created prophylactic rules designed to safeguard the core constitutionalright protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. See,e. g.,Tucker, 417 U. S., at 444 (describing the "procedural safeguards" required by Miranda as "not themselves rights pro-tected by the Constitution but . . . measures to insure thatthe right against compulsory self-incrimination was pro-tected" to "provide practical reinforcement for the right");Elstad, supra, at 306 (stating that "[t]he Miranda exclusion-ary rule . . . serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps morebroadly than the Fifth Amendment itself "). Among theserules is an evidentiary privilege that protects witnesses frombeing forced to give incriminating testimony, even in non-criminal cases, unless that testimony has been immunized538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN771Cite as: 538 U. S. 760 (2003)Opinion of Thomas, J.from use and derivative use in a future criminal proceedingbefore it is compelled. See Kastigar, supra, at 453; Manessv. Meyers, 419 U. S. 449, 461-462 (1975) (noting that the FifthAmendment privilege may be asserted if one is "compelledto produce evidence which later may be used against him asan accused in a criminal action" (emphasis added)).By allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreementbefore being compelled to give incriminating testimony ina noncriminal case, the privilege preserves the core FifthAmendment right from invasion by the use of that compelledtestimony in a subsequent criminal case. See Tucker,supra, at 440-441 ("Testimony obtained in civil suits, or before administrative or legislative committees, could [absenta grant of immunity] prove so incriminating that a personcompelled to give such testimony might readily be convictedon the basis of those disclosures in a subsequent criminalproceeding"). Because the failure to assert the privilegewill often forfeit the right to exclude the evidence in a subsequent "criminal case," see Murphy, 465 U. S., at 440; Garnerv. United States, 424 U. S. 648, 650 (1976) (failure to claimprivilege against self-incrimination before disclosing incriminating information on tax returns forfeited the right to exclude that information in a criminal prosecution); UnitedStates v. Kordel, 397 U. S. 1, 7 (1970) (criminal defendant forfeited his right to assert Fifth Amendment privilege withregard to answers he gave to interrogatories in a prior civilproceeding), it is necessary to allow assertion of the privilegeprior to the commencement of a "criminal case" to safeguardthe core Fifth Amendment trial right. If the privilege couldnot be asserted in such situations, testimony given in thosejudicial proceedings would be deemed "voluntary," see Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 371 (1951); United Statesv. Monia, 317 U. S. 424, 427 (1943); hence, insistence on aprior grant of immunity is essential to memorialize the factthat the testimony had indeed been compelled and therefore538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN772 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZOpinion of Thomas, J.protected from use against the speaker in any "criminalcase."Rules designed to safeguard a constitutional right, how-ever, do not extend the scope of the constitutional right itself, just as violations of judicially crafted prophylactic rulesdo not violate the constitutional rights of any person. Aswe explained, we have allowed the Fifth Amendment privi-lege to be asserted by witnesses in noncriminal cases inorder to safeguard the core constitutional right defined bythe Self-Incrimination Clause--the right not to be compelledin any criminal case to be a witness against oneself. 3 Wehave likewise established theMiranda exclusionary rule asa prophylactic measure to prevent violations of the right protected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause--the ad-mission into evidence in a criminal case of confessions obtained through coercive custodial questioning. See Warrenv. Lincoln, 864 F. 2d 1436, 1442 (CA8 1989) (alleged Mirandaviolation not actionable under $ 1983); Giuffre v. Bissell, 31F. 3d 1241, 1256 (CA3 1994) (same);Bennett v. Passic, 545F. 2d 1260, 1263 (CA10 1976) (same); see also New York v.Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 686 (1984) (Marshall, J., dissenting)("All the Fifth Amendment forbids is the introduction of coerced statements at trial"). Accordingly, Chavez's failure toread Miranda warnings to Martinez did not violate Martinez's constitutional rights and cannot be grounds for a $ 1983action. See Connecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987)(Miranda's warning requirement is "not itself required bythe Fifth Amendmen[t] . . . but is instead justified only byreference to its prophylactic purpose"); Tucker, supra, at 444(Miranda's safeguards "were not themselves rights pro-tected by the Constitution but were instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination wasprotected"). And the absence of a "criminal case" in which3 That the privilege is a prophylactic one does not alter our penalty casesjurisprudence, which allows such privilege to be asserted prior to, andoutside of, criminal proceedings.538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN773Cite as: 538 U. S. 760 (2003)Opinion of Thomas, J.Martinez was compelled to be a "witness" against himselfdefeats his core Fifth Amendment claim. The Ninth Circuit's view that mere compulsi on violates the Self-Incrimination Clause, see 270 F. 3d, at 857;California Attorneys for Criminal Justice v. Butts, 195 F. 3d 1039, 1045-1046(1999);Cooper, 963 F. 2d, at 1243-1244, finds no support inthe text of the Fifth Amendment and is irreconcilable withour case law.4 Because we find that Chavez's alleged con-duct did not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's denial of qualified immunity as toMartinez's Fifth Amendment claim.Our views on the proper scope of the Fifth Amendment'sSelf-Incrimination Clause do not mean that police torture orother abuse that results in a confession is constitutionallypermissible so long as the statements are not used at trial;it simply means that the Fourteenth Amendment's DueProcess Clause, rather than the Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause, would govern the inquiry in thosecases and provide relief in appropriate circumstances.54 It is Justice Kennedy's indifference to the text of the SelfIncrimination Clause, as well as a conspicuous absence of a single citationto the actual text of the Fifth Amendment, that permits him to adopt theNinth Circuit's interpretation.Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978), on which Justice Kennedyand Justice Ginsburg rely in support of their reading of the FifthAmendment, was a case addressing the admissibility of a coerced confession under the Due Process Clause. Mincey did not even mention theFifth Amendment or the Self-Incrimination Clause, and refutes JusticeKennedy's and Justice Ginsburg's assertions that their interpretationof that Clause would have been known to any reasonable officer at thetime Chavez conducted his interrogation.5 We also do not see how, in light of Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386(1989), Justice Kennedy can insist that "the Self-Incrimination Clauseis applicable at the time and place police use compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect" while at the same time maintaining that the use of"torture or its equivalent in an attempt to induce a statement" violatesthe Due Process Clause. Post, at 795, 796 (opinion concurring in part anddissenting in part). Graham foreclosed the use of substantive due proc538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN774 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZOpinion of Thomas, J.BThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no person shallbe deprived "of life, liberty, or property, without due processof law." Convictions based on evidence obtained by meth-ods that are "so brutal and so offensive to human dignity"that they "shoc[k] the conscience" violate the Due ProcessClause.Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172, 174 (1952)(overturning conviction based on evidence obtained by involuntary stomach pumping). See also Breithaupt v. Abram,352 U. S. 432, 435 (1957) (reiterating that evidence obtainedthrough conduct that " `shock[s] the conscience' " may not beused to support a criminal conviction). AlthoughRochindid not establish a civil remedy for abusive police behavior,we recognized in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.833, 846 (1998), that deprivations of liberty caused by "themost egregious official conduct," id., at 846, 847-848, n. 8,may violate the Due Process Clause. While we rejected, inLewis, a $ 1983 plaintiff 's contention that a police officer'sdeliberate indifference during a high-speed chase that causedthe death of a motorcyclist violated due process, id., at 854,we left open the possibility that unauthorized police behaviorin other contexts might "shock the conscience" and give riseto $ 1983 liability.Id., at 850.We are satisfied that Chavez's questioning did not violateMartinez's due process rights. Even assuming, arguendo,that the persistent questioning of Martinez somehow deprived him of a liberty interest, we cannot agree with Martiess analysis in claims involving the use of excessive force in effecting anarrest and held that such claims are governed solely by the FourthAmendment's prohibitions against "unreasonable" seizures, because theFourth Amendment provided the explicit source of constitutional protection against such conduct. 490 U. S., at 394-395. If, as Justice Kennedy believes, the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause governscoercive police interrogation even absent use of compelled statements ina criminal case, then Graham suggests that the Due Process Clausewould not.538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN775Cite as: 538 U. S. 760 (2003)Opinion of Thomas, J.nez's characterization of Chavez's behavior as "egregious" or"conscience shocking." As we noted inLewis, the officialconduct "most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level"is the "conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiableby any government interest." Id., at 849. Here, there isno evidence that Chavez acted with a purpose to harm Martinez by intentionally interfering with his medical treatment.Medical personnel were able to treat Martinez throughoutthe interview, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, 18a, and Chavezceased his questioning to allow tests and other proceduresto be performed.Id., at 4a. Nor is there evidence thatChavez's conduct exacerbated Martinez's injuries or prolonged his stay in the hospital. Moreover, the need to investigate whether there had been police misconduct constituteda justifiable government interest given the risk that key evidence would have been lost if Martinez had died without theauthorities ever hearing his side of the story.The Court has held that the Due Process Clause also protects certain "fundamental liberty interest[s]" from deprivation by the government, regardless of the procedures provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to servea compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521U. S. 702, 721 (1997). Only fundamental rights and libertieswhich are " `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' " and " `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' " qualify for such protection. Ibid. Many times, however, wehave expressed our reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process, see Lewis, supra, at 842; Glucksberg,supra, at 720; Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 271 (1994);Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993); in large part"because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in thisunchartered area are scarce and open-ended," Collins v.Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). See also Regentsof Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.

We therefore must take into account the fact thatMartinez was hospitalized and in severe pain during the interview, but also that Martinez was a critical nonpolice witness to an altercation resulting in a shooting by a police officer, and that the situation was urgent given the perceivedrisk that Martinez might die and crucial evidence might belost. In these circumstances, we can find no basis in ourprior jurisprudence, see, e. g., Miranda, 384 U. S., at 477-478("It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to givewhatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement"), or in our Nation's history and traditions to supposethat freedom from unwanted police questioning is a right sofundamental that it cannot be abridged absent a "compellingstate interest." Flores, supra, at 302. We have never required such a justification for a police interrogation, and wedecline to do so here. The lack of any "guideposts for responsible decisionmaking" in this area, and our oft-statedreluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process,further counsel against recognizing a new "fundamental liberty interest" in this case.We conclude that Martinez has failed to allege a violationof the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is therefore unnecessary to inquire whether the right asserted by Martinez wasclearly established.IIIBecause Chavez did not violate Martinez's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, he was entitled to qualified immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings.
