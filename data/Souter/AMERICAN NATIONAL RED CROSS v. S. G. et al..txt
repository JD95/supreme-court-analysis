The Charter of the American National Red Cross author-izes the organization "to sue and be sued in courts of lawand equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of theUnited States." 33 Stat. 600, as amended, 36 U. S. C. $ 2.In this case we consider whether that "sue and be sued" pro-vision confers original jurisdiction on federal courts over allcases to which the Red Cross is a party, with the conse-quence that the organization is thereby authorized to removefrom state to federal court any state-law action it is defend-ing. We hold that the clause does confer such jurisdiction.IIn 1988 respondents filed a state-law tort action in a courtof the State of New Hampshire, alleging that one of respond*Christopher V.

After discovering that theRed Cross had supplied the tainted blood, respondents suedit, too, again in state court, and moved to consolidate the twoactions. Before the state court decided that motion, theRed Cross invoked the federal removal statute, 28 U. S. C.$ 1441, to remove the latter suit to the United States DistrictCourt for the District of New Hampshire. The Red Crossclaimed federal jurisdiction based both on the diversity ofthe parties and on the "sue and be sued" provision of itscharter, which it argued conferred original federal jurisdiction over suits involving the organization. The DistrictCourt rejected respondents' motion to remand the case tostate court, holding that the charter provision conferredoriginal federal jurisdiction. See District Court order ofMay 24, 1990, reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a-25a.On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed. 938 F. 2d 1494 (1991).The Court of Appeals compared the Red Cross Charter's"sue and be sued" provision with analogous provisions in federal corporate charters previously examined by this Court,and concluded that the relevant language in the Red CrossCharter was similar to its cognates in the charter of the firstBank of the United States, construed in Bank of the UnitedStates v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61 (1809), and in that of thefederally chartered railroad construed in Bankers Trust Co.v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916), in neither ofwhich cases did we find a grant of federal jurisdiction. TheCourt of Appeals distinguished Osborn v. Bank of UnitedStates, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), where we reached the oppositeresult under the charter of the second Bank of the UnitedStates, the Court of Appeals finding it significant that thesecond Bank's authorization to sue and be sued spoke of aparticular federal court and of state courts already possessed505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT250 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the Courtof jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals also discounted theRed Cross's reliance on our opinion in D'Oench, Duhme &Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 315 U. S. 447 (1942),concluding that in that case we had "not[ed] only incidentally" that federal jurisdiction was based on the "sue and besued" clause in the FDIC's charter. See 938 F. 2d, at 1497-1499. The Court of Appeals found support for its conclu-sion in the location of the Red Cross Charter's "sue and besued" provision in the section "denominat[ing] standard cor-porate powers,"id., at 1499, as well as in legislative historyof the amendment to the Red Cross Charter adding the current "sue and be sued" language, and in the different formof analogous language in other federal corporate chartersenacted contemporaneously with that amendment, see id.,at 1499-1500.We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 976 (1991), to answer thisdifficult and recurring question.1IISince its founding in 1881 as part of an international effortto ameliorate soldiers' wartime suffering, the American RedCross has expanded its activities to include, among others,the civilian blood-supply services here at issue. The organization was reincorporated in 1893, and in 1900 received itsfirst federal charter, which was revised in 1905. See American National Red Cross, Report of the Advisory Committeeon Organization 4 (1946) (hereinafter Advisory Report), reprinted at App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 90-1873 (CA1),pp. 94, 101.1 Although more than 40 District Court cases have considered this issue,no result clearly predominates. Compare Pet. for Cert. 10, n. 4 (listingcases finding jurisdictional grant in Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued"provision), with id., at 11, n. 5 (listing cases reaching opposite conclusion).Reflecting this confusion, the only other Court of Appeals to consider thisissue decided differently from the First Circuit. See Kaiser v. MemorialBlood Center of Minneapolis, Inc., 938 F. 2d 90 (CA8 1991).505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT251Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe 1905 charter empowered the Red Cross "to sue andbe sued in courts of law and equity within the jurisdiction ofthe United States." Act of Jan. 5, 1905, ch. 23, $ 2, 33 Stat.600. At that time the provision would not have had thejurisdictional significance of its modern counterpart, sincethe law of the day held the involvement of a federally chartered corporation sufficient to render any case one "arisingunder" federal law for purposes of general statutory federalquestion jurisdiction. See Pacific Railroad Removal Cases,115 U. S. 1, 14 (1885). In 1925, however, Congress restrictedthe reach of this jurisdictional theory to federally charteredcorporations in which the United States owned more thanone-half of the capital stock. Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229,$ 12, 43 Stat. 941; codified as amended at 28 U. S. C. $ 1349.2Since the effect of the 1925 law on nonstock corporations likethe Red Cross is unclear, see, e. g., C. H. v. American RedCross, 684 F. Supp. 1018, 1020-1022 (ED Mo. 1987) (notingsplit in authority over whether $ 1349 applies to nonstockcorporations),3 its enactment invested the charter's "sue andbe sued" clause with a potential jurisdiction significance previously unknown to it.Its text, nevertheless, was left undisturbed for more than20 years further, until its current form, authorizing the RedCross "to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, Stateor Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,"took shape with the addition of the term "State or Federal"to the 1905 language, as part of an overall revision of theorganization's charter and bylaws. See Act of May 8, 1947,2 Congress had previously overruled much of Pacific Railroad RemovalCases, 115 U. S. 1 (1885), by withdrawing federal jurisdiction over casesinvolving federally chartered railroads based solely on the railroad's federal incorporation, see Act of Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 22, $ 5, 38 Stat. 803, 804, alimitation irrelevant for our purposes.3 We do not address this question, as we hold that the "sue and be sued"provision of the Red Cross's Charter suffices to confer federal jurisdictionindependently of the organization's federal incorporation.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT252 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the CourtPub. L. 80-47, $ 3, 61 Stat. 80, 81. It is this language uponwhich the Red Cross relies, and which the Court of Appealsheld to have conferred no federal jurisdiction.IIIAAs indicated earlier, we do not face a clean slate. Begin-ning with Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in 1809, we havehad several occasions to consider whether the "sue and besued" provision of a particular federal corporate charter conferred original federal jurisdiction over cases to which thatcorporation was a party, and our readings of those provisionsnot only represented our best efforts at divining congres-sional intent retrospectively, but have also placed Congresson prospective notice of the language necessary and suffi-cient to confer jurisdiction. See,e. g., United States v. Merriam, 263 U. S. 179, 186 (1923) (Congress presumed to intendjudicially settled meaning of terms); Cannon v. Universityof Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979) (presuming congres-sional knowledge of interpretation of similarly worded earlier statute). Those cases therefore require visitation withcare.In Deveaux, we considered whether original federal juris-diction over suits by or against the first Bank of the UnitedStates was conferred by its charter. The language in pointauthorized the Bank " `to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended,in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever,' " 5Cranch, at 85. In the opinion written by Chief Justice Mar-shall, the Court held this language to confer no federal jurisdiction, reading it as a mere grant to the bank of the normalcorporate capacity to sue, id., at 85-86. The Court contrasted the charter's "sue and be sued" provision with oneauthorizing the institution of certain suits against the bank'sofficers "in any court of record of the United States, or of505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT253Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the Court[sic] either of them," a provision the Court described as "expressly authoriz[ing] the bringing of that action in the federal or state courts," id., at 86. The Chief Justice concludedthat this latter provision "evince[d] the opinion of congress,that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in thecourts of the union, unless it be expressed," ibid.The same issue came to us again 15 years later in Osborn.By this time Congress had established the second Bank ofthe United States, by a charter that authorized it "to sueand be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all state courts havingcompetent jurisdiction, and in any circuit court of the UnitedStates." Act of Apr. 10, 1816, ch. 44, $ 7, 3 Stat. 266, 269.In its interpretation of this language, the Court, again speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, relied heavily on itsDeveaux analysis, and especially on the contrast developedthere between the first bank charter's "sue and be sued"provision and its provision authorizing suits against bank officers. See Osborn, 9 Wheat., at 818. Holding that the language of the second bank's charter "could not be plainer byexplanation," ibid., in conferring federal jurisdiction, the Osborn Court distinguished Deveaux as holding that "a generalcapacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the courtsof the Union, may not give a right to sue in those courts," 9Wheat., at 818.With the basic rule thus established, our next occasion toconsider the issue did not arise until Bankers Trust, nearlya century later. The federal charter considered in that caseauthorized a railroad corporation "to sue and be sued, pleadand be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts oflaw and equity within the United States." Act of Mar. 3,1871, ch. 122, $ 1, 16 Stat. 573, 574. Testing this languageagainst that construed in Deveaux and Osborn, we concludedthat it "d[id] not literally follow" its analogues considered ineither of the earlier cases, 241 U. S., at 304, but held, never505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT254 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the Courttheless, that it had "the same generality and natural import"as the clause contained in the first Bank charter. Thus, wefollowed Deveaux and found in the failure to authorize fed-eral court litigation expressly no grant of federal jurisdiction. 241 U. S., at 304-305.Last came D'Oench, Duhme, where we held that theFDIC's charter granted original federal jurisdiction. Thatjurisdiction was not, we explained, "based on diversity ofcitizenship. Respondent, a federal corporation, brings thissuit under an Act of Congress authorizing it to sue or besued `in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.' " 315U. S., at 455-456 (citation and footnote omitted). It is per-fectly true, as respondents stressed in argument, that in anaccompanying footnote we quoted without comment anotherpart of the same statute, providing that " `[a]ll suits of a civilnature at common law or in equity to which the Corporationshall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws ofthe United States: Provided, That any such suit to which theCorporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a Statebank and which involves only the rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders and such State bank underState law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of theUnited States.' " Id., at 455-456, n. 2.4 The footnote didnot, however, raise any doubt that the Court held federaljurisdiction to rest on the terms of the "sue and be sued"clause. Quite the contrary, the footnote's treatment naturally expressed the subordinate importance of the provisionit quoted. While as a state bank's receiver the FDIC mightlose the benefit of the deemer clause as a grant of federal4 The "sue and be sued" language was originally enacted in the statutecreating the FDIC, see Banking Act of 1933, ch. 89, $ 8, 48 Stat. 162, 172,and was reenacted in the 1935 amendments to that statute, see BankingAct of 1935, ch. 614, $ 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692. The 1935 amendments alsoenacted for the first time the deemer provision we quoted in footnote 2 ofour opinion in D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U. S. 447, 455 (1942).See 49 Stat. 684, 692.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT255Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the Courtjurisdiction, the "sue and be sued" clause would settle thejurisdictional question conclusively, in any case.5BThese cases support the rule that a congressional charter's"sue and be sued" provision may be read to confer federalcourt jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the fed-eral courts. In Deveaux, the Court found a "conclusive argument" against finding a jurisdictional grant in the "sue and besued" clause in the fact that another provision of the same document authorized suits by and against bank officers "in anycourt of record of the United States, or of[sic] either ofthem . . . ." See 5 Cranch, at 86. In contrasting these twoprovisions the Deveaux Court plainly intended to indicatethe degree of specificity required for a jurisdictional grant.6That is certainly how the Osborn Court understood Deveaux,as it described the latter provision as an "express grant ofjurisdiction," 9 Wheat., at 818, in contrast to the first Bankcharter's "sue and be sued" provision, which, "without men5 Respondents argue that the parties in D'Oench, Duhme did not litigatethe jurisdictional issue. See Brief for Respondents 18-22. But the parties' failure to challenge jurisdiction is irrelevant to the force of our holding on that issue. See, e. g., FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231(1990) (federal courts have independent obligation to examine their ownjurisdiction); see also Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 100 (1807) (Marshall,C. J.) (giving controlling weight to previous jurisdictional holding by Courteven though parties to previous case had not raised jurisdictional issue).6 The dissent reads Deveaux as distinguishing between these two provisions not on this basis, but rather on the ground that the provision authorizing suits against bank officers allowed the bringing of a particular causeof action. See post, at 270. That reading might be possible if Chief Justice Marshall had not nipped it in the bud. He did not explain the difference between the jurisdictional significance of the two clauses in questionby saying that jurisdiction may be granted only in provisions referring tocourts in which causes of action could be brought. He explained it simplyby inferring, from the drafting contrasts, "the opinion of congress that theright to sue does not imply the right to sue in the courts of the unionunless it be expressed." Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 86 (emphasis added).505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT256 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the Courttioning the courts of the Union," ibid., was held merely togive the Bank "a general capacity . . . to sue [but not] a rightto sue in those courts," ibid.7 The Osborn Court thus founda jurisdictional grant sufficiently stated in the second Bankcharter's "sue and be sued" provision, with its express federal reference, remarking that "[t]o infer from [Deveaux]that words expressly conferring a right to sue in those courtsdo not give the right, is surely a conclusion which the premises do not warrant." Ibid.8Applying the rule thus established, in Bankers Trust wedescribed the railroad charter's "sue and be sued" provision,with its want of any reference to federal courts, and, holdingit up against its analogues in Deveaux and Osborn, we found7 The dissent accuses us of repeating what it announces as Chief JusticeMarshall's misunderstanding, in Osborn, of his own previous opinion inDeveaux. See post, at 271. We are honored.8 Contrary to respondents' argument, our cases do not support a requirement that federal jurisdiction under a "sue and be sued" clause requiresmention of the specific federal court on which it is conferred. D'Oench,Duhme, of course, bars any such reading. Nor would Osborn v. Bank ofUnited States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), require such a specification even ifD'Oench, Duhme were not on the books. When the second Bank waschartered, two sets of federal courts, the Circuit Courts and the DistrictCourts, shared overlapping original federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., E.Surrency, History of the Federal Courts 61 (1987). If (as apparently wasthe case) the framers of the second Bank's charter wished to provide thatall suits in federal court involving the Bank be brought in one set of courts,it would have been necessary for any jurisdictional grant to specify whichset of federal trial courts was being invested with jurisdiction. This needno longer exists, and the means chosen by the drafters of the early charters to resolve that problem should not be thought significant in resolvingthe very different issue before us today. Moreover, the larger part of theCourt's analysis in Osborn speaks only of the charter's mention of federalcourts, not its specification of the Circuit Courts in particular. See 9Wheat., at 817-818. The charter's specification of those courts wouldhave made it natural for the Osborn Court to indicate its reliance on thatnarrower ground, had it believed such specificity to be required. The factthat it did not so indicate is strong evidence that the Court thought itunnecessary.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the Courtit closer to the former.9 Finally, in D'Oench, Duhme webased our finding of jurisdiction on the "sue and be sued"provision of the FDIC charter, which mentioned the federalcourts in general, but not a particular federal court.The rule established in these cases makes it clear that theRed Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision should beread to confer jurisdiction. In expressly authorizing the or-ganization to sue and be sued in federal courts, using language resulting in a "sue and be sued" provision in all rele-vant respects identical to one on which we based a holdingof federal jurisdiction just five years before, the provisionextends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacityto sue, and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.IVRespondents offer several arguments against this conclu-sion, none of which we find availing.9 The dissent is playful in manufacturing a conflict between our synthesisof the cases and the opinion in Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas and Pacific R.Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916). See post, at 272. The dissent first quotes theCourt's construction in the Bankers Trust opinion, that the clause at issuethere implied no jurisdictional grant, but simply rendered the corporation" `capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court of lawor equity--Federal, state or territorial--whose jurisdiction as otherwisecompetently defined was adequate to the occasion.' " Post, at 272 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 241 U. S., at 303). The dissent then concludes that"[t]hat paraphrasing of the railroad charter, in terms that would spell jurisdiction under the key the Court adopts today, belies any notion thatBankers Trust was using the same code book." Post, at 273. The dissent thus attempts to set up a conflict between our analysis and the resultin Bankers Trust, by suggesting that that Court's interpretation of theprovision (i. e., to confer capacity to sue in courts including federal ones)should itself be subject to a second-order interpretation, which under ouranalysis might require a holding of jurisdiction, the conclusion rejectedby the Bankers Trust Court. This "interpretation of an interpretation"methodology is simply illegitimate, originating not in our opinion but inthe dissent's whimsy. Like our predecessors, we are construing a charter,not a paraphrase.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT258 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the CourtAFirst, we can make short work of respondents' argumentthat the charter's conferral of federal jurisdiction is nevertheless subject to the requirements of the "well-pleaded com-plaint" rule (that the federal question must appear on theface of a well-pleaded complaint) limiting the removal ofcases from state to federal court. See Brief for Respondents 38-46. Respondents erroneously invoke that rule out-side the realm of statutory "arising under" jurisdiction, i. e.,jurisdiction based on 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, to jurisdiction basedon a separate and independent jurisdictional grant, in thiscase, the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision.The "well-pleaded complaint" rule applies only to statutory"arising under" cases, see Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bankof Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 494 (1983); see also 13B C. Wright,A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure$ 3566, pp. 82-83 (2d ed. 1984); Chemerinsky & Kramer, De-fining the Role of the Federal Courts, 1990 B. Y. U. L. Rev.67, 75, n. 17; it has no applicability here.BRespondents also claim that language used in congres-sional charters enacted closely in time to the 1947 amendment casts doubt on congressional intent thereby to conferfederal jurisdiction over cases involving the Red Cross. Respondents argue that the 1948 amendment to the charter ofthe Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the 1947 amendment to the charter of the Federal Crop Insurance Corpora-tion (FCIC), and the 1935 amendment to the FDIC's charter,each of which includes explicit grants of federal jurisdiction,together demonstrate "a practice of using clear and explicitlanguage to confer federal jurisdiction over corporations[Congress] had created." Brief for Respondents 27.The argument does not hold up. The CCC amendment isirrelevant to this enquiry, as it conferred exclusive, ratherthan concurrent, federal jurisdiction. See Act of June 29,505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT259Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the Court1948, ch. 704, $ 4, 62 Stat. 1070. There is every reason toexpect Congress to take great care in its use of explicit language when it wishes to confer exclusive jurisdiction, givenour longstanding requirement to that effect.10 Its employment of explicitly jurisdictional language in the CCC's casethus raises no suggestion that its more laconic Red Crossamendment was not meant to confer concurrent federaljurisdiction.Nor do the other two enactments support respondents' argument. The statutes were passed 12 years apart and employed verbally and doctrinally distinct formulations. Compare Banking Act of 1935, ch. 614, $ 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692(providing that suits involving FDIC "shall be deemed toarise under the laws of the United States"), with Act of Aug.1, 1947, ch. 440, $ 7, 61 Stat. 719 (providing that FCIC "maysue and be sued in its corporate name in any court of recordof a State having general jurisdiction, or in any UnitedStates district court, and [that] jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such district court to determine such controversies without regard to the amount in controversy").11 Thesedifferences are not merely semantic: the jurisdictional effectof the FDIC's provision depends on the 28 U. S. C. $ 1331grant of general federal-question jurisdiction, while the10 See Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136 (1876) ("[O]ur judgment[has] been . . . to affirm [concurrent state-court] jurisdiction, where it isnot excluded by express provision, or by incompatibility in its exercisearising from the nature of the particular case"); see also Charles DowdBox Co. v. Courtney, 368 U. S. 502, 508 (1962) (Claflin's analysis of thisquestion "has remained unmodified through the years").11 Respondents do not repeat the Court of Appeals's argument that theoriginal language of the FCIC charter tracked in all relevant respects thatin the Red Cross's post-1947 charter, and that Congress's later amendmentof the FCIC charter to make jurisdiction more explicit thus implicitly suggests that Congress considered that language insufficient to confer jurisdiction. See 938 F. 2d 1494, 1500 (CA1 1991). We note here only thatthe Red Cross adequately rebuts that argument. See Brief for Petitioner 42-43.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT260 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the CourtFCIC's provision functions independently of $ 1331. Thesedifferences of both form and substance belie respondents'claim of a coherent drafting pattern against which to judgethe ostensible intent behind the Red Cross amendment.If, indeed, respondents' argument could claim any plausi-bility, it would have to be at the cost of ignoring the 1942D'Oench, Duhme opinion citing the FDIC charter's "sue andbe sued" provision as the source of federal jurisdiction inthat case. See 315 U. S., at 455. If the "sue and be sued"clause is sufficient for federal jurisdiction when it occurs inthe same charter with the language respondents claim to beat odds with its jurisdictional significance, it is certainly sufficient standing alone. In any event, the fact that our opin-ion in D'Oench, Duhme was handed down before the 1947amendment to the Red Cross Charter indicates that Con-gress may well have relied on that holding to infer thatamendment of the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued"provision to make it identical to the FDIC's would suffice toconfer federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., Cannon, 441 U. S., at696-697. Congress was, in any event, entitled to draw theinference. CRespondents would have us look behind the statute to findquite a different purpose when they argue that the 1947amendment may have been meant not to confer jurisdiction,but to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to sue in federalcourts where an independent jurisdictional basis exists.See Brief for Respondents 23-27. The suggestion is thatCongress may have thought such a clarification necessaryafter passage of the 1925 statute generally bringing an endto federal incorporation as a jurisdictional basis. See 28U. S. C. $ 1349.12 But this suggestion misconstrues $ 1349 as12 See Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, $ 12, 43 Stat. 941 (currently codifiedat 28 U. S. C. $ 1349). The exception, for federally chartered corporationsover one-half owned by the United States, is irrelevant to our enquiry.See n. 3, supra.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT261Cite as: 505 U.

See H. R. Rep. No. 337, 80th Cong., 1stSess., 6 (1947) ("[The 1947 amendment] was drafted as theresult of recommendations made by [the Advisory committee] . . . .

No. 38, 80th Cong., 1stSess., 1 (1947) ("The present legislation incorporates, in themain, the recommendations of the [A]dvisory committee").The Advisory Report had recommended that "[t]he chartershould make it clear that the Red Cross can sue and be suedin the Federal Courts," reasoning that "[t]he Red Cross hasin several instances sued in the Federal Courts, and its powers in this respect have not been questioned. However, inview of the limited nature of the jurisdiction of the FederalCourts, it seems desirable that this right be clearly stated inthe Charter." Advisory Report 35-36, reprinted at App. toBrief for Appellants in No. 90-1873, at 132-133.13 The only debate on the 1947 amendment to the charter's "sue and besued" provision occurred at a Senate Committee hearing. See Hearingson S. 591 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 80th Cong.,1st Sess., 10 (1947). The only two relevant comments, both made by Senator George, appear to be mutually contradictory on the matter at issuehere. At one point Senator George said: "I think the purpose of the billis very clear, and that is to give the jurisdiction in State courts and Federal courts, and I think we had better leave it there," ibid. Later, however, he stated: "I think there might be some question about the right ofa Federal corporation to be sued in a State court.

G.Opinion of the CourtThe Advisory Report's explicit concern with the limitedjurisdiction of the federal courts indicates that the recommended change, which prompted the amendment to the "sueand be sued" provision, spoke to jurisdiction rather thancapacity to sue. Against this, respondents argue only thatthe Advisory Report's use of the words "can" and "power"indicate concern with the latter, not the former. See Brieffor Respondents 25. This is fine parsing, too fine to overcome the overall jurisdictional thrust of the Report'srecommendation.In a final look toward the text, respondents speculate thatthe 1947 amendment can be explained as an attempt to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to enter the federal courts undertheir diversity jurisdiction. See Brief for Respondents 25-26, 29. The argument turns on the theory that federallychartered corporations are not citizens of any particularState, and thus may not avail themselves of diversity jurisdiction. See id., at 26 (quoting Walton v. Howard University, 683 F. Supp. 826, 829 (DC 1987)). Respondents completely fail, however, to explain how the addition of thewords "State or Federal" to the "sue and be sued" provisionmight address this claimed jurisdictional problem. Indeed,the 1947 amendment, by specifying the particular courtsopen to the Red Cross, as opposed to the Red Cross's statusas a party, seems particularly ill-suited to rectifying an asserted party-based jurisdictional deficiency.1414 At oral argument respondents carried the suggestion a further stepby speculating that the 1947 amendment could be explained as an attemptto ensure the Red Cross's access to federal courts when diversity jurisdiction existed, due to concern, presumably present until our 1949 decision inNational Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U. S. 582, aboutthe constitutionality of the 1940 statute giving District of Columbiachartered corporations the same rights to sue in diversity as statechartered corporations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31. But the speculation,if sound, would prove too much. For on this theory Congress would havebeen hedging against a constitutional problem of diversity jurisdiction byresorting to a special grant of jurisdiction to cover the Red Cross, which is505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)Opinion of the CourtPerhaps most obviously, respondents' argument violatesthe ordinary sense of the language used, as well as somebasic canons of statutory construction. The 1905 charter,authorizing the Red Cross "to sue and be sued in courts oflaw and equity within the jurisdiction of the United States,"simply cannot be read as failing to empower the Red Crossto sue in federal courts having jurisdiction. That fact, whencombined with the Advisory Report's justification of the 1947amendment by reference to federal courts' limited jurisdic-tion, seesupra, leaves it extremely doubtful that capacity tosue simpliciter motivated that amendment. Indeed, theRed Cross's clear preamendment capacity to sue in federalcourts calls into play the canon of statutory construction requiring a change in language to be read, if possible, to havesome effect, see,e. g., Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337(1930); 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction$ 46.06 (5th rev. ed. 1992), a rule which here tugs hard towarda jurisdictional reading of the 1947 amendment.15exactly what the Red Cross maintains was intended by following D'Oench,Duhme and Osborn.Respondents complain that the Red Cross's theory is of recent vintage,citing a 1951 case in which the Red Cross removed a suit against it fromstate to federal court based not on any independent jurisdictional grantimplicit in the "sue and be sued" provision, but rather on party diversity.See Brief for Respondents 29 (citing Patterson v. American National RedCross, 101 F. Supp. 655 (SD Fla. 1951)). However, the Red Cross's failurein one 40-year-old case to base its removal petition on the theory it advances today adds nothing to respondents' attack on the Red Cross's current interpretation.15 The dissent adopts and refines respondents' argument, see Brief forRespondents 16, that the 1947 amendment's parallel treatment of federaland state courts counsels against reading that amendment as conferringjurisdiction, see post, at 267-268. The short answer is that D'Oench,Duhme forecloses the argument, since the charter language we held toconfer federal jurisdiction in that case made exactly the same parallelmention of federal and state courts. But going beyond that, the referenceto state as well as federal courts presumably was included lest a mentionof federal courts alone (in order to grant jurisdiction to them) be taken asmotivated by an intent to confer exclusive federal jurisdiction. Moreover,the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision, like its counterparts505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT264 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.Opinion of the CourtVOur holding leaves the jurisdiction of the federal courtswell within Article III's limits. As long ago asOsborn, thisCourt held that Article III's "arising under" jurisdiction isbroad enough to authorize Congress to confer federal-courtjurisdiction over actions involving federally chartered corporations. See 9 Wheat., at 823-828.16 We have consistentlyreaffirmed the breadth of that holding. See Pacific R. Removal Cases, 115 U. S., at 11-14; In re Dunn, 212 U. S. 374,383-384 (1909);Bankers Trust, 241 U. S., at 305-306; Puertoconstrued in Osborn and D'Oench, Duhme, confers both capacity to sueand jurisdiction. While capacity to sue in both federal and state courtswas already clearly established before the 1947 amendment, it may havebeen feared that the addition of the word "Federal" to confer federal jurisdiction would be misread to limit the Red Cross's capacity to sue in statecourts, if it were not reaffirmed by explicit inclusion of the word "State."It is the dissent's conclusion that the 1947 amendment was meant to"eliminat[e] the possibility that the language `courts of law and equitywithin the jurisdiction of the United States' that was contained in theoriginal charter might be read to limit the grant of capacity to sue infederal court," post, at 275 (emphasis and citation omitted); that is difficultto justify. Such a motivation is nowhere even hinted at in the AdvisoryReport, the document both Houses of Congress acknowledged as thesource for the amendment, see supra, at 261 (quoting congressional reports); indeed, the relevant part of the Advisory Report does not evenmention state courts, see Advisory Report 35-36, reprinted at App. toBrief for Appellants in No. 90-1873, at 132-133. It is hardly a "reasonableconstruction," post, at 275, of the amendment to view it as granting something the Advisory Report never requested. While the dissent notes oneof Senator George's comments supporting its hypothesis, it ignores theother, which explicitly notes a federal jurisdiction-conferring motivationbehind the amendment. See supra, at 261, n. 13.Neither party reads the 1947 amendment to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to sue in state courts, and, as there is no evidence of such an intent,we do not embrace that reading here.16 Again, it should be pointed out that statutory jurisdiction in this caseis not based on the Red Cross's federal incorporation, but rather upona specific statutory grant. In contrast, the constitutional question askswhether Article III's provision for federal jurisdiction over cases "arisingunder federal law" is sufficiently broad to allow that grant.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 505 U.
