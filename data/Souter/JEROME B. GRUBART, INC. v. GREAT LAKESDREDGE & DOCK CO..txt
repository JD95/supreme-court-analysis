On April 13, 1992, water from the Chicago River pouredinto a freight tunnel running under the river and thence intothe basements of buildings in the downtown Chicago Loop.Allegedly, the flooding resulted from events several monthsearlier, when respondent Great Lakes Dredge and DockCompany had used a crane, sitting on a barge in the rivernext to a bridge, to drive piles into the riverbed above thetunnel. The issue before us is whether a court of the UnitedStates has admiralty jurisdiction to determine and limit theextent of Great Lakes's tort liability. We hold this suit tobe within federal admiralty jurisdiction.#Richard Ruda filed a brief for the National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.Warren J.

GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the CourtIThe complaint, together with affidavits subject to no objec-tion, alleges the following facts. In 1990, Great Lakes bidon a contract with petitioner city of Chicago to replacewooden pilings clustered around the piers of several bridgesspanning the Chicago River, a navigable waterway withinthe meaning ofThe Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563 (1871).See Escanaba Co. v. Chicago, 107 U. S. 678, 683 (1883). Thepilings (called dolphins) keep ships from bumping into thepiers and so protect both. After winning the contract,Great Lakes carried out the work with two barges towed bya tug. One barge carried pilings; the other carried a cranethat pulled out old pilings and helped drive in new ones.In August and September 1991, Great Lakes replaced thepilings around the piers projecting into the river and sup-porting the Kinzie Street Bridge. After towing the cranecarrying barge into position near one of the piers, GreatLakes's employees secured the barge to the riverbed withspuds, or long metal legs that project down from the bargeand anchor it. The workers then used the crane on thebarge to pull up old pilings, stow them on the other barge,and drive new pilings into the riverbed around the piers.About seven months later, an eddy formed in the river nearthe bridge as the collapsing walls or ceiling of a freight tunnel running under the river opened the tunnel to river water,which flowed through to flood buildings in the Loop.After the flood, many of the victims brought actions instate court against Great Lakes and the city of Chicago,claiming that in the course of replacing the pilings GreatLakes had negligently weakened the tunnel structure, whichChicago (its owner) had not properly maintained. GreatLakes then brought this lawsuit in the United States DistrictCourt, invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction. Count I ofthe complaint seeks the protection of the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act (Limitation Act), 46 U. S. C. App.$ 181 et seq., a statute that would, in effect, permit the admi513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT531Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtralty court to decide whether Great Lakes committed a tortand, if so, to limit Great Lakes's liability to the value of thevessels (the tug and two barges) involved if the tort wascommitted "without the privity or knowledge" of the vessels'owner, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 183(a). Counts II and III of GreatLakes's complaint ask for indemnity and contribution fromthe city for any resulting loss to Great Lakes.The city, joined by petitioner Jerome B. Grubart, Inc., oneof the state-court plaintiffs, filed a motion to dismiss thissuit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.12(b)(1). The District Court granted the motion, the Sev-enth Circuit reversed,Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.Chicago, 3 F. 3d 225 (1993), and we granted certiorari, 510U. S. 1108 (1994). We now affirm.IIThe parties do not dispute the Seventh Circuit's conclusionthat jurisdiction as to Counts II and III (indemnity and contribution) hinges on jurisdiction over the Count I claim.See 3 F. 3d, at 231, n. 9; see also 28 U. S. C. $ 1367 (1988 ed.,Supp. V) (supplemental jurisdiction); Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.14(a) and (c) (impleader of third parties). Thus, the issue issimply whether or not a federal admiralty court has jurisdic-tion over claims that Great Lakes's faulty replacement workcaused the flood damage. AA federal court's authority to hear cases in admiralty flowsinitially from the Constitution, which "extend[s]" federal judicial power "to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Juris-diction." U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2. Congress has embodied that power in a statute giving federal district courts"original jurisdiction . . . of . . . [a]ny civil case of admiraltyor maritime jurisdiction . . . ." 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1).The traditional test for admiralty tort jurisdiction askedonly whether the tort occurred on navigable waters. If itdid, admiralty jurisdiction followed; if it did not, admiralty513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT532 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtjurisdiction did not exist. See, e. g., Thomas v. Lane, 23 F.Cas. 957, 960 (No. 13902) (CC Me. 1813) (Story, J., on Circuit).This ostensibly simple locality test was complicated by therule that the injury had to be "wholly" sustained on navigable waters for the tort to be within admiralty. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, 34 (1866) (no jurisdiction over tort actionbrought by the owner of warehouse destroyed in a fire thatstarted on board a ship docked nearby). Thus, admiraltycourts lacked jurisdiction over, say, a claim following a ship'scollision with a pier insofar as it injured the pier, for admi-ralty law treated the pier as an extension of the land.Martin v. West, 222 U. S. 191, 197 (1911); Cleveland Terminal &Valley R. Co. v. Cleveland S. S. Co., 208 U. S. 316, 319 (1908).This latter rule was changed in 1948, however, when Congress enacted the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act,62 Stat. 496. The Act provided that"[t]he admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of theUnited States shall extend to and include all cases ofdamage or injury, to person or property, caused by avessel on navigable water, notwithstanding that suchdamage or injury be done or consummated on land." 46U. S. C. App. $ 740.The purpose of the Act was to end concern over the sometimes confusing line between land and water, by investingadmiralty with jurisdiction over "all cases" where the injurywas caused by a ship or other vessel on navigable water,even if such injury occurred on land. See, e. g., Gutierrez v.Waterman S. S. Corp., 373 U. S. 206, 209-210 (1963); Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. Cleveland, 409 U. S. 249, 260 (1972).After this congressional modification to gather the oddcase into admiralty, the jurisdictional rule was qualifiedagain in three decisions of this Court aimed at keeping adifferent class of odd cases out. In the first case, ExecutiveJet, supra, tort claims arose out of the wreck of an airplanethat collided with a flock of birds just after takeoff on a do513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT533Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtmestic flight and fell into the navigable waters of Lake Erie.We held that admiralty lacked jurisdiction to consider theclaims. We wrote that "a purely mechanical application ofthe locality test" was not always "sensible" or "consonantwith the purposes of maritime law," id., at 261, as when (forexample) the literal and universal application of the localityrule would require admiralty courts to adjudicate tort disputes between colliding swimmers, id., at 255. We held that"claims arising from airplane accidents are not cognizablein admiralty" despite the location of the harm, unless "thewrong bear[s] a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity." Id., at 268.The second decision,Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, 457U. S. 668 (1982), dealt with tort claims arising out of the collision of two pleasure boats in a navigable river estuary. Weheld that admiralty courts had jurisdiction,id., at 677, eventhough jurisdiction existed only if "the wrong" had "a sig-nificant connection with traditional maritime activity,"id., at674. We conceded that pleasure boats themselves had littleto do with the maritime commerce lying at the heart of theadmiralty court's basic work, id., at 674-675, but we nonethe-less found the necessary relationship in"[t]he potential disruptive impact [upon maritime com-merce] of a collision between boats on navigable waters,when coupled with the traditional concern that admi-ralty law holds for navigation . . . ,"id., at 675.In the most recent of the trilogy, Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S.358 (1990), we held that a federal admiralty court had jurisdiction over tort claims arising when a fire, caused by a defective washer/dryer aboard a pleasure boat docked at a marina, burned the boat, other boats docked nearby, and themarina itself. Id., at 367. We elaborated on the enquiryexemplified in Executive Jet and Foremost by focusing ontwo points to determine the relationship of a claim to theobjectives of admiralty jurisdiction. We noted, first, that513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT534 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtthe incident causing the harm, the burning of docked boatsat a marina on navigable waters, was of a sort "likely todisrupt [maritime] commercial activity." 497 U. S., at 363.Second, we found a "substantial relationship" with "traditional maritime activity" in the kind of activity from whichthe incident arose, "the storage and maintenance of a vessel. . . on navigable waters." Id., at 365-367.After Sisson, then, a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1) over a tortclaim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity. A court applying the locationtest must determine whether the tort occurred on navigablewater or whether injury suffered on land was caused by avessel on navigable water. 46 U. S. C. App. $ 740. The connection test raises two issues. A court, first, must "assessthe general features of the type of incident involved," 497U. S., at 363, to determine whether the incident has "a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce," id., at 364,n. 2. Second, a court must determine whether "the generalcharacter" of the "activity giving rise to the incident" showsa "substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity."Id., at 365, 364, and n. 2. We now apply the tests to thefacts of this suit.BThe location test is, of course, readily satisfied. If GreatLakes caused the flood, it must have done so by weakeningthe structure of the tunnel while it drove in new pilings orremoved old ones around the bridge piers. The weakeningpresumably took place as Great Lakes's workers lifted andreplaced the pilings with a crane that sat on a barge stationed in the Chicago River. The place in the river wherethe barge sat, and from which workers directed the crane, isin the "navigable waters of the United States." EscanabaCo., 107 U. S., at 683. Thus, if Great Lakes committed a tort,it must have done it while on navigable waters.513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT535Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIt must also have done it "by a vessel." Even though thebarge was fastened to the river bottom and was in use as awork platform at the times in question, at other times it wasused for transportation. See 3 F. 3d, at 229. Petitioners donot here seriously dispute the conclusion of each court belowthat the Great Lakes barge is, for admiralty tort purposes,a "vessel." The fact that the pile driving was done with acrane makes no difference under the location test, given themaritime law that ordinarily treats an "appurtenance"attached to a vessel in navigable waters as part of the vesselitself. See, e. g., Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, 404 U. S. 202,210-211 (1971); Gutierrez, 373 U. S., at 209-210.1Because the injuries suffered by Grubart and the otherflood victims were caused by a vessel on navigable water,the location enquiry would seem to be at an end, "notwithstanding that such damage or injury [was] done or consummated on land." 46 U. S. C. App. $ 740. Both Grubart andChicago nonetheless ask us to subject the Extension Act tolimitations not apparent from its text. While they concedethat the Act refers to "all cases of damage or injury," theyargue that "all" must not mean literally every such case, nomatter how great the distance between the vessel's tortiousactivity and the resulting harm. They contend that, to be1 Grubart argues, based on Margin v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 812 F. 2d973, 975 (CA5 1987), that an appurtenance is considered part of the vesselonly when it is defective. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-762, pp. 34-35(Grubart Brief). Margin, however, does not so hold. It dealt with aland-based crane that lowered a ship's hatch cover dangerously close to awelder working on a dock, and its result turned not on the condition ofthe hatch cover, the putative appurtenance, but on the fact that the plaintiff did not allege that "vessel negligence proximately caused his injury."812 F. 2d, at 977. Indeed, the argument that Congress intended admiraltyjurisdiction to extend to injuries caused by defective appurtenances, butnot to appurtenances in good condition when operated negligently, makesno sense. See Gutierrez, 373 U. S., at 210 ("There is no distinction inadmiralty between torts committed by the ship itself and by the ship'spersonnel while operating it . . .").513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT536 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtwithin the Act, the damage must be close in time and spaceto the activity that caused it: that it must occur "reasonablycontemporaneously" with the negligent conduct and no "far-ther from navigable waters than the reach of the vessel, itsappurtenances and cargo." Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-1094, p. 45 (City Brief). For authority, they point to thisCourt's statement in Gutierrez, supra, that jurisdiction ispresent when the "impact" of the tortious activity "is feltashore at a time and place not remote from the wrongfulact."Id., at 210.2The demerits of this argument lie not only in its want oftextual support for its nonremoteness rule, but in its disre-gard of a less stringent but familiar proximity condition tiedto the language of the statute. The Act uses the phrase"caused by," which more than one Court of Appeals has readas requiring what tort law has traditionally called "proxi-mate causation." See,e. g., Pryor v. American PresidentLines, 520 F. 2d 974, 979 (CA4 1975), cert. denied, 423 U. S.1055 (1976); Adams v. Harris County, 452 F. 2d 994, 996-997(CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U. S. 968 (1972). This classictort notion normally eliminates the bizarre, cf. Palsgraf v.Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99 (1928), andits use should obviate not only the complication but eventhe need for further temporal or spatial limitations. Noris reliance on familiar proximate causation inconsistent withGutierrez, which used its nonremote language, not to an-nounce a special test, but simply to distinguish its own facts(the victim having slipped on beans spilling from cargo con-tainers being unloaded from a ship) from what the Courtcalled "[v]arious far-fetched hypotheticals," such as injury tosomeone slipping on beans that continue to leak from the2 At oral argument, counsel for the city undercut this argument by conceding that admiralty jurisdiction would govern claims arising from anincident in which a ship on navigable waters slipped its moorings, driftedinto a dam, and caused a breach in the dam that resulted in flooding ofsurrounding territory.

See also VictoryCarriers, supra, at 210-211.The city responds by saying that, as a practical matter,the use of proximate cause as a limiting jurisdictional princi-ple would undesirably force an admiralty court to investigatethe merits of the dispute at the outset of a case when itdetermined jurisdiction.3 The argument, of course, assumesthat the truth of jurisdictional allegations must always bedetermined with finality at the threshold of litigation, butthat assumption is erroneous. Normal practice permits aparty to establish jurisdiction at the outset of a case bymeans of a nonfrivolous assertion of jurisdictional elements,see,e. g., Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506U. S. 263, 285 (1993);Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682-683(1946), and any litigation of a contested subject-matter jurisdictional fact issue occurs in comparatively summary proce3 The city in part bases its assertion about the practical effects of aproximate cause rule on a reading of Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 54-56(1932), which, according to the city, held that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act could not constitutionally apply to an employee absent a finding that he was actually injured on navigable waters.Thus, the city argues, a construction of the Extension Act that wouldpermit the assertion of federal jurisdiction over land-based injuries absenta finding, on the merits, of actual causation "would raise serious constitutional questions." See City Brief 41-42.Even if the city's interpretation of Crowell is correct, it is not dispositivehere. Constitutional difficulties need not arise when a court defers finaldetermination of facts upon which jurisdiction depends until after the firstjurisdictional skirmish. In the standing context, for example, we haveheld that "the Constitution does not require that the plaintiff offer . . .proof [of the facts showing that the plaintiff sustained actual injury] asa threshold matter in order to invoke the District Court's jurisdiction."Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484U. S. 49, 66 (1987). We see no reason why a different rule should applyhere, and find ourselves in the company of the city's own amici. See Brieffor National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 18-19, n. 9 (suggesting that "a court need not decide the merits of causationissues to resolve a jurisdictional challenge").513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT538 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtdure before a judge alone (as distinct from litigation of thesame fact issue as an element of the cause of action, if theclaim survives the jurisdictional objection). See 2A J.Moore & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice || 12.07[2.-1] (2ded. 1994); 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 1350 (2d ed. 1990). There is no reason why thisshould not be just as true for proximate causation as it is forthe maritime nature of the tortfeasor's activity giving riseto the incident. See Sisson, 497 U. S., at 365. There is noneed or justification, then, for imposing an additional nonremoteness hurdle in the name of jurisdiction.CWe now turn to the maritime connection enquiries, thefirst being whether the incident involved was of a sort withthe potential to disrupt maritime commerce. In Sisson, wedescribed the features of the incident in general terms as "afire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters," id.,at 363, and determined that such an incident "plainly satisf[ied]" the first maritime connection requirement, ibid., be-cause the fire could have "spread to nearby commercial vessels or ma[d]e the marina inaccessible to such vessels" andtherefore "[c]ertainly" had a "potentially disruptive impacton maritime commerce," id., at 362. We noted that this firstprong went to potential effects, not to the "particular factsof the incident," noting that in both Executive Jet and Fore-most we had focused not on the specific facts at hand but onwhether the "general features" of the incident were "likelyto disrupt commercial activity." 497 U. S., at 363.The first Sisson test turns, then, on a description of theincident at an intermediate level of possible generality. Tospeak of the incident as "fire" would have been too generalto differentiate cases; at the other extreme, to have described the fire as damaging nothing but pleasure boats andtheir tie-up facilities would have ignored, among otherthings, the capacity of pleasure boats to endanger commer513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT539Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcial shipping that happened to be nearby. We rejected bothextremes and instead asked whether the incident could beseen within a class of incidents that posed more than a fanci-ful risk to commercial shipping.Following Sisson, the "general features" of the incident atissue here may be described as damage by a vessel in naviga-ble water to an underwater structure. So characterized,there is little question that this is the kind of incident thathas a "potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce."As it actually turned out in this suit, damaging a structurebeneath the riverbed could lead to a disruption in the watercourse itself, App. 33 (eddy formed above the leak); and,again as it actually happened, damaging a structure so situated could lead to restrictions on the navigational use of thewaterway during required repairs. See Pet. for Cert. in No.93-1094, p. 22a (District Court found that after the flood"[t]he river remained closed for over a month," "[r]iver trafficceased, several commuter ferries were stranded, and manybarges could not enter the river system . . . because the riverlevel was lowered to aid repair efforts"). Cf. Pennzoil Producing Co. v. Offshore Express, Inc., 943 F. 2d 1465 (CA51991) (admiralty suit when vessel struck and ruptured gaspipeline and gas exploded); Marathon Pipe Line Co. v. Drilling Rig Rowan/Odessa, 761 F. 2d 229, 233 (CA5 1985) (admiralty jurisdiction when vessel struck pipeline, "a fixed structure on the seabed"); Orange Beach Water, Sewer, and FireProtection Authority v. M/V Alva, 680 F. 2d 1374 (CA111982) (admiralty suit when vessel struck underwaterpipeline).In the second Sisson enquiry, we look to whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incidentshows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity. We ask whether a tortfeasor's activity, commercialor noncommercial, on navigable waters is so closely relatedto activity traditionally subject to admiralty law that thereasons for applying special admiralty rules would apply in513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT540 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtthe suit at hand. Navigation of boats in navigable watersclearly falls within the substantial relationship,Foremost,457 U. S., at 675; storing them at a marina on navigable wa-ters is close enough,Sisson, supra, at 367; whereas in flyingan airplane over the water, Executive Jet, 409 U. S., at 270-271, as in swimming, id., at 255-256, the relationship is tooattenuated.On like reasoning, the "activity giving rise to the incident"in this suit,Sisson, supra, at 364, should be characterized asrepair or maintenance work on a navigable waterway per-formed from a vessel. Described in this way, there is noquestion that the activity is substantially related to traditional maritime activity, for barges and similar vessels havetraditionally been engaged in repair work similar to whatGreat Lakes contracted to perform here. See, e. g., Shea v.Rev-Lyn Contracting Co., 868 F. 2d 515, 518 (CA1 1989)(bridge repair by crane-carrying barge); Nelson v. UnitedStates, 639 F. 2d 469, 472 (CA9 1980) (Kennedy, J.)

In re The V-14813,65 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA5 1933) ("There are many cases holdingthat a dredge, or a barge with a pile driver, employed onnavigable waters, is subject to maritime jurisdiction . . .$ 7.54"); Lawrence v.

Lawrence, 86 F. 907 (CA5 1898).The city argues, to the contrary, that a proper applicationof the activity prong of Sisson would consider the city's ownalleged failure at properly maintaining and operating thetunnel system that runs under the river. City Brief 48-49.If this asserted proximate cause of the flood victims' injuries513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT541Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtwere considered, the city submits, its failure to resemble anytraditional maritime activity would take this suit out ofadmiralty.The city misreadsSisson, however, which did not considerthe activities of the washer/dryer manufacturer, who waspossibly an additional tortfeasor, and whose activities werehardly maritime; the activities of Sisson, the boat owner, supplied the necessary substantial relationship to traditionalmaritime activity. Likewise, inForemost, we said that"[b]ecause the `wrong' here involves the negligent operationof a vessel on navigable waters, we believe that it has a sufficient nexus to traditional maritime activity to sustain admiralty jurisdiction . . . ." 457 U. S., at 674. By using theword "involves," we made it clear that we need to look onlyto whether one of the arguably proximate causes of the incident originated in the maritime activity of a tortfeasor: aslong as one of the putative tortfeasors was engaged in traditional maritime activity the allegedly wrongful activity will"involve" such traditional maritime activity and will meetthe second nexus prong. Thus, even if we were to identifythe "activity giving rise to the incident" as including the actsof the city as well as Great Lakes, admiralty jurisdictionwould nevertheless attach. That result would be true toSisson's requirement of a "substantial relationship" betweenthe "activity giving rise to the incident" and traditional maritime activity. Sisson did not require, as the city in effectasserts, that there be a complete identity between the two.The substantial relationship test is satisfied when at leastone alleged tortfeasor was engaging in activity substantiallyrelated to traditional maritime activity and such activity isclaimed to have been a proximate cause of the incident.Petitioners also argue that we might get a different resultsimply by characterizing the "activity" in question at a different level of generality, perhaps as "repair and maintenance," or as "pile driving near a bridge." The city is, ofcourse, correct that a tortfeasor's activity can be described513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT542 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courtat a sufficiently high level of generality to eliminate any hintof maritime connection, and if that were properly done Sisson would bar assertion of admiralty jurisdiction. But tosuggest that such hypergeneralization ought to be the rulewould convert Sisson into a vehicle for eliminating admiraltyjurisdiction. Although there is inevitably some play in thejoints in selecting the right level of generality when applyingthe Sisson test, the inevitable imprecision is not an excusefor whimsy. The test turns on the comparison of traditionalmaritime activity to the arguably maritime character of thetortfeasor's activity in a given case; the comparison wouldmerely be frustrated by eliminating the maritime aspect ofthe tortfeasor's activity from consideration.4Grubart makes an additional claim that Sisson is beinggiven too expansive a reading. If the activity at issue hereis considered maritime related, it argues, then virtually"every activity involving a vessel on navigable waters"would be "a traditional maritime activity sufficient to invokemaritime jurisdiction." Grubart Brief 6. But this is notfatal criticism. This Court has not proposed any radicalalteration of the traditional criteria for invoking admiraltyjurisdiction in tort cases, but has simply followed the lead ofthe lower federal courts in rejecting a location rule so rigidas to extend admiralty to a case involving an airplane, not avessel, engaged in an activity far removed from anythingtraditionally maritime. See Executive Jet, 409 U. S., at 268-274; see also Peytavin v. Government Employees Ins. Co.,453 F. 2d 1121, 1127 (CA5 1972) (no jurisdiction over claim4 The city also proposes that we define the activity as "the operation ofan underground tunnel connected to Loop buildings." City Brief 49-50.But doing this would eliminate the maritime tortfeasor's activity fromconsideration entirely. This (like the choice of a supreme level of generality, described in the text) would turn Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U.

In the cases after Executive Jet, theCourt stressed the need for a maritime connection, but foundone in the navigation or berthing of pleasure boats, despitethe facts that the pleasure boat activity took place nearshore, where States have a strong interest in applying theirown tort law, or was not on all fours with the maritime shipping and commerce that has traditionally made up the business of most maritime courts. Sisson, 497 U. S., at 367;Foremost, 457 U. S., at 675. Although we agree with petitioners that these cases do not say that every tort involvinga vessel on navigable waters falls within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction no matter what, they do show that ordinarily that will be so.5IIIPerhaps recognizing the difficulty of escaping the case law,petitioners ask us to change it. In cases "involving landbased parties and injuries," the city would have us adopt acondition of jurisdiction that"the totality of the circumstances reflects a federal interest in protecting maritime commerce sufficientlyweighty to justify shifting what would otherwise bestate-court litigation into federal court under the federallaw of admiralty."

C. $ 1333(1), we need not considerrespondent Great Lakes's alternative argument that the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 46 U. S. C.

Columbus-McKinnon, Inc. v. Gearench,Inc., 493 U. S. 1003 (1989). Although they point out thatSisson disapproved the use of four-factor or seven-factortests "where all the relevant entities are engaged in similartypes of activity," this rule implicitly left the matter openfor cases like this one, where most of the victims, and one ofthe tortfeasors, are based on land. See 497 U. S., at 365, n. 3("Different issues may be raised by a case in which one ofthe instrumentalities is engaged in a traditional maritimeactivity, but the other is not"). The city argues that thereis a good reason why cases like this one should get differenttreatment. Since the basic rationale for federal admiraltyjurisdiction is "protection of maritime commerce throughuniform rules of decision," the proposed jurisdictional testwould improve on Sisson in limiting the scope of admiraltyjurisdiction more exactly to its rationale. A multiple factortest would minimize, if not eliminate, the awkward possibility that federal admiralty rules or procedures will govern acase, to the disadvantage of state law, when admiralty's purpose does not require it. Cf. Foremost, supra, at 677-686(Powell, J., dissenting).Although the arguments are not frivolous, they do not persuade. It is worth recalling that the Sisson tests are aimedat the same objectives invoked to support a new multifactortest, the elimination of admiralty jurisdiction where the ra513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT545Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courttionale for the jurisdiction does not support it. If the tortproduces no potential threat to maritime commerce or occursduring activity lacking a substantial relationship to tradi-tional maritime activity, Sisson assumes that the objectivesof admiralty jurisdiction probably do not require its exercise,even if the location test is satisfied. If, however, theSissontests are also satisfied, it is not apparent why the need foradmiralty jurisdiction in aid of maritime commerce somehowbecomes less acute merely because land-based parties happen to be involved. Certainly Congress did not think aland-based party necessarily diluted the need for admiraltyjurisdiction or it would have kept its hands off the primitivelocation test.Of course, one could claim it to be odd that under Sissona land-based party (or more than one) may be subject to admiralty jurisdiction, but it would appear no less odd underthe city's test that a maritime tortfeasor in the most traditional mould might be subject to state common-law jurisdic-tion. Other things being equal, it is not evident why thefirst supposed anomaly is worse than the second. But otherthings are not even equal. As noted just above, Congresshas already made the judgment, in the Extension Act, thata land-based victim may properly be subject to admiraltyjurisdiction. Surely a land-based joint tortfeasor has noclaim to supposedly more favorable treatment.Nor are these the only objections to the city's position.Contrary to what the city suggests, City Brief 10, 14-15, 25-26, 30, exercise of federal admiralty jurisdiction does not re-sult in automatic displacement of state law. It is true that,"[w]ith admiralty jurisdiction comes the application of sub-stantive admiralty law."East River S. S. Corp. v. Trans-america Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858, 864 (1986). But, tocharacterize that law, as the city apparently does, as "federalrules of decision," City Brief 15, is"a destructive oversimplification of the highly intricateinterplay of the States and the National Government in513US2 Unit: $U27 [01-06-00 06:44:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN546 JEROME B. GRUBART, INC. v. GREAT LAKES DREDGE& DOCK CO.Opinion of the Courttheir regulation of maritime commerce. It is true thatstate law must yield to the needs of a uniform federalmaritime law when this Court finds inroads on a harmo-nious system. But this limitation still leaves the Statesa wide scope." Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 373 (1959) (footnote omitted).See East River, supra, at 864-865 ("Drawn from state andfederal sources, the general maritime law is an amalgam oftraditional common-law rules, modifications of those rules,and newly created rules" (footnote omitted)). Thus, thecity's proposal to synchronize the jurisdictional enquiry withthe test for determining the applicable substantive lawwould discard a fundamental feature of admiralty law, thatfederal admiralty courts sometimes do apply state law. See,e. g., American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 451-452(1994); see also 1 S. Friedell, Benedict on Admiralty $ 112,p. 7-49 (7th ed. 1994).66 We will content ourselves simply with raising a question about anotherof the city's assumptions, which does not go to anything dispositive for us.It is true that this Court has said that "the primary focus of admiraltyjurisdiction is unquestionably the protection of maritime commerce," Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, 457 U. S. 668, 674 (1982); see Sisson, 497 U. S.,at 367; see id., at 364, n. 2, a premise that recently has been questioned,see Casto, The Origins of Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction in an Age ofPrivateers, Smugglers, and Pirates, 37 Am. J. Legal Hist. 117 (1993). However that may be, this Court has never limited the interest in question tothe "protection of maritime commerce through uniform rules of decision,"as the city would have it. City Brief 19. Granted, whatever its precisepurpose, it is likely that Congress thought of uniformity of substantive lawas a subsidiary goal conducive to furthering that purpose. See Currie,Federalism and the Admiralty: "The Devil's Own Mess," 1960 S. Ct. Rev.158, 163 ("[A] uniform law was apparently one reason for the establishmentof the admiralty jurisdiction in 1789" (footnote omitted)). But we are unwilling to rule out that the first Congress saw a value in federal admiraltycourts beyond fostering uniformity of substantive law, stemming, say, froma concern with local bias similar to the presupposition for diversity jurisdiction. See The Federalist No. 80, p. 538 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamil513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT547Cite as: 513 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the CourtFinally, on top of these objections going to the city's prem-ises there is added a most powerful one based on the practical consequences of adopting a multifactor test. Althoughthe existing case law tempers the locality test with the addedrequirements looking to potential harm and traditional activ-ity, it reflects customary practice in seeing jurisdiction as thenorm when the tort originates with a vessel in navigablewaters, and in treating departure from the locality principleas the exception. For better or worse, the case law has thuscarved out the approximate shape of admiralty jurisdictionin a way that admiralty lawyers understand reasonably well.As against this approach, so familiar and relatively easy, theproposed four- or seven-factor test would be hard to apply,jettisoning relative predictability for the open-ended roughand-tumble of factors, inviting complex argument in a trialcourt and a virtually inevitable appeal.Consider, for example, just one of the factors under thecity's test, requiring a district court at the beginning ofevery purported admiralty case to determine the source(state or federal) of the applicable substantive law. The difficulty of doing that was an important reason why this CourtinRomero, supra, was unable to hold that maritime claimsfell within the scope of the federal-question-jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. 358 U. S., at 375-376 ("[S]ound judi-cial policy does not encourage a situation which necessitatesconstant adjudication of the boundaries of state and federalcompetence"). That concern applies just as strongly toton) ("maritime causes . . . so commonly affect the rights of foreigners");1 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 124 (1911); 2id., at 46; see generally D. Robertson, Admiralty and Federalism 95-103(1970). After all, if uniformity of substantive law had been Congress'sonly concern, it could have left admiralty jurisdiction in the state courtssubject to an appeal to a national tribunal (as it did with federal-questionjurisdiction until 1875, and as the Articles of Confederation had done withcases of prize and capture).513us2$27M 04-01-98 17:48:46 PAGES OPINPGT548 JEROME B.
