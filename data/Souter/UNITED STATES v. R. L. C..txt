Plain-meaning analysis does not compel adoption of the Government's construction that the word "authorized" in $ 5037(c)(1)(B) mustrefer to the maximum term of imprisonment provided for by the statutedefining the offense. At least equally consistent, and arguably morenatural, is the construction that "authorized" refers to the result ofapplying all statutes with a required bearing on the sentencing decision,including not only those that empower the court to sentence but thosethat limit the legitimacy of its exercise of that power, including $ 3553(b),which requires application of the Guidelines and caps an adult sentenceat the top of the relevant Guideline range, absent circumstances warranting departure. Thus, the most that can be said from examining thetext in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferredconstruction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.Pp. 297-298.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT292 UNITED STATES v.

Although determining the maximum permissiblesentence under $ 5037(c)(1)(B) will require sentencing and reviewingcourts to determine an appropriate Guideline range in juveniledelinquency proceedings, it does not require plenary application of theGuidelines to juvenile delinquents. Where the statutory provisionapplies, a sentencing court's concern with the Guidelines goes solely tothe upper limit of the proper Guideline range as setting the maximumterm for which a juvenile may be committed to official detention,absent circumstances that would warrant departure under $ 3553(b).Pp. 306-307.Justice Souter, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White, andJustice Stevens, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II-B andII-C, concluding that:1. The textual evolution of $ 5037(c)(1)(B) and the relevant legislativehistory reinforce the conclusion that the section is better understood torefer to the maximum sentence permitted under $ 3553(b). Whereasthe predecessor of $ 5037(c) spoke in terms of the "maximum term whichcould have been imposed on an adult" (emphasis added), the currentversion's reference to "the juvenile," on its face suggests a change inreference from abstract considerations to a focused inquiry into the circumstances of the particular juvenile. Although an intervening versionreferred to the maximum sentence "that would be authorized by section3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult" (emphasis added), the emphasized language was quickly deleted, resulting inthe present statutory text. The legislative history demonstrates thatCongress intended the deletion to conform juvenile and adult maximumsentences, in that $ 3581(b), which catalogs such sentences for federaloffenses by reference to their relative seriousness, could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence for a juvenile thanan adult would have received. Absent promulgation of the Guidelines,the deletion might have left the question of the "authorized" maximumto be determined by reference to the penalty provided by the statutecreating the offense. However, Congress' purpose today can beachieved only by reading "authorized" to refer to the maximum sentencethat may be imposed consistently with $ 3553(b), which will generallyprovide a ceiling more favorable to the juvenile than that contained inthe offense-defining statute. It hardly seems likely that Congressadopted the current $ 5037(c) without intending the recently enactedGuidelines scheme to be considered for the purpose of conforming juvenile and adult sentences.

No ambiguity about the statute's intended scope survives the foregoing analysis, but, if any did, the construction yielding the shorter sentence would be chosen under the rule of lenity. That rule's applicationis unnecessary in this case, however, since this Court has "alwaysreserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute's intended scope even after resort to `the languageand structure, legislative history, and motivating policies' of the statute." Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (citation omitted).Pp. 305-306.Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas,concluded that it is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe atextually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on thebasis of legislative history. Once it is determined that the statutorytext is ambiguous, the rule requires that the more lenient interpretationprevail. In approving reliance on a statute's "motivating policies,"Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108, seems contrary to Hugheyv. United States, 495 U. S. 411, 422. And insofar as Moskal requiresconsideration of legislative history at all, it compromises the purposesof the lenity rule: to assure that criminal statutes provide fair warningof what conduct is rendered illegal, see, e. g., McBoyle v. United States,283 U. S. 25, 27, and to assure that society, through its representatives,has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out, see, e. g.,United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348. While the Court has considered legislative history in construing criminal statutes before, it appearsthat only one case, Dixson v. United States, 465 U. S. 482, has relied onlegislative history to "clarify" an ambiguous statute against a criminaldefendant's interest. Dixson does not discuss the implications of itsdecision, and both of the cases it cites in supposed support of its holdingfound the statute at hand not to be facially ambiguous. Pp. 307-311.Justice Thomas agreed with Justice Scalia that the use of legislative history to construe an otherwise ambiguous penal statute againsta criminal defendant is difficult to reconcile with the rule of lenity. Therule operates, however, only if ambiguity remains even after a court hasapplied established principles of construction to the statutory text.See, e. g., Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463. Althoughknowledge of these principles is imputed to the citizenry, there appearsscant justification for also requiring knowledge of extralegal materialssuch as legislative history.

S. 291 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcountry as defined by federal law. These circumstances provide federal jurisdiction in this case. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 1151,1162, 1153. Upon certifying that a proceeding was authorized in federal court under $ 5032 on the ground that no statecourt had jurisdiction over the offense, the Governmentcharged R. L. C. with an act of juvenile delinquency.After a bench trial, the District Court found R. L. C. to bea juvenile who had driven a car recklessly while intoxicatedand without the owner's authorization, causing Mountain'sdeath. R. L. C. was held to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency within the meaning of $ 5031, since his actswould have been the crime of involuntary manslaughter inviolation of $$ 1112(a) and 1153 if committed by an adult.The maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under18 U. S. C. $ 1112(b) is three years. At R. L. C.'s dispositional hearing, the District Court granted the Government'srequest to impose the maximum penalty for respondent's delinquency and accordingly committed him to official detention for three years.Despite the manslaughter statute's provision for an adultsentence of that length, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Eighth Circuit vacated R. L. C.'s sentence and remanded for resentencing, after concluding that 36 monthsexceeded the cap imposed by $ 5037(c)(1)(B) upon the periodof detention to which a juvenile delinquent may be sentenced. 915 F. 2d 320 (1990).

Under the Guidelines, involuntarymanslaughter caused by recklessness has a base offense levelof 14. United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual $ 2A1.4(a)(2) (Nov. 1991). The court found, and theGovernment agrees, see Brief for United States 22, n. 5, thatbecause R. L. C. had the lowest possible criminal historylevel, Category I, the Guidelines would yield a sentencingrange of 15-21 months for a similarly situated adult. TheCourt of Appeals therefore concluded that the maximum period of detention to which R. L. C. could be sentenced was21 months.The Government sought no stay of mandate from theCourt of Appeals, and on remand the District Court imposeddetention for 18 months. Although R. L. C. has now servedthis time, his failure to complete the 3-year detention originally imposed and the possibility that the remainder of itcould be imposed saves the case from mootness. See UnitedStates v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983).We granted the Government's petition for certiorari, 501U.

S. 291 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcert. denied, 493 U. S. 956 (1989), and endorsed by theGovernment.IIAThe Government suggests a straightforward enquiry intoplain meaning to explain what is "authorized." It arguesthat the word "authorized" must mean the maximum termof imprisonment provided for by the statute defining the offense, since only Congress can "authorize" a term of imprisonment in punishment for a crime. As against the positionthat the Sentencing Guidelines now circumscribe a trialcourt's authority, the Government insists that our concernmust be with the affirmative authority for imposing a sentence, which necessarily stems from statutory law. It maintains that in any event the Sentencing Commission's congressional authorization to establish sentencing guidelines doesnot create affirmative authority to set punishments forcrime, and that the Guidelines do not purport to authorizethe punishments to which they relate.But this is too easy. The answer to any suggestion thatthe statutory character of a specific penalty provision givesit primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is thatthe mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory. See18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b). More significantly, the Government'sargument that "authorization" refers only to what is affirmatively provided by penal statutes, without reference to theSentencing Guidelines to be applied under statutory mandate, seems to us to beg the question. Of course it is truethat no penalty would be "authorized" without a statuteproviding specifically for the penal consequences of definedcriminal activity. The question, however, is whether Congress intended the courts to treat the upper limit of such apenalty as "authorized" even when proper application of astatutorily mandated Guideline in an adult case would barimposition up to the limit, and an unwarranted upward de503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT298 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.Opinion of Souter, J.parture from the proper Guideline range would be reversibleerror. $ 3742. Here it suffices to say that the Government'sconstruction is by no means plain. The text is at leastequally consistent with treating "authorized" to refer to theresult of applying all statutes with a required bearing on thesentencing decision, including not only those that empowerthe court to sentence but those that limit the legitimacy of itsexercise of that power. This, indeed, is arguably the morenatural construction.Plain-meaning analysis does not, then, provide the Government with a favorable answer. The most that can be saidfrom examining the text in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferred construction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.BOn the assumption that ambiguity exists, we turn to examine the textual evolution of the limitation in question andthe legislative history that may explain or elucidate it.2 The2 R. L. C. argues that the broader statutory purpose supports his position. He contends that longer juvenile sentences are only justified by arehabilitative purpose. See, e. g., Carter v. United States, 113 U. S. App.D. C. 123, 125, 306 F. 2d 283, 285 (1962) (imposing a longer juvenile sentence under the now-repealed Youth Corrections Act) ("[R]ehabilitationmay be regarded as comprising the quid pro quo for a longer confinementbut under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergoin an ordinary prison"). He then suggests that the Sentencing ReformAct rejected the rehabilitative model not merely for adult imprisonment,see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366-367 (1989), but for juveniles as well. See Brief for Respondent 19. While it is true that somerehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme in1984, see Pub. L. 98-473, $ 214(b), 98 Stat. 2014 (abolishing parole forjuvenile delinquents), the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completelyreject rehabilitative objectives. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 5035, 5039. Wedo not think a broader congressional purpose points clearly in either party's direction.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT299Cite as: 503 U. S. 291 (1992)Opinion of Souter, J.predecessor of $ 5037(c) as included in the Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 provided that a juvenile adjudged delinquent could be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period "not [to] extendbeyond the juvenile's twenty-first birthday or the maximumterm which could have been imposed on an adult convictedof the same offense, whichever is sooner." 18 U. S. C.$ 5037(b) (1982 ed.) (emphasis added). In its current form,the statute refers to the "maximum term of imprisonmentthat would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried andconvicted as an adult." 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c) (emphasisadded). On its face, the current language suggests a changein reference from abstract consideration of the penalty permitted in punishment of the adult offense, to a focused enquiry into the maximum that would be available in the circumstances of the particular juvenile before the court. Theintervening history supports this reading.With the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (chapter II ofthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, $ 214(a), 98 Stat. 2013), $ 5037 was rewritten. As$ 5037(c)(1)(B), its relevant provision became "the maximumterm of imprisonment that would be authorized by section3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as anadult." 18 U. S. C. $$ 5037(c)(1)(B), (c)(2)(B)(ii) (1982 ed.,Supp. II) (emphasis added). The emphasized language wasquickly deleted, however, by the Criminal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-646,$ 21(a)(2), 100 Stat. 3596 (Technical Amendments Act), resulting in the present statutory text, "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had beentried and convicted as an adult." It thus lost the referenceto $ 3581(b), which would have guided the sentencing courtin identifying the "authorized" term of imprisonment.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT300 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.Opinion of Souter, J.R. L. C. argues that this loss is highly significant. Section3581(b)3 was, and still is, part of a classification systemadopted in 1984 for use in setting the incidents of punishmentfor federal offenses by reference to letter grades reflectingtheir relative seriousness. One provision, for example, setsthe maximum period of supervised release for each lettergrade. $ 3583. Section 3581(b) sets out the maximum termof imprisonment for each letter grade, providing, for instance, that the authorized term of imprisonment for a classC felony is not more than 12 years, for a class D not morethan 6, and for a class E not more than 3.The deletion of the reference to $ 3581(b) with its specificcatalog of statutory maximums would seem to go against theGovernment's position. Since, for example, a juvenile whohad committed what would have been an adult class E felonywould apparently have been subject to three years of detention, because $ 3581(b) "authorized" up to three years of im-prisonment for an adult, the deletion of the reference to$ 3581(b) would appear to indicate some congressional intentto broaden the range of enquiry when determining whatwas authorized.4The Government, however, finds a different purpose, disclosed in the section-by-section analysis prepared by the De3 "(b) Authorized terms.--The authorized terms of imprisonmentare--"(1) for a Class A felony, the duration of the defendant's life or anyperiod of time;"(2) for a Class B felony, not more than twenty-five years;"(3) for a Class C felony, not more than twelve years;"(4) for a Class D felony, not more than six years;"(5) for a Class E felony, not more than three years;"(6) for a Class A misdemeanor, not more than one year;"(7) for a Class B misdemeanor, not more than six months;"(8) for a Class C misdemeanor, not more than thirty days; and"(9) for an infraction, not more than five days." 18 U. S. C. $ 3581.4 We speak here of an indication appearing solely from the face of thetext. In fact, so far as we can tell, at the time of the amendment nofederal statute defining an offense referred to it by letter grade.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT301Cite as: 503 U. S. 291 (1992)Opinion of Souter, J.partment of Justice to accompany the bill that became theTechnical Amendments Act. The Department's analysisincluded this explanation for the proposal to delete the reference to $ 3581(b): "Because of the effect of 18 U. S. C.$ 3559(b)(2), deleting the reference to 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b)will tie the maximum sentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, rather than making juvenile sentences moresevere than adult sentences." 131 Cong. Rec. 14177 (1985).Congress had enacted $ 3559 to reconcile the new sentencingschedule, providing for the incidents of conviction accordingto the offense's assigned letter grade, with the pre-existingbody of federal criminal statutes, which of course includedno assignments of letter grades to the particular offensesthey created. Section 3559(a) provides a formula for assigning the missing letter based on the maximum term of imprisonment set by the statute creating the offense. Thus, as itstood at the time of the Technical Amendments Act, it read:"(a) Classification"An offense that is not specifically classified by a lettergrade in the section defining it, is classified--"(1) if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is--"(A) life imprisonment, or if the maximum penalty isdeath, as a Class A felony;"(B) twenty years or more, as a Class B felony;"(C) less than twenty years but ten or more years, asa Class C felony;"(D) less than ten years but five or more years, as aClass D felony;"(E) less than five years but more than one year, as aClass E felony;"(F) one year or less but more than six months, as aClass A misdemeanor;"(G) six months or less but more than thirty days, asa Class B misdemeanor;503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT302 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.Opinion of Souter, J."(H) thirty days or less but more than five days, as aClass C misdemeanor; or"(I) five days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized, as an infraction."(b) Effect of classification"An offense classified under subsection (a) carries allthe incidents assigned to the applicable letter designation except that:"(1) the maximum fine that may be imposed is the fineauthorized by the statute describing the offense, or bythis chapter, whichever is the greater; and"(2) the maximum term of imprisonment is the termauthorized by the statute describing the offense." 18U. S. C. $ 3559 (1982 ed., Supp. II).The Government explains that limiting the length of ajuvenile detention to that authorized for an adult under$ 3581(b) could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence than an adult could have received,when the offense involved was assigned no letter grade inits defining statute. Thus an offense created without lettergrade and carrying a maximum term of two years would betreated under $ 3559(a) as a class E felony. Section 3581(b)provides that a class E felony carried a maximum of threeyears. Regardless of that classification, $ 3559(b)(2) wouldcertainly preclude sentencing any adult offender to morethan two years. Tension would arise, however, where a juvenile had committed the act constituting the offense. Insofar as $ 5037(c) capped the juvenile detention by reference towhat was authorized for an adult, the maximum would havebeen two years; but insofar as it capped it by reference towhat was authorized by $ 3581(b), the limit might have appeared to be three. It was to break this tension, accordingto the Government, that the reference to $ 3581(b) was deleted guaranteeing that no juvenile would be given detentionlonger than the maximum adult sentence authorized by the503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 503 U. S. 291 (1992)Opinion of Souter, J.statute creating the offense. The amendment also, the Gov-ernment says, left the law clear in its reference to the statutecreating the offense as the measure of an "authorized" sen-tence. This conclusion is said to be confirmed by a statement in the House Report that the amendment "delet[es an]incorrect cross-referenc[e]," H. R. Rep. No. 99-797, p. 21(1986), which, the Government argues, "suggests that no substantive change was intended." Brief for United States 20,n. 4.We agree with the Government's argument up to a point.A sentencing court could certainly have been confused bythe reference to $ 3581(b). A sentencing judge considering ajuvenile defendant charged with an offense bearing no letterclassification, and told to look for "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized [according to lettergrade] by section 3581(b)," would have turned first to$ 3559(a) to obtain a letter classification. The court perhapswould have felt obliged to ignore the provision of $ 3559(b)that "the maximum term of imprisonment is the term authorized by the statute describing the offense" in favor of alonger term provided for by the appropriate letter grade in$ 3581(b). Indeed, the sentencing judge would have beenfaced with this puzzle in virtually every case, since the system of classifying by letter grades adopted in 1984 was onlyto be used in future legislation defining federal criminal offenses. See Brief for United States 16. No federal offenseon the books at the time the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984was adopted carried a letter grade in its defining statute,and Congress has used the device only rarely in the ensuing years.Thus, while it included a reference to $ 3581(b), $ 5037(c)was ambiguous. This ambiguity was resolved by an amendment that, absent promulgation of the Guidelines, mighthave left the question of the "authorized" maximum term ofimprisonment to be determined only by reference to the penalty provided by the statute creating the offense, whether503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT304 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.Opinion of Souter, J.expressed as a term of years or simply by reference to lettergrade. The legislative history does not prove, however, thatCongress intended "authorized" to refer solely to the statutedefining the offense despite the enactment of a statute requiring application of the Sentencing Guidelines, a provisionthat will generally provide a ceiling more favorable to thejuvenile than that contained in the offense-defining statute.Indeed, the contrary intent would seem the better infer-ence. The Justice Department analysis of the Criminal Lawand Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, uponwhich the Government relies, went on to say that "deletingthe reference to 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b) will tie the maximumsentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, ratherthan making juvenile sentences more severe than adult sentences." 131 Cong. Rec. 14177 (1985). This is an expression of purpose that today can be achieved only by reading"authorized" to refer to the maximum period of imprisonment that may be imposed consistently with 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(b). That statute provides that "[t]he court shall impose a sentence . . . within the range" established for thecategory of offense as set forth in the Guidelines, "unless thecourt finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigatingcircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately takeninto consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described." $ 3553(b).The point is reinforced by other elements of the legislativehistory. The Senate Report accompanying the 1986 Technical Amendments Act states that the amendment "makesclear that juvenile sentences are to be of equal length asthose for adult offenders committing the same crime."S. Rep. No. 99-278, p. 3 (1986). This, in turn, reflects thestatement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sentencing Reform Act, that the changes in juvenile sentencing lawwere included "in order to conform it to the changes madein adult sentencing laws." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 155 (1983).503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT305Cite as: 503 U. S. 291 (1992)Opinion of Souter, J.The most fundamental of the Sentencing Reform Act'schanges was, of course, the creation of the Sentencing Commission, authorized to promulgate the guidelines requiredfor use by sentencing courts. It hardly seems likely thatCongress adopted the current $ 5037(c) with a purpose toconform juvenile and adult maximum sentences without intending the recently authorized Guidelines scheme to be con-sidered for that purpose. The legislative history thus reinforces our initial conclusion that $ 5037 is better understoodto refer to the maximum sentence permitted under the statute requiring application of the Guidelines.5CWe do not think any ambiguity survives. If any did, how-ever, we would choose the construction yielding the shortersentence by resting on the venerable rule of lenity, see, e. g.,United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-348 (1971), rooted in" `the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prisonunless the lawmaker has clearly said they should,' " id., at348 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)). Whilethe rule has been applied not only to resolve issues about thesubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing, see Bifulco v. UnitedStates, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980), its application is unnecessaryin this case, since "we have always reserved lenity for thosesituations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a stat-ute's intended scope even after resort to `the language andstructure, legislative history, and motivating policies' of the5 The dissent takes us to task for reliance upon a "technical amendment."But a statute is a statute, whatever its label. Although the critical congressional enactment, the deletion of the reference to $ 3581(b), came inthe Technical Amendments Act, we have applied the usual tools of statutory construction: the language left in the statute after its amendment in1986 is most naturally read to refer to the term of imprisonment authorized after application of the statute mandating use of the Guidelines.The legislative history of the Technical Amendments Act reinforces thisconclusion.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT306 UNITED STATES v.

But the Court has not in the past approached the use of lenity inthe way Justice Scalia would have it.It is true that the need for fair warning will make it "rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statutebroader than that clearly warranted by the text," Crandon v. UnitedStates, 494 U. S. 152, 160 (1990), and that "general declarations of policy,"whether in the text or the legislative history, will not support constructionof an ambiguous criminal statute against the defendant, Hughey v. UnitedStates, 495 U. S. 411, 422 (1990). But lenity does not always require the"narrowest" construction, and our cases have recognized that a broaderconstruction may be permissible on the basis of nontextual factors thatmake clear the legislative intent where it is within the fair meaning of thestatutory language. See Dixson v. United States, 465 U. S. 482, 500-501,n. 19 (1984). Cf. McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931) (a criminal statute should be construed in such a way that its language gives "fairwarning" to the "common mind"). Whether lenity should be given themore immediate and dispositive role Justice Scalia espouses is an issuethat is not raised and need not be reached in this case.503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT307Cite as: 503 U.
