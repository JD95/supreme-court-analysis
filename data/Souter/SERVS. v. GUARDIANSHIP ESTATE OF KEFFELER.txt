Although the department providesfoster care without strings attached to any child who needsit, the State's policy is "to attempt to recover the costs offoster care from the parents of [the] children," 145 Wash. 2d1, 6, 32 P. 3d 267, 269 (2001) (citing Wash. Rev. Code$ 74.20A.010 (2001)), and to use "moneys and other funds" ofthe foster child to offset "the amount of public assistanceotherwise payable," $ 74.13.060. The department accordingly adopted a regulation providing that public benefits fora child, including benefits under SSI or OASDI, "shall beused on behalf of the child to help pay for the cost of thefoster care received." Wash. Admin. Code $ 388-70-069(1)(2001), repealed by Wash. St. Reg. 01-08-047 (Mar. 30,2001).2When the department receives Social Security benefits asrepresentative payee for children in its care, it generallycredits them to a special Foster Care Trust Fund Accountkept by the state treasurer, which includes subsidiary accounts for each child beneficiary. When these accounts aredebited, it is only rarely for a direct purchase by the Stateof a foster child's food, clothing, and shelter. The usual pur-chaser is a foster care provider, who is then paid back bythe department according to a fixed compensation schedule.Every month, the department compares its payments to theprovider of a child's care with the child's subsidiary accountbalance, on which the department then draws to reimburseitself. Since the State's outlay customarily exceeds a child'smonthly Social Security benefits, the reimbursement to theState usually leaves the account empty until the next federalbenefit check arrives.The department occasionally departs from this practice, inthe exercise of its discretion, to use the Social Security funds2 In April 2001, the department repealed $ 388-70-069 and replaced itwith a functionally similar provision. The new regulation provides thatthe department "must use income not exempted to cover the child's costof care." Wash. Admin.

See App. to Pet. for Cert.A-57; App. 178.CAs of September 1999, there were 10,578 foster children inthe department's care, some 1,500 of them receiving OASDIor SSI benefits.

GUARDIANSHIP ESTATE OF KEFFELEROpinion of the CourtSection 1383(d)(1) incorporates this provision by referenceand applies it to Title XVI of the Act.Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the trialcourt agreed with respondents. It enjoined the departmentfrom continuing to charge its costs of foster care against Social Security benefits, ordered restitution of previous reimbursement transfers, and awarded attorney's fees to respondents. The department appealed to the State Court ofAppeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court ofWashington.After remanding for further factfinding, the State Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's holding that the department's practices violated the antiattachment provisions.4Relying in part on Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd.,409 U. S. 413 (1973), and Bennett v. Arkansas, 485 U. S. 395(1988) (per curiam), the state court reasoned that $ 407(a)was intended to protect Social Security benefits from theclaims of creditors, and consequently framed "the crucialquestion" as "[w]hether [the department] acts as a creditorwhen it reimburses itself for foster care costs out of the foster children's [benefits]." 145 Wash. 2d, at 17, 32 P. 3d, at275 (emphasis in original).

Nor did the state court think it significant that it was the Commissioner of Social Security whohad appointed the department to serve as representativepayee for respondents' Social Security benefits. See id., at25, 32 P. 3d, at 278 (calling the department's representativepayee status "at best immaterial to the analysis"). To thecontrary, the court ultimately reasoned that the department's capacity as representative payee "further undercutsthe legality of its reimbursement process" because a representative payee is charged with acting " `in the best interestsof the beneficiary.' " Id., at 24, 32 P. 3d, at 278 (emphasisin original) (quoting 20 CFR $ 404.2035(a)).

GUARDIANSHIP ESTATE OF KEFFELEROpinion of the CourtIIASection 407(a) protects SSI and OASDI benefits from"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legalprocess." The Supreme Court of Washington approachedrespondents' claim by generalizing from this text andconcluding that $ 407(a) prohibits "creditor-type acts," onwhich reading it held that the department's reimbursementscheme was prohibited. The analysis was flawed.First, neither $ 407(a) nor the Commissioner's regulationsinterpreting that provision say anything about "creditors."Cf. Philpott, supra, at 417 ("[Section] 407 does not refer toany `claim of creditors'; it imposes a broad bar against theuse of any legal process to reach all social security benefits").In fact, the Act and regulations to which we owe deference,see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984), not only permitcertain creditors to serve as representative payees, 42U. S. C. $$ 405( j)(2)(C)(iii), 1383(a)(2)(B)(v), but allow a representative payee to satisfy even old debts of a beneficiary solong as current and reasonably foreseeable needs will be metand reimbursement is in the beneficiary's interest, 20 CFR$$ 404.2040(d), 416.640(d). Finally, as the Supreme Court ofWashington apparently recognized (in qualifying its characterization of "creditor relationship" by referring to the department's acts as merely "creditor-type"), the departmentis simply not a creditor of the foster care children for whomit serves as representative payee. No law provides thatthey are liable to repay the department for the costs of theircare, and the State of Washington makes no such claim.The questions to be answered in resolving this case, then,do not go to the State's character as a creditor. The questions, instead, are whether the department's effort to becomea representative payee, or its use of respondents' Social Security benefits when it acts in that capacity, amounts to em537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 537 U. S. 371 (2003)Opinion of the Courtploying an "execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, orother legal process" within the meaning of $ 407(a).6 For obvious reasons, respondents do not contend that the depart-ment's activities involve any execution, levy, attachment, orgarnishment. These legal terms of art refer to formal pro-cedures by which one person gains a degree of control overproperty otherwise subject to the control of another, andgenerally involve some form of judicial authorization. See,e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "pro-visional attachment" as a "prejudgment attachment in whichthe debtor's property is seized so that if the creditor ulti-mately prevails, the creditor will be assured of recovering onthe judgment . . . . Ordinarily, a hearing must be held be-fore the attachment takes place");id., at 689 (defining "gar-nishment" as "[a] judicial proceeding in which a creditor (orpotential creditor) asks the court to order a third party whois indebted to or is bailee for the debtor to turn over to thecreditor any of the debtor's property"). The department'sefforts to become a representative payee and to use respondents' benefits do not even arguably employ any of these traditional procedures.Thus, the case boils down to whether the department'smanner of gaining control of the federal funds involves"other legal process," as the statute uses that term. Thatrestriction to the statutory usage of "other legal process" is6 Respondents have apparently never argued that the reimbursementviolates the $ 407(a) bar to "transfe[r]" of benefits; nor would such a claimseem to hold any promise on the facts here. Respondents do, however,contend that the department's budgeting in anticipation of receiving SocialSecurity benefits constitutes an "assign[ment]" prohibited by $ 407(a).Congress could hardly have intended for this sort of budgeting, done byprivate and public representative payees alike, to run afoul of the antiattachment provisions of the Act, particularly since the Administrationmakes OASDI payments with a 1-month lag. See infra, at 387. To theextent that the text of $ 407(a) is ambiguous on this score, the Commissioner's interpretation of the provision to permit such budgeting requires deference. See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 139-140 (1944).537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 WASHINGTON STATE DEPT. OF SOCIAL AND HEALTHSERVS. v.

Thus, "other legal process"should be understood to be process much like the processesof execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at aminimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicialor quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from oneperson to another in order to discharge or secure dischargeof an allegedly existing or anticipated liability.In this case, the product of these canons of constructionis confirmed by legal guidance in the Commissioner's owninterpretation of "legal process." The Social Security Administration's Program Operations Manual System (POMS),the publicly available operating instructions for processingSocial Security claims, defines "legal process" as used in$ 407(a) as "the means by which a court (or agency or officialauthorized by law) compels compliance with its demand;generally, it is a court order." POMS GN 02410.001 (2002),available at http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/aboutpoms (as visited Jan. 23, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file).Elsewhere in the POMS, the Commissioner defines "legalprocess" similarly as "any writ, order, summons or other similar process in the nature of garnishment. It may include,but is not limited to, an attachment, writ of execution, income execution order or wage assignment that is issued by. . . [a] court of competent jurisdiction . . . [or a]n authorizedofficial pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to State or local law . . . [a]nd is directedto a governmental entity." POMS GN 02410.200 (emphasisadded). While these administrative interpretations are notproducts of formal rulemaking, they nevertheless warrantrespect in closing the door on any suggestion that the usualrules of statutory construction should get short shrift for thesake of reading "other legal process" in abstract breadth.See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 139-140 (1944);537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 WASHINGTON STATE DEPT. OF SOCIAL AND HEALTHSERVS. v. GUARDIANSHIP ESTATE OF KEFFELEROpinion of the Courtsee also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228, 234-235 (2001).On this restrictive understanding of "other legal process,"it is apparent that the department's efforts to become respondents' representative payee and its use of respondents'benefits in that capacity involve nothing of the sort.8Whereas the object of the processes specifically named is todischarge, or secure discharge of, some enforceable obliga-tion, the State has no enforceable claim against its fosterchildren. And although execution, levy, attachment, andgarnishment typically involve the exercise of some sort ofjudicial or quasi-judicial authority to gain control over anoth-er's property, the department's reimbursement scheme operates on funds already in the department's possession andcontrol, held on terms that allow the reimbursement.The regulations previously quoted specify that paymentsmade for a beneficiary's "current maintenance" are deemedto be "for the use and benefit of the beneficiary," and define"current maintenance" to include "cost[s] incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfortitems." 20 CFR $$ 404.2040(a), 416.640(a). There is noquestion that the state funds to be reimbursed were spentfor items of "current maintenance," and although the Statetypically makes the accounting reimbursement two monthsafter spending its own funds, this practice is consistent withthe regulation's definition of "current maintenance" as "costsincurred" for food and the like. That the State is dealingwith the funds consistently with Social Security regulationsis confirmed by the Commissioner's own interpretation of8 In arguing that $ 407(a) applies here, respondents rely in part on$ 407(b), which provides that "[n]o other provision of law . . . may be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section." Given our conclusion that $ 407(a), by its terms, does not apply,however, respondents' reliance is misplaced.537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 537 U.

POMS GN 00602.030 (defining a "past debt," which maybe satisfied only if a beneficiary's current and reasonablyforeseeable needs are met, as "a debt the beneficiary incurred before the date of the first benefit payment is madeto the current payee").9The Government has gone even further to support this asa reasonable interpretation, text aside, owing to significantadvantages of the reimbursement method in providing accurate documentation and allowing for easy monitoring of representative payees in administering Social Security. SeeBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28-29.10 In fact,it would be hard not to see this type of slightly delayed reimbursement as the only way OASDI funds could be spent on afoster child's current maintenance, since the Administrationdisburses those Social Security benefits with a time lag.See POMS GN 02401.001 (noting that OASDI benefits aredispensed within the month after they are due). In short,the Commissioner's interpretation of her own regulations is9 There is one exception to this rule, although it is not relevant forour present purposes. In October 1996, Congress amended 42 U. S. C.$ 1383 to specify that when the Administration issues a retroactive lumpsum payment of SSI benefits that exceeds six times the monthlybenefit amount, that amount is to be deposited directly into a dedicatedinterest-bearing bank account to be used only for certain special needs.$ 1383(a)(2)(F).10 Moreover, as the Government notes, the position of the SupremeCourt of Washington and respondents is ultimately "one of empty formalism" because a State could, indisputably, use a foster child's Social Securitybenefits directly for the costs of care and then reduce the State's ownfunding by the same amount.

The financial result would be the same as in the system currentlyused by the department, yet the practical advantages of the reimbursement method of accounting would be lost.537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 WASHINGTON STATE DEPT.

S. 452, 461 (1997).11The Supreme Court of Washington rested its contrary con-clusion, in part, on our decisions in Philpott v. Essex CountyWelfare Bd., 409 U. S. 413 (1973), and Bennett v. Arkansas,485 U. S. 395 (1988) (per curiam). But both Philpott andBennett involved judicial actions in which a State sought toattach a beneficiary's Social Security benefits as reimbursement for the costs of the beneficiary's care and maintenance.SeePhilpott, supra, at 415 ("Respondent sued to reach thebank account"); Bennett, supra, at 396 ("The State filed separate actions in state court seeking to attach Social Securitybenefits"). In each case, we held that the plain language of$ 407(a) barred the State's legal action, and refused to findan implied exception to the antiattachment provision for aState simply because it provides for the care and mainte-nance of a beneficiary. See Philpott, supra, at 416; Bennett,supra, at 397. Unlike the present case, then, both PhilpottandBennett involved forms of legal process expressly pro-hibited by $ 407(a). In neither case was the State acting asa representative payee in seeking to use the funds as reim11 It bears mentioning that nothing in the State Supreme Court's reasoning limits its holding to state agencies. The state court's logic wouldapply equally to parents serving as representative payees, since they, likethe department, are under a legal obligation to support their children'sbasic needs irrespective of Social Security benefits. See, e. g., Wash. Rev.Code $ 74.20A.010 (2002). We find it hard to believe that Congress wouldhave intended this result, which would likely impose onerous and absurdaccounting requirements on parents. See, e. g., Mellies v. Mellies, 249Kan. 28, 33, 815 P. 2d 114, 117 (1991) (holding that a parent "had no obligation to exhaust his personal finances in providing for [his child's] supportbefore spending any of [the child's] social security benefits on the child'smaintenance"); In re Guardianship of Nelson, 547 N. W. 2d 105, 108, 109(Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (stating that because Social Security benefits are"not a windfall" for the beneficiary, "a representative payee parent canuse his or her child's social security survivor benefits for the child's currentmaintenance regardless of the parent's financial ability to meet thoseneeds").537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 537 U. S. 371 (2003)Opinion of the Courtbursement for the costs incurred in providing for the benefi-ciary's care and maintenance.BThe poor fit between $ 407(a) and respondents' argumentpoints to the real basis of their objections to the reimbursement practice. At bottom, respondents' position and theState Supreme Court's holding reflect a view that allowinga state agency to reimburse itself for the costs of foster careis antithetical to the best interest of the beneficiary fosterchild. See 145 Wash. 2d, at 17, 32 P. 3d, at 275 (contendingthat a foster child "is better off with any payee other thanthe [department] because [the department] must provide fos-ter care under state lawregardless of whether it receives areimbursement" (emphasis in original)); id., at 24, 32 P. 3d,at 278 ("We seriously doubt using [Social Security] benefitsto reimburse the state for its public assistance expenditureis in all cases, or even some, `in the best interests of thebeneficiary' " (quoting 20 CFR $ 404.2035(a))).Although it is true that the State could not directly compelthe beneficiary or any other representative payee to pay Social Security benefits over to the State, that fact does notrender the appointment of a self-reimbursing representativepayee at odds with the Commissioner's mandate to find thata beneficiary's "interest . . . would be served" by the appointment. 42 U. S. C. $$ 405( j)(1)(A), 1383(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I).12 Re12 Respondents also go beyond the $ 407(a) issue to argue that the department violates $ 405(j) itself, by, for example, failing to exercise discretion in how it uses benefits, periodically "sweeping" beneficiaries' accountsto pay for past care, and "double dipping" by using benefits to reimbursethe State for costs previously recouped from other sources. These allegations, and respondents' $ 405( j) stand-alone arguments more generally, arefar afield of the question on which we granted certiorari. Moreover, constitutional claims aside, respondents' complaint and the class-action certification related only to $ 407(a). Accordingly, we decline to reach respondents' $ 405(j) arguments here, except insofar as they relate to the properinterpretation of $ 407(a). Respondents are free to press their stand537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 WASHINGTON STATE DEPT. OF SOCIAL AND HEALTHSERVS. v. GUARDIANSHIP ESTATE OF KEFFELEROpinion of the Courtspondents' premise that promoting the "best interests" ofa beneficiary requires maximizing resources from left-overbenefit income ignores the settled principle of administrativelaw that an open-ended and potentially vague term is highlysusceptible to administrative interpretation subject to judi-cial deference. See Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842-843. Underher statutory authority, the Commissioner has read the "in-terest" of the beneficiary in light of the basic objectives ofthe Act: to provide a "minimum level of income" to childrenwho would not "have sufficient income and resources tomaintain a standard of living at the established Federal mini-mum income level," 20 CFR $ 416.110 (SSI); see alsoSulli-van v. Zebley, 493 U. S. 521, 524 (1990), and to provide workers and their families the "income required for ordinary andnecessary living expenses," $ 404.508(a) (OASDI); see alsoCalifano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 50 (1977). The Commis-sioner, that is, has decided that a representative payeeserves the beneficiary's interest by seeing that basic needsare met, not by maximizing a trust fund attributable to fortuitously overlapping state and federal grants.This judgment is not only obviously within the bounds ofthe reasonable, but one confirmed by the demonstrably anti-thetical character of respondents' position to the best interest of many foster care children. SSI beneficiaries would bemost obviously subject to threat, since eligibility for benefitsof these child recipients is lost if their assets creep abovea certain minimal level, currently $2,000. See 42 U. S. C.$$ 1382(a)(1)(B), (3)(B); 20 CFR $ 416.1205(c). Many fosterchildren would lose SSI benefits altogether if respondentsprevailed. See Brief for Children's Defense Fund et al. asAmici Curiae 20; Brief for Counties of the State of Califor-nia et al. asAmici Curiae 16-18. But foster children bene-ficiaries under both SSI and OASDI would suffer from abroader disadvantage. Respondents' argument forgets thealone $ 405(j) arguments before the Commissioner, who bears responsibility for overseeing representative payees, or elsewhere as appropriate.537US2 Unit: $U20 [04-22-04 21:04:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 537 U. S. 371 (2003)Opinion of the Courtfact that public institutions like the department are last inthe line of eligibility for appointment as representative payees; the Commissioner appoints them only when no one elsewill do. See 20 CFR $$ 404.2021(b), 416.621(b). If respondents had their way, however, public offices like the depart-ment might well not be there to serve as payees even as thelast resort, for there is reason to believe that if state agenciescould not use Social Security benefits to reimburse the Statein funding current costs of foster care, many States would bediscouraged from accepting appointment as representativepayees by the administrative costs of acting in that capacity.See Brief for Children's Defense Fund, supra, at 21; Brieffor State of Florida et al. asAmici Curiae 7.13 And withoutsuch agencies to identify children eligible for federal benefitsand to help them qualify, see Brief for Children's DefenseFund, supra, at 20-24; Brief for State of Florida, supra, at3-5; Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 17, many eligible children would either obtain no Social Security benefitsor need some very good luck to get them. With a smallertotal pool of money for their potential use, the chances ofhaving funds for genuine needs beyond immediate supportwould obviously shrink, to the children's loss. Respondents'position, in sum, would tend to produce worse representativepayees in these cases, with less money to spend.13 The Act does allow a state representative payee to use the lesser of10 percent of monthly benefits or $25 per month to offset administrativeexpenses. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 405(j)(4)(A)(i), 1383(a)(2)(D)(i). Nevertheless, at least with respect to SSI, many States spend considerably moreto identify eligible foster children and assist them in obtaining benefits.According to the department, for example, the process of screening potential SSI applicants among foster children and applying for benefits on theirbehalf involves 27 staff members and costs $1.9 million annually. See Application to Recall and Stay the Mandate of the Supreme Court of Washington Pending Certiorari, No. 01A557, pp. 18-19. For this reason, thedepartment has said that it would not seek to become the representativepayee for SSI beneficiaries absent an ability to use benefits to recoup somecosts.
