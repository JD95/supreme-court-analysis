This case turns on whether the federal carjacking statute,18 U. S. C. $ 2119, as it was when petitioner was charged,defined three distinct offenses or a single crime with a choiceof three maximum penalties, two of them dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of charge andjury verdict. We think the better reading is of three distinct offenses, particularly in light of the rule that any inter-pretive uncertainty should be resolved to avoid serious questions about the statute's constitutionality.IIn December 1992, petitioner, Nathaniel Jones, and twoothers, Oliver and McMillan, held up two men, Mutanna andMardaie. While Jones and McMillan went through the vic-tims' pockets, Oliver stuck his gun in Mutanna's left ear, andlater struck him on the head. Oliver and McMillan madetheir getaway in the Cadillac Jones had driven to the scene,while Jones forced Mardaie into Mutanna's Honda and droveoff after them. After stopping to put Mardaie out, Jones*David M. Porter and Edward M. Chikofsky filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urgingreversal.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN230 JONES v.

S. C. $ 924(c), andcarjacking or aiding and abetting carjacking, in violation of18 U. S.

Consistently with this advice, the District Court's subsequent jury instructions de-fined the elements subject to the Government's burden ofproof by reference solely to the first paragraph of $ 2119,with no mention of serious bodily injury.Id., at 10. Thejury found Jones guilty on both counts.The case took a new turn, however, with the arrival of thepresentence report, which recommended that petitioner besentenced to 25 years for the carjacking because one of thevictims had suffered serious bodily injury. The reportnoted that Mutanna had testified that Oliver's gun causedprofuse bleeding in Mutanna's ear, and that a physician hadconcluded that Mutanna had suffered a perforated eardrum,with some numbness and permanent hearing loss. Id., at15-16; 60 F. 3d, at 554. Jones objected that the 25-year recommendation was out of bounds, since serious bodily injurywas an element of the offense defined in part by $ 2119(2),which had been neither pleaded in the indictment nor provenbefore the jury. App. 12-13. The District Court saw thematter differently and, based on its finding that the seriousbodily injury allegation was supported by a preponderanceof the evidence, imposed a 25-year sentence on the carjackingcount, ibid., together with a consecutive 5-year sentence forthe firearm offense, 60 F. 3d, at 549.Like the trial court, the Court of Appeals did not read$ 2119(2) as setting out an element of an independent offense.2 Id., at 551-554. The Ninth Circuit thus agreedwith the Eleventh, seeUnited States v. Williams, 51 F. 3d1004, 1009-1010 (1995), in reasoning that the structure of2 The Ninth Circuit vacated another portion of the District Court's sentencing decision and remanded. United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe statute, particularly the grammatical dependence of thenumbered subsections on the first paragraph, demonstratedCongress's understanding that the subsections did not com-plete the definitions of separate crimes. 60 F. 3d, at 552-553. For its view that the subsections provided sentencingfactors, the court found additional support in the statute'slegislative history. The heading on the subtitle of the billcreating $ 2119 was "Enhanced Penalties for Auto Theft,"which the court took as indicating that the statute's num-bered subsections merely defined sentencing enhancements.Id., at 553. The court also noted several references in theCommittee Reports and floor debate on the bill to enhancedpenalties for an apparently single carjacking offense. Ibid.Because of features arguably distinguishing this case fromAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), wegranted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1045 (1998), and now reverse.IIMuch turns on the determination that a fact is an elementof an offense rather than a sentencing consideration, giventhat elements must be charged in the indictment, submittedto a jury, and proven by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S.87, 117 (1974);United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 509-510 (1995). Accordingly, some statutes come with the benefit of provisions straightforwardly addressing the distinctionbetween elements and sentencing factors. See McMillan v.Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85-86 (1986) (express identifica-tion of statutory provision as sentencing factor). Evenwithout any such help, however, $ 2119 at first glance has alook to it suggesting that the numbered subsections are onlysentencing provisions. It begins with a principal paragraphlisting a series of obvious elements (possession of a firearm,taking a motor vehicle, connection with interstate commerce,and so on). That paragraph comes close to standing on itsown, followed by sentencing provisions, the first of which,526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN233Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Courtsubsection (1), certainly adds no further element. But thesuperficial impression loses clarity when one looks at thepenalty subsections (2) and (3). These not only provide forsteeply higher penalties, but condition them on further facts(injury, death) that seem quite as important as the elementsin the principal paragraph (e. g., force and violence, intimida-tion). It is at best questionable whether the specification offacts sufficient to increase a penalty range by two-thirds, letalone from 15 years to life, was meant to carry none of theprocess safeguards that elements of an offense bring withthem for a defendant's benefit. The "look" of the statute,then, is not a reliable guide to congressional intentions, andthe Government accordingly advances two, more subtlestructural arguments for its position that the fact specifiedin subsection (2) is merely a sentencing factor.Like the Court of Appeals, the Government stresses thatthe statute's numbered subsections do not stand alone indefining offenses, most of whose elements on anyone's reckoning are set out in the statute's opening paragraph. Thisintegrated structure is said to suggest that the statuteestablishes only a single offense. To the same point, theGovernment argues that the numbered subsections comeafter the word "shall," which often divides offense-definingprovisions from those that specify sentences. Brief forUnited States 15-18. While these points are sound enoughas far as they go, they are far short of dispositive even ontheir own terms, whereas they are weakened here by a number of countervailing structural considerations. First, aspetitioner notes, Reply Brief for Petitioner 1-2, if the shortersubsection (2) of $ 2119 does not stand alone, neither does thesection's more voluminous first paragraph. In isolation, itwould merely describe some very obnoxious behavior, leaving any reader assuming that it must be a crime, but neverbeing actually told that it is. Only the numbered subsidiaryprovisions complete the thought. Section 2119 is thus unlike most offense-defining provisions in the federal criminal526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN234 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcode, which genuinely stand on their own grammatical feetthanks to phrases such as "shall be unlawful," see,e. g., 18U. S. C. $ 922(g), "shall be punished," see, e. g., $ 511A(a), or"shall be guilty of," see,e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 514 (1994 ed.,Supp. II), which draw a provision to its close. Second, asfor the significance of the word "shall," although it frequentlyseparates offense-defining clauses from sentencing provisions, it hardly does so invariably. One of the robberystatutes that served as a model for $ 2119,3 see 18 U. S. C.$$ 2118(a)(3), (b)(3), for example, places elements of the of-fense on either side of "shall." And, of course, where thesupposedly "elements" side is itself grammatically incom-plete (as here), the placement of "shall" is oddly equivocal.Indeed, both the Government and the Courts of Appealstreat the statute perhaps most closely resembling this one,$ 1365(a) (consumer tampering), as defining basic and aggravated offenses, one of which is defined in terms of seriousbodily injury. See,e. g., United States v. Meling, 47 F. 3d1546, 1551 (CA9 1995).These clues derived from attention to structure and parsing of wording, like those the dissent holds up to distinguishthe carjacking act both from the robbery statutes uponwhich it was modeled and state aggravated robbery statutes,seepost, at 260-262, 263-264 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), turnout to move us only so far in our effort to infer congressionalintent. The text alone does not justify any confident infer-ence. But statutory drafting occurs against a backdrop notmerely of structural conventions of varying significance, butof traditional treatment of certain categories of importantfacts, like the degree of injury to victims of crime, in relation toparticular crimes. If a given statute is unclear about treatingsuch a fact as element or penalty aggravator, it makes senseto look at what other statutes have done, on the fair assumption that Congress is unlikely to intend any radical departures from past practice without making a point of saying so.3 See n. 4, infra.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN235Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the CourtWe engaged in just such an enquiry this past Term inAlmendarez-Torres, where we stressed the history of treating recidivism as a sentencing factor, and noted that, withperhaps one exception, Congress had never clearly madeprior conviction an offense element where the offense con-duct, in the absence of recidivism, was independently unlawful. 523 U. S., at 230. Here, on the contrary, the search forcomparable examples more readily suggests that Congresshad separate and aggravated offenses in mind when it em-ployed the scheme of numbered subsections in $ 2119. Although Congress has explicitly treated serious bodily injuryas a sentencing factor, see,e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2262(b)(2) (inter-state violation of a protection order); $ 248(b)(2) (free accessto clinic entrances; bodily injury), it has unmistakably identi-fied serious bodily injury as an offense element in any number of statutes, see, e. g., 10 U. S. C. $ 928(b)(2) (assault by amember of the armed forces); 18 U. S. C. $ 37(a)(1) (violenceat international airports); $ 1091(a)(2) (genocide). The like-lihood that Congress understood injury to be an offenseelement here follows all the more from the fact that carjack-ing is a type of robbery, and serious bodily injury has traditionally been treated, both by Congress and by the statelegislatures, as defining an element of the offense of aggravated robbery. As the Government acknowledges, Brief forUnited States 20-21, and n. 8, Congress modeled the federalcarjacking statute on several other federal robbery statutes.4One of them, 18 U. S. C. $ 2118 (robbery involving controlledsubstances), clearly makes causing serious bodily injury anelement of the offense. It provides that "[w]hoever takes orattempts to take from the person or presence of another byforce or violence or by intimidation any [of certain controlled4 Legislative history identifies three such models. See H. R. Rep.No. 102-851, pt. 1, p. 17 (1992) ("The definition of the offense tracks thelanguage used in other federal robbery statutes (18 U. S. C. $$ 2111, 2113,2118)"). One of them, 18 U. S. C. $ 2111 (robbery in areas of federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction), lacks aggravated forms of the offense altogether, and thus is not on point here.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN236 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsubstances] shall . . . be fined . . . or imprisoned not morethan twenty years, or both, if (1) the replacement cost of the[controlled substance] was not less than $500, . . . or (3) an-other person was killed or suffered significant bodily injuryas a result of such taking or attempt." $ 2118(a)(3); see also$ 2118(b)(3).5 A second model, $ 2113 (bank robbery), as theGovernment concedes, see Brief for United States 17, makesrelated facts of violence, that is, assault and jeopardizing lifeby using a dangerous weapon, elements defining an aggravated form of that type of robbery. See $$ 2113(d), (e);cf.Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 231 (citing bank robberystatute as example of statute establishing greater and lesserincluded offenses);McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88 (contrasting$ 2113(d) with provision defining a sentencing enhancement).When pressed at oral argument, the Government provedunable to explain why Congress might have chosen one treatment of serious bodily harm or violence in defining two of thethree offenses it used as its models for $ 2119 and a differenttreatment in writing the carjacking statute itself, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 41-44, and we are unable to imagine a convincingreason ourselves. We thus think it fair to say that, as in theearlier robbery statutes, so in the carjacking statute, Congress probably intended serious bodily injury to be an element defining an aggravated form of the crime.State practice bolsters the conclusion. Many States usecausation of serious bodily injury or harm as an element defining a distinct offense of aggravated robbery. See, e. g.,Ala. Code $ 13A-8-41(a)(2) (1994) (robbery in the first degreedefined in part by the causing of "serious physical injury");5 The dissent, in passing, questions our view that $ 2118(a) makes thecausing of significant bodily injury an element of the offense defined bythat section, see post, at 261-262, but it offers no reason to doubt ourreading. Given that $ 2118(a) establishes only one maximum punishment,and that it makes eligibility for such punishment contingent on the establishment of at least one of three facts, one of which is the causing of deathor significant bodily injury, we think our reading is the only sensible one.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN237Cite as: 526 U.

Code $ 9A.56.200(1)(c) (1994) (robbery in the first degree; "[i]nflicts bodily injury"). While the state practice isnot, admittedly, direct authority for reading the federal carjacking statute, it does show that in treating serious bodilyinjury as an element, Congress would have been treading awell-worn path.Despite these indications and the equivocal structuralclues, the Government suggests that a 1996 amendment supports its reading of the carjacking statute as previouslyenacted. In the Carjacking Correction Act of 1996, 110 Stat.3020, Congress provided that the term "serious bodily injury" in subsection (2) should include sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse as defined in $$ 2241 and 2242. TheGovernment points to several statements in the 1996 amendment's legislative history in which subsection (2) is describedas providing a "penalty enhancement," see, e. g., H. R. Rep.No. 104-787, pp. 2, 3 (1996), as showing that subsection (2)526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN238 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdefines a sentencing factor. Even those of us disposed totreat legislative history as authority, however, find thequoted statements unimpressive. Assuming that "penaltyenhancement" was meant to be synonymous with "sentencing factor," the legislative history also contains contrary indications in some of the statements made by the 1996 amend-ment's sponsors, suggesting an assumption that subsection(2) established an element or elements that had to be provenat trial. See 142 Cong. Rec. 19769 (1996) (statement of Sen.Biden) ("[T]he defendant had been convicted of raping thewoman" (emphasis added)). This hardly seems the occasionto doubt that "subsequent legislative history is a `hazardousbasis for inferring the intent of an earlier' Congress." Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S.633, 650 (1990) (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304,313 (1960)). Indeed, our leeriness of relying on hindsightexpressed in legislative history is only confirmed by recognizing what oddity there would be in defining the fact ofserious bodily injury by reference to a distinct offense withits own offense elements, like sexual abuse, while at the sametime assuming that the fact so defined is merely a sentencing consideration.Nor do we think the legislative history that attracted theCourt of Appeals is any more helpful to the Government.See 60 F. 3d, at 553. The Committee Reports and floor debate on the statute refer to its augmentation of the criminallaw in the singular, not the plural, speaking only of a newfederal "crime" or "offense" of carjacking in the singular.See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 102-851, pt. 1, p. 17 (1992); 138 Cong.Rec. 32500 (1992) (statement of Rep. Dingell). But what wemake of the singular-plural distinction turns on the circumstances. Characterizing a cluster of provisions as enactingsomething to be described by the singular terms "offense"or "crime" would signify a good deal if the speakers or writers were addressing a point on which the distinction mattered. That is not, however, what they were doing in the526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN239Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Courtpassages cited, where those references couched in the singu-lar did not occur in discussions of the issue of offense elements versus sentencing factors that we confront here. So,we think their significance is slight. On the subject of legislative history, we should add that we see nothing favorableto the Government in the fact that the statement in theHouse Report explaining that the drafters of the carjackingstatute drew on the examples of other federal robbery statutes referred to an early version of the carjacking statutewhen it lacked any reference to the aggravated forms of theoffense now defined by subsections (2) and (3). See H. R.Rep. No. 102-851,supra, at 17. As against the suggestionthat Congress looked to the earlier robbery statutes onlywhen it settled on the language contained in the carjackingstatute's first paragraph, we think it would have beenstrange for Congress to find guidance in the other robberystatutes at the beginning of the legislative process and thenjust forget about them. As the Government itself suggestsin a somewhat different context, there is no reason to thinkthat Congress "might have abandoned [those] ready federalmodels" in developing the more fully elaborated version ofthe statute that it ultimately adopted. Brief for UnitedStates 21, n. 8.IIIWhile we think the fairest reading of $ 2119 treats the factof serious bodily harm as an element, not a mere enhancement, we recognize the possibility of the other view. Anydoubt that might be prompted by the arguments for thatother reading should, however, be resolved against it underthe rule, repeatedly affirmed, that "where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave anddoubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other ofwhich such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt thelatter." United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909); see also UnitedStates v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916). It is "out526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN240 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in thelight of constitutional limitations,"Rust v. Sullivan, 500U.

Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988);see alsoUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S.64, 78 (1994).As the Government would have us construe it, the statutewould be open to constitutional doubt in light of a series ofcases over the past quarter century, dealing with due processand the guarantee of trial by jury. The first of these, Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), reviewed a Maine murderstatute providing that the element of malice (in the sense ofwant of provocation, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197,215 (1977)) would be presumed upon proof of intent to killresulting in death, subject to a defendant's right of rebuttalthat he had acted on provocation in the heat of passion,which would reduce the offense to manslaughter. Mullaney, supra, at 686, and n. 3. The challenge was that thepresumption subject to rebuttal relieved the State of its dueprocess burden to prove every element of the crime beyonda reasonable doubt, as explained in In re Winship, 397 U. S.358, 364 (1970). The State replied that the challenge wasmerely formalistic, that the State's law in effect establisheda generic crime of felonious homicide, Mullaney, supra, at688, 696-697, on which view the fact subject to presumptionand rebuttal would have gone simply to sentence, andWinship would not have been controlling. But the Courtdeclined to accord the State this license to recharacterize theissue, in part because the State's reading left its statute atodds both with the centuries-old common law recognition ofmalice as the fact distinguishing murder from manslaughterand with the widely held modern view that heat of passion,once raised by the evidence, was a subject of the State's burden, 421 U. S., at 692-696, and in part because an unlimited526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN241Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Courtchoice over characterizing a stated fact as an element wouldleave the State substantially free to manipulate its way outof Winship, 421 U. S., at 698.Two Terms later, inPatterson v. New York, supra, theCourt ruled on a Winship challenge to a scheme definingmurder as causing death with intent, subject to an affirma-tive defense of extreme emotional disturbance for whichthere was a reasonable explanation. 432 U. S., at 205-206.Unlike Maine's law, New York's raised no presumption ofmalice; malice was omitted from the elements of murder.Patterson contended that because the presence or absence ofan extreme emotional disturbance affected the severity ofsentence, Winship and Mullaney required the State to provethe absence of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. We rejected this argument and "decline[d] to adopt as a constitutional imperative . . . that a State must disprove beyond areasonable doubt every fact constituting any and all affirmative defenses related to the culpability of an accused." 432U. S., at 210. We identified the use of a presumption to establish an essential ingredient of the offense as the curse ofthe Maine law, because the "shifting of the burden of persuasion with respect to a fact which the State deems so important that it must be either proved or presumed is impermissible under the Due Process Clause." Id., at 215. With onecaveat, therefore, Patterson left the States free to choosethe elements that define their crimes, without any impediment from Winship. The caveat was a stated recognition ofsome limit upon state authority to reallocate the traditionalburden of proof, 432 U. S., at 210, which in that case waseasily satisfied by the fact that "at common law the burdenof proving" the mitigating circumstances of severe emotionaldisturbance "rested on the defendant." Id., at 202; see alsoid., at 211; Mullaney, supra, at 693-694. While a narrowreading of this limit might have been no more than a ban onusing presumptions to reduce elements to the point of beingnominal, a broader reading was equally open, that the State526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN242 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlacked the discretion to omit "traditional" elements from thedefinition of crimes and instead to require the accused todisprove such elements.These cases about allocation of burden, with their implications about the charging obligation and the requisite quantum of proof, were succeeded by McMillan v. Pennsylvania,477 U. S. 79 (1986), in which theWinship issue rose from aprovision that a judge's finding (by a preponderance) of visi-ble possession of a firearm would require a mandatory minimum sentence for certain felonies, but a minimum that fellwithin the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed. Although the Court rejected the petitioner's claim insofar as itwould have required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt ofany fact upon which a mandatory minimum sentence depended (and rejected certain subsidiary arguments as well),it did observe that the result might have been different ifproof of visible possession had exposed a defendant to a sentence beyond the maximum that the statute otherwise setwithout reference to that fact. 477 U. S., at 88.McMillan is notable not only for acknowledging the question of due process requirements for factfinding that raises asentencing range, but also for disposing of a claim that thePennsylvania law violated the Sixth Amendment right tojury trial as well. The petitioner's basic argument was fora right to jury determination of all "ultimate facts concerning the offense committed," id., at 93, and although the Courtdisposed of this by reference back to its due process discussion, that discussion had broached the potential constitutional significance of factfinding that raised the sentencingceiling.McMillan, then, recognizes a question under both the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the juryguarantee of the Sixth: when a jury determination has notbeen waived, may judicial factfinding by a preponderancesupport the application of a provision that increases the potential severity of the penalty for a variant of a given crime?526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN243Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the CourtThe seriousness of the due process issue is evident from Mul-laney's insistence that a State cannot manipulate its way outof Winship, and from Patterson's recognition of a limit onstate authority to reallocate traditional burdens of proof; thesubstantiality of the jury claim is evident from the practicalimplications of assuming Sixth Amendment indifference totreating a fact that sets the sentencing range as a sentencingfactor, not an element.6The terms of the carjacking statute illustrate very wellwhat is at stake. If serious bodily injury were merely asentencing factor under $ 2119(2) (increasing the authorizedpenalty by two thirds, to 25 years), then death would presumably be nothing more than a sentencing factor under sub-section (3) (increasing the penalty range to life). If a potential penalty might rise from 15 years to life on a nonjurydetermination, the jury's role would correspondingly shrink6 The dissent repeatedly chides us for failing to state precisely enoughthe principle animating our view that the carjacking statute, as construedby the Government, may violate the Constitution. See post, at 254, 266,277. The preceding paragraph in the text expresses that principle plainlyenough, and we restate it here: under the Due Process Clause of the FifthAmendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximumpenalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury,and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because our prior cases suggestrather than establish this principle, our concern about the Government'sreading of the statute rises only to the level of doubt, not certainty.Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, the constitutional proposition thatdrives our concern in no way "call[s] into question the principle that thedefinition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature." Post, at 270 (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional guarantees that give rise to our concern in no way restrict theability of legislatures to identify the conduct they wish to characterize ascriminal or to define the facts whose proof is essential to the establishmentof criminal liability. The constitutional safeguards that figure in our analysis concern not the identity of the elements defining criminal liabilitybut only the required procedures for finding the facts that determine themaximum permissible punishment; these are the safeguards going to theformality of notice, the identity of the factfinder, and the burden of proof.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN244 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfrom the significance usually carried by determinations ofguilt to the relative importance of low-level gatekeeping: insome cases, a jury finding of fact necessary for a maximum15-year sentence would merely open the door to a judicialfinding sufficient for life imprisonment. It is therefore notrivial question to ask whether recognizing an unlimited legislative power to authorize determinations setting ultimatesentencing limits without a jury would invite erosion of thejury's function to a point against which a line must necessarily be drawn.The question might well be less serious than the constitutional doubt rule requires if the history bearing on the Framers' understanding of the Sixth Amendment principle demonstrated an accepted tolerance for exclusively judicialfactfinding to peg penalty limits. But such is not the history. To be sure, the scholarship of which we are awaredoes not show that a question exactly like this one was everraised and resolved in the period before the framing. Onthe other hand, several studies demonstrate that on a general level the tension between jury powers and powers exclusively judicial would likely have been very much to the forein the Framers' conception of the jury right.The fact that we point to no statutes of the earlier timeexemplifying the distinction between elements and facts thatelevate sentencing ranges is unsurprising, given the breadthof judicial discretion over fines and corporal punishment inless important, misdemeanor cases, see, e. g., J. Baker, Introduction to English Legal History 584 (3d ed. 1990); 4W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 372(1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); Preyer, Penal Measures inthe American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am. J. Legal Hist.326, 350 (1982), and the norm of fixed sentences in cases offelony, see Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on theEve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England,France, Germany 1700-1900, pp. 36-37 (A. Schioppa ed.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN245Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Court1987); 4 Blackstone 238-239; A. Scott, Criminal Law in Colo-nial Virginia 27-28, 103-106 (1930).Even in this system, however, competition developed be-tween judge and jury over the real significance of their respective roles. The potential or inevitable severity of sentences was indirectly checked by juries' assertions of amitigating power when the circumstances of a prosecutionpointed to political abuse of the criminal process or endoweda criminal conviction with particularly sanguinary consequences. This power to thwart Parliament and Crown tookthe form not only of flat-out acquittals in the face of guiltbut of what today we would call verdicts of guilty to lesserincluded offenses, manifestations of what Blackstone described as "pious perjury" on the jurors' part. 4 Blackstone238-239.7Countervailing measures to diminish the juries' powerwere naturally forthcoming, with ensuing responses both inthe mother country and in the Colonies that validate, thoughthey do not answer, the question that the Government's position here would raise. One such move on the Government'sside was a parliamentary practice of barring the right tojury trial when defining new, statutory offenses. See, e. g.,Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and theConstitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev.917, 925-930 (1926); 4 Blackstone 277-279. This practice extended to violations of the Stamp Act and recurred in statutes regulating imperial trade, see C. Ubbelohde, ViceAdmiralty Courts and the American Revolution 16-21, 74-80(1960); Wroth, The Massachusetts Vice Admiralty Court, in7 For English practice, see, e. g., Langbein, Shaping the EighteenthCentury Criminal Trial, 50 U.

For ColonialAmerican practice, see, e. g., J. Goebell & T. Naughton, Law Enforcementin Colonial New York 673-674 (1944); State v. Bennet, 3 Brevard 515(S.

Billias ed.1965), and was one of the occasions for the protest in theDeclaration of Independence against deprivation of the bene-fit of jury trial, see P. Maier, American Scripture 118 (1997).But even before the Declaration, a less revolutionary voicethan the Continental Congress had protested against the leg-islative practice, in words widely read in America. The useof nonjury proceedings had "of late been so far extended,"Blackstone warned in the 1760's, "as, if a check be not timelygiven, to threaten the disuse of our admirable and truly Eng-lish trial by jury." 4 Blackstone 278. Identifying trial byjury as "the grand bulwark" of English liberties, Blackstonecontended that other liberties would remain secure only "solong as this palladium remains sacred and inviolate, not onlyfrom all open attacks, (which none will be so hardy as tomake) but also from all secret machinations, which may sapand undermine it; by introducing new and arbitrary methodsof trial, by justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, and courts of conscience. And however convenientthese may appear at first, (as doubtless all arbitrary powers,well executed, are the most convenient), yet let it be againremembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in theforms of justice, are the price that all free nations mustpay for their liberty in more substantial matters." Id., at342-344.A second response to the juries' power to control outcomesoccurred in attempts to confine jury determinations in libelcases to findings of fact, leaving it to the judges to apply thelaw and, thus, to limit the opportunities for juror nullification. Ultimately, of course, the attempt failed, the juries'victory being embodied in Fox's Libel Act in Britain, seegenerally T. Green, Verdict According to Conscience 318-355(1985), and exemplified in John Peter Zenger's acquittal inthe Colonies, see, e. g., J. Rakove, Original Meanings 300-302(1996). It is significant here not merely that the denouement of the restrictive efforts left the juries in control, but526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN247Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthat the focus of those efforts was principally the juries' con-trol over the ultimate verdict, applying law to fact (or "finding" the law, see, e. g., id., at 301), and not the factfindingrole itself.8 There was apparently some accepted understanding at the time that the finding of facts was simply toosacred a jury prerogative to be trifled with in prosecutionfor such a significant and traditional offense in the commonlaw courts.9 That this history had to be in the minds of theFramers is beyond cavil. According to one authority, theleading account of Zenger's trial was, with one possible ex-ception, "the most widely known source of libertarianthought in England and America during the eighteenth cen-tury." L. Levy, Freedom of Speech and Press in EarlyAmerican History 133 (1963). It is just as much beyond8 The principle that the jury were the judges of fact and the judges thedeciders of law was stated as an established principle as early as 1628 byCoke. See 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 155b (1628) ("adquestionem facti non respondent judices; ad questionem juris non respondent juratores"). See also Langbein, The English Criminal TrialJury on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England,France, Germany, supra, at 34, n. 60. Even the traditional, juryrestrictive view of libel law recognized the jury's authority over mattersof fact. See, e. g., King v. Francklin, 17 How. St. Tr. 626, 672 (K. B. 1731)("These [publications and the words having the meaning ascribed to them]are the two matters of fact that come under your consideration; and ofwhich you are proper judges. But then there is a third thing, to wit,Whether these defamatory expressions amount to a libel or not? Thisdoes not belong to the office of the jury, but to the office of the Court;because it is a matter of law, and not of fact; and of which the Court arethe only proper judges"). Thus most participants in the struggle overjury autonomy in seditious libel cases viewed the debate as concerned withthe extent of the jury's law-finding power, not its unquestioned role as thedeterminer of factual issues. See T. Green, Verdict According to Conscience 318-319 (1985). Some influential jurists suggested that it mightalso be seen as a struggle over the jury's right to find a particular fact,namely, the required criminal intent. See 10 W. Holdsworth, History ofEnglish Law 680-683 (1938).9 See 4 Blackstone 354 ( jurors could choose to stop at special verdicts ifthey wished).526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN248 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtquestion that Americans of the period perfectly well understood the lesson that the jury right could be lost not only bygross denial, but by erosion. See supra, at 245-247. Onecontributor to the ratification debates, for example, commenting on the jury trial guarantee in Art. III, $ 2, echoedBlackstone in warning of the need "to guard with the mostjealous circumspection against the introduction of new, andarbitrary methods of trial, which, under a variety of plausiblepretenses, may in time, imperceptibly undermine this bestpreservative of LIBERTY." A [New Hampshire] Farmer,No. 3, June 6, 1788, quoted in The Complete Bill of Rights477 (N. Cogan ed. 1997).In sum, there is reason to suppose that in the present circumstances, however peculiar their details to our time andplace, the relative diminution of the jury's significance wouldmerit Sixth Amendment concern. It is not, of course, thatanyone today would claim that every fact with a bearing onsentencing must be found by a jury; we have resolved thatgeneral issue and have no intention of questioning its resolution. The point is simply that diminishment of the jury'ssignificance by removing control over facts determining astatutory sentencing range would resonate with the claimsof earlier controversies, to raise a genuine Sixth Amendmentissue not yet settled.Our position that the Sixth Amendment and due processissues are by no means by the boards calls for a word aboutseveral cases that followed McMillan. Almendarez-Torresv. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), decided last Term,stands for the proposition that not every fact expanding apenalty range must be stated in a felony indictment, the precise holding being that recidivism increasing the maximumpenalty need not be so charged. But the case is not dispositive of the question here, not merely because we are concerned with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial andnot alone the rights to indictment and notice as claimed by526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN249Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the CourtAlmendarez-Torres, but because the holding last Termrested in substantial part on the tradition of regarding recidivism as a sentencing factor, not as an element to be set outin the indictment. The Court's repeated emphasis on thedistinctive significance of recidivism leaves no question thatthe Court regarded that fact as potentially distinguishablefor constitutional purposes from other facts that might ex-tend the range of possible sentencing. Seeid., at 230 ("Atthe outset, we note that the relevant statutory subject matter is recidivism"); ibid. ("With recidivism as the subjectmatter in mind, we turn to the statute's language"); id., at243 ("First, the sentencing factor at issue here--recidivism--is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court's increasing an offender's sentence"); id., at 245(distinguishingMcMillan "in light of the particular sentenc-ing factor at issue in this case--recidivism"). One basis forthat possible constitutional distinctiveness is not hard tosee: unlike virtually any other consideration used to enlargethe possible penalty for an offense, and certainly unlike thefactor before us in this case, a prior conviction must itselfhave been established through procedures satisfying thefair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.Almendarez-Torres cannot, then, be read to resolve the dueprocess and Sixth Amendment questions implicated by reading the carjacking statute as the Government urges.1010 The dissent insists that Almendarez-Torres "controls the question before us," post, at 266, but in substantiating that assertion, it tellingly reliesmore heavily on the claims of the Almendarez-Torres dissenters than onthe statements of the Almendarez-Torres majority. Neither source bearsout the current dissent's conclusion. If, as the dissenters in this case suggest, Almendarez-Torres did not turn on the particular "sentencing factorat issue" there, 523 U. S., at 243, but instead stood for the broad proposition that any fact increasing the maximum permissible punishment maybe determined by a judge by a preponderance, it is a mystery why theAlmendarez-Torres majority engaged in so much discussion of recidivism,or why, at the crux of its constitutional discussion, it turned first to discuss526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN250 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtNor is the question resolved by a series of three casesdealing with factfinding in capital sentencing. The first ofthese, Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447 (1984), contains nodiscussion of the sort of factfinding before us in this case.It addressed the argument that capital sentencing must be ajury task and rejected that position on the ground that capital sentencing is like sentencing in other cases, being a choiceof the appropriate disposition, as against an alternative or arange of alternatives. Id., at 459.Spaziano was followed in a few years by Hildwin v. Flor-ida, 490 U. S. 638 (1989) (per curiam), holding that the determination of death-qualifying aggravating facts could be en-trusted to a judge, following a verdict of guilty of murderand a jury recommendation of death, without violating theSixth Amendment's jury clause. Although citingSpazianoas authority, 490 U. S., at 639-640, Hildwin was the first caseto deal expressly with factfinding necessary to authorize im-position of the more severe of alternative sentences, and thusarguably comparable to factfinding necessary to expand thesentencing range available on conviction of a lesser crimethan murder. Even if we were satisfied that the analogywas sound,Hildwin could not drive the answer to the SixthAmendment question raised by the Government's positionhere. In Hildwin, a jury made a sentencing recommenda-tion of death, thus necessarily engaging in the factfindingrequired for imposition of a higher sentence, that is, the dethe "tradition" of recidivism's treatment as a sentencing factor, ibid., orwhy it never announced the unqualified holding that today's dissentersclaim to find in it. Admittedly, as the dissent here notes, the dissentersin Almendarez-Torres criticized the majority for what they consideredthe majority's unsupportable restraint in restricting their holding to recidivism. But that very criticism would have lacked its target if theAlmendarez-Torres majority had not so doggedly refrained from endorsing the general principle the dissent in this case now attributes to them.The majority and the dissenters in Almendarez-Torres disagreed over thelegitimacy of the Court's decision to restrict its holding to recidivism, butboth sides agreed that the Court had done just that.526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN251Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)Opinion of the Courttermination that at least one aggravating factor had beenproved. Hildwin, therefore, can hardly be read as resolvingthe issue discussed here, as the reasoning in Walton v. Ari-zona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), confirms.Walton dealt with an argument only slightly less expan-sive than the one inSpaziano, that every finding underlyinga sentencing determination must be made by a jury. Although the Court's rejection of that position cited Hildwin,it characterized the nature of capital sentencing by quotingfrom Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147, 156 (1986). See 497U. S., at 648. There, the Court described statutory specifications of aggravating circumstances in capital sentencing as"standards to guide the . . . choice between the alternativeverdicts of death and life imprisonment." Ibid. (quotingPoland, supra, at 156 (internal quotation marks omitted)).The Court thus characterized the finding of aggravatingfacts falling within the traditional scope of capital sentencingas a choice between a greater and a lesser penalty, not as aprocess of raising the ceiling of the sentencing range avail-able. We are frank to say that we emphasize this carefulreading of Walton's rationale because the question impli-cated by the Government's position on the meaning of$ 2119(2) is too significant to be decided without beingsquarely faced.In sum, the Government's view would raise serious consti-tutional questions on which precedent is not dispositive.Any doubt on the issue of statutory construction is hence tobe resolved in favor of avoiding those questions.11 This is11 In tones of alarm, the dissent suggests, see post, at 254, 271, that ourdecision will unsettle the efforts of many States to bring greater consistency to their sentencing practices through provisions for determinate sentences and statutorily or administratively established guidelines governing sentencing decisions. The dissent's concern is misplaced for severalreasons. Most immediately, our decision today does not announce anynew principle of constitutional law, but merely interprets a particular federal statute in light of a set of constitutional concerns that have emergedthrough a series of our decisions over the past quarter century. But even526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN252 JONES v.
