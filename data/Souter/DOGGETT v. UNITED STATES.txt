In this case we consider whether the delay of 81/2 yearsbetween petitioner's indictment and arrest violated his SixthAmendment right to a speedy trial. We hold that it did.IOn February 22, 1980, petitioner Marc Doggett was in-dicted for conspiring with several others to import and distribute cocaine. See 84 Stat. 1265, 1291, as amended, 21U. S. C. $$ 846, 963. Douglas Driver, the Drug EnforcementAdministration's (DEA's) principal agent investigating theconspiracy, told the United States Marshal's Service that theDEA would oversee the apprehension of Doggett and hisconfederates. On March 18, 1980, two police officers set out505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT649Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)Opinion of the Courtunder Driver's orders to arrest Doggett at his parents' housein Raleigh, North Carolina, only to find that he was notthere. His mother told the officers that he had left forColombia four days earlier.To catch Doggett on his return to the United States,Driver sent word of his outstanding arrest warrant to allUnited States Customs stations and to a number of law enforcement organizations. He also placed Doggett's name inthe Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS),a computer network that helps Customs agents screen peopleentering the country, and in the National Crime InformationCenter computer system, which serves similar ends. TheTECS entry expired that September, however, and Doggett'sname vanished from the system.In September 1981, Driver found out that Doggett wasunder arrest on drug charges in Panama and, thinking thata formal extradition request would be futile, simply askedPanama to "expel" Doggett to the United States. Althoughthe Panamanian authorities promised to comply when theirown proceedings had run their course, they freed Doggettthe following July and let him go to Colombia, where hestayed with an aunt for several months. On September 25,1982, he passed unhindered through Customs in New YorkCity and settled down in Virginia. Since his return to theUnited States, he has married, earned a college degree,found a steady job as a computer operations manager, livedopenly under his own name, and stayed within the law.Doggett's travels abroad had not wholly escaped the Government's notice, however. In 1982, the American Embassyin Panama told the State Department of his departure toColombia, but that information, for whatever reason, eludedthe DEA, and Agent Driver assumed for several years thathis quarry was still serving time in a Panamanian prison.Driver never asked DEA officials in Panama to check intoDoggett's status, and only after his own fortuitous assignment to that country in 1985 did he discover Doggett's depar505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT650 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtture for Colombia. Driver then simply assumed Doggetthad settled there, and he made no effort to find out for sureor to track Doggett down, either abroad or in the UnitedStates. Thus Doggett remained lost to the American criminal justice system until September 1988, when the Marshal'sService ran a simple credit check on several thousand peoplesubject to outstanding arrest warrants and, within minutes,found out where Doggett lived and worked. On September5, 1988, nearly 6 years after his return to the United Statesand 81/2 years after his indictment, Doggett was arrested.He naturally moved to dismiss the indictment, arguingthat the Government's failure to prosecute him earlier violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. TheFederal Magistrate hearing his motion applied the criteriafor assessing speedy trial claims set out in Barker v. Wingo,407 U. S. 514 (1972): "[l]ength of delay, the reason for thedelay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice tothe defendant." Id., at 530 (footnote omitted). The Magistrate found that the delay between Doggett's indictment andarrest was long enough to be "presumptively prejudicial,"Magistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 27-28, that the delay "clearly [was] attributable to the negligence of the government," id., at 39, and that Doggett couldnot be faulted for any delay in asserting his right to a speedytrial, there being no evidence that he had known of thecharges against him until his arrest, id., at 42-44. The Magistrate also found, however, that Doggett had made no affirmative showing that the delay had impaired his ability tomount a successful defense or had otherwise prejudiced him.In his recommendation to the District Court, the Magistratecontended that this failure to demonstrate particular prejudice sufficed to defeat Doggett's speedy trial claim.The District Court took the recommendation and deniedDoggett's motion. Doggett then entered a conditional guiltyplea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2),505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT651Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)Opinion of the Courtexpressly reserving the right to appeal his ensuing convic-tion on the speedy trial claim.A split panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 906 F. 2d573 (CA11 1990). Following Circuit precedent, see Ringstaff v. Howard, 885 F. 2d 1542 (CA11 1989) (en banc), thecourt ruled that Doggett could prevail only by proving "actual prejudice" or by establishing that "the first threeBarker factors weigh[ed] heavily in his favor." 906 F. 2d, at582. The majority agreed with the Magistrate that Doggetthad not shown actual prejudice, and, attributing the Govern-ment's delay to "negligence" rather than "bad faith," id., at578-579, it concluded that Barker's first three factors did notweigh so heavily against the Government as to make proofof specific prejudice unnecessary. Judge Clark dissented,arguing, among other things, that the majority had placedundue emphasis on Doggett's inability to prove actualprejudice.We granted Doggett's petition for certiorari, 498 U. S. 1119(1991), and now reverse.IIThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that, "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy. . . trial . . . ." On its face, the Speedy Trial Clause is writ-ten with such breadth that, taken literally, it would forbidthe government to delay the trial of an "accused" for anyreason at all. Our cases, however, have qualified the literalsweep of the provision by specifically recognizing the rele-vance of four separate enquiries: whether delay before trialwas uncommonly long, whether the government or the crimi-nal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, indue course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial,and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay's result. SeeBarker, supra, at 530.The first of these is actually a double enquiry. Simply totrigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege thatthe interval between accusation and trial has crossed the505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT652 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthreshold dividing ordinary from "presumptively prejudicial"delay, 407 U. S., at 530-531, since, by definition, he cannotcomplain that the government has denied him a "speedy"trial if it has, in fact, prosecuted his case with customarypromptness. If the accused makes this showing, the courtmust then consider, as one factor among several, the extentto which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimumneeded to trigger judicial examination of the claim. Seeid.,at 533-534. This latter enquiry is significant to the speedytrial analysis because, as we discuss below, the presumptionthat pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifiesover time. In this case, the extraordinary 81/2-year lag be-tween Doggett's indictment and arrest clearly suffices totrigger the speedy trial enquiry; 1 its further significancewithin that enquiry will be dealt with later.As for Barker's second criterion, the Government claimsto have sought Doggett with diligence. The findings of thecourts below are to the contrary, however, and we reviewtrial court determinations of negligence with considerabledeference. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.384, 402 (1990);McAllister v. United States, 348 U. S. 19,20-22 (1954); 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 2590 (1971). The Government gives us nothingto gainsay the findings that have come up to us, and we seenothing fatal to them in the record. For six years, the Gov-ernment's investigators made no serious effort to test theirprogressively more questionable assumption that Doggett1 Depending on the nature of the charges, the lower courts have generally found postaccusation delay "presumptively prejudicial" at least as itapproaches one year. See 2 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure$ 18.2, p. 405 (1984); Joseph, Speedy Trial Rights in Application, 48 Ford.L. Rev. 611, 623, n. 71 (1980) (citing cases). We note that, as the term isused in this threshold context, "presumptive prejudice" does not necessarily indicate a statistical probability of prejudice; it simply marks the pointat which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the Barkerenquiry. Cf. Uviller, Barker v. Wingo: Speedy Trial Gets a Fast Shuffle,72 Colum. L. Rev. 1376, 1384-1385 (1972).505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT653Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)Opinion of the Courtwas living abroad, and, had they done so, they could havefound him within minutes. While the Government's lethargy may have reflected no more than Doggett's relativeunimportance in the world of drug trafficking, it was stillfindable negligence, and the finding stands.The Government goes against the record again in suggesting that Doggett knew of his indictment years before he wasarrested. Were this true, Barker's third factor, concerninginvocation of the right to a speedy trial, would be weighedheavily against him. But here again, the Government istrying to revisit the facts. At the hearing on Doggett'sspeedy trial motion, it introduced no evidence challengingthe testimony of Doggett's wife, who said that she did notknow of the charges until his arrest, and of his mother, whoclaimed not to have told him or anyone else that the policehad come looking for him. From this the Magistrate implicitly concluded, Magistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet.for Cert. 42-44, and the Court of Appeals expressly reaffirmed, 906 F. 2d, at 579-580, that Doggett had won theevidentiary battle on this point. Not only that, but in thefactual basis supporting Doggett's guilty plea, the Government explicitly conceded that it had"no information that Doggett was aware of the indictment before he left the United States in March 1980, orprior to his arrest. His mother testified at the suppression hearing that she never told him, and Barnes andRiddle [Doggett's confederates] state they did not havecontact with him after their arrest [in 1980]." 2 Record, Exh. 63, p. 2.While one of the Government's lawyers later expressedamazement that "that particular stipulation is in the factualbasis," Tr. 13 (Mar. 31, 1989), he could not make it go away,and the trial and appellate courts were entitled to acceptthe defense's unrebutted and largely substantiated claim of505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT654 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDoggett's ignorance. Thus, Doggett is not to be taxed forinvoking his speedy trial right only after his arrest.IIIThe Government is left, then, with its principal contention:that Doggett fails to make out a successful speedy trial claimbecause he has not shown precisely how he was prejudicedby the delay between his indictment and trial.AWe have observed in prior cases that unreasonable delaybetween formal accusation and trial threatens to producemore than one sort of harm, including "oppressive pretrialincarceration," "anxiety and concern of the accused," and"the possibility that the [accused's] defense will be impaired"by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.Barker, 407 U. S., at 532; see also Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S.374, 377-379 (1969);United States v. Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120(1966). Of these forms of prejudice, "the most serious is thelast, because the inability of a defendant adequately to pre-pare his case skews the fairness of the entire system." 407U. S., at 532. Doggett claims this kind of prejudice, andthere is probably no other kind that he can claim, since hewas subjected neither to pretrial detention nor, he hassuccessfully contended, to awareness of unresolved chargesagainst him.The Government answers Doggett's claim by citing language in three cases, United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307,320-323 (1971), United States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 8(1982), and United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312(1986), for the proposition that the Speedy Trial Clause doesnot significantly protect a criminal defendant's interest infair adjudication. In so arguing, the Government asks us,in effect, to read part of Barker right out of the law, andthat we will not do. In context, the cited passages supportnothing beyond the principle, which we have independently505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT655Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)Opinion of the Courtbased on textual and historical grounds, see Marion, supra,at 313-320, that the Sixth Amendment right of the accusedto a speedy trial has no application beyond the confines ofa formal criminal prosecution. Once triggered by arrest,indictment, or other official accusation, however, the speedytrial enquiry must weigh the effect of delay on the accused'sdefense just as it has to weigh any other form of prejudicethatBarker recognized.2 See Moore v. Arizona, 414 U. S.25, 26-27, and n. 2 (1973); Barker, supra, at 532; Smith,supra, at 377-379; Ewell, supra, at 120.As an alternative to limiting Barker, the Governmentclaims Doggett has failed to make any affirmative showingthat the delay weakened his ability to raise specific defenses,elicit specific testimony, or produce specific items of evidence.Though Doggett did indeed come up short in this respect,the Government's argument takes it only so far: consider-ation of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable, and, as it concedes, Brief for United States 28, n. 21;Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-34 (Feb. 24, 1992), affirmative proof ofparticularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trialclaim. SeeMoore, supra, at 26; Barker, supra, at 533.Barker explicitly recognized that impairment of one's de-fense is the most difficult form of speedy trial prejudice toprove because time's erosion of exculpatory evidence andtestimony "can rarely be shown." 407 U. S., at 532. Andthough time can tilt the case against either side, see id., at521; Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, one cannot generally be surewhich of them it has prejudiced more severely. Thus, wegenerally have to recognize that excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that nei-ther party can prove or, for that matter, identify. While2 Thus, we reject the Government's argument that the effect of delay onadjudicative accuracy is exclusively a matter for consideration under theDue Process Clause. We leave intact our earlier observation, see UnitedStates v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 7 (1982), that a defendant may invokedue process to challenge delay both before and after official accusation.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT656 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsuch presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a SixthAmendment claim without regard to the other Barker criteria, see Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, it is part of the mix ofrelevant facts, and its importance increases with the lengthof delay. BThis brings us to an enquiry into the role that presumptiveprejudice should play in the disposition of Doggett's speedytrial claim. We begin with hypothetical and somewhat eas-ier cases and work our way to this one.Our speedy trial standards recognize that pretrial delay isoften both inevitable and wholly justifiable. The government may need time to collect witnesses against the accused,oppose his pretrial motions, or, if he goes into hiding, trackhim down. We attach great weight to such considerationswhen balancing them against the costs of going forward witha trial whose probative accuracy the passage of time hasbegun by degrees to throw into question. See Loud Hawk,supra, at 315-317. Thus, in this case, if the Governmenthad pursued Doggett with reasonable diligence from his indictment to his arrest, his speedy trial claim would fail. In-deed, that conclusion would generally follow as a matter ofcourse however great the delay, so long as Doggett could notshow specific prejudice to his defense.The Government concedes, on the other hand, that Dog-gett would prevail if he could show that the Government hadintentionally held back in its prosecution of him to gain someimpermissible advantage at trial. See Brief for UnitedStates 28, n. 21; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-34 (Feb. 24, 1992). Thatwe cannot doubt.Barker stressed that official bad faith incausing delay will be weighed heavily against the government, 407 U. S., at 531, and a bad-faith delay the length ofthis negligent one would present an overwhelming case fordismissal.Between diligent prosecution and bad-faith delay, officialnegligence in bringing an accused to trial occupies the mid505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT657Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)Opinion of the Courtdle ground. While not compelling relief in every case wherebad-faith delay would make relief virtually automatic, neither is negligence automatically tolerable simply because theaccused cannot demonstrate exactly how it has prejudicedhim. It was on this point that the Court of Appeals erred,and on the facts before us, it was reversible error.Barker made it clear that "different weights [are to be]assigned to different reasons" for delay. Ibid. Althoughnegligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than adeliberate intent to harm the accused's defense, it still fallson the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once ithas begun. And such is the nature of the prejudice presumed that the weight we assign to official negligence compounds over time as the presumption of evidentiary prejudice grows. Thus, our toleration of such negligence variesinversely with its protractedness, cf. Arizona v. Youngblood,488 U. S. 51 (1988), and its consequent threat to the fairnessof the accused's trial. Condoning prolonged and unjustifiable delays in prosecution would both penalize many defendants for the state's fault and simply encourage the government to gamble with the interests of criminal suspectsassigned a low prosecutorial priority. The Government, indeed, can hardly complain too loudly, for persistent neglect inconcluding a criminal prosecution indicates an uncommonlyfeeble interest in bringing an accused to justice; the moreweight the Government attaches to securing a conviction,the harder it will try to get it.To be sure, to warrant granting relief, negligence unaccompanied by particularized trial prejudice must have lastedlonger than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.But even so, the Government's egregious persistence in failing to prosecute Doggett is clearly sufficient. The lag between Doggett's indictment and arrest was 81/2 years, and hewould have faced trial 6 years earlier than he did but for theGovernment's inexcusable oversights. The portion of the505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT658 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATESO'Connor, J., dissentingdelay attributable to the Government's negligence far ex-ceeds the threshold needed to state a speedy trial claim;indeed, we have called shorter delays "extraordinary." SeeBarker, supra, at 533. When the Government's negligencethus causes delay six times as long as that generally suffi-cient to trigger judicial review, see n. 1,supra, and whenthe presumption of prejudice, albeit unspecified, is neitherextenuated,3 as by the defendant's acquiescence, e. g., 407U. S., at 534-536, nor persuasively rebutted,4 the defendantis entitled to relief. IVWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
