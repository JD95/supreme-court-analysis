one  motion  to  reopen  his  or  her  removal  proceedings.  See 8 U. S. C. $ 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  The statute also 

provides,  however,  that  if  the  alien's  request  for  voluntary departure is granted after he or she is found removable, the 
alien  is  required  to  depart  within  the  period  prescribed  by immigration  officials,  which  cannot  exceed  60  days.  See 

$ 1229c(b)(2)  (2000  ed.).  Failure  to  depart  within  the  pre-
scribed  period  renders  the  alien  ineligible  for  certain  forms of  relief,  including  adjustment  of  status,  for  a  period  of  10 

years.  $ 1229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Pursuant to regu-lation, however, departure has the effect of withdrawing the 
motion to reopen.  See 8 CFR $ 1003.2(d) (2007). 

Without some means, consistent with the Act, to reconcile 
the  two  commands--one  directing  voluntary  departure  and 
the other directing termination of the motion to reopen if an 
alien departs the United States--an alien who seeks reopen-
ing has two poor choices: The alien can remain in the United 
States  to  ensure  the  motion  to  reopen  remains  pending, 
while  incurring  statutory  penalties  for  overstaying  the  vol-
untary  departure  date;  or  the  alien  can  avoid  penalties  by 
prompt departure but abandon the motion to reopen. 

The  issue  is  whether  Congress  intended  the  statutory 
right  to  reopen  to  be  qualified  by  the  voluntary  departure 
process.  The alien, who  is petitioner  here, urges that  filing 
a  motion  to  reopen  tolls  the  voluntary  departure  period 
pending the motion's disposition.  We reject this interpreta-
tion  because  it  would  reconfigure  the  voluntary  departure 
scheme  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  the  statutory  design. 
We do not have the authority to interpret the statute as peti-
tioner  suggests.  Still,  the  conflict  between  the  right  to  file 
a  motion  to  reopen  and  the  provision  requiring  voluntary 
departure  no  later  than  60  days  remains  untenable  if  these 
are  the  only  two  choices  available  to  the  alien.  Absent  a 
valid  regulation  resolving  the  dilemma  in  a  different  way, 
we  conclude  the  alien  must  be  permitted  an  opportunity  to 
withdraw  the  motion  for  voluntary  departure,  provided  the

Opinion of the Court 
In  1996,  perhaps  in  response  to  criticism  of  immigration officials  who  had  expressed  frustration  that  aliens  granted 

voluntary  departure  were  "permitted  to  continue  their  ille-gal  presence  in  the  United  States  for  months,  and  even 
years,"  Letter  from  Benjamin  G.  Habberton,  Acting  Com-missioner on  Immigration and Naturalization,  to the  Execu-
tive Director of the  President's Commission on  Immigration 
and  Naturalization,  reprinted  in  Hearings  before  the  House Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  82d  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  1954 

(Comm.  Print  1952),  Congress  curtailed  the  period  of  time during which an alien may remain in the United States pend-
ing voluntary departure.  The Act, as pertinent to voluntary departures  requested  at  the  conclusion  of  removal  proceed-
ings, provides: 

"The Attorney General may permit an alien voluntar-
ily  to  depart  the  United  States  at  the  alien's  own  ex-pense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding under section 

1229a of this title, the immigration judge enters an order granting  voluntary  departure  in  lieu  of  removal  and 
finds that-- "(A)  the  alien  has  been  physically  present  in  the 
United  States  for  a  period  of  at  least  one  year  immedi-ately preceding the date the notice to appear was served 
under section 1229(a) of this title; 

"(B)  the alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the 

alien's application for voluntary departure; "(C)  the  alien  is  not  deportable  under  secti on 
1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)  or  section  1227(a)(4)  of  this  title;  and

36  FLORIDA  DEPT.  OF  REVENUE  v.  PICCADILLY 

CAFETERIAS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

the  Court  of  Appeals  upholding  the  exemption  for  Piccadil-ly's  asset  transfer.  Because  we  hold  that  $ 1146(a)'s  stamp-

tax exemption does not apply to transfers made before a plan is  confirmed  under  Chapter  11,  we  reverse  the  judgment 
below.  I 

Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Nation's most  successful  cafeteria  chains  until  it  began  experiencing 
financial difficulties in the last decade.  On October 29, 2003, Piccadilly  declared  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  11  of  the 
Bankruptcy  Code,  $ 1101  et  seq.  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  V),  and requested  court  authorization  to  sell  substantially  all  its 
assets  outside  the  ordinary  course  of  business  pursuant  to $ 363(b)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).  Piccadilly  prepared  to  sell 
its  assets  as  a  going  concern  and  sought  an  exemption  from any  stamp  taxes  on  the  eventual  transfer  under  $ 1146(a)  of 
the  Code.1  The  Bankruptcy  Court  conducted  an  auction  in which  the  winning  bidder  agreed  to  purchase  Piccadilly's 
assets for $80 million. On  January  26,  2004,  as  a  precondition  to  the  sale,  Picca-
dilly  entered  into  a  global  settlement  agreement  with  com-mittees  of  senior  secured  noteholders  and  unsecured  credi-
tors.  The  settlement  agreement  dictated  the  priority  of distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly's creditors. 
On  February  13,  2004,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  approved  the proposed  sale  and  settlement  agreement.  The  court  also 
ruled  that  the  transfer  of  assets  was  exempt  from  stamp taxes  under  $ 1146(a).  The  sale  closed  on  March  16,  2004. 

Piccadilly  filed  its  initial  Chapter  11  plan  in  the  Bank-ruptcy  Court  on  March  26,  2004,  and  filed  an  amended  plan 

1 When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax exemp-
tion  was  contained  in  $ 1146(c)  (2000  ed.).  In  2005,  Congress  repealed 
subsections  (a)  and  (b),  and  the  stamp-tax  exemption  was  recodified  as 

$ 1146(a).  See  Bankruptcy  Abuse  Prevention  and  Consumer  Protection 
Act  of  2005,  $ 719(b)(3),  119  Stat.  133.  For  simplicity,  we  will  cite  the 
provision as it is currently codified.

Opinion of the Court 
on July 31, 2004.2  The plan provided  for distribution of the sale  proceeds  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  settlement 

agreement.  Before  the  Bankruptcy  Court  confirmed  the plan,  Florida  filed  an  objection,  seeking  a  declaration  that 
the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of Pic-cadilly's  transferred  assets  fell  outside  $ 1146(a)'s  exemption 
because  the  transfer  had  not  been  "under  a  plan  confirmed" under  Chapter  11.  On  October  21,  2004,  the  bankruptcy 
court  confirmed  the  plan.  On  cross-motions  for  summary judgment  on  the  stamp-tax  issue,  the  Bankruptcy  Court 
granted summary  judgment in  favor of Piccadilly, reasoning that  the  sale  of  substantially  all  Piccadilly's  assets  was  a 
transfer  " `under' "  its  confirmed  plan  because  the  sale  was necessary to consummate the plan.  App. D to Pet. for Cert. 
40a-41a.  The  District  Court  upheld  the  decision  on  the ground  that  $ 1146(a),  in  certain  circumstances,  affords  a 
stamp-tax  exemption  even  when  a  transfer  occurs  prior  to confirmation.  In  re  Piccadilly  Cafeterias,  Inc.,  379  B.  R. 
215, 226 (SD Fla. 2006). The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eleventh  Circuit  affirmed, 
holding  that  "$ 1146[(a)]'s  tax  exemption  may  apply  to  those pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consum-
mation  of  a  confirmed  plan  of  reorganization,  which,  at  the 

2 Chapter  11  bankruptcy  proceedings  ordinarily  culminate  in  the  con-
firmation  of  a  reorganization  plan.  But  in  some  cases,  as  here,  a  debtor 
sells all or substantially all its assets under $ 363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) 
before  seeking  or  receiving  plan  confirmation.  In  this  scenario,  the 
debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquidation (rather than 
a  traditional  plan  of  reorganization)  providing  for  the  distribution  of  the 
proceeds resulting from the sale.  Here, Piccadilly filed a Chapter 11 liqui-
dation  plan  after  selling  substantially  all  its  assets  as  a  going  concern. 
Although the central purpose of Chapter 11 is to facilitate reorganizations 
rather than liquidations (covered generally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 ex-
pressly  contemplates  liquidations.  See  $ 1129(a)(11)  (2000  ed.)  ("Confir-
mation  of  the  plan  is  not  likely  to  be  followed  by  the  liquidation,  or  the 
need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to 
the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is pro-
posed in the plan").

CAFETERIAS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

very  least,  requires  that  there  be  some  nexus  between  the pre-confirmation  transfer  and  the  confirmed  plan."  In  re 

Piccadilly  Cafeterias,  Inc.,  484  F.  3d  1299,  1304  (2007)  (per curiam).  Finding  the  statutory  text ambiguous,  the  Court 
of  Appeals  concluded  that  $ 1146(a)  should  be  interpreted consistent with "the principle that a remedial statute such as 
the  Bankruptcy  Code  should  be  liberally  construed."  Ibid. The  court  further  noted  that  its  interpretation  of  $ 1146(a) 
better  accounted  for  "the  practical  realities  of  Chapter  11 reorganization cases" because a debtor may need to transfer 
assets  to  induce  relevant  parties  to  endorse  the  proposed confirmation  of  a  plan. 

Ibid.  The  Court  of  Appeals  ac-knowledged  that  its  holding  conflicted  with  the  approach 

taken  by  the  Courts  of  Appeals  for  the  Third  and  Fourth Circuits, 

id., at 1302, which have held that $ 1146(a) "does not apply to . . . transactions that occur prior to the confirmation 

of  a  plan  under  Chapter  11  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,"  In  re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., 335 F. 3d 243, 246 (CA3 2003); see 
also  In  re  NVR,  LP,  189  F.  3d  442,  458  (CA4  1999)  (holding that  $ 1146(a)  "appl[ies]  only  to  transfers  under  the  Plan  oc-
curring after the date of confirmation"). We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1074 (2007), to resolve the 
conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether $ 1146(a) applies to preconfirmation transfers. 

II 
Section 1146(a), entitled "Special tax provisions," provides: "The  issuance,  transfer,  or  exchange  of  a  security,  or  the 

making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, may not be taxed 
under  any  law  imposing  a  stamp  tax  or  similar  tax."  (Em-phasis added.)  Florida asserts that $ 1146(a) applies only to 
postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends that it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as they are made in accord-
ance  with  a  plan  that  is  eventually  confirmed.  Florida  and Piccadilly  base  their  competing  readings  of  $ 1146(a)  on  the

Opinion of the Court 
provision's text, on inferences drawn from other Code provi-sions,  and  on  substantive  canons  of  statutory  construction. 

We consider each of their arguments in turn. 

A 
Florida contends that $ 1146(a)'s text unambiguously limits stamp-tax  exemptions  to  postconfirmation  transfers  made 

under  the  authority  of  a  confirmed  plan.  It  observes  that the word "confirmed" modifies the word "plan" and is a past 
participle,  i. e.,  "[a]  verb  form  indicating  past  or  completed action  or  time  that  is  used  as  a  verbal  adjective  in  phrases 
such  as  baked  beans  and  finished  work."  American  Heri-tage Dictionary 1287 (4th ed. 2000).  Florida maintains that 
a  past  participle  indicates  past  or  completed  action  even when  it  is  placed  after  the  noun  it  modifies,  as  in  "beans 
baked  in  the  oven,"  or  "work  finished  after  midnight." Thus, it argues, the phrase "plan confirmed" denotes a "con-
firmed  plan"--meaning  one  that  has  been  confirmed  in  the past. 

Florida further  contends that the  word "under" in "under a plan confirmed" should be read to mean "with the authori-
zation  of "  or  "inferior  or  subordinate"  to  its  referent,  here the confirmed plan.  See 

Ardestani v.  INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (noting that a thing that is " `under' " a statute is most 

naturally read as being " `subject to' " or " `governed by' " the statute).  Florida  points  out  that,  in  the  other  two  appear-
ances  of  "under"  in  $ 1146(a),  it  clearly  means  "subject  to." Invoking  the  textual  canon  that  " `identical  words  used  in 
different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,' "  Commissioner  v.  Keystone  Consol.  Industries, 
Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993), Florida asserts the term must also  have  its  core  meaning  of  "subject  to"  in  the  phrase 
"under  a  plan  confirmed."  Florida  thus  reasons  that  to  be eligible for  $ 1146(a)'s exemption,  a transfer  must be subject 
to a plan  that has been confirmed subject to $ 1129 (2000 ed. and  Supp.  V).  Echoing  the  Fourth  Circuit's  reasoning  in

40  FLORIDA  DEPT.  OF  REVENUE  v.  PICCADILLY 

CAFETERIAS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

NVR,  supra,  at  457,  Florida  concludes  that  a  transfer  made 
prior  to  the  date  of  plan  confirmation  cannot  be  subject  to, 
or under the authority of, something that did not exist at the 
time of the transfer--a confirmed plan. 

Piccadilly  counters  that  the  statutory  language  does  not 
unambiguously impose a temporal requirement.  It contends 
that  "plan  confirmed"  is  not  necessarily  the  equivalent  of 
"confirmed plan," and that had Congress intended the latter, 
it would have used that language, as it did in a related Code 
provision.  See  $ 1142(b)  (referring  to  "any  instrument  re-
quired  to  effect  a  transfer  of  property  dealt  with  by  a  con-
firmed plan").  Piccadilly also argues that "under" is just as 
easily  read  to  mean  "in accordance  with."  It observes  that 
the  variability  of  the  term "under" is  well documented, not-
ing  that  the  American  Heritage  Dictionary  1395  (1976)  pro-
vides  15  definitions,  including  "[i]n  view  of,"  "because  of," 
"by  virtue  of,"  as  well  as  "[s]ubject  to  the  restraint . . . of."  
See  also  Ardestani,  supra,  at  135  (recognizing  that  "[t]he 
word `under' has many dictionary definitions and must draw 
its  meaning  from  its  context").  Although  "under"  appears 
several  times  in  $ 1146(a),  Piccadilly  maintains  there  is  no 
reason why a term of such common usage and variable mean-
ing  must  have  the  same  meaning  each  time  it  is  used,  even 
in the same sentence.  As an illustration, it points to $ 302(a) 
of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  which  states,  "The  commencement 
of  a  joint  case  under  a  chapter  of  this  title  constitutes  an 
order  for  relief  under  such  chapter."  Piccadilly  contends 
that this provision is best read as: "The commencement of a 
joint  case  subject  to  the  provisions  of  a  chapter  of  this  title 
constitutes  an  order  for  relief  in  such  chapter."  Piccadilly 
thus  concludes  that  the  statutory  text--standing  alone--is 
susceptible of more than one interpretation.  See Hechinger, 
supra,  at  253  ("[W]e  cannot  say  that  the  language  of 
[$ 1146(a)]  rules  out  the  possibility  that  `under  a  plan  con-
firmed' means `in agreement with a plan confirmed' ").

Opinion of the Court 
While both sides present credible interpretations of $ 1146(a),  Florida  has  the  better  one.  To  be  sure,  Congress 

could  have  used  more  precise  language--i. e.,  "under  a  plan that  has  been  confirmed"--and  thus  removed  all  ambiguity. 
But  the  two  readings  of  the  language  that  Congress  chose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida's is  clearly the 
more  natural.  The  interpretation  advanced  by  Piccadilly and  adopted  by  the  Eleventh  Circuit--that  there  must  be 
"some  nexus  between  the  pre-confirmation  transfer  and  the confirmed  plan"  for  $ 1146(a)  to  apply,  484  F.  3d,  at  1304-- 
places  greater  strain  on  the  statutory  text  than  the  simpler construction  advanced  by  Florida  and  adopted  by  the  Third 
and Fourth Circuits. Furthermore,  Piccadilly's  emphasis  on  the  distinction  be-
tween  "plan  confirmed"  and  "confirmed  plan"  is  unavailing because $ 1146(a) specifies  not  only  that a  tax-exempt  trans-
fer  be  "under  a  plan,"  but  also  that  the  plan  in  question  be confirmed pursuant to $ 1129.  Congress' placement of "plan 
confirmed" before "under section 1129" avoids the ambiguity that  would  have  arisen  had  it  used  the  term  "confirmed 
plan,"  which  could  easily  be  read  to  mean  that  the  transfer must  be  "under  section  1129"  rather  than  under  a  plan  that 
was itself confirmed under $ 1129. Although  we  agree  with  Florida  that  the  more  natural 
reading  of  $ 1146(a)  is  that  the  exemption  applies  only  to postconfirmation  transfers,  ultimately  we  need  not  decide 
whether  the  statute  is  unambiguous  on  its  face.  Even  as-suming,  arguendo,  that  the  language  of  $ 1146(a)  is  facially 
ambiguous,  the  ambiguity  must  be  resolved  in  Florida's favor.  We  reach  this  conclusion  after  considering  the  par-
ties' other arguments, to which we now turn.

Piccadilly  insists  that,  whatever  the  degree  of  ambiguity 
on  its  face,  $ 1146(a)  becomes  even  more  ambiguous  when

Opinion of the Court 

read  in  context  with  other  Bankruptcy  Code  provisions. Piccadilly  asserts  that  if  Congress  had  intended  $ 1146(a)  to 

apply  exclusively  to  transfers  occurring  after  confirmation, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal 
limitation similar to  those appearing  elsewhere in  the  Code. For  example,  $ 1127  governs  modifications  to  a  Chapter  11 
plan, providing that the proponent of a plan may modify the 
plan "at any time before confirmation," or, subject to certain restrictions,  "at  any  time  after  confirmation  of  such  plan." 

$$ 1127(a)-( b).  Similar  examples  abound.  See,  e. g., $ 1104(a) ("[a]t any time after the commencement of the case 
but  before  confirmation  of  a  plan  .  .  .  ");  $ 1104(c)  ("at  any 
time before the confirmation of a plan . . . ").  Piccadilly em-
phasizes that, "where Congress includes particular language 
in  one  section  of  a  statute  but  omits  it  in  another  section  of 
the  same  Act,  it  is  generally  presumed  that  Congress  acts 
intentionally  and purposely  in  the  disparate  inclusion  or  ex-
clusion."  Russello  v.  United  States,  464  U. S.  16,  23  (1983) 
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Because  Congress  did 
not impose a clear and commonly used temporal limitation in 

$ 1146(a),  Piccadilly  concludes  that  Congress  did  not  intend 
one to exist.  Piccadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing 
out  that  $ 1146(b)--the  subsection  immediately  following 

$ 1146(a)--includes an express temporal limitation.  See 

$ 1146(b)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V)  (providing  that  a  bankruptcy 
court may declare certain  tax consequences  after the date  a 
government  unit  responds  to  a  plan  proponent's  request  or 
"270  days  after  such  request,"  whichever  is  earlier).  But 
Congress included no such limitation in subsection (a). 

Piccadilly  also  relies  on  other  Code  provisions  to  bolster 
its  argument  that  the  term  "under"  preceding  "a  plan  con-
firmed" in $ 1146(a) should be read broadly--to mean "in ac-
cordance  with"  rather  than  the  narrower  "authorized  by." 
Apart  from  $ 302,  discussed  above,  Piccadilly  adverts  to 

$ 111,  which  states  that  an  agency  providing  credit  counsel-
ing  to  debtors  is  required  to  meet  "the  standards  set  forth

Opinion of the Court 
under this section."  $ 111(b)(4)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Pic-cadilly argues that this language requires the agency to meet 

"the standards set forth in this section," because reading the quoted language to mean "the standards set forth 

authorized 
by this section" would render the words "set forth" nonsensi-cal.  Piccadilly additionally refers to $ 303(a), which provides 

that  "[a]n  involuntary  case  may  be  commenced  only  under 
chapter 7  or 11 of this  title."  Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language means "an involuntary case may be commenced 

only in chapter 7 or 11 of this title."  It reasons that "under" in  $ 303(a)  cannot  mean  "authorized  by"  because  $ 303(a)  it-
self authorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chap-
ters  7  and  11  do  not.  Piccadilly  makes  a  similar  argument 
with respect to $ 343, which provides that "[t]he debtor shall 
appear  and  submit  to  examination  under  oath  at  the  meet-
ing  of  creditors."  Reading  "under"  to  mean  "authorized 
by"  would  make  little  sense  here.  On  the  basis  of  these 
examples,  Piccadilly  concludes  that  the  term  "under"  is 
ambiguous. 

Finally,  Piccadilly  maintains  that  "under"  in  $ 1146(a) 
should  be  construed  broadly  in  light  of  $ 365(g)(1)  of  the 
Bankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an execu-
tory  contract  or  unexpired  lease  constitutes  the  equivalent 
of a prebankruptcy breach "if such contract or lease has not 
been  assumed  under  this  section  or  under  a  plan  confirmed 
under chapter . . . 11."   In  Hechinger, the Third Circuit con-
cluded  that  substituting  "authorized  by"  for  "under"  in 

$ 1146(a) would be consistent with the use of the parallel lan-
guage in $ 365(g)(1).  335 F. 3d, at 254.  Piccadilly attempts 
to  refute  Hechinger's  reading  of  $ 365(g)(1),  asserting  that, 
because  authorization  for  the  assumption  of  a  lease  under  a 
plan  is  described  in  $ 1123(b)(2),  which  "circles  back  to  sec-
tion  365,"  such  authorization  cannot  be  "subject  to"  or  "au-
thorized by" Chapter 11.  Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis 
deleted);  see  11  U. S. C.  $ 1123(b)(2)  (providing  that  "a  plan 
may  .  .  .  subject  to  section  365  of  this  title,  provide  for  the

assumption,  rejection,  or  assignment  of  any  executory  con-tract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected 

under such  section").  The phrase  "under a  plan confirmed" in  $ 365(g)(1),  contends  Piccadilly,  is  thus  best  read  to  mean 
"in  accordance  with  a  plan  confirmed"  because  a  plan  may provide for the assumption of an executory contract or unex-
pired lease but not--unlike  $ 365--be the ultimate authority 
for  that  assumption.  As  a  result,  Piccadilly  concludes  that the  identical  language  of  $ 1146(a)  should  have  the  same 

meaning. Piccadilly  supports  this  point  with  its  assertion  that,  un-
like sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections are not permitted  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code.  See 

NLRB  v.  Bil-
disco  &  Bildisco,  465  U. S.  513,  529  (1984)  (stating  that  in "a  Chapter  11  reorganization,  a  debtor-in-possession  has 

until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract").  Because, as Picca-
dilly  contends,  the  phrase  "under  a  plan  confirmed  under 
chapter . . .  11" in $ 365(g)(1)  cannot refer  to assumptions or rejections  occurring  after  confirmation,  it  would  be  anoma-

lous  to  read  the  identical  phrase  in  $ 1146(a)  to  cover  only postconfirmation transfers. 

For  its  part,  Florida  argues  that  the  statutory  context  of 

$ 1146(a) supports its position that the  stamp-tax exemption 
applies  exclusively  to  postconfirmation  transfers.  It  ob-
serves that the subchapter in which $ 1146(a) appears is enti-
tled,  "POSTCONFIRMATION  MATTERS."  Florida  con-
tends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a provision 
in  a particular subchapter  suggests that  its terms should be 
interpreted  consistent  with  that  subchapter.  See  Davis  v. 
Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989) ("It is 
a  fundamental  canon  of  statutory  construction  that  the 
words  of  a  statute  must  be  read  in  their  context  and  with  a 
view  to  their  place  in  the  overall  statutory  scheme").  In 
addition, Florida dismisses Piccadilly's references to the tem-
poral limitations in other Code provisions on the ground that 
it would have been superfluous for Congress to add any fur-

Opinion of the Court 
ther  limitations  to  $ 1146(a)'s  already  unambiguous  tempo-ral element. 

Even on the assumption that the text of $ 1146(a) is ambig-uous,  we  are  not  persuaded  by  Piccadilly's  contextual  argu-
ments.  As noted above, Congress could have used language that  made  $ 1146(a)'s  temporal  element  clear  beyond  ques-
tion.  Unlike  $ 1146(a),  however,  the  temporal  language 
examples  quoted  by  Piccadilly  are  indispensable  to  the  op-erative  meaning  of  the  provisions  in  which  they  appear. 

Piccadilly's  reliance  on  $ 1127,  for  example,  is  misplaced  be-cause  that  section  explicitly  differentiates  between  precon-
firmation  modifications,  see  $ 1127(a),  and  postconfirmation modifications,  which  are  permissible  "only  if  circumstances 
warrant"  them, $ 1127(b).  It  was unnecessary  for  Congress to  include  in  $ 1146(a)  a  phrase  such  as  "at  any  time  after 
confirmation of such  plan" because  the phrase "under a plan 
confirmed" is  most  naturally read  to require that  there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer. 

Even  if  we  were  to  adopt  Piccadilly's  broad  definition  of 
"under,"  its  interpretation  of  the  statute  faces  other  obsta-
cles.  The  asset  transfer  here  can  hardly  be  said  to  have been consummated  "in accordance  with"  any confirmed plan 

because,  as  of  the  closing  date,  Piccadilly  had  not  even  sub-
mitted  its  plan  to  the  Bankruptcy  Court  for  confirmation. 
Piccadilly's asset sale was thus not conducted "in accordance 
with" any plan confirmed under Chapter 11.  Rather, it was 
conducted  "in  accordance  with"  the  procedures  set  forth  in 
Chapter  3--specifically,  $ 363(b)(1).  To  read  the  statute  as 
Piccadilly  proposes  would  make  $ 1146(a)'s  exemption  turn 
on  whether  a  debtor-in-possession's  actions  are  consistent 
with a legal instrument that does not exist--and indeed may 
not  even  be  conceived  of--at  the  time  of  the  sale.  Reading 

$ 1146(a) in  context  with  other relevant  Code provisions,  we 
find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what 
is a straightforward exemption. 

Nor  does  anything  in  $ 365(g)(1)  recommend  Piccadilly's 
reading of $ 1146(a).  Section 365(g) generally allows a

Opinion of the Court 

trustee  to  reject  "an  executory  contract  or  unexpired  lease of  the  debtor,"  i. e.,  to  reject  a  contract  that  is  unfavorable 

to the estate, subject to court approval.  As the text makes clear,  such  approval  may  occur  either  under  "this  section," 

$ 365(g)--i. e.,  "at  any  time  before  the  confirmation  of  a plan," $ 365(d)(2)--or "under a plan confirmed under chapter 
9, 11, 12, or 13," $ 365(g)(1).  Piccadilly relies heavily on Bil-
disco,  supra,  in  which  this  Court  held  that  $ 365  permits  a debtor-in-possession  to  reject  a  collective-bargaining  agree-

ment like any other executory contract, and that doing  so is not  an  unfair  labor  practice under  the  National  Labor  Rela-
tions  Act.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  the  Court  observed that "a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is 
confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract."  465 U. S., at 529 (emphasis added). 

We  agree  with  Bildisco's  commonsense  observation  that the  decision  whether  to  reject  a  contract  or  lease  must  be 
made  before  confirmation.  But  that  in  no  way  undermines the  fact  that  the  rejection  takes 

effect  upon  or  after  confir-mation of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if pur-

suant to $ 365(d)(2)).  In the context of $ 1146(a), the decision whether  to  transfer  a  given  asset  "under  a  plan  confirmed" 
must be made prior to submitting the Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy  court,  but  the  transfer  itself  cannot  be  "under  a 
plan confirmed" until the court confirms the plan in question. Only  at  that  point  does  the  transfer  become  eligible  for  the 
stamp-tax exemption.3 

3 Also  meritless  is  Piccadilly's  argument  that  "under"  in  the  phrase 
"under  a  plan  confirmed  under  chapter  .  .  .  11"  in  $ 365(g)(1)  cannot  be 
read to mean "subject to" because $ 1123(b)(2), in Piccadilly's words, "cir-
cles  back  to  section  365."  Brief  for  Respondent  39  (emphasis  deleted). 
Section 1123(b)(2) authorizes a  plan to provide  for the assumption,  rejec-
tion,  or  assignment  of  an  executory  contract  or  unexpired  lease,  but  re-
quires that the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various require-
ments  set  forth  throughout  $ 365.  By  contrast,  the  phrase  "under  this 
section"  in  $ 365(g)(1)  serves  as  a  reference  to  $ 365(d)(2),  which  permits 
preconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order (and 
not, as in $ 1123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).

Opinion of the Court 
If  the  statutory  context  suggests  anything,  it  is  that $ 1146(a)  is  inapplicable  to  preconfirmation  transfers.  We 

find  it  informative  that  Congress  placed  $ 1146(a)  in  a  sub-chapter entitled, "POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS. " 
To  be  sure,  a  subchapter  heading  cannot  substitute  for  the operative text of the statute.  See, 

e. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of  Corrections  v.  Yeskey,  524  U. S.  206,  212  (1998)  (" `[T]he 

title  of  a  statute . . .  cannot  limit  the  plain  meaning  of  the text' ").  Nonetheless,  statutory  titles  and  section  headings 
" `are  tools  available  for  the  resolution  of  a  doubt  about  the meaning of a statute.' "  Porter v.  Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 528 
(2002).  The  placement  of  $ 1146(a)  within  a  subchapter  ex-pressly limited to postconfirmation matters undermines Pic-
cadilly's view that $ 1146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers. But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly's textual and 
contextual arguments, they would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous.  They do not--and largely 
are  not  intended  to--demonstrate  that  $ 1146(a)'s  purported ambiguity  should  be  resolved  in  Piccadilly's  favor.  Florida 
argues  that  various  nontextual  canons  of  construction  re-quire  us  to  resolve  any  ambiguity  in  its  favor.  Piccadilly 
responds  with  substantive  canons  of  its  own.  It  is  to  these dueling canons of construction that we now turn. 

C 
Florida contends that even if the statutory text is deemed ambiguous,  applicable  substantive  canons  compel  its  inter-

pretation  of  $ 1146(a).  Florida  first  invokes  the  canon  that "Congress  is  presumed  to  be  aware  of  an  administrative  or 
judicial  interpretation  of  a  statute  and  to  adopt  that  in-terpretation  when  it  re-enacts  a  statute  without  change." 
Lorillard  v.  Pons,  434  U. S.  575,  580-581  (1978).  Florida observes  that  the  relevant  language  of  $ 1146(a)  relating  to 
"under a plan confirmed" has remained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  The most 
recent  revision  in  2005  occurred  after  the  Fourth  Circuit's decision  in  NVR  and  the  Third  Circuit's  decision  in  Hech-

inger  but  before  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  decision  below. Florida  asserts  that  Congress  ratified  this  longstanding  in-

terpretation  when,  in  its  most  recent  amendments  to  the Code,  it  "readopted"  the  stamp-tax  provision  verbatim  as 

$ 1146(a).  Brief for Petitioner 26. Florida  also  invokes  the  substantive  canon--on  which  the 
Third Circuit relied in Hechinger--that courts should " `pro-
ceed  carefully  when  asked  to  recognize  an  exemption  from state  taxation  that  Congress  has  not  clearly  expressed.' " 

335 F. 3d, at 254  (quoting California State Bd. of Equaliza-
tion  v.  Sierra  Summit,  Inc.,  490  U. S.  844,  851-852  (1989)). 
In  light  of  this  directive,  Florida  contends  that  $ 1146(a)'s 
language must be construed strictly in favor of the States to 
prevent  unwarranted  displacement  of  their  tax  laws.  See 
National  Private  Truck  Council,  Inc.  v.  Oklahoma  Tax 
Comm'n,  515  U. S.  582,  590  (1995)  (discussing  principles  of 
comity  in  taxation  and  the  "federal  reluctance  to  interfere 
with state taxation" given the "strong background presump-
tion against interference"). 

Furthermore,  Florida  notes  that  the  canon  also  discour-
ages federal interference with the administration of a State's 
taxation  scheme.  See  id.,  at  586,  590.  Florida  contends 
that  the  Court  of  Appeals'  extension  of  $ 1146(a)  to  precon-
firmation  transfers  directly  interferes  with  the  administra-
tion of the State's stamp tax, which is imposed "prior to rec-
ordation" of the instrument of transfer.  Fla. Stat. $$ 201.01, 
201.02(1) (2006).  Extending the exemption to transfers that 
occurred months or years before a confirmable plan even ex-
isted, Florida explains, may require the States to " `unravel' " 
stamp taxes already collected.  Brief for Petitioner 31.  Al-
ternatively,  should  a  court  grant  an  exemption  under 

$ 1146(a)  before  confirmation,  States  would  be  saddled  with 
the  task  of  monitoring  whether  the  plan  is  ever  eventually 
confirmed. 

In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism princi-
ple  articulated  in  Sierra  Summit,  supra,  at  852,  does  not

Opinion of the Court 
apply  where  there  is  a  "clear  expression  of  an  exemption from  state  taxation"  overriding  a  State's  authority  to  tax. 

In  Piccadilly's  view,  that  is  precisely  the  case  with  regard to  $ 1146(a),  which  proscribes  the  imposition  of  stamp  taxes 
and  demonstrates  Congress'  intent  to  exempt  a  category  of state taxation. 

Piccadilly  further  maintains  that  Florida's  stamp  tax  is nothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an admin-
istrative  expense,  which  is  paid  as  a  priority  claim  ahead  of 
the prepetition claims of most creditors.  Equating Florida's receipt of tax revenue with a preference in favor of a particu-

lar claimant, Piccadilly argues that $ 1146(a)'s ambiguous ex-
emption should not be construed to diminish other claimants' 
recoveries.  See  Howard  Delivery  Service,  Inc.  v.  Zurich 
American  Ins.  Co.,  547  U. S.  651,  667  (2006)  (emphasizing 
that  "provisions  allowing  preferences  must  be  tightly  con-
strued").  Reading  the  stamp-tax  exemption  too  narrowly, 
Piccadilly  maintains,  " `is  not  only  inconsistent  with  the  pol-
icy  of  equality  of  distribution' "  but  also  " `dilutes  the  value 
of the priority for those creditors Congress intended to pre-
fer' "--those with  prepetition  claims.  Brief for  Respondent 
54 (quoting Howard Delivery Serv., supra, at 667). 

Above  all,  Piccadilly  urges  us  to  adopt  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals'  maxim  that  "a  remedial  statute  such  as  the  Bank-
ruptcy  Code  should  be  liberally  construed."  484  F.  3d,  at 
1304; cf. Isbrandtsen Co. v.  Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 782 (1952). 
In  Piccadilly's  view,  any  ambiguity  in  the  statutory  text  is 
overshadowed by $ 1146(a)'s obvious purpose: to facilitate the 
Chapter  11  process  "through  giving  tax  relief."  In  re 
Jacoby-Bender,  Inc.,  758  F.  2d  840,  841  (CA2  1985).  Picca-
dilly characterizes the tax on asset transfers at issue here as 
tantamount  to  a  levy  on  the  bankruptcy  process  itself.  A 
stamp tax like Florida's makes the sale of a debtor's property 
more  expensive  and  reduces  the  total  proceeds  available  to 
satisfy  the  creditors'  claims,  contrary  to  Congress'  clear  in-
tent in enacting $ 1146(a).

Opinion of the Court 

What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why "Congress would have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential to a plan 

that  occurs  two  minutes  before  confirmation  may  be  taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds after may not." 
Brief for Respondent 43.  After all, interpreting $ 1146(a) in the  manner  Florida  proposes  would  lead  precisely  to  that 
result.  And  that,  Piccadilly  asserts,  is  "absurd"  in  light  of 

$ 1146(a)'s policy aim--evidenced by the provision's  text and legislative  history--of  reducing  the  cost  of  asset  transfers. 

In  that  vein,  Piccadilly  contends  that  interpreting  $ 1146(a) to  apply  solely  to  postconfirmation  transfers  would  under-
mine Chapter  11's twin  objectives  of "preserving  going con-
cerns  and  maximizing  property  available  to  satisfy  credi-
tors."  Bank  of  America  Nat.  Trust  and  Sav.  Assn.  v.  203 
North  LaSalle  Street  Partnership,  526  U. S.  434,  453  (1999). 
In  order  to  obtain  the  maximum  value  for  its  assets--espe-
cially  assets  rapidly  declining  in  value--Piccadilly  claims 
that a  debtor  often  must close  the  sale  before  formal confir-
mation of the Chapter 11 plan. 

We  agree  with  Florida  that  the  federalism  canon  articu-
lated in Sierra Summit and elsewhere obliges us to construe 

$ 1146(a)'s  exemption  narrowly.  Piccadilly's  effort  to  evade 
the  canon  falls  well  short  of  the  mark  because  reading 

$ 1146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would require us 
to do exactly what the canon counsels against.  If we recog-
nized  an  exemption  for  preconfirmation  transfers,  we  would 
in effect be " `recogniz[ing] an exemption from state taxation 
that  Congress  has  not  clearly  expressed' "--namely,  an  ex-
emption  for  preconfirmation  transfers.  Sierra  Summit, 
supra, at 851-852 (emphasis added); see also Swarts v.  Ham-
mer,  194  U. S.  441,  444  (1904)  (reasoning  that  if  Congress 
endeavored to exempt a debtor from state and local taxation, 
"the intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be col-
lected  or  inferred  from  disputable  considerations  of  conven-
ience in administering the estate of the bankrupt").  Indeed, 
Piccadilly  proves  precisely  this  point  by  resting  its  entire

Opinion of the Court 
case on  the  premise  that  Congress  has  expressed  its stamp-tax  exemption  in  ambiguous  language.  Therefore,  far  from 

being inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case. The  canons  on  which  Piccadilly  relies  are  inapposite. 
While  we  agree  with  Piccadilly  that  "provisions  allowing preferences must be tightly construed, " 

Howard  Deliv-
ery  Serv.,  supra,  at  667,  $ 1146(a)  is  not  a  preference-
granting  provision.  The  statutory  text  makes  no  mention of preferences. 

Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should construe $ 1146(a)  "liberally"  to  serve  its  ostensibly  "remedial"  pur-
pose.  Based  on  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  declaration  that  the 
Bankruptcy  Code  is  a  "remedial  statute,"  Piccadilly  would 
stretch the disallowance well beyond what the statutory text 
can naturally bear.  Apart from the opinion below, however, 
the  only  authority  Piccadilly  offers  is  a  1952  decision  of this 
Court interpreting the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872. 
See  Brief  for  Respondent  54  (citing  Isbrandtsen,  supra,  at 
782).  But  unlike  the  statutory  scheme  in  Isbrandtsen, 
which  was  " `designed  to  secure  the  comfort  and  health  of 
seamen  aboard  ship,  hospitalization  at  home  and  care 
abroad,' " 343 U. S., at 784  (quoting Aguilar v.  Standard Oil 
Co. of N.  J.,  318  U. S.  724,  728-729  (1943)),  the  Bankruptcy 
Code--and Chapter 11 in  particular--is not  a remedial  stat-
ute  in  that  sense.  To  the  contrary,  this  Court  has  rejected 
the  notion  that  "Congress  had  a  single  purpose  in  enacting 
Chapter  11."  Toibb  v.  Radloff,  501  U. S.  157,  163  (1991). 
Rather,  Chapter  11  strikes  a balance  between  a  debtor's  in-
terest  in  reorganizing  and  restructuring  its  debts  and  the 
creditors' interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy 
estate.  Ibid.  The Code also accommodates the interests of 
the  States  in  regulating  property  transfers  by  " `generally 
[leaving]  the  determination  of  property  rights  in  the  assets 
of a bankrupt's estate to state law.' "  Travelers Casualty & 
Surety  Co.  of  America  v.  Pacific  Gas  &  Elec.  Co.,  549  U. S.

Opinion of the Court 

and  in  this  case,  they  clearly  do  not.  We  therefore  decline to construe  the  exemption granted  by $ 1146(a) to the  detri-

ment of the State. As for Piccadilly's assertion that reading $ 1146(a) to allow 
preconfirmation  transfers  to  be  taxed  while  exempting  oth-ers  moments  later  would  amount  to  an  "absurd"  policy,  we 
reiterate  that " `it  is  not  for  us  to substitute  our  view of  . .  . policy  for  the  legislation  which  has  been  passed  by  Con-
gress.' "  Hechinger,  335  F.  3d,  at  256.  That  said,  we  see no  absurdity  in  reading  $ 1146(a)  as  setting  forth  a  simple, 
bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-fact inquiry Piccadilly  envisions.  At  bottom,  we  agree  with  the  Fourth 
Circuit's summation of $ 1146(a): 

"Congress  struck  a  most  reasonable  balance.  If  a debtor  is  able  to  develop  a  Chapter  11  reorganization 

and  obtain  confirmation,  then  the  debtor  is  to  be  af-forded  relief  from  certain  taxation  to  facilitate  the 
implementation  of  the  reorganization  plan.  Before  a debtor  reaches  this  point,  however,  the  state  and  local 
tax  systems  may  not  be  subjected  to  federal  interfer-ence." 

NVR, 189 F. 3d, at 458. 

Lastly, to the extent the "practical realities" of Chapter 11 reorganizations  are  increasingly  rendering  postconfirmation 

transfers  a  thing  of  the  past,  see  484  F.  3d,  at  1304,  it  is incumbent  upon  the  Legislature,  and  not  the  Judiciary,  to 
determine whether $ 1146(a) is in need of revision.  See, e. g., Ali  v.  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons,  552  U. S.  214,  228  (2008) 
("We  are  not  at  liberty  to  rewrite  the  statute  to  reflect  a meaning we deem more desirable"). 

III 
The most natural reading of $ 1146(a)'s text, the provision's placement  within  the  Code,  and  applicable  substantive  can-

ons all lead to the same conclusion: Section 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax  exemption  only  to  transfers  made  pursuant  to  a

Opinion of the Court 
"It  is  the  policy  of  the  state  not  to  interfere  with  an employee's  choice  about  whether  to  join  or  to  be  repre-

sented  by  a  labor  union.  For  this  reason,  the  state should  not  subsidize  efforts  by  an  employer  to  assist, 
promote,  or  deter  union  organizing.  It  is  the  intent  of the  Legislature  in  enacting  this  act  to  prohibit  an  em-
ployer  from  using  state  funds  and  facilities  for  the  pur-pose  of  influencing  employees  to  support  or  oppose 
unionization  and  to  prohibit  an  employer  from  seeking to influence employees to support or oppose unionization 
while  those  employees  are  performing  work  on  a  state contract."  2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, $ 1. 

AB  1889  prohibits  certain  employers  that  receive  state funds--whether  by  reimbursement,  grant,  contract,  use  of 
state  property,  or  pursuant  to  a  state  program--from  using such  funds  to  "assist,  promote,  or  deter  union  organizing." 
See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $$ 16645.1 to 16645.7.  This prohi-bition encompasses "any attempt by an employer to influence 
the  decision  of  its  employees"  regarding  "[w]hether  to  sup-port  or  oppose  a  labor  organization"  and  "[w]hether  to  be-
come a member of any labor organization."  $ 16645(a).  The statute specifies that the spending restriction applies to "any 
expense,  including  legal  and  consulting  fees  and  salaries  of supervisors  and  employees,  incurred  for  . . . an activity  to  
assist, promote, or deter union organizing."  $ 16646(a). Despite  the  neutral statement of policy  quoted above, AB 
1889  expressly  exempts  "activit[ies]  performed"  or  "ex-pense[s]  incurred"  in  connection  with  certain  undertakings 
that  promote  unionization,  including  "[a]llowing  a  labor  or-ganization  or  its  representatives  access  to  the  employer's 
facilities  or  property,"  and  "[n]egotiating,  entering  into,  or carrying out a voluntary recognition agreement with a labor 
organization."  $$ 16647(b), (d). To ensure compliance with the grant and program restric-
tions  at  issue  in  this  case,  AB  1889  establishes a  formidable enforcement  scheme.  Covered  employers  must  certify  that 
no  state  funds  will  be  used  for  prohibited  expenditures;  the

of  service  typically  go  hand  in  hand  with  age,  the  two  concepts  are 
"analytically  distinct,"  id.,  at  611.  And the  dismissal  at  issue  there,  if 
based purely on  pension status, would not embody the evils prompting 
the ADEA: It was not based on a "prohibited stereotype" of older work-
ers, did not produce any "attendant stigma" to those workers, and was 
not  "the  result  of  an  inaccurate  and  denigrating  generalization  about 
age."  Id., at 612.  However, the Court noted that discrimination based 
on pension status could violate the ADEA if pension status was a "proxy 
for age."  Id., at 613.  Pp. 141-143. 

(b)  Applying  Hazen  Paper,  the  circumstances  here,  taken  together, 
show that the differences  in treatment in this particular instance were 
not  "actually  motivated"  by  age.  (1)  Age  and  pension  status  remain 
"analytically  distinct"  concepts.  (2)  Here,  several  background  circum-
stances eliminate the possibility that pension status serves as a "proxy 
for age."  Rather than an individual employment decision, at issue here 
are  complex  systemwide  rules  involving  not  wages,  but  pensions--a 
benefit  the  ADEA  treats  somewhat  more  flexibly  and  leniently  in  re-
spect  to  age.  Further,  Congress  has  otherwise  approved  programs, 
such  as  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance,  that  calculate  disability 
benefits  using  a  formula  that  expressly  takes  account  of  age.  (3)  The 
disparity here has a clear non-age-related rationale.  The Plan's disabil-
ity rules track Kentucky's "normal retirement" rules by imputing only 
those additional years of service needed to bring the disabled worker's 
total  to  20  or  to  the  number  of  years  that  the  individual  would  have 
worked had he worked to age 55.  Thus, the disability rules' purpose is 
to  treat  a  disabled  worker  as  though  he  had  become  disabled  after, 
rather than before, he had become eligible for "normal retirement" ben-
efits.  Age  factors  into  the  disability  calculation  only  because  the  nor-
mal  retirement  rules  themselves  permissibly  consider  age.  The  Plan 
simply seeks to treat disabled employees as if they had worked until the 
point at which they would  be eligible for a normal pension.  Thus, the 
disparity turns upon pension eligibility and nothing more.  (4) Although 
the Plan placed an older worker at a disadvantage here, in other cases, 
the  rules  can  work  to  the  advantage  of  older  workers,  who  may  get  a 
bigger  boost  of  imputed  years  than  younger  workers.  (5)  Kentucky's 
system does not rely on the sorts of stereotypical assumptions, e. g., the 
work  capacity  of  "older"  workers  relative  to  "younger"  workers,  that 
the ADEA  sought to  eradicate.  The Plan's  "assumptions"  that no dis-
abled worker would have continued to work beyond the point at which 
he  was  both  disabled  and  pension  eligible  do  not  involve  age-related 
stereotypes, but apply equally to all workers regardless of age.  (6) The 
nature  of  the  Plan's  eligibility  requirements  means  that,  unless  Ken-

Opinion of the Court 

I 
A 
Kentucky has put in place a special retirement plan (Plan) for state and county employees who occupy "[h]azardous po-

sition[s],"  e. g.,  active  duty  law  enforcement  officers,  fire-fighters,  paramedics,  and  workers  in  correctional  systems. 
See  Ky.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 61.592(1)(a)  (Lexis  Supp.  2003). The  Plan  sets  forth  two  routes  through  which  such  an  em-
ployee can become eligible for what is called "normal retire-ment" benefits.  The first makes an employee eligible for re-
tirement  after  20  years  of  service.  The  second  makes  an employee eligible after only 5 years of service provided that 
the  employee  has  attained  the  age  of  55.  See  $$ 16.576, 16.577(2),  61.592(4).  An  employee  eligible  under  either 
route will receive a pension calculated in the same way: Ken-tucky multiplies years of service times 2.5%  times final pre-
retirement pay.  See $ 16.576(3). Kentucky's Plan has special provisions for hazardous posi-
tion  workers  who  become  disabled  but  are  not  yet  eligible for  normal  retirement.  Where  such  an  employee  has 
worked for five years or became disabled in the line of duty, the  employee  can  retire  at  once.  See  $$ 16.576(1),  16.582(2) 
(Lexis  2003).  In  calculating  that  employee's  benefits  Ken-tucky will add  a  certain  number of ("imputed")  years  to the 
employee's actual years of service.  The number of imputed years equals the number of years that the disabled employee 
would have had to continue working in order to become eligi-ble  for  normal  retirement  benefits, 

i. e.,  the  years  necessary to bring the employee up to 20 years of service or to at least 

5 years of service when the employee would turn 55 (which-ever  number  of  years  is  lower).  See  $ 16.582(5)(a)  (Lexis 
2003).  Thus,  if  an  employee  with  17  years  of  service  be-comes  disabled  at  age  48,  the  Plan  adds  3  years  and  calcu-
lates the benefits as if the employee had completed 20 years of service.  If an employee with 17 years of service becomes

Opinion of the Court 
disabled  at  age  54,  the  Plan  adds  1  year  and  calculates  the benefits  as  if  the  employee  had  retired  at  age  55  with  18 

years of service. The Plan also imposes a ceiling on imputed years equal to 
the  number  of  years  the  employee  has  previously  worked (i. e., an employee who has worked eight years cannot receive 
more than eight additional imputed years), see $ 16.582(5)(a); it  provides  for  a  certain  minimum  payment,  see  $ 16.582(6) 
(Lexis  2003);  and  it  contains  various  other  details,  none  of which is challenged here.

Charles  Lickteig,  a  hazardous  position  worker  in  the  Jef-ferson  County  Sheriff 's  Department,  became  eligible  for  re-

tirement at age 55, continued to work, became  disabled, and then retired at age 61.  The Plan calculated his annual pen-
sion  on  the  basis  of  his  actual  years  of  service  (18  years) times  2.5%  times  his  final  annual  pay.  Because  Lickteig 
became  disabled  after  he  had  already  become  eligible  for normal  retirement  benefits,  the  Plan  did  not  impute  any 
additional years for purposes of the calculation. Lickteig  complained  of  age  discrimination  to  the  Equal 
Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC);  and  the EEOC  then  brought  this  age  discrimination  lawsuit  against 
the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,  Kentucky's  Plan  adminis-trator,  and  other  state  entities  (to  whom  we  shall  refer  col-
lectively  as  "Kentucky").  The  EEOC  pointed  out  that,  if Lickteig  had  become  disabled  before  he  reached  the  age  of 
55,  the  Plan,  in  calculating  Lickteig 's  benefits,  would  have imputed  a  number  of  additional  years.  And  the  EEOC  ar-
gued  that  the  Plan  failed  to  impute  years  solely  because Lickteig became disabled after he reached age 55. 

The  District  Court,  making  all  appropriate  evidence-related assumptions in the EEOC's favor, see Fed. Rule Civ. 
Proc.  56,  held  that  the  EEOC  could  not  establish  age  dis-crimination;  and  it  granted  summary  judgment  in  the  de-
fendants'  favor.  A  panel  of  the  Sixth  Circuit  affirmed  that

The  ADEA  forbids  an  employer  to  "fail  or  refuse  to  hire or  to  discharge  any  individual  or  otherwise  discriminate 

against  any  individual  with  respect  to  his  compensation, terms,  conditions,  or  privileges  of  employment, 

because  of 
such  individual's  age."  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(a)(1)  (emphasis added).  In Hazen Paper Co. v.  Biggins, 507 U. S. 604 (1993), 

the  Court  explained  that  where,  as  here,  a  plaintiff  claims age-related "disparate treatment" (i. e., intentional discrimi-
nation "because of . . . age") the plaintiff must prove that age "actually  motivated  the  employer's  decision."  Id.,  at  610 
(emphasis  added);  see  also  Reeves  v.  Sanderson  Plumbing 
Products,  Inc.,  530  U. S.  133,  141  (2000).  The  Court  noted that  "[t]he employer  may  have relied  upon  a formal,  facially 

discriminatory  policy  requiring  adverse  treatment"  because of  age,  or  "the  employer  may  have  been  motivated  by  [age] 
on  an  ad  hoc,  informal  basis."  Hazen  Paper,  507  U. S.,  at

610.  But  "[w]hatever  the  employer's  decisionmaking  proc-ess," a  plaintiff alleging disparate  treatment cannot succeed 

unless  the  employee's  age  "actually  played  a  role  in  that 
process and had a determinative influence on the outcome." 
Ibid.  (emphasis  added).  Cf.  Smith  v.  City  of  Jackson,  544 U. S.  228,  239-240  (2005)  (plurality  opinion)  (describing 

"disparate-impact"  theory,  not  here  at  issue,  which  focuses 
upon unjustified discriminatory results). In 

Hazen  Paper,  the  Court  considered  a  disparate-
treatment  claim  that  an  employer  had  unlawfully  dismissed a  62-year-old  employee  with  over  9

1/2  years  of  service  in 

order  to  avoid  paying  pension  benefits  that  would  have 
vested  after  10  years.  The  Court  held  that,  without  more 
evidence  of  intent,  the  ADEA  would  not  forbid  dismissal  of 
the  claim.  A  dismissal  based  on  pension  status  was  not  a 
dismissal  "because  of . . . age."   507  U.  S.,  at  611-612.  Of 
course,  pension  status  depended  upon  years  of  service,  and 
years of service  typically go hand in hand  with  age.  Id.,  at 
611.  But  the  two  concepts  were  nonetheless  "analytically 
distinct."  Ibid.  An employer could easily "take account of 
one  while  ignoring  the  other."  Ibid.  And  the  dismissal  in 
question,  if  based  purely  upon  pension  status  (related  to 
years  of  service),  would  not  embody  the  evils  that  led  Con-
gress  to  enact  the  ADEA  in  the  first  place:  The  dismissal 
was not based on a "prohibited stereotype" of older workers, 
did  not  produce  any  "attendant  stigma"  to  those  workers, 
and was not "the result of an inaccurate and denigrating gen-
eralization about age."  Id., at 612. 

At the same time, Hazen Paper indicated that discrimina-
tion on the basis of pension status could sometimes be unlaw-
ful  under  the  ADEA,  in  particular  where  pension  status 
served  as  a  "proxy  for  age."  Id.,  at  613.  Suppose,  for  ex-
ample,  an  employer  "target[ed]  employees  with  a  particular 
pension  status  on  the  assumption  that  these  employees  are 
likely  to  be  older."  Id.,  at 612-613.  In  such  a  case,  Hazen 
Paper  suggested,  age,  not  pension  status,  would  have  "ac-

Opinion of the Court 
tually motivated" the  employer's  decisionmaking.  Hazen Paper  also left  open  "the  special case  where  an  employee  is 

about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his age, rather than  years  of  service."  Id.,  at  613.  We  here  consider  a 
variation on this "special case" theme. 

III 
Kentucky's  Plan  turns  normal  pension  eligibility  either upon  the  employee's  having  attained  20  years  of  service 

alone  or  upon  the  employee's  having  attained  5  years  of service  and  reached  the  age  of  55.  The  ADEA  permits  an 
employer  to  condition  pension  eligibility  upon  age.  See 29  U. S. C.  $ 623(l)(1)(A)(i)  (2006  ed.).  Thus  we  must  de-
cide  whether  a  plan  that  (1)  lawfully  makes  age  in  part  a condition of pension eligibility, and (2) treats workers differ-
ently  in  light  of  their  pension  status,  (3)  automatically  dis-criminates  because  of  age.  The  Government  argues  "yes." 
But, following Hazen Paper's approach, we come to a differ-ent  conclusion.  In  particular,  the  following  circumstances, 
taken  together,  convince  us  that,  in  this  particular  instance, differences in treatment were not "actually motivated" 
by age. First,  as  a  matter  of  pure  logic,  age  and  pension  status 
remain  "analytically  distinct"  concepts.  Hazen  Paper,  507 U. S., at 611.  That is to say, one can easily conceive of deci-
sions that are actually made "because of " pension status and not  age,  even  where  pension  status  is  itself  based  on  age. 
Suppose, for example, that an employer pays all retired work-ers a pension, retirement eligibility turns on age, say, 65, and 
a  70-year-old  worker  retires.  Nothing  in  language  or  in logic  prevents  one  from  concluding  that  the  employer  has 
begun  to  pay  the  worker  a  pension,  not  because  the  worker is over 65, but simply because the worker has retired. 

Second,  several  background  circumstances  eliminate  the possibility  that  pension  status,  though  analytically  distinct 
from  age,  nonetheless  serves  as  a  "proxy  for  age"  in  Ken-

Opinion of the Court 
tucky's Plan.  Cf. id., at 613.  We consider not an individual employment decision, but a set of complex systemwide rules. 

These  systemic  rules  involve,  not  wages,  but  pensions-- a  benefit  that  the  ADEA  treats  somewhat  more  flexibly 
and  leniently  in  respect  to  age.  See,  e. g.,  29  U. S. C. $ 623(

l)(1)(A)(i) (explicitly allowing pension eligibility to turn 
on  age);  $ 623(l)(2)(A)  (allowing  employer  to  consider  (age-
related)  pension  benefits  in  determining  level  of  severance pay);  $ 623(

l)(3)  (allowing  employer to  consider  (age-related) 
pension  benefits  in  determining  level  of  long-term  disability benefits).  And the specific benefit at issue here is offered to 

all  hazardous  position  workers  on  the  same  nondiscrimina-
tory  terms  ex  ante.  That  is  to  say,  every  such  employee, 
when hired, is promised disability retirement benefits should 
he  become  disabled  prior  to  the  time  that  he  is  eligible  for 
normal retirement benefits. 

Furthermore,  Congress  has  otherwise  approved  of  pro-
grams  that  calculate  permanent  disability  benefits  using  a 
formula  that  expressly  takes  account  of  age.  For  example, 
the  Social  Security  Administration  now  uses  such  a  formula 
in  calculating  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  benefits. 
See,  e. g.,  42  U. S. C.  $ 415(b)(2)(B)(iii);  20  CFR  $ 404.211(e) 
(2007).  And until (and in some cases after) 1984, federal em-
ployees  received  permanent  disability  benefits  based  on  a 
formula  that,  in  certain  circumstances,  did  not  just  consider 
age,  but  effectively  imputed  years  of  service  only  to  those 
disabled  workers  younger  than  60.  See  5  U. S. C.  $ 8339(g) 
(2006 ed.); see also Office of Personnel Management, Disabil-
ity Retirement Under the Civil Service Retirement System, 
Retirement  Facts  4,  p.  3  (rev.  Nov.  1997),  online  at  http:// 
www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/RI83-4.pdf (as visited June 16, 
2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). 

Third,  there  is  a  clear  non-age-related  rationale  for  the 
disparity here at issue.  The manner in which Kentucky cal-
culates  disability  retirement  benefits  is  in  every  important 
respect  but  one  identical  to  the  manner  in  which  Kentucky

Opinion of the Court 
calculates  normal  retirement  benefits.  The  one  significant difference  consists  of  the  fact  that  the  Plan  imputes  addi-

tional years of service to disabled individuals.  But the Plan imputes 

only those years needed to bring the disabled work-
er's years of service to 20 or to the number of years that the individual  would  have  worked  had  he  worked  to  age  55. 

The  disability  rules  clearly  track  Kentucky's  normal  retire-
ment rules. It is obvious, then, that the whole purpose of the disability 

rules  is,  as  Kentucky  claims,  to  treat  a  disabled  worker  as though he had become  disabled after, rather  than before, he 
had  become  eligible  for  normal  retirement  benefits.  Age 
factors into the disability calculation only because the normal 
retirement  rules  themselves  permissibly  include  age  as  a 
consideration.  No  one  seeking  to  help  disabled  workers  in 
the  way  that  Kentucky's  rules  seek  to  help  those  workers 
would care  whether Kentucky's normal system  turned eligi-
bility in part upon age or upon other, different criteria. 

That this is so is suggested by the fact that one can readily 
construct  a  plan  that  produces  an  identical  disparity  but 
is  age  neutral.  Suppose  that  Kentucky's  Plan  made  eligi-
ble  for  a  pension  (1)  day-shift  workers  who  have  20  years 
of  service,  and  (2)  night-shift  workers  who  have  15  years 
of  service.  Suppose  further  that  the  Plan  calculates  the 
amount  of  the  pension  the  same  way  in  either  case,  which 
method  of  calculation  depends  solely  upon  years  of  service 
(say,  giving  the  worker  a  pension  equal  to  $1,000  for  each 
year  of  service).  If  the  Plan  were  then  to  provide  workers 
who  become  disabled  prior  to  pension  eligibility  the  same 
pension  the  workers  would  have  received  had  they  worked 
until  they  became  pension  eligible,  the  Plan  would  create  a 
disparity  between  disabled  day-shift  and  night-shift  work-
ers: A day-shift worker who becomes disabled before becom-
ing pension eligible would, in many instances, end up receiv-
ing a bigger pension than a night-shift worker who becomes 
disabled  after  becoming  pension  eligible.  For  example,  a 

554US1 Unit: $U61 [01-05-13 17:44:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
146  KENTUCKY  RETIREMENT  SYSTEMS  v.  EEOC 

Opinion of the Court 
day-shift  worker  who  becomes  disabled  prior  to  becoming 
pension  eligible  would  receive  an  annual  pension  of  $20,000, 
while  a  night-shift  worker  who  becomes  disabled  after  be-
coming pension eligible, say, after 16 years of service, would 
receive an annual pension of $16,000. 

The  disparity  in  this  example  is  not  "actually  motivated" 
by  bias against  night-shift workers.  Rather,  such a  dispar-
ity, like the disparity in the case before us, is simply an arti-
fact  of Plan  rules  that treat  one set  of  workers more  gener-
ously in respect to the timing of their eligibility for normal 
retirement benefits but which do not treat them more gener-
ously  in  respect  to  the  calculation  of  the  amount  of  their 
normal  retirement  benefits.  The  example  helps  to  show 
that  the  Plan  at  issue  in  this  case  simply  seeks  to  treat  dis-
abled  employees  as  if  they  had  worked  until  the  point  at 
which they would be eligible for a normal pension.  The dis-
parity turns upon pension eligibility and nothing more. 

Fourth,  although  Kentucky's  Plan  placed  an  older  worker 
at a disadvantage in this  case, in other cases,  it  can work to 
the advantage of older workers.  Consider, for example, two 
disabled  workers,  one  of  whom  is  aged  45  with  10  years  of 
service,  one  of  whom  is  aged  40  with  15  years  of  service. 
Under  Kentucky's  scheme,  the  older  worker  would  actually 
get a bigger boost of imputed years than the younger worker 
(10 years would be imputed to the former, while only 5 years 
would be imputed to the latter).  And that fact helps to con-
firm  that  the  underlying  motive  is  not  an  effort  to  discrimi-
nate "because of . . . age."  

Fifth, Kentucky's system does not rely on any of the sorts 
of stereotypical assumptions that the ADEA sought to eradi-
cate.  It  does  not  rest  on  any  stereotype  about  the  work 
capacity  of  "older"  workers  relative  to  "younger"  workers. 
See,  e. g.,  General  Dynamics  Land  Systems,  Inc.  v.  Cline, 
540 U. S. 581, 590 (2004) (noting that except on one point, all 
the  findings  and  statements  of  objectives  in  the  ADEA  are 

554US1 Unit: $U61 [01-05-13 17:44:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
"either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over 
time,  or  are  couched  in  terms  that  refer  to  `older'  workers, 
explicitly  or  implicitly  relative  to  `younger'  ones"  (emphasis 
added)).  The  Plan  does  assume  that  all  disabled  workers 
would  have  worked  to  the  point  at  which  they  would  have 
become  eligible  for  a  pension.  It  also  assumes  that  no  dis-
abled  worker  would  have  continued  working  beyond  the 
point at which he was both (1) disabled and (2) pension eligi-
ble.  But these "assumptions" do not involve age-related ste-
reotypes,  and  they  apply  equally  to  all  workers,  regardless 
of age. 

Sixth,  the  nature  of  the  Plan's  eligibility  requirements 
means that,  unless  Kentucky were severely to cut  the  bene-
fits given to disabled workers who are not yet pension eligi-
ble  (which  Kentucky  claims  it  will  do  if  its  present  Plan  is 
unlawful),  Kentucky  would  have  to  increase  the  benefits 
available to disabled, pension-eligible workers, while lacking 
any  clear  criteria  for  determining  how  many  extra  years  to 
impute  for  those  pension-eligible  workers  who  already  are 
55 or older.  The difficulty of finding a remedy that can both 
correct the disparity and achieve the Plan's legitimate objec-
tive--providing each disabled worker with a sufficient retire-
ment benefit, namely, the normal retirement benefit that the 
worker would receive if he were pension eligible at the time 
of  disability--further  suggests  that  this  objective  and  not 
age "actually motivated" the Plan. 

The  above  factors  all  taken  together  convince  us  that  the 
Plan  does  not,  on  its  face,  create  treatment  differences  that 
are "actually motivated" by age.  And, for present purposes, 
we  accept  the  District  Court's  finding  that  the  Government 
has  pointed  to  no  additional  evidence  that  might  permit  a 
factfinder  to  reach  a  contrary  conclusion.  See  App.  28-30. 

It bears emphasizing that our  opinion in no way unsettles 
the  rule  that  a  statute  or  policy  that  facially  discriminates 
based on age suffices to show disparate treatment under the

148  KENTUCKY  RETIREMENT  SYSTEMS  v.  EEOC 

Opinion of the Court 
ADEA.  We are dealing today with the quite special case of differential  treatment  based  on  pension  status,  where  pen-

sion  status--with  the  explicit  blessing  of  the  ADEA--itself turns, in part, on age.  Further, the rule we adopt today for 
dealing  with  this  sort  of  case  is  clear:  Where  an  employer adopts a pension  plan that  includes age as a factor, and that 
employer then treats employees differently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a disparate-treatment claim under 
the  ADEA,  must  come  forward  with  sufficient  evidence  to show  that  the  differential  treatment  was  "actually  moti-
vated" by age, not pension status.  And our discussion of the factors  that  lead  us  to  conclude  that  the  Government  has 
failed to make the requisite showing in this case provides an indication  of  what  a  plaintiff  might  show  in  other  cases  to 
meet his burden of proving that differential treatment based on  pension  status  is  in  fact  discrimination  "because  of "  age. 

IV 
The Government makes two additional arguments.  First, it looks for support to an amendment that Congress made to 

the  ADEA  after  this  Court's  decision  in  Public  Employees 
Retirement System of Ohio v.  Betts, 492 U. S. 158 (1989).  In 
Betts,  the  employer  denied  a  worker  disability  benefits  on the  ground  that  its  bona  fide  benefit  program  provided  dis-

ability  benefits  only  to  workers  who  became  disabled  prior to age 60, and the worker in that case became disabled at age 
61.  Id.,  at  163.  The  ADEA  at  that  time  exempted  from its prohibitions employment  decisions taken  pursuant to the 
terms  of  " `any  bona  fide  employee  benefit  plan  .  .  .  which  is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of ' the Act."  Id., at 
161  (quoting  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(f)(2)  (1982  ed.)).  And  the Court  held  that  the  employer's  decision  fell  within  that 
exception.  492 U. S., at 182.  Subsequently Congress amended the ADEA to make clear that it covered age-based 
discrimination  in  respect  to  all  employee  benefits.  See Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act,  $ 102,  104  Stat.  978, 

554US1 Unit: $U61 [01-05-13 17:44:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
29 U. S. C. $ 630(l) (2000 ed.).  Congress  replaced the  "not  a subterfuge"  exception  with  a  provision  stating  that  age-

based disparities  in the  provision of  benefits  are  lawful only when  they  are  justified  in  respect  to  cost  savings. 

Id.,  at 
978-979, 29 U. S. C. $ 623(f )(2)(B)(i). We  agree  with  the  Government  that  the  amendment 

broadened  the  field  of  employer  actions  subject  to  antidis-
crimination  rules  and  it  narrowed  the  statutorily  available justifications  for  age-related  differences.  But  these  facts 

cannot  help  the  Government  here.  We  do  not  dispute  that ADEA prohibitions apply to the Plan at issue, and our basis 
for  finding  the  Plan  lawful  does  not  rest  upon  amendment-
related  justifications.  Rather,  we  find  that  the  discrimina-
tion is not "actually motivated" by age.  Thus Hazen Paper, 
not  Betts,  provides  relevant  precedent.  And  the  amend-
ment cited by the Government is beside the point. 

Second, the Government says that we must defer to a con-
trary  EEOC  interpretation  contained  in  an  EEOC  regula-
tion and compliance manual.  The regulation, however, says 
only that providing "the same level of benefits to older work-
ers  as  to  younger  workers"  does  not  violate  the  Act.  29 
CFR  $ 1625.10(a)(2)  (2007).  The  Government's  interpreta-
tion of this language is not entitled to deference because, on 
its  face,  the  regulation  "does  little  more  than  restate  the 
terms  of  the  statute  itself."  Gonzales  v.  Oregon,  546  U. S. 
243,  257  (2006)  (denying  deference  to  an  agency  interpreta-

238  GREENLAW  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Syllabus 
with respect to a criminal sentence, "[t]he Government may not further 
prosecute  [the]  appeal  without  the  personal  approval  of  the  Attorney 
General, the Solicitor  General,  or a deputy  solicitor general designated 
by  the  Solicitor  General."  18  U. S. C.  $ 3742(b).  This  provision  gives 
the top representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative 
to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain 
they may be.  Pp. 243-246. 

(b)  The Eighth Circuit held that the plain-error rule, Fed. Rule Crim. 
Proc. 52(b), authorized it to order the sentence enhancement sua sponte. 
Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b), or in this Court's decisions, 
suggests  that  the  plain-error  rule  was  meant  to  override  the  cross-
appeal requirement.  In every case in which correction of a plain error 
would result in modifying a judgment to the advantage of a party who 
did not seek this Court's review, the Court has invoked the cross-appeal 
rule  to  bar  the  correction.  See,  e. g.,  Chittenden  v.  Brewster,  2  Wall. 
191; Strunk v.  United States, 412 U. S. 434.  Even if it would be proper 
for an appeals court to initiate plain-error review in some cases, sentenc-
ing errors that the Government has refrained from pursuing would not 
fit  the  bill.  In  $ 3742(b),  Congress  assigned  to  leading  Department  of 
Justice officers responsibility for determining when Government pursuit 
of a sentencing appeal is in order.  Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate 
court  interference  with  the  assessment  of  those  officers.  Pp.  247-248. 

(c)  Amicus  curiae,  invited  by  the  Court  to  brief  and  argue  the  case 
in support of the Court of Appeals' judgment, links the argument based 
on  Rule  52(b)  to  a  similar  argument  based  on  28  U. S. C.  $ 2106.  For 
substantially  the  same  reasons  that  Rule  52(b)  does  not  override  the 
cross-appeal rule, $ 2106 does not do so either.  Pp. 248-249. 

(d)  Amicus  also  argues  that  18  U. S. C.  $ 3742,  which  governs  appel-
late  review  of  criminal  sentences,  overrides  the  cross-appeal  rule  for 
sentences  "imposed  in  violation  of  law,"  $ 3742(e).  Amicus'  construc-
tion  of  $ 3742  is  novel  and  complex,  but  ultimately  unpersuasive.  At 
the  time  $ 3742  was  enacted,  the  cross-appeal  rule  was  a  solidly 
grounded rule of appellate practice.  Congress had  crafted explicit ex-
ceptions  to  the  cross-appeal  rule  in  earlier  statutes  governing  sen-
tencing appeals,  i. e., the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and the 
Controlled  Substances  Act  of  1970.  When  Congress  repealed  those 
exceptions  and  enacted  $ 3742,  it  did  not  similarly  express  in  the  text 
of $ 3742 any exception to the cross-appeal rule.  This drafting history 
suggests that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal  rule and framed 

$ 3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with 
it.  Pp. 249-252. 

(e)  In increasing Greenlaw's sentence sua sponte, the Eighth Circuit 
did not advert to the procedural rules setting firm deadlines for launch-

Opinion of the Court 
guilty  on  seven  of  the  charges.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert. 16a-17a. 

Among  Greenlaw's  convictions  were  two  for  violating  18 U. S. C.  $ 924(c)(1)(A),  which  prohibits  carrying  a  firearm 
during  and  in  relation  to  a  crime  of  violence  or  a  drug  traf-ficking  crime:  His  first  $ 924(c)  conviction  was  for  carrying 
a  firearm  in  connection  with  a  crime  committed  in  1998; 
his  second,  for  both  carrying  and  discharging  a  firearm  in connection  with  a  crime  committed  in  1999.  App.  to  Pet. 

for  Cert.  17a.  A  first  conviction  for  violating  $ 924(c)  car-ries a mandatory  minimum term of 5 years, if the firearm is 
simply  carried.  $ 924(c)(1)(A)(i).  If  the  firearm  is  also  dis-
charged,  the  mandatory  minimum  increases  to  10  years. 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).  For  "a  second  or  subsequent  conviction," 
however,  whether  the  weapon  is  only  carried  or  discharged 
as  well,  the  mandatory  minimum  jumps  to  25  years. 

$ 924(c)(1)(C)(i).  Any  sentence  for  violating  $ 924(c),  more-
over,  must  run  consecutively  to  "any  other  term  of  im-
prisonment,"  including  any  other  conviction  under  $ 924(c). 

$ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). 

At  sentencing,  the  District  Court  made  an  error.  Over 
the  Government's  objection,  the  court  held  that  a  $ 924(c) 
conviction does not count as "second or subsequent" when it 
is  "charged  in  the  same  indictment"  as  the  defendant's  first 

$ 924(c) conviction.  App. 59, 61-62.  The error was plain be-
cause this Court had held, in Deal v.  United States, 508 U. S. 
129  (1993),  that  when  a  defendant  is  charged  in  the  same 
indictment with more than one offense qualifying for punish-
ment  under  $ 924(c),  all  convictions  after  the  first  rank  as 
"second or subsequent," see id., at 132-137. 

As determined by the District Court, Greenlaw's sentence 
included  262  months  (without  separately  counting  sentences 
that  ran  concurrently)  for  all  his  convictions  other  than  the 
two  under  $ 924(c).  For  the  first  $ 924(c)  offense,  the  court 
imposed  a  5-year  sentence  in  accord  with  $ 924(c)(1)(A)(i). 
As  to  the  second  $ 924(c)  conviction,  the  District  Court  re-

242  GREENLAW  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
jected  the  Government's  request  for  the  25-year  minimum prescribed  in  $ 924(c)(1)(C)  for  "second  or  subsequent"  of-

fenses;  instead,  it  imposed  the  10-year  term  prescribed  in $ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for first-time offenses.

1  The total sentence 

thus calculated came to 442 months. Greenlaw appealed to the United States Court of Appeals 

for  the  Eighth  Circuit,  urging,  inter  alia,  that  the  appro-priate  total  sentence  for  all  his  crimes  was  15  years.  See 
481  F.  3d,  at  607.  The  Court  of  Appeals  found  no  merit  in any  of  Greenlaw's  arguments. 

Id.,  at  606-607.  Although the Government did not appeal or cross-appeal, id., at 608, it 

did note, on brief and  at oral argument, the  District Court's error: Greenlaw's sentence should have been 15 years longer 
than the 442 months imposed by the District Court, the Gov-ernment  observed,  because  his  second  $ 924(c)  conviction 
called for a 25-year (not a 10-year) mandatory minimum con-secutive sentence. 

The  Government  made  the  observation  that  the  sentence was 15 years too short only to counter Greenlaw's argument 
that  it  was  unreasonably  long.  See  App.  84-86;  Recording of  Oral  Arg.  in 

United  States  v.  Carter,  No.  05-3391  (CA8, Sept.  26,  2006),  at  16:53-19:04,  available  at  http://www. 

ca8.uscourts.gov/oralargs/oaFrame.html  (as  visited  June  13, 2008).  Having refrained from seeking correction of the Dis-
trict  Court's  error  by  pursuing  its  own  appeal,  the  Gov-ernment  simply  urged  that  Greenlaw's  sentence  should  be 
affirmed. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Government, 
while  objecting  at  sentencing  to  the  trial  court's  erroneous reading  of  $ 924(c)(1)(C),  had  elected  to  seek  no  appellate 
court  alteration  of  Greenlaw's  sentence.  481  F.  3d,  at  608. Relying  on  the  "plain-error  rule"  stated  in  Federal  Rule  of 
Criminal  Procedure  52(b),  however,  the  appeals  court  held 

1 The court added 10 years rather than 5 based on the jury's finding that 
the firearm Greenlaw carried in connection with the second $ 924(c) offense 
had been discharged.  See App. 44-45, 59-60.

Opinion of the Court 
that it had discretion to raise and correct the District Court's error  on  its  own  initiative.  481  F.  3d,  at  608-609.  The 

Court  of  Appeals  therefore  vacated  the  sentence  and  in-structed the District Court "to impose the [statutorily man-
dated]  consecutive  minimum  sentence  of  25  years."  Id., at 611. 

Petitioning for rehearing and rehearing en banc, Greenlaw asked  the  Eighth  Circuit  to  adopt  the  position  advanced  by 
the Seventh Circuit in United States v.  Rivera, 411 F. 3d 864 (2005).  App.  95.  "By deciding  not  to  take a  cross-appeal," 
the  Seventh  Circuit  stated,  "the  United  States  has  ensured that  [the  defendant's]  sentence  cannot  be  increased."  411 
F. 3d, at 867.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing without an  opinion.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  28a.  On  remand,  as  in-
structed  by  the  Court  of  Appeals,  the  District  Court  in-creased  Greenlaw's  sentence  by  15  years,  yielding  a  total 
prison term of 622 months.  App. 103-104, 109. Greenlaw petitioned for certiorari noting a division among 
the  Circuits  on  this  question:  When  a  defendant  unsuccess-fully challenges  his  sentence  as too  high, may  a court of  ap-
peals,  on  its  own  initiative,  increase  the  sentence  absent  a cross-appeal by the Government?  In response, the Govern-
ment  "agree[d]  with  [Greenlaw]  that  the  court  of  appeals erred  in  sua  sponte  remanding  the  case  with  directions  to 
enhance petitioner's sentence."  Brief in Opposition 12.  We granted  review  and  invited  Jay  T.  Jorgensen  to  brief  and 
argue  this  case,  as  amicus  curiae,  in  support  of  the  Court of Appeals' judgment.  552 U. S. 1087 and 1135 (2008).  Mr. 
Jorgensen accepted the appointment and has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.

arbiter of matters the parties present.  To the extent courts

Morley Constr. Co. v.  Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185,

Courts of Appeals have disagreed, however, on the proper 
characterization  of  the  cross-appeal  rule:  Is  it  "jurisdic-
tional,"  and  therefore  exceptionless,  or  a  "rule  of  practice," 
and thus potentially subject to judicially created exceptions? 
Compare,  e. g.,  Johnson  v.  Teamsters  Local  559,  102  F.  3d 
21,  28-29  (CA1  1996)  (cross-appeal  rule  "is  mandatory  and 
jurisdictional"),  with, e. g.,  American  Roll-On  Roll-Off  Car-
rier,  LLC  v.  P  &  O  Ports  Baltimore,  Inc.,  479  F.  3d  288, 
295-296  (CA4  2007)  ("cross-appeal  requirement  [is]  one  of 
practice,  [not]  a  strict  jurisdictional  requirement").  Our 
own  opinions  contain  statements  supporting  both  charac-
terizations.  Compare,  e. g.,  Morley  Constr.  Co.,  300  U. S., 
at 187 (cross-appeal rule defines "[t]he power of an appellate 
court  to  modify  a  decree"  (emphasis  added)),  with,  e. g., 
Langnes  v.  Green,  282  U. S.  531, 538  (1931)  (cross-appeal  re-
quirement  is  "a  rule  of  practice  which  generally  has  been 
followed"). 

In El Paso Natural Gas Co. v.  Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 480 
(1999),  we  declined  to  decide  "the  theoretical  status"  of  the 
cross-appeal rule.  It sufficed to point out that the rule was 
"firmly entrenched"  and  served to  advance "institutional in-
terests  in  fair  notice  and  repose."  Ibid.  "Indeed,"  we 
noted,  "in  more  than  two  centuries  of  repeatedly  endorsing 
the  cross-appeal  requirement,  not  a  single  one  of  our  hold-
ings  has  ever  recognized  an  exception  to  the  rule."  Ibid. 
Following  the  approach  taken  in  Neztsosie,  we  again  need 
not type the rule "jurisdictional" in order to decide this case. 

Congress  has  eased  our  decision  by  specifying  the  in-
stances in which the Government may seek appellate review 
of  a  sentence,  and  then  adding  this  clear  instruction:  Even 
when  a  United  States  Attorney  files  a  notice  of  appeal  with

Opinion of the Court 
respect  to  a  sentence  qualifying  for  review,  "[t]he  Govern-ment may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the per-

sonal  approval  of  the  Attorney  General,  the  Solicitor  Gen-eral, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor 
General."  18  U. S. C.  $ 3742(b).  Congress  thus  entrusted to  named  high-ranking  officials  within  the  Department  of 
Justice  responsibility  for  determining  whether  the  Govern-ment,  on behalf  of the  public, should  seek a  sentence higher 
than  the  one  imposed.  It  would  severely  undermine  Con-gress'  instruction  were  appellate  judges  to  "sally  forth"  on 
their own motion, cf. supra, at 244, to take up errors adverse to the Government when the designated Department of Jus-
tice officials have not authorized an appeal from the sentence the trial court imposed.

This Court has recognized that "the Executive Branch has exclusive  authority  and  absolute  discreti on  to  decide 

whether  to  prosecute  a  case."  United  States  v.  Nixon,  418 U. S. 683, 693 (1974).  We need not decide whether compara-
ble  authority  and  discretion  are  lodged  in  the  Executive Branch with respect to the pursuit of issues on appeal.  We 
need only recognize that Congress, in $ 3742(b), has accorded to  the  top  representatives  of  the  United  States  in  litigation 
the  prerogative  to seek  or forgo  appellate correction  of sen-tencing  errors,  however  plain  they  may  be.  That  measure 
should garner the Judiciary's full respect. 

4 The dissent reads $ 3742(b) not as a restraint on sua sponte error cor-
rection by appellate courts, but simply as apportioning "authority within 
an executive department."  Post, at 266; see post, at 267 ("[P]erhaps Con-
gress wanted to . . . giv[e] high-level officials the authority to nix meritless 
or marginal [sentencing appeals].").  A statute is hardly needed to estab-
lish the authority of the Attorney General and Solicitor General over local 
U.  S.  Attorneys  on  matters  relating  to  the  prosecution  of  criminal  cases, 
including  appeals  of  sentences.  It  seems  unlikely,  moreover,  that  Con-
gress, having lodged discretion in top-ranking Department of Justice offi-
cers,  meant  that  discretion  to  be  shared  with  more  than  200  appellate 
judges.

Opinion of the Court 

III 

A 
In  ordering  the  District  Court  to  add  15  years  to  Green-law's  sentence,  despite  the  absence  of  a  cross-appeal  by  the 

Government,  the  Court  of  Appeals  identified  Federal  Rule of  Criminal  Procedure  52(b)  as  the  source  of  its  authority. 
See  481  F.  3d,  at  608-609,  and  n.  5.  Rule  52(b)  reads: "A  plain  error that affects  substantial rights may  be consid-
ered  even  though  it  was  not  brought  to  the  court's  atten-tion."  Nothing in the text or history of Rule 52(b) suggests 
that  the  rulemakers,  in  codifying  the  plain-error  doctrine, meant to override the cross-appeal requirement.  See Advi-
sory  Committee's  Notes  on  Fed.  Rule  Crim.  Proc.  52,  18 U. S. C.  App.,  p.  1664  (describing  Rule  52(b)  as  "a  restate-
ment of existing law"). Nor do our opinions support a plain-error exception to the 
cross-appeal  rule.  This  Court  has  indeed  noticed,  and  or-dered  correction  of,  plain  errors  not  raised  by  defendants, 
but  we  have  done  so  only  to  benefit  a  defendant  who  had himself  petitioned  the  Court  for  review  on  other  grounds. 
See,  e. g.,  Silber  v.  United  States,  370  U. S.  717  (1962)  (per curiam).  In  no  case  have  we  applied  plain-error  doctrine 
to  the  detriment  of  a  petitioning  party.  Rather,  in  every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modi-
fication  of  a  judgment  to  the  advantage  of  a  party  who  did not  seek  this  Court's  review,  we  have  invoked  the  cross-
appeal rule to bar the correction. In Chittenden v.  Brewster, 2 Wall. 191 (1865), for example, 
the appellants asserted that an award entered in their favor was  too  small.  A  prior  decision  of  this  Court,  however, 
made it plain that they were entitled to no award at all.  See id.,  at  195-196  (citing  Jones  v.  Green,  1  Wall.  330  (1864)). 
But  because  the  appellee  had  not  filed  a  cross-appeal,  the Court  left  the  award  undisturbed.  See  2  Wall.,  at  196. 
Strunk v.  United States, 412 U. S. 434 (1973), decided over a

248  GREENLAW  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
century  later,  is  similarly  illustrative.  There,  the  Court  of Appeals  had  determined  that  the  defendant  was  denied  his 

right to a speedy trial, but held that the proper remedy was reduction  of  his  sentence  as  compensation  for  the  delay,  not 
dismissal  of  the  charges  against  him.  As  petitioner  in  this Court,  the  defendant  sought  review  of  the  remedial  order. 
See  id.,  at  435.  The  Court  suggested  that  there  may  have been no speedy trial violation, as "it seem[ed] clear that [the 
defendant] was responsible for a large part of the . . . delay." 
Id., at 436.  But because the Government had not raised the issue by cross-petition,  we considered the case on the prem-

ise  that  the  defendant  had  been  deprived  of  his  Sixth Amendment right, 

id., at 437, and ruled that dismissal of the indictment was the proper remedy, id., at 439-440. 

Even if there might be circumstances in which it would be proper  for  an  appellate  court  to  initiate  plain-error  review, 
sentencing  errors  that  the  Government  refrained  from  pur-suing  would  not  fit  the  bill.  Heightening  the  generally  ap-
plicable party presentation principle, Congress has provided a  dispositive  direction  regarding  sentencing  errors  that  ag-
grieve  the  Government.  In  $ 3742(b),  as  earlier  explained, see  supra, at  245-246,  Congress  designated  leading  Depart-
ment of Justice officers as the decisionmakers responsible for determining  when  Government  pursuit  of  a  sentencing  ap-
peal  is  in  order.  Those  high  officers,  Congress  recognized, are best  equipped  to determine  where  the  Government's  in-
terest lies.  Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court inter-ference with their assessment. 

B 
Amicus  supporting  the  Eighth  Circuit's  judgment  links the  argument  based  on  Rule  52(b)  to  a  similar  argument 

based on 28 U. S. C. $ 2106.  See Brief for Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 40-43 (hereinafter Jorgensen Brief). 
Section 2106 states that federal appellate courts "may affirm, modify,  vacate,  set  aside  or  reverse  any  judgment  .  .  .  law-

Opinion of the Court 
fully  brought  before  it  for  review."  For  substantially  the same  reasons  that  Rule  52(b)  does  not  override  the  cross-

appeal  requirement,  $ 2106  does  not  do  so  either.  Section 2106  is  not  limited  to  plain  errors,  much  less  to  sentencing 
errors  in  criminal  cases--it  applies  to  all  cases,  civil  and criminal,  and  to  all  errors.  Were  the  construction 

amicus offers  correct,  $ 2106  would  displace  the  cross-appeal  rule 

cross the board.  The authority described in $ 2106, we have observed,  "must  be  exercised  consistent  with  the  require-
ments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by  this  Court."  Unitherm  Food  Systems,  Inc.  v.  SwiftEckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. 394, 402-403, n. 4 (2006).  No differ-ent  conclusion  is  warranted  with  respect  to  the  "inveterate 
and  certain"  cross-appeal  rule.  Morley  Constr.  Co.,  300 U. S., at 191. 

C 
In  defending  the  Court  of  Appeals'  judgment,  amicus places heavy weight on an argument pinned not to Rule 52(b) 

or  28  U. S. C.  $ 2106,  but  to  the  text  of  18  U. S. C.  $ 3742, the  Criminal  Code  provision  governing  appellate  review  of 
criminal  sentences.  As  amicus  reads  $ 3742,  once  either party appeals a sentence, the Court of Appeals must remand 
"any illegal sentence regardless of whether the remand hurts or  helps  the  appealing  party."  Jorgensen  Brief  9.  Con-
gress  so  directed,  amicus  argues,  by  instructing  that,  upon review  of  the  record,  a  court  of  appeals  "shall  determine 
whether  the  sentence  .  .  .  was  imposed  in  violation  of  law," $ 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (emphasis added), and "shall 
remand"  if  it  so  determines,  $ 3742(f)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V) (emphasis added).  See Jorgensen Brief 10-11, and n. 3. 

Amicus makes a further text-based  observation.  He notes  that  $ 3742(f)(2)--the  provision  covering  sentences 
"outside  the  applicable  [G]uideline  range"--calls  for  a  re-mand  only  where  a  departure  from  the  Federal  Sentencing 
Guidelines  harms  the  appellant.  In  contrast,  amicus  em-phasizes,  $ 3742(f)(1)--the  provision  controlling  sentences

250  GREENLAW  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
imposed  "in  violation  of  law"  and  Guidelines  application  er-rors--contains  no  such  appellant-linked  limitation.  The  in-

ference amicus draws from this  distinction is that Congress intended  to  override  the  cross-appeal  rule  for  sentences 
controlled  by  $ 3742(f)(1),  i. e.,  those  imposed  "in  violation of  law"  (or  incorrectly  applying  the  Guidelines),  but  not 
for  Guidelines  departure  errors,  the  category  covered  by $ 3742(f)(2).  See 

id., at 14-15. This  novel  construction  of  $ 3742,  presented  for  the  first 

time  in  the  brief  amicus  filed  in  this  Court,5  is  clever  and complex,  but  ultimately  unpersuasive.  Congress  enacted 

$ 3742  in  1984.  See  Sentencing  Reform  Act,  $ 213(a),  98 Stat. 2011.  At that time, the  cross-appeal requirement  was 
a  solidly  grounded  rule  of  appellate  practice.  See  supra, at 244-245.  The inference properly drawn, we think, is that 
Congress  was  aware  of  the  cross-appeal  rule,  and  framed $ 3742  expecting  that  the  new  provision  would  operate  in 
harmony  with  the  "inveterate  and  certain"  bar  to  enlarging judgments  in  favor  of  an appellee  who  filed  no  cross-appeal. 
Cf.  Astoria  Fed.  Sav.  &  Loan  Assn.  v.  Solimino,  501  U. S. 104,  108  (1991)  ("Congress  is  understood to  legislate against 
a background of common-law adjudicatory principles."). Congress  indicated  awareness  of  the  cross-appeal  rule  in 
an earlier measure, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA),  Pub.  L.  91-452,  84  Stat.  922,  which  provided  for 
review  of  sentences  of  "dangerous  special  offenders."  See $ 1001(a), 

id., at 948-951.  For that Act, Congress crafted an explicit  exception  to  the  cross-appeal  rule.  It  ordered  that 

an  appeal  of  a  sentence  taken  by  the  Government  "shall  be deemed  the  taking  of  [an  appeal]  by  the  defendant." 

Id., at  950.  But  the  "deeming"  ran  in  only  one  direction:  "[A]

not  earlier  aired.  See  United  States  v.  American  Railway  Express 
Co.,  265  U. S.  425,  435  (1924)  ("[T]he  appellee  may,  without  taking  a 
cross-appeal,  urge  in  support  of  a  decree  any  matter  appearing  in  the 
record . . . .").

When  Congress  repealed  this  provision  and,  in  $ 3742, broadly provided for appellate review of sentences, it did not 

similarly express in the new text any exception to the cross-appeal rule.  In short, Congress formulated a precise excep-
tion  to  the  cross-appeal  rule  when  that  was  its  intention. Notably,  the  exception  Congress  legislated  did  not  expose  a 
defendant to a higher sentence in response to his own appeal. Congress spoke  plainly  in  the  1970 legislation,  leaving  noth-
ing for a court to infer.  We therefore see no reason to read the  current  statute  in  the  inventive  manner 

amicus  pro-poses, inferring so much from so little. 

Amicus'  reading  of  $ 3742,  moreover,  would  yield  some strange results.  We note two, in particular.  Under his con-
struction,  $ 3742  would  give  with  one  hand  what  it  takes away  with  the  other:  Section  3742(b)  entrusts  to  certain 
Government  officials  the  decision  whether  to  appeal  an  ille-gally  low  sentence,  see 

supra,  at  245-246;  but  according  to amicus, $$ 3742(e)  and (f ) would instruct  appellate courts to 

correct an error of that order on their own initiative, thereby trumping  the  officials'  decision.  We  resist  attributing  to 
Congress an intention to render a statute so internally incon-sistent.  Cf.  Western  Air  Lines,  Inc.  v.  Board  of  Equaliza-
tion of S. D., 480  U. S. 123,  133  (1987)  ("The  illogical  results of  applying  [a  proffered]  interpretation . . . argue  strongly 
against the conclusion that Congress intended th[o]se results .  .  .  .").  Further,  the  construction  proposed  by 

amicus would draw a puzzling distinction between incorrect applica-

tions of the Sentencing Guidelines, controlled by $ 3742(f)(1), and  erroneous  departures  from  the  Guidelines,  covered  by 

6 The  Controlled  Substances  Act  of  1970,  $ 409(h),  84  Stat.  1268-1269, 
contained matching instructions applicable to "dangerous special drug of-
fender[s]."  The prescriptions in both Acts were replaced by $ 3742.  See 
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, $$ 212(2), 213(a), 219, 98 Stat. 1987, 2011, 
2027.

files  a  cross-appeal,  the  defendant  will  have  fair  warning, well in advance of briefing and argument, that pursuit of his 

appeal  exposes him to the risk of a higher sentence.  Given early  warning,  he  can  tailor  his  arguments  to  take  account 
of  that  risk.  Or  he  can  seek  the  Government's  agreement to  voluntary  dismissal  of  the  competing  appeals,  see  Fed. 
Rule App. Proc. 42(b), before positions become hardened dur-ing  the  hours  invested  in  preparing  the  case  for  appellate 
court consideration. The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal 
would  be  undermined,  in  both  civil  and  criminal  cases,  if  an appeals  court  could  modify  a  judgment  in  favor  of  a  party 
who  filed  no  notice  of  appeal.  In  a  criminal  prosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his peril, with noth-
ing to alert him that, on his  own appeal,  his  sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed.  In this very 
case, Greenlaw might have made different strategic decisions had  he  known  soon  after  filing  his  notice  of  appeal  that  he 
risked a 15-year increase in an already lengthy sentence. 

E 
We note that nothing we have said in this opinion requires courts to modify their current practice in so-called "sentenc-

ing  package  cases."  Those  cases  typically  involve  multi-count indictments and a successful attack by  a defendant  on 
some  but  not  all  of  the  counts  of  conviction.  The  appeals court,  in  such  instances,  may  vacate  the  entire  sentence  on 
all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the  sentencing  plan  to  ensure  that  it  remains  adequate  to 
satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp.  V).  In remanded cases,  the  Government  relates, 
trial courts have imposed a sentence on the remaining counts longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particu-
lar counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the  aggregate  sentence  initially  imposed.  See  Brief  for 
United  States  23,  n.  11  (citing,  inter  alia,  United  States  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F. 2d 9 (CA1 1989) (en banc)).  Thus the  defendant  ultimately  may  gain  nothing  from  his  limited 

success  on  appeal,  but  he  will  also  lose  nothing,  as  he  will serve  no  more  time  than  the  trial  court  originally  ordered. 

The practice the Government describes is not at odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from add-
ing  years  to  a  defendant's  sentence  on  their  own  initiative. 
It simply ensures that the sentence " `will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.' " 

Pimienta-Redondo, 
874 F. 2d, at 14 (quoting Wasman v.  United States, 468 U. S. 559,  564  (1984)).  And  the  assessment  will  be  made  by  the 

sentencing  judge  exercising  discretion,  not  by  an  appellate panel  ruling  on  an  issue  of  law  no  party  tendered  to  the 
court.8 This  is  not  a  "sentencing  package"  case.  Greenlaw  was 
unsuccessful on all his appellate issues.  There was no occa-sion  for  the  Court  of  Appeals  to  vacate  his  sentence  and  no 
warrant, in  the  absence  of a  cross-appeal,  to order  the  addi-
tion of 15 years to his sentence.9 

8 The dissent suggests that our reading of the cross-appeal rule is anom-
alous because it could bar a court of appeals from correcting an error that 
would increase a defendant's sentence, but after a "successful" appeal the 
district court itself could rely on that same error to increase the sentence. 
See post, at 264-265, and n. 2.  The cross-appeal rule, we of course agree, 
does not  confine the trial court.  But default and  forfeiture doctrines do. 
It would therefore be hard to imagine a case in which a district court, after 
a court of appeals vacated a criminal sentence, could properly increase the 
sentence based on  an error  the appeals court  left  uncorrected because  of 
the  cross-appeal  rule.  What  of  cases  remanded  post-Booker  on  defend-
ants' appeals, the dissent asks?  Post, at 265, n. 2.  In those cases, defend-
ants  invited  and  received  precisely  the  relief  they  sought,  and  the  Sixth 
Amendment required.  Neither the cross-appeal rule nor default and for-
feiture had any role to play. 

9 For  all  its  spirited  argument,  the  dissent  recognizes  the  narrow  gap 

between its core  position and the  Court's.  The cross-appeal rule, rooted 
in  the  principle  of  party  presentation,  the  dissent  concedes,  should  hold 
sway in the "vast majority of cases."  Post, at 259.  Does this case qualify 
as the  "rare"  exception  to the  "strong rule of  practice"  the  dissent advo-

SERVICES,  INC.   

Opinion of the Court   

aggregators  can  bring  suit  on  their  behalf.  See  Brief  for Respondents 3.  Typically, an individual aggregator collects 

claims  from  different  payphone  operators;  the  aggregator promises  to  remit  to  the  relevant  payphone  operator  (

i. e., 
the assignor of the claim) any dial-around compensation that is recovered; the aggregator then pursues the claims in court 

or  through  settlement  negotiations;  and  the  aggregator  is 
paid a fee for this service. The present litigation involves a group of aggregators who 

have taken claim assignments from approximately 1,400 pay-phone  operators.  Each  payphone  operator  signed  an  As-
signment and Power of Attorney Agreement (Agreement) in 
which  the  payphone  operator  "assigns,  transfers  and  sets 
over to [the aggregator] for purposes of collection all  rights, 
title and interest of the [payphone operator] in the [payphone 
operator's]  claims,  demands  or  causes  of  action  for  `DialAround  Compensation'  .  .  .  due  the  [payphone  operator]  for 
periods  since  October  1,  1997."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  114. 
The  Agreement  also  "appoints"  the  aggregator  as  the  pay-
phone  operator's  "true  and  lawful  attorney-in-fact."  Ibid. 
The Agreement provides that the aggregator will litigate "in 
the  [payphone  operator's]  interest."  Id.,  at  115.  And  the 
Agreement  further  stipulates  that  the  assignment  of  the 
claims  "may  not  be  revoked  without  the  written  consent  of 
the [aggregator]."  Ibid.  The aggregator and payphone op-
erator  then  separately  agreed  that  the  aggregator  would 
remit  all  proceeds  to  the  payphone  operator  and  that  the 
payphone operator would pay the aggregator for its services 
(typically via a quarterly charge). 

After  signing  the  agreements,  the  aggregators  (respond-
ents here) filed lawsuits in federal court seeking dial-around

carriers  (petitioners  here).  AT&T  moved  to  dismiss  the 
claims,  arguing  that  the  aggregators  lack  standing  to  sue

254 F. Supp. 2d 135, 140-141 (DC 2003), but changed its mind in light of a "long line of cases and legal treatises that recog-

nize a well-established principle that assignees for collection purposes  are  entitled  to  bring  suit  where  [as  here]  the  as-
signments  transfer  absolute  title  to  the  claims."  APCC 
Servs., Inc. v.  AT&T  Corp.,  281 F. Supp. 2d 41, 45 (DC 2003). After  consolidating  similar  cases,  a  divided  panel  of  the 

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that the aggregators have standing to sue, but held that the 
relevant  statutes  do  not  create  a  private  right  of  action. APCC Servs., Inc. v.  Sprint Communications Co., 418 F. 3d 
1238 (2005) (per curiam).  This Court granted the aggrega-tors'  petition  for  certiorari  on  the  latter  statutory  question, 
vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsider-ation  in  light  of 

Global  Crossing,  supra.  APCC  Services, Inc.  v.  Sprint  Communications  Co.,  550  U. S.  901  (2007). 

On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the orders  of the District  Court  allowing  the  litigation  to  go  forward.  489 
F. 3d 1249, 1250 (2007) (per curiam).  The long-distance car-riers  then  asked  us  to  consider  the  standing  question.  We 
granted certiorari, and we now affirm. 

II 
We begin with the most basic doctrinal principles: Article III,  $ 2,  of  the  Constitution  restricts  the  federal  "judicial 

Power"  to  the  resolution  of  "Cases"  and  "Controversies." That case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied only where 
a  plaintiff  has  standing.  See,  e. g.,  DaimlerChrysler  Corp. v. 

Cuno, 547  U. S. 332  (2006).  And  in order  to have  Article III standing, a plaintiff must adequately establish: (1) an in-

jury in fact (i. e., a "concrete and particularized" invasion of a "legally protected interest"); (2) causation (i. e., a " `fairly . . . 
trace[able]' "  connection  between  the  alleged  injury  in  fact and  the  alleged  conduct  of  the  defendant);  and  (3)  redress-
ability  (i. e.,  it  is  " `likely' "  and  not  "merely  `speculative' " that the plaintiff 's injury will be remedied by the relief plain-

tiff seeks in bringing suit).  Lujan v.  Defenders of Wildlife, 
504  U. S.  555,  560-561  (1992)  (calling  these  the  "irreducible 
constitutional minimum" requirements). 

In some sense, the aggregators clearly meet these require-
ments.  They base their suit upon a concrete and particular-
ized "injury in fact," namely, the carriers' failure to pay dial-
around  compensation.  The  carriers  "caused"  that  injury. 
And the litigation will "redress" that injury--if the suits are 
successful, the long-distance carriers will pay what they owe. 
The long-distance carriers argue, however, that the aggrega-
tors  lack  standing  because  it  was  the  payphone  operators 
(who  are  not  plaintiffs),  not  the  aggregators  (who  are  plain-
tiffs), who were "injured in fact" and that it is the payphone 
operators, not the aggregators, whose injuries a legal victory 
will  truly  "redress":  The  aggregators,  after  all,  will  remit 
all litigation  proceeds  to the  payphone  operators.  Brief for 
Petitioners  18.  Thus,  the  question  before  us  is  whether, 
under these circumstances, an assignee has  standing to pur-
sue the assignor's claims for money owed. 

We have often said that history and tradition offer a mean-
ingful guide to the types of cases that Article III empowers 
federal courts to consider.  See, e. g., Steel Co. v.  Citizens for 
Better  Environment,  523  U. S.  83,  102  (1998)  ("We  have  al-
ways  taken  [the  case-or-controversy  requirement]  to  mean 
cases  and  controversies  of  the  sort  traditionally  amenable 
to,  and  resolved  by,  the  judicial  process"  (emphasis  added)); 
GTE  Sylvania,  Inc.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  United  States, 
Inc.,  445  U. S.  375,  382  (1980)  ("The  purpose  of  the  case-or-
controversy  requirement  is  to  limit  the  business  of  federal 
courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in 
a  form  historically  viewed  as  capable  of  resolution  through 
the  judicial  process"  (emphasis  added;  internal  quotation

them  the  familiar  operations  of  the  English  judicial  system and  its  manifestations  on  this  side  of  the  ocean  before  the 

Union").  Consequently,  we  here  have  carefully  examined how  courts  have  historically  treated  suits  by  assignors  and 
assignees.  And we have discovered that history and prece-dent are clear on the question before us: Assignees of a claim, 
including  assignees  for  collection,  have  long  been  permitted to  bring  suit.  A  clear  historical  answer  at  least  demands 
reasons  for  change.  We  can  find  no  such  reasons  here,  and accordingly we conclude that the aggregators have standing. 

A 
We must begin with a minor concession.  Prior to the 17th century,  English  law  would  not  have  authorized  a  suit  like 

this  one.  But that is  because, with  only  limited  exceptions, English courts refused to recognize assignments at all.  See, 
e. g.,  Lampet's  Case,  10  Co.  Rep.  46b,  48a,  77  Eng.  Rep.  994, 997  (K. B.  1612) (stating  that  "no possibility,  right, title,  nor 
thing  in  action,  shall  be  granted  or  assigned  to  strangers" (footnote  omitted)); 

Penson  &  Higbed's  Case,  4  Leo.  99,  74 Eng. Rep. 756 (K. B. 1590) (refusing to recognize the right of 

an assignee of a right in contract); see also 9 J. Murray, Cor-bin on Contracts $ 47.3, p. 134 (rev. ed. 2007) (noting that the 
King was excepted from the basic rule and could, as a result, always receive assignments). 

Courts  then  strictly  adhered  to  the  rule  that  a  "chose  in action"--an  interest  in  property  not  immediately  reducible 
to  possession  (which,  over  time,  came  to  include  a  financial interest such as a debt, a legal claim for money, or a contrac-
tual right)--simply "could not be transferred to another per-son  by  the  strict  rules  of  the  ancient  common  law."  See  2 
W. Blackstone, Commentaries *442.  To permit transfer, the 
courts  feared,  would  lead  to  the  "multiplying  of  contentions and  suits," 

Lampet's  Case,  supra,  at  48a,  77  Eng.  Rep.,  at 
997, and would also promote "maintenance," i. e., officious in-

termeddling  with  litigation,  see  Holdsworth,  History  of  the Treatment of 

Choses in Action by the Common Law, 33 Harv. 
L. Rev. 997, 1006-1009 (1920). As  the  17th  century  began,   however,  str i c t  anti -

assignment rules seemed inconsistent with growing commer-cial  needs.  And  as  English  commerce  and  trade  expanded, 
courts  began  to  liberalize  the  rules  that  prevented  assign-
ments of choses in action.  See 9 Corbin, supra, $ 47.3, at 134 (suggesting that the "pragmatic necessities of trade" induced 

"evolution of the common law"); Holdsworth, supra, at 1021- 1022  (the  "common  law"  was  "induced"  to  change  because 
of  "considerations  of  mercantile  convenience  or  necessity"); 
J.  Ames,  Lectures  on  Legal  History  214  (1913)  (noting  that 
the  "objection  of maintenance" yielded to "the modern  com-
mercial  spirit").  By  the  beginning  of  the  18th  century, 
courts  routinely  recognized  assignments  of  equitable  (but 
not legal) interests in a chose in action: Courts of equity per-
mitted suits by an assignee who had equitable (but not legal) 
title.  And  courts  of  law  effectively  allowed  suits  either  by 
the  assignee  (who  had  equitable,  but  not  legal  title)  or  the 
assignor (who had legal, but not equitable title). 

To  be more  specific,  courts of  equity  would  simply  permit 
an  assignee  with  a  beneficial  interest  in  a  chose  in  action 
to  sue  in  his  own  name.  They  might,  however,  require  the 
assignee to  bring in  the  assignor  as a party  to  the action so 
as  to  bind  him  to  whatever  judgment  was  reached.  See, 
e. g., Warmstrey v.  Tanfield, 1 Ch. Rep. 29, 21 Eng. Rep. 498 
(1628-1629); Fashion v.  Atwood, 2 Ch. Cas.  36, 22 Eng. Rep.

Opinion of the Court 
equity would recognize the validity of the assignment of both debts  and  of  other  things  regarded  by  the  common  law  as 

choses in action"). Courts of law, meanwhile, would permit the assignee with 
an equitable  interest to bring  suit, but nonetheless  required the assignee to obtain a "power of attorney" from the holder 
of  the  legal  title,  namely,  the  assignor,  and  further  required the assignee to bring suit 

in the name of that assignor.  See, e. g., Cook, Alienability of Choses in Action, 29 Harv. L. Rev. 

816,  822  (1916)  ("[C]ommon  law  lawyers  were  able,  through the  device  of  the  `power  of  attorney'  .  .  .  to  enable  the  as-
signee  to  obtain  relief  in  common  law  proceedings  by  suing in  the name  of the assignor"); 29 R. Lord, Williston  on Con-
tracts $ 74:2, pp. 214-215 (4th ed. 2003).  Compare, e. g., Bar-row  v.  Gray,  Cro.  Eliz.  551,  78  Eng.  Rep.  797  (K.  B.  1653), 
and  South  &  Marsh's  Case,  3  Leo.  234,  74  Eng.  Rep.  654 (Exch.  1686)  (limiting  the  use  of  a  power  of  attorney  to 
cases in  which  the  assignor  owed the  assignee  a  debt),  with Holdsworth, 

supra, at 1021 (noting that English courts aban-doned  that  limitation  by  the  end  of  the  18th  century).  At 

the same time, courts of law would permit an assignor to sue even  when  he  had  transferred  away  his  beneficial  interest. 
And  they  permitted  the  assignor  to  sue  in  such  circum-stances  precisely  because  the  assignor  retained  legal  title. 
See,  e. g.,  Winch  v.  Keeley,  1  T.  R.  619,  99  Eng.  Rep.  1284 (K.  B.  1787)  (allowing  the  bankrupt  assignor  of  a  chose  in 
action to sue a debtor for the benefit of the assignee because the assignor possessed legal, though not equitable, title). 

The  upshot  is  that  by  the  time  Blackstone  published  vol-ume  II  of  his  Commentaries  in  1766,  he  could  dismiss  the 
"ancient common law" prohibition on assigning choses in ac-tion as a "nicety . . .  now  disregarded."  2 Blackstone, 

supra, at *442.

Legal  practice  in  the  United  States  largely  mirrored  that in  England.  In  the  latter  half  of  the  18th  century  and

Opinion of the Court   

throughout the 19th century, American courts regularly "ex-ercised  their  powers  in  favor  of  the  assignee,"  both  at  law 

and  in  equity.  9  Corbin  on  Contracts  $ 47.3,  at  137.  See, 
e. g.,  McCullum  v.  Coxe,  1  Dall.  139  (Pa.  1785)  (protecting 
assignee  of  a  debt  against  a  collusive  settlement  by  the  as-signor); 

Dennie  v.  Chapman,  1  Root  113,  115  (Conn.  Super. 
1789)  (assignee  of  a  nonnegotiable  note  can  bring  suit  "in 
the  name  of  the  original  promisee  or  his  administrator"); 
Andrews v.  Beecker, 1 Johns. Cas. 411, 411-412, n. (N. Y. Sup. 
Ct.  1800)  (per  curiam)  ("Courts  of  law  .  .  .  are,  in  justice, bound  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  assignees,  as  much  as  a 

court  of  equity,  though  they  may  still  require  the  action  to 
be  brought  in  the  name  of  the  assignor");  Riddle  &  Co.  v. 
Mandeville,  5  Cranch  322  (1809)  (assignees  of  promissory 
notes  entitled  to  bring  suit  in  equity).  Indeed,  $ 11  of  the 
Judiciary  Act  of  1789  specifically  authorized  federal  courts 
to  take  "cognizance  of  any  suit  to  recover  the  contents  of 
any  promissory  note  or  other  chose  in  action  in  favour  of 
an  assignee"  so  long  as  federal  jurisdiction  would  lie  if  the 
assignor himself had brought suit.  1 Stat. 79. 

Thus,  in  1816,  Justice  Story,  writing  for  a  unanimous 
Court,  summarized  the  practice  in  American  courts  as  fol-
lows:  "Courts  of  law,  following  in  this  respect  the  rules  of 
equity,  now  take  notice  of  assignments  of  choses  in  action, 
and exert themselves to afford them every support and pro-
tection."  Welch  v.  Mandeville,  1  Wheat.  233,  236.  He 
added  that  courts  of  equity  have  "disregarded  the  rigid 
strictness of the common law, and protected the rights of the 
assignee  of  choses  in  action,"  and  noted  that  courts  of  com-
mon law "now consider an assignment of a chose in action as 
substantially  valid,  only  preserving,  in  certain  cases,  the 
form  of  an  action  commenced  in  the  name  of  the  assignor." 
Id., at 237, n. 

It  bears noting,  however, that  at the  time of  the  founding 
(and in some States well before then) the law did permit the 
assignment  of  legal  title  to  at  least  some  choses  in  action.

Opinion of the Court 
In  such  cases,  the  assignee  could  bring  suit  on  the  assigned claim  in  his  own  name,  in  a  court  of  law.  See,  e. g.,  Act  of 

Oct.  1705,  Ch.  XXXIV,  3  Va.  Stat.  378  (W.  Hening  ed.  1823) (reprinted  1969) (permitting  any person  to "assign  or trans-
fer  any  bond  or  bill  for  debt  over  to  any  other  person"  and providing that "the assignee or assignees, his and their exec-
utors  and  administrators  by  virtue  of  such  assignment  shall and may have lawfull power to commence and prosecute any 
suit at law in  his or their  own  name or  names"); Act of May 28,  1715,  Ch.  XXVIII,  Gen.  Laws  of  Penn.  60  (J.  Dunlop 
comp. 2d ed. 1849) (permitting the assignment of "bonds, spe-cialties,  and  notes"  and  authorizing  "the  person  or  persons, 
to  whom  the  said  bonds,  specialties  or  notes,  are  .  .  .  as-signed" to "commence and prosecute his, her or their actions 
at law"); Patent Act of 1793, ch. 11, $ 4, 1 Stat. 322 ("[I]t shall be  lawful  for  any  inventor,  his  executor  or  administrator  to 
assign the title and interest in the said invention, at anytime, and  the  assignee  .  .  .  shall  thereafter  stand  in  the  place  of 
the  original  inventor,  both  as  to  right  and  responsibility"). 

C 
By  the  19th  century,  courts  began  to  consider  the  specific question presented here: whether an assignee of a legal claim 

for  money  could  sue  when  that  assignee  had  promised  to give  all  litigation  proceeds  back  to  the  assignor.  During 
that  century  American  law  at  the  state  level  became  less formalistic  through  the  merger  of  law  and  equity,  through 
statutes  more  generously  permitting  an  assignor  to  pass legal  title  to  an  assignee,  and  through  the  adoption  of  rules 
that  permitted  any  "real  party  in  interest"  to  bring  suit. See  6A  C.  Wright,  A.  Miller,  &  M.  Kane,  Federal  Practice 
and Procedure  $ 1541, pp. 320-321  (2d  ed. 1990)  (hereinafter Wright  &  Miller);  see  also  9  Corbin,  supra,  $ 47.3,  at  137. 
The courts recognized that pre-existing law permitted an as-signor  to bring  suit  on  a claim even  though  the  assignor  re-
tained  nothing  more  than  naked  legal  title.  Since  the  law

Opinion of the Court   

increasingly  permitted  the  transfer  of  legal  title  to  an  as-signee,  courts  agreed  that  assignor  and  assignee  should  be 

treated  alike  in  this  respect.  And  rather  than  abolish  the assignor's well-established right to sue on the basis of naked 
legal  title  alone,  many  courts  instead  extended  the  same 
right to an assignee.  See, e. g., Clark & Hutchins, The Real 
Party  in  Interest,  34  Yale  L.  J.  259,  264-265  (1925)  (noting 
that the changes in the law permitted both the assignee with "naked  legal title" and the  assignee with  an equitable  inter-

est in a claim to bring suit). Thus,  during  the  19th  century,  most  state  courts  enter-
tained  suits  virtually  identical  to  the  litigation  before  us: suits  by  individuals  who  were  assignees  for  collection  only, 
i. e.,  assignees  who  brought  suit  to  collect  money  owed  to their  assignors  but  who  promised  to  turn  over  to  those  as-
signors  the  proceeds  secured  through  litigation.  See,  e. g., 
Webb & Hepp  v.  Morgan,  McClung  &  Co.,  14  Mo.  428,  431 
(1851)  (holding  that  the  assignees  of  a  promissory  note  for 
collection only can bring suit,  even though they lack a bene-ficial interest in the note, because the assignment "creates in 

them such  legal interest,  that  they thereby  become  the per-sons  to  sue");

(1871) (allowing suit by the assignee of a cause of action even 
though  the  assignors  " `expected  to  receive  the  amount  re-
covered  in  the  action,' "  because  the  assignee,  as  "legal 
holder of the claim," was "the real party in interest"); Sear-
ing  v.  Berry,  58  Iowa  20,  23,  24,  11  N.  W.  708,  709  (1882) 
(where  legal  title  to  a  judgment  was  assigned  "merely  for 
the  purpose  of  enabling  plaintiff  to  enforce  its  collection" 
and  the  assignor  in  fact  retained  the  beneficial  interest,  the 
plaintiff-assignee  could  "prosecute  this  suit  to  enforce  the

though  the  assignment  was  "for  the  purpose  of  collection" and the assignee had "no interest other than that of the legal

228,  235,  33  P.  1042,  1044,  1045  (1893)  (holding  that  an  as-signee could bring suit based on causes of action assigned to 

him "simply to enable him to sue" and who "would turn over to  the  assignors  all  that  was  recovered  in  the  action,  after

condition  that  when  the  sum  is  collected  the  whole  or  some part of it must be paid over to the assignor").  See also Ap-
pendix,  infra  (collecting  cases  from  numerous  other  States approving of suits by assignees for collection). 

Of  course,  the  dissent  rightly  notes,  some  States  during 
this  period  of  time  refused  to  recog nize  assig nee-for-
collection  suits,  or  otherwise  equivocated  on  the  matter.

States  allowed  these  suits  that  by  1876,  the  distinguished 
procedure and equity scholar John Norton Pomeroy declared 
it  "settled  by  a  great  preponderance  of  authority,  although 
there is some conflict" that an assignee is "entitled to sue in 
his  own  name"  whenever  the  assignment  vests  "legal  title" 
in the assignee, and notwithstanding "any contemporaneous, 
collateral  agreement  by  virtue  of  which  he  is  to  receive  a 
part only of the proceeds . . . or even is to thus account [to the 
assignor] for the whole proceeds."  Remedies and Remedial 
Rights  $ 132,  p.  159  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted;  em-

same  basic  conclusion.  See,  e. g.,  P.  Bliss,  A  Treatise  Upon the  Law  of  Pleading  $ 51,  p.  69  (2d  ed.  1887)  (stating  that 

"[m]ost of the courts have held that where negotiable paper has  been  indorsed,  or  other  choses  in  action  have  been  as-
signed,  it  does  not  concern  the  defendant  for  what  purpose the  transfer  has  been  made"  and  giving  examples  of  States 
permitting assignees to bring suit even where they lacked a 
beneficial  interest  in  the  assigned  claims  (emphasis  added)). See also Clark & Hutchins, 

supra, at 264 ("[M]any, probably 
most,  American  jurisdictions"  have  held  that  "an  assignee who has no beneficial interest, like an assignee for collection 

only,  may  prosecute  an  action  in  his  own  name"  (emphasis 
added)).  Even  Michael  Ferguson's  California  Law  Review 
Comment--which  the  dissent  cites  as  support  for  its  argu-
ment about "the divergent practice" among the courts, post, 
at 310--recognizes that "[a] majority of courts has held that 
an  assignee  for  collection  only  is  a  real  party  in  interest" 
entitled to bring suit.  See Comment, The Real Party in In-
terest Rule Revitalized: Recognizing Defendant's Interest in 
the Determination of Proper Parties Plaintiff, 55 Cal. L. Rev. 
1452,  1475  (1967)  (emphasis  added);  see  also  id.,  at  1476, 
n. 118 (noting that even "[t]he few courts that have waivered 
on  the  question  have  always  ended  up  in  the  camp  of  the 
majority" (emphasis added)). 

During  this  period,  a  number  of  federal  courts  similarly 
indicated  approval  of  suits  by  assignees  for  collection  only. 
See,  e. g.,  Bradford  v.  Jenks,  3  F.  Cas.  1132,  1134  (No.  1,769) 
(CC  Ill.  1840)  (stating  that  the  plaintiff,  the  receiver  of  a 
bank,  could  bring  suit  in  federal  court  to  collect  on  a  note 
owed  to  that  bank  if  he  sued  as  the  bank's  assignee,  not  its 
receiver,  but  ultimately  holding  that  the  plaintiff  could  not 
sue  as  an  assignee  because  there  was  no  diversity  jurisdic-
tion); Orr v.  Lacy, 18 F. Cas. 834 (No. 10,589) (CC Mich. 1847)

exchange, on the ground that, as endorsee, he had the "legal

ceeds of the litigation would be turned over to the endorser); 
Murdock  v.  The  Emma  Graham,  17  F.  Cas.  1012,  1013  (No. 
9,940)  (SD  Ohio  1878)  (permitting  the  assignee  of  a  claim for  injury  to  a  "float  or  barge"  to  bring  suit  when,  "under 

the assignment," the assignor's creditors would benefit from the  litigation); 

The  Rupert  City,  213  F.  263,  266-267  (WD 
Wash.  1914)  (assignees  of  claims  for  collection  only  could 
bring  suit  in  maritime  law  because  "an  assignment  for collection  .  .  .  vest[s]  such  an  interest  in  [an]  assignee  as  to 

entitle him to sue"). Even  this  Court long  ago  indicated  that  assignees  for  col-
lection only can properly bring suit.  For example, in Waite 
v.  Santa  Cruz,  184  U. S.  302  (1902),  the  plaintiff  sued  to  col-
lect  on  a  number  of  municipal  bonds  and  coupons  whose 
"legal  title"  had  been  vested  in  him  but  which  were  trans-
ferred to him "for collection only."  Id., at 324.  The Court, 
in  a  unanimous  decision,  ultimately  held  that  the  federal 
courts  could  not  hear  his  suit  because  the  amount-in-
controversy  requirement  of  diversity  jurisdiction  would  not 
have  been  satisfied  if  the  bondholders  and  coupon  holders 
had  sued  individually.  See  id.,  at  328-329.  However,  be-
fore  reaching  this  holding,  the  Court  expressly  stated  that 
the  suit  could  properly  be  brought  in  federal  court  "if  the 
only objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is that 
the  plaintiff  was  invested  with  the  legal  title  to  the  bonds 
and  coupons  simply  for  purposes  of  collection."  Id.,  at  325. 

Next,  in  Spiller  v.  Atchison,  T.  &  S.  F.  R.  Co.,  253  U. S. 
117  (1920),  a  large  number  of  cattle  shippers  assigned  to 
Spiller  (the  secretary  of  a  Cattle  Raiser's  Association)  their 
individual  reparation  claims  against  railroads  they  said  had 
charged  them  excessive  rates.  The  Federal  Court  of  Ap-
peals held that Spiller could not bring suit because, in effect, 
he  was an  assignee for  collection  only  and  would be  passing 
back  to  the  cattle  shippers  any  money  he  recovered  from 
the litigation.  In a unanimous decision, this Court reversed. 
The Court wrote that the cattle shippers' "assignments were

Opinion of the Court   

absolute  in  form"  and  "plainly"  "vest[ed]  the  legal  title  in Spiller." 

Id.,  at  134.  The  Court  conceded  that  the  assign-
ments  did  not  pass  "beneficial  or  equitable  title"  to  Spiller. 
Ibid.  But the Court then said that "this was not necessary 
to  support  the  right  of  the  assignee  to  claim  an  award  of reparation  and  enable  him  to  recover  it  by  action  at  law 

brought in his own name but for the benefit of the equitable 
owners  of  the  claims."  Ibid.  The  Court  thereby  held that  Spiller's  legal  title  alone  was  sufficient  to  allow  him  to 

bring  suit  in  federal  court  on  the  aggregated  claims  of  his assignors. 

Similarly,  in  Titus  v.  Wallick,  306  U. S.  282  (1939),  this 
Court  unanimously  held  that  (under  New  York  law)  a  plain-
tiff, an  assignee for collection, had  "dominion  over the  claim 
for  purposes  of  suit"  because  the  assignment  purported  to 
" `sell,  assign,  transfer  and  set  over'  the  chose  in  action"  to 
the  assignee.  Id.,  at  289.  More  importantly  for  present 
purposes,  the  Court  said  that  the  assignment's  "legal  effect 
was not curtailed by the recital that the assignment was for 
purposes of suit and that its proceeds were to be turned over 
or accounted for to another."  Ibid. 

To  be  clear,  we  do  not  suggest  that  the  Court's  decisions 
in Waite, Spiller, and Titus conclusively resolve the standing 
question  before  us.  We  cite  them  because  they  offer  addi-
tional and powerful support for the proposition that suits by 
assignees  for  collection  have  long  been  seen  as  "amenable" 
to  resolution  by  the  judicial  process.  Steel  Co.,  523  U. S., 
at 102. 

Finally,  we  note  that  there  is  also  considerable,  more  re-
cent  authority  showing  that  an  assignee  for  collection  may 
properly  sue  on  the  assigned  claim  in  federal  court.  See, 
e. g.,  6A  Wright  &  Miller  $ 1545,  at  346-348  (noting  that  an 
assignee  with  legal  title  is  considered  to  be  a  real  party  in 
interest  and  that  as  a  result  "federal  courts  have  held  that 
an assignee for purposes of collection who holds legal title to 
the  debt  according  to  the  governing  substantive  law  is  the

The  history  and  precedents  that  we  have  summarized 
make clear that courts have long found ways to allow assign-
ees to bring suit; that where assignment is at issue, courts-- 
both before and after the founding-- have always permitted 
the  party  with  legal  title  alone  to  bring  suit;  and  that  there 
is a strong tradition specifically of suits by assignees for col-
lection.  We  find  this  history  and  precedent  "well  nigh  con-
clusive" in respect to the issue before us: Lawsuits by assign-
ees,  including  assignees  for  collection  only,  are  "cases  and 
controversies  of  the  sort  traditionally  amenable  to,  and  re-
solved  by,  the  judicial  process."  Vermont  Agency  of  Natu-
ral Resources v.  United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 
777-778 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

III 
Petitioners  have  not  offered  any  convincing  reason  why 
we  should  depart  from  the  historical  tradition  of  suits  by 
assignees,  including  assignees  for  collection.  In  any  event, 
we  find  that  the  assignees  before  us  satisfy  the  Article  III

Opinion of the Court   

standing requirements articulated in more modern decisions of this Court. 

Petitioners  argue,  for  example, that  the  aggregators  have not  themselves  suffered  any  injury  in  fact  and  that  the  as-
signments  for  collection  "do  not  suffice  to  transfer  the  pay-phone  operators'  injuries."  Brief  for  Petitioners  18.  It  is, 
of course, true that the aggregators did not originally suffer 
any  injury  caused  by  the  long-distance  carriers;  the  pay-phone  operators  did.  But  the  payphone  operators  assigned 

their  claims  to the  aggregators lock,  stock,  and barrel.  See 
APCC  Servs.,  418  F.  3d,  at  1243  (there  is  "no  reason  to  be-
lieve  the assignment  is anything  less than a complete trans-
fer to the aggregator" of the injury and resulting claim); see 
also App. to Pet. for Cert. 114 (Agreement provides that each 
payphone  operator  "assigns,  transfers  and  sets  over"  to  the 
aggregator "all rights, title and interest" in dial-around com-
pensation  claims).  And  within  the  past  decade  we  have 
expressly held that an assignee can sue based on his assign-
or's  injuries.  In  Vermont  Agency,  supra,  we  considered 
whether  a  qui  tam  relator  possesses  Article  III  standing  to 
bring  suit  under  the  False  Claims  Act,  which  authorizes  a 
private  party  to  bring  suit  to  remedy  an  injury  (fraud)  that 
the United States, not the private party, suffered.  We held 
that such a relator does possess standing.  And we said that 
is  because  the  Act  "effect[s]  a  partial  assignment  of  the 
Government's  damages  claim"  and  that  assignment  of  the 
"United  States'  injury  in  fact  suffices  to  confer  standing  on 
[the relator]."  Id., at 773, 774.  Indeed, in Vermont Agency 
we  stated  quite  unequivocally  that  "the  assignee  of  a  claim 
has  standing  to  assert  the  injury  in  fact  suffered  by  the  as-
signor."  Id., at 773. 

Petitioners next argue that the aggregators cannot satisfy 
the  redressability  requirement  of  standing  because,  if  suc-
cessful  in  this  litigation,  the  aggregators  will  simply  remit 
the litigation proceeds to the payphone operators.  But peti-
tioners misconstrue the  nature of our  redressability inquiry.

Opinion of the Court 
That inquiry focuses, as it should, on whether the injury that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litiga-

tion--not on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money he recovers.  See, 

e. g., id., at 771 (to demonstrate 
redressability,  the  plaintiff  must  show  a  "substantial  likeli-hood that the requested relief will remedy 

the alleged injury 
in fact" (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); 
Lujan,  504  U. S.,  at  561  ("[I]t  must  be  likely . . .  that  the 
injury  will  be  redressed  by  a  favorable  decision"  (internal 
quotation  marks  omitted;  emphasis  added)).  Here,  a  legal victory would unquestionably redress the 

injuries for which 
the aggregators bring suit.  The aggregators' injuries relate 
to  the  failure  to  receive  the  required  dial-around  compensa-
tion.  And  if  the  aggregators  prevail  in  this  litigation,  the 
long-distance  carriers  would  write  a  check  to  the  aggre-
gators  for  the  amount  of  dial-around  compensation  owed. 
What does it matter what the aggregators do with the money 
afterward?  The  injuries  would  be  redressed  whether  the 
aggregators  remit  the  litigation  proceeds  to  the  payphone 
operators,  donate  them  to  charity,  or  use  them  to  build 
new corporate headquarters.  Moreover, the statements our 
prior  cases  made  about  the  need  to  show  redress  of  the  in-
jury  are  consistent  with  what  numerous  authorities  have 
long held in the assignment context, namely, that an assignee 
for  collection  may  properly  bring  suit  to  redress  the  injury 
originally  suffered  by  his  assignor.  Petitioners  might  dis-
agree with those authorities.  But petitioners have not pro-
vided us with a good reason to reconsider them. 

The dissent  argues  that  our  redressability analysis "could 
not  be  more  wrong,"  because  "[w]e  have  never  approved 
federal-court jurisdiction over a claim where the entire relief 
requested will run to a party not before the court.  Never." 
Post,  at  302.  But  federal  courts  routinely  entertain  suits 
which will result in relief for parties that are not themselves 
directly bringing  suit.  Trustees bring suits to benefit their 
trusts; guardians ad litem bring suits to benefit their wards;

SERVICES,  INC.   

Opinion of the Court   

receivers  bring  suit  to benefit  their  receiverships;  assignees in  bankruptcy  bring suit to benefit bankrupt estates;  execu-

tors bring suit to benefit testator estates; and so forth.  The dissent's  view  of  redressability,  if  taken  seriously,  would 
work a sea change in the law.  Moreover, to the extent that trustees,  guardians  ad  litem,  and  the  like  have  some  sort 
of  "obligation"  to  the  parties whose  interests they  vindicate 
through litigation, see post, at 304-305, n. 2, the same is true in respect to the aggregators here.  The aggregators have a 

contractual  obligation  to  litigate  "in  the  [payphone  opera-tor's]  interest."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  115a.  (And  if  the 
aggregators  somehow  violate  that  contractual  obligation, 
say, by agreeing to settle the claims against the long-distance 
providers  in  exchange  for  a  kickback  from  those  providers, 
each  payphone  operator  would  be  able  to  bring  suit  for 
breach of contract.) 

Petitioners  also  make  a  further  conceptual  argument. 
They point to cases in which this Court has said that a party 
must  possess  a  "personal  stake"  in  a  case  in  order  to  have 
standing  under  Article  III.  See  Baker  v.  Carr,  369  U. S. 
186,  204  (1962).  And  petitioners  add  that,  because  the  ag-
gregators will not actually benefit from a victory in this case, 
they lack a "personal stake" in the litigation's outcome.  The 
problem  with  this  argument  is  that  the  general  "personal 
stake"  requirement  and  the  more  specific  standing  require-
ments  (injury  in  fact,  redressability,  and  causation)  are  flip 
sides  of  the  same  coin.  They  are  simply  different  descrip-
tions  of  the  same  judicial  effort  to  ensure,  in  every  case  or 
controversy,  "that  concrete  adverseness  which  sharpens  the 
presentation  of  issues  upon  which  the  court  so  largely  de-
pends  for  illumination."  Ibid.  See  also  Massachusetts  v. 
EPA,  549  U. S.  497,  517  (2007)  ("At  bottom,  the  gist  of  the 
question of standing is whether petitioners have such a per-
sonal  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the  controversy  as  to  assure 
that  concrete  adverseness"  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-
ted)).  Courts, during the past two centuries, appear to have

289 Cite as: 554 U. S. 269 (2008) 
Opinion of the Court 
found that "concrete adverseness" where an assignee for col-lection  brings  a  lawsuit.  And  petitioners  have  provided  us 

with no grounds for reaching a contrary conclusion. Petitioners  make  a  purely  functional  argument,  as  well. 
Read as a whole, they  say, the  assignments in  this litigation constitute  nothing  more  than  a  contract  for  legal  services. 
We  think  this  argument  is  overstated.  There  is  an  impor-tant  distinction  between  simply  hiring  a  lawyer  and  assign-
ing  a  claim  to  a  lawyer  (on  the  lawyer's  promise  to  remit litigation  proceeds).  The  latter  confers  a  property  right 
(which creditors might attach); the former does not. Finally,  we  note,  as  a  practical  matter,  that  it  would  be 
particularly unwise for us to abandon history and precedent in resolving the question before us.  Were we to agree with 
petitioners  that  the  aggregators  lack  standing,  our  holding could  easily  be  overcome.  For  example,  the  Agreement 
could  be  rewritten  to  give  the  aggregator  a  tiny  portion  of the  assigned  claim  itself,  perhaps  only  a  dollar  or  two.  Or 
the  payphone  operators  might  assign  all of  their  claims  to  a "Dial-Around  Compensation  Trust"  and  then  pay  a  trustee 
(perhaps the aggregator) to bring suit on behalf of the trust. Accordingly,  the  far  more  sensible  course  is  to  abide  by  the 
history  and  tradition  of  assignee  suits  and  find  that  the  ag-gregators possess Article III standing. 

IV 
Petitioners argue that, even if the aggregators have stand-ing  under  Article  III,  we  should  nonetheless  deny  them 

standing for a number of prudential reasons.  See Elk Grove Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U. S.  1,  11  (2004)  (pru-
dential  standing  doctrine  "embodies  judicially  self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction" (internal quota-
tion marks omitted)). First,  petitioners  invoke  certain  prudential  limitations 
that  we  have  imposed  in  prior  cases  where  a  plaintiff  has sought to assert the legal claims of third parties.  See, 

e. g.,

Opinion of the Court   

Warth  v.  Seldin,  422  U. S.  490,  501  (1975)  (expressing  a  "re-luctance to exert judicial power when the plaintiff 's claim to 

relief  rests  on  the  legal  rights  of  third  parties");  Arlington 
Heights  v.  Metropolitan  Housing  Development  Corp.,  429 
U. S. 252, 263 (1977) ("In the ordinary case, a party is denied standing to assert the rights of third persons"); 

Secretary of 
State  of  Md.  v.  Joseph  H.  Munson  Co.,  467  U. S.  947,  955 
(1984)  (a  plaintiff  ordinarily  " `cannot  rest  his  claim  to  relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties' "). 

These third-party cases, however, are not on point.  They concern  plaintiffs  who  seek  to  assert  not  their  own  legal 
rights,  but  the  legal  rights  of  others.  See,  e. g.,  Warth, 
supra,  at  499  (plaintiff  "generally must  assert  his  own  legal 
rights  and  interests,  and  cannot  rest  his  claim  to  relief  on 
the  legal  rights  or  interests  of  third  parties"  (emphasis 
added));  see  also  Kowalski  v.  Tesmer,  543  U. S.  125  (2004) 
(lawyers  lack  standing  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of 
defendants deprived of appointed counsel on appeal); Powers 
v.  Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991) (permitting a criminal defendant 
to  assert  rights  of  juror  discriminated  against  because  of 
race);  Craig  v.  Boren,  429  U. S.  190  (1976)  (permitting  beer 
vendors to assert rights of prospective male customers aged 
18  to  21  who,  unlike  females  of  the  same  ages,  were  barred 
from  purchasing  beer).  Here,  the  aggregators  are  suing 
based  on  injuries  originally  suffered  by  third  parties.  But 
the  payphone  operators  assigned  to  the  aggregators  all 
"rights, title and  interest" in  claims based  on those injuries. 
Thus, in the litigation before us, the aggregators assert what 
are, due to that transfer, legal rights of their own.  The ag-
gregators,  in  other  words,  are  asserting  first-party,  not 
third-party, legal rights.  Moreover, we add that none of the 
third-party  cases  cited  by  petitioners  involved  assignments 
or  purported  to  overturn  the  longstanding  doctrine  permit-
ting an assignee to bring suit on an assigned claim. 

Second, petitioners suggest that the litigation here simply

operators  to  circumvent  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure 23's  class-action  requirements.  But  we  do  not  understand 

how  "circumvention"  of  Rule  23  could  constitute  a  basis  for denying  standing  here.  For  one  thing,  class  actions  are 
permissive, not mandatory.  More importantly, class actions constitute  but  one  of  several  methods  for  bringing  about 
aggregation  of  claims,  i. e.,  they  are  but  one  of  several 
methods  by  which  multiple  similarly  situated  parties  get similar claims resolved at one time and in one federal forum. 

See  Rule  20(a)  (permitting  joinder  of  multiple  plaintiffs); Rule 42 (permitting consolidation of related cases filed in the 
same district court); 28 U. S. C. $ 1407 (authorizing consolida-
tion of pretrial proceedings for related cases filed in multiple 
federal districts); $ 1404 (making it possible for related cases 
pending in different federal courts to be transferred and con-
solidated  in  one  district  court);  D.  Herr,  Annotated  Manual 
for  Complex  Litigation  $ 20.12,  p.  279  (4th  ed.  2007)  (noting 
that "[r]elated cases pending  in  different federal courts may 
be  consolidated  in  a  single  district"  by  transfer  under  28 
U. S. C. $ 1404(a)); J. Tidmarsh & R. Trangsrud, Complex Lit-
igation and the Adversary System 473-524 (1998) (section on 
"Transfer Devices that Aggregate Cases in a Single Venue"). 
Because  the  federal  system  permits  aggregation  by  other 
means,  we  do  not  think  that  the  aggregators  should  be  de-
nied  standing  simply  because  the  payphone  operators  chose 
one aggregation method over another. 

Petitioners  also  point  to  various  practical  problems  that 
could  arise  because  the  aggregators,  rather  than  the  pay-
phone operators, are suing.  In particular, they say that the 
payphone operators may not comply with discovery requests 
served on them, that the payphone operators may not honor 
judgments reached in this case, and that petitioners may not 
be  able  to  bring,  in  this  litigation,  counterclaims  against 
the  payphone  operators.  See  Brief  for  Petitioners  46-48. 
Even assuming  all that is so,  courts have long  permitted as-
signee lawsuits notwithstanding the fact that such problems

could  arise.  Regardless,  courts  are  not  helpless  in  the  face of  such  problems.  For  example,  a  district  court  can,  if  ap-

propriate, compel a party to collect and to produce whatever discovery-related  information  is  necessary.  See  Fed.  Rules 
Civ.  Proc.  26(b)(1),  30-31,  33-36.  That  court  might  grant  a motion  to  join  the  payphone  operators  to  the  case  as  "re-
quired" parties.  See Rule 19.  Or the court might allow the carriers to file a third-party complaint against the payphone 
operators.  See  Rule  14(a).  And  the  carriers  could  always ask the Federal Communications Commission to find admin-
istrative  solutions  to  any  remaining  practical  problems. Cf.  47  U. S. C.  $ 276(b)(1)(A)  (authorizing  the  FCC  to  "pre-
scribe  regulations"  that  "ensure  that  all  payphone  service providers  are  fairly  compensated  for  each  and  every  com-
pleted [dial-around] call").  We do not say that the litigation before  us  calls  for  the  use  of  any  such  procedural  device. 
We  mention  them  only  to  explain  the  lack  of  any  obvious need for  the  remedy that  the  carriers here  propose, namely, 
denial of standing. Finally,  we  note  that  in  this  litigation,  there  has  been  no 
allegation that the assignments were made in bad faith.  We note,  as  well,  that  the  assignments  were  made  for  ordinary 
business  purposes.  Were  this  not  so,  additional  prudential questions might perhaps arise.  But these questions are not 
before us, and we need not consider them here. 

V  
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.   

It is so ordered.

1.  Webb  &  Hepp  v.  Morgan,  McClung  &  Co.,  14  Mo.  428, 
431  (1851)  (holding  that  the  assignees  of  a  promissory  note 
for  collection  only  can  bring  suit,  even  though  they  lack  a 
beneficial  interest  in  the  note,  because  the  assignment  "cre-
ates  in  them  such  legal  interest,  that  they  thereby  become 
the persons to sue"); 

2.  Castner  v.  Austin  Sumner  &  Co.,  2  Minn.  44,  47-48 
(1858)  (holding  that  the  assignees  of  promissory  notes  were 
proper  plaintiffs,  regardless  of  the  arrangement  they  and 
their  assignor  had  made  in  respect  to  the  proceeds  of  the 
litigation,  because  the  defendants  "can  only  raise  the  objec-
tion  of  a  defect  of  parties  to  the  suit,  when  it  appears  that 
some  other  person  or  party  than  the  Plaintiffs  have  such  a 
legal  interest  in  the  note  that  a  recovery  by  the  Plaintiffs 
would  not  preclude  it  from  being  enforced,  and  they  be 
thereby  subjected  to  the  risk  of  another  suit  for  the  same 
subject-matter" (emphasis added)); 

3.  Cottle v.  Cole,  20 Iowa 481, 485-486 (1866) (holding that 
the  assignee  could  sue,  notwithstanding  the  possibility  that 
the assignor was the party "beneficially interested in the ac-
tion,"  because  "[t]he  course  of  decision  in  this  State  estab-
lishes this rule, viz.: that the party holding the  legal title of 
a note or instrument may sue on it though he be an agent or 
trustee,  and  liable  to  account  to  another  for  the  proceeds  of 
the recovery"); 

4.  Allen v.  Brown, 44 N. Y. 228, 231, 234 (1870) (opinion of 
Hunt,  Comm'r)  (holding  that  the  assignee  with  legal  title  to 
a  cause  of  action  was  "legally  the  real  party  in  interest" 
"[e]ven if he be liable to another as a debtor upon his contract 
for the collection he may thus make"); 

5.  Meeker v.  Claghorn, 44 N. Y. 349, 350, 353 (1871) (opin-
ion of Earl, Comm'r) (allowing suit by the assignee of a cause 
of action even though the assignors " `expected to receive the 
amount  recovered  in  the  action,' "  because  the  assignee,  as 
"legal holder of the claim," was "the real party in interest");

6.  Hays v.  Hathorn, 74 N. Y. 486,  490  (1878) (holding that so long as an assignee has legal title to the assigned commer-

cial  paper,  the  assignee  may  bring  suit  even  if  the  assign-ment was "merely for  the  purpose  of collection"  and he acts 
merely  as  "equitable  trustee"  for  the  assignor,  i. e.,  the  as-signor maintains the beneficial interest in the paper); 

7.  Searing  v.  Berry,  58  Iowa  20,  23,  24,  11  N.  W.  708,  709 (1882) (where legal title to a judgment was assigned "merely 
for the purpose of enabling plaintiff to enforce the collection" 
and  the  assignor  in  fact  retained  the  beneficial  interest,  the plaintiff-assignee  could  "prosecute  this  suit  to  enforce  the 

collection of the judgment");

ing,  in  light  of  the  "recognized  practice  in  this  state,"  that 
the  assignee  could  bring  suit  to  recover  on  certain  accounts 
even  where  the  assignment  of  the  accounts  had  been  made 
"with  the  agreement that  they  were to [be]  [he]ld  solely  for 
the purpose of [the litigation]," i. e., the assignor maintained 
the beneficial interest in the accounts (emphasis added)); 

9.  Grant v.  Heverin, 77 Cal. 263, 265, 264, 19 P. 493 (1888) 
(holding  that  the  assignee  of  a  bond  could  bring  suit,  even 
though  he  lacked  a  beneficial  interest  in  the  bond,  and  en-
dorsing Pomeroy's rule as "a clear and correct explication of 
the law"); 

10.  Young  v.  Hudson,  99  Mo.  102,  106,  12  S.  W.  632,  633 
(1889)  (holding  that  an  assignee  could  sue  to  collect  on  an 
account for merchandise sold, even though the money would 
be remitted to the assignor, because "[a]n assignee of a chose 
in  action  arising  out  of  contract  may  sue  upon  it  in  his  own 
name,  though  the  title  was  passed  to  him  only  for  the  pur-

by someone else);

13.  Anderson v.  Reardon, 46  Minn.  185, 186, 48  N.  W. 777 (1891) (where plaintiff had been assigned a claim on the "un-

assignor  less  the  "amount  due  him  for  services  already  ren-dered,  and  to  be  thereafter  rendered"  to  the  assignor,  the 

plaintiff  could  bring  suit,  even  though  he  had  "already  col-lected  on  the demand  enough  to  pay his  own claim for  serv-
ices  up  to  that  time,"  because  "[i]t  is  no  concern  of  the  de-
fendant  whether  the  assignee of a  claim  receives the  money

14.  McDaniel v.  Pressler, 3 Wash. 636, 638, 637, 29 P. 209,

the  real  party  in  interest,  even  though  the  assignment  was 
"for  the  purpose  of  collection"  and  the  assignee  had  "no  in-
terest other than that of the legal holder of said notes");

demand"  and  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  "there  was  an 
agreement  between  the  [assignor]  and  the  plaintiff  that  the 
latter took the [assignment] only for collection");

legal title to contractual rights, where the assignor retained 
the beneficial interest, noting that the doctrine that "prevails 
in  Colorado"  is  that  the  assignee  may  bring  suit  in  his  own 
name  "although  there  may  be  annexed  to  the  transfer  the 
condition  that  when  the  sum  is  collected  the  whole  or  some

an adverse judgment against assignee was barred by res ju-

an  action  on  an  account  which  has  been  assigned  to  him  for 
the  purpose  of  collection,  only"  because  such  parties  are

the  beneficial  interest  in  the  outcome,  and  expressly  noting 
that the assignees could bring suit even if the entire interest 
in the notes had been assigned to them as "agents for collec-

standing that he would take the claim, collect what he could, 
and  turn  over  to  the  company  the  proceeds  thereof  less  the

tion.' "  Roper, supra,  at  568.  Applying  this principle, the  Court held 
in  Roper  and  Atkins  that  the  execution  of  juveniles  and  mentally  re-
tarded  persons  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  the  offender 
has a diminished personal responsibility for the crime.  The Court also 
has found  the death  penalty  disproportionate  to the  crime itself  where 
the  crime  did  not  result,  or  was  not  intended  to  result,  in  the  victim's 
death.  See, e. g., Coker, supra; Enmund v.  Florida, 458 U. S. 782.  In 
making  its  determination,  the  Court  is  guided  by  "objective  indicia  of 
society's  standards,  as  expressed  in  legislative  enactments  and  state 
practice with respect to executions."  Roper, supra, at 563.  Consensus 
is  not  dispositive,  however.  Whether  the  death  penalty  is  dispropor-
tionate  to  the  crime  also  depends  on  the  standards  elaborated  by  con-
trolling precedents and on the Court's own understanding and interpre-
tation  of the Eighth  Amendment's text,  history,  meaning, and purpose. 
Pp. 419-421. 

2.  A  review  of  the  authorities  informed  by  contemporary  norms,  in-
cluding the history of the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide 
crimes,  current  state statutes  and new  enactments,  and  the number  of 
executions since 1964, demonstrates a national consensus against capital 
punishment for the crime of child rape.  Pp. 422-434. 

(a)  The Court follows the approach of cases in which objective indi-
cia of consensus demonstrated an opinion against the death penalty for 
juveniles,  see  Roper,  supra,  mentally  retarded  offenders,  see  Atkins, 
supra,  and  vicarious  felony  murderers,  see  Enmund,  supra.  Thirty-
seven jurisdictions--36 States plus the Federal Government--currently 
impose capital punishment, but only 6 States authorize it for child rape. 
In  45  jurisdictions,  by  contrast,  petitioner  could  not  be  executed  for 
child rape of any kind.  That number surpasses the 30 States in Atkins 
and  Roper  and  the  42  in  Enmund  that  prohibited  the  death  penalty 
under the circumstances those cases considered.  Pp. 422-426. 

(b)  Respondent's  argument  that  Coker's  general  discussion  con-
trasting  murder  and  rape,  433  U. S.,  at  598,  has  been  interpreted  too 
expansively, leading some States to conclude that Coker applies to child 
rape when in fact it does not, is unsound.  Coker's holding was narrower 
than some of its language read in isolation indicates.  The Coker plural-
ity  framed  the  question  as  whether,  "with  respect  to  rape  of  an  adult 
woman,"  the  death  penalty  is  disproportionate  punishment,  id.,  at  592, 
and it repeated the phrase "adult woman" or "adult female" eight times 
in  discussing  the  crime  or  the  victim.  The  distinction  between  adult 
and child rape was not merely rhetorical; it was central to Coker's rea-
soning, including its analysis of legislative consensus.  See, e. g.,  id., at 
595-596.  There  is  little  evidence  to  support  respondent's  contention 
that state legislatures have understood Coker to state a broad rule that

Syllabus 
covers  minor  victims,  and  state  courts  have  uniformly  concluded  that 
Coker  did  not  address  that  crime.  Accordingly,  the  small  number  of 
States that have enacted the death penalty for child rape is relevant to 
determining  whether  there  is  a  consensus  against  capital  punishment 
for the rape of a child.  Pp. 426-431. 

(c)  A consistent direction of change in support of the death penalty 
for  child  rape  might  counterbalance  an  otherwise  weak  demonstration 
of consensus, see, e. g., Atkins, 536 U. S., at 315, but no showing of con-
sistent  change  has  been  made  here.  That  five  States  may  have  had 
pending  legislation  authorizing  death  for  child  rape  is  not  dispositive 
because it is not this Court's practice, nor is it sound, to find contempo-
rary norms based on legislation proposed but not yet enacted.  Indeed, 
since  the  parties  submitted  their  briefs,  the  legislation  in  at  least  two 
of  the  five  States  has  failed.  Further,  evidence  that,  in  the  last  13 
years,  six  new  death  penalty  statutes  have  been  enacted,  three  in  the 
last  two  years,  is  not  as  significant  as  the  data  in  Atkins,  where  18 
States  between  1986  and  2001  had  enacted  legislation  prohibiting  the 
execution  of  mentally  retarded  persons.  See  id.,  at  314-315.  Re-
spondent  argues  that  this  case  is  like  Roper  because,  there,  only  five 
States had shifted their positions between 1989 and 2005, one less State 
than  here.  See  543  U. S.,  at  565.  But  the  Roper  Court  emphasized 
that the slow pace of abolition was counterbalanced by the total number 
of States  that had recognized the impropriety of executing juvenile of-
fenders.  See id., at 566-567.  Here, the fact that only six States have 
made child rape a capital offense is not an indication of a trend or change 
in  direction  comparable  to  the  one  in  Roper.  The  evidence  bears  a 
closer resemblance to that in Enmund, where the Court found a national 
consensus against death for vicarious felony murder despite eight juris-
dictions having authorized it.  See 458 U. S., at 789, 792.  Pp. 431-433. 

(d)  Execution statistics also confirm that there is a social consensus 
against  the  death  penalty  for  child  rape.  Nine  States  have  permitted 
capital  punishment  for  adult  or  child  rape  for  some  length  of  time  be-
tween  the  Court's  1972  Furman  decision  and  today;  yet  no  individual 
has  been  executed  for  the  rape  of  an  adult  or  child  since  1964,  and  no 
execution  for  any  other  nonhomicide  offense  has  been  conducted  since 
1963.  Louisiana is the only State since 1964 that has sentenced an indi-
vidual  to  death  for  child  rape,  and  petitioner  and  another  man  so  sen-
tenced  are the only individuals  now on death  row in  the United  States 
for nonhomicide offenses.  Pp. 433-434. 

3.  Informed by its own precedents and its understanding of the Con-
stitution and the rights it secures, the Court concludes, in its independ-
ent judgment,  that the  death  penalty  is  not  a proportional  punishment 
for the crime of child rape.  Pp. 434-446.

Syllabus 
(a)  The  Court's  own  judgment  should  be  brought  to  bear  on  the 
death penalty's acceptability under the Eighth Amendment.  See, e. g., 
Coker,  supra,  at  597.  Rape's  permanent  and  devastating  impact  on  a 
child suggests moral grounds for questioning a rule barring capital pun-
ishment  simply  because  the  crime  did  not  result  in  the  victim's  death, 
but  it  does  not  follow  that  death  is  a  proportionate  penalty  for  child 
rape.  The constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and un-
usual punishments mandates that punishment "be  exercised within the 
limits  of  civilized  standards."  Trop,  356  U. S.,  at  99-100.  Evolving 
standards of decency counsel the Court to be most hesitant before allow-
ing extension of the death penalty, especially where no life was taken in 
the  commission  of  the  crime.  See,  e. g.,  Coker,  supra,  at  597-598;  En-
mund, supra, at 797.  Consistent with those evolving standards and the 
teachings of its precedents, the Court concludes that there is a distinc-
tion between intentional  first-degree murder  on the one hand and non-
homicide  crimes  against  individuals,  even  including  child  rape,  on  the 
other.  The  latter  crimes  may  be  devastating  in  their  harm,  as  here, 
but  "in  terms  of  moral  depravity  and  of  the  injury  to  the  person  and 
to  the  public,"  they  cannot  compare  to  murder  in  their  "severity  and 
irrevocability,"  433  U. S.,  at  598.  The  Court  finds  significant  the  sub-
stantial number of executions that would be allowed for child rape under 
respondent's  approach.  Although  narrowing  aggravators  might  be 
used to ensure the death penalty's restrained application in this context, 
as they are in the context of capital murder, all such standards have the 
potential to result in some inconsistency of application.  The Court, for 
example,  has  acknowledged  that  the  requirement  of  general  rules  to 
ensure consistency of treatment, see, e. g., Godfrey v.  Georgia, 446 U. S. 
420,  and  the  insistence  that  capital  sentencing  be  individualized,  see, 
e. g., Woodson v.  North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, have resulted in tension 
and imprecision.  This approach might be sound with respect to capital 
murder,  but  it  should  not  be  introduced  into  the  justice  system  where 
death has not occurred.  The Court has spent more than 32 years devel-
oping  a  foundational  jurisprudence  for  capital  murder  to  guide  the 
States  and  juries  in  imposing  the  death  penalty.  Beginning  the  same 
process  for  crimes  for  which  no  one  has  been  executed  in  more  than 
40  years  would  require  experimentation  in  an  area  where  a  failed  ex-
periment  would  result  in  the  execution  of  individuals  undeserving  of 
death.  Pp. 434-441. 

(b)  The Court's decision is consistent with the justifications offered 
for  the  death  penalty,  retribution  and  deterrence,  see,  e. g.,  Gregg  v. 
Georgia,  428  U. S.  153,  183.  Among  the  factors  for  determining 
whether  retribution  is  served,  the  Court  must  look  to  whether  the 
death  penalty  balances  the  wrong  to  the  victim  in  nonhomicide  cases.

and sentenced to death under a state statute authorizing cap-ital punishment for the rape of a child under 12 years of age. 

See La. Stat. Ann. $ 14:42 (West 1997 and Supp. 1998).  This case presents the question whether the Constitution bars re-
spondent  from  imposing  the  death  penalty  for  the  rape  of  a child  where  the  crime  did  not  result,  and  was  not  intended 
to  result,  in  death  of  the  victim.  We  hold  the  Eighth Amendment  prohibits  the  death  penalty  for  this  offense. 
The Louisiana statute is unconstitutional. 

I 
Petitioner's  crime  was  one  that  cannot  be  recounted  in these pages in a way sufficient to capture in full the hurt and 

horror inflicted on his victim or to convey the revulsion soci-ety,  and  the  jury  that  represents  it,  sought  to  express  by 
sentencing  petitioner  to  death.  At  9:18  a.m.  on  March  2, 1998,  petitioner  called  911  to  report  that  his  stepdaughter, 
referred  to  here  as  L.  H.,  had  been  raped.  He  told  the  911 operator that L. H. had been in the garage while he readied 
his son for school.  Upon hearing loud screaming, petitioner said,  he  ran  outside  and  found  L.  H.  in  the  side  yard.  Two 
neighborhood boys, petitioner told the operator, had dragged L.  H.  from  the  garage  to  the  yard,  pushed  her  down,  and 
raped her.  Petitioner claimed he saw one of the boys riding away on a blue 10-speed bicycle. 

When police arrived at petitioner's home between 9:20 and 9:30 a.m., they found L. H. on her bed, wearing a T-shirt and 
wrapped  in  a  bloody  blanket.  She  was  bleeding  profusely from the vaginal area.  Petitioner told police he had carried 
her from the yard to the bathtub and then to the bed.  Con-sistent with this explanation, police found a thin line of blood 
drops in the garage on the way to the house and then up the stairs.  Once in the  bedroom, petitioner had used a basin  of 
water and a cloth to wipe blood from the victim.  This later prevented medical personnel from collecting a  reliable DNA 
sample.

Opinion of the Court 
L. H. was transported to the Children's Hospital.  An ex-pert in pediatric forensic medicine testified that L. H.'s inju-

ries were the most severe he had seen from a sexual assault in his four years of practice.  A laceration to the left wall of 
the  vagina  had  separated  her  cervix  from  the  back  of  her vagina,  causing  her  rectum  to  protrude  into  the  vaginal 
structure.  Her entire perineum was torn from the posterior 
fourchette  to  the  anus.  The  injuries  required  emergency surgery. 

At  the  scene  of  the  crime,  at  the  hospital,  and  in  the  first weeks that followed, both L. H. and petitioner maintained in 
their accounts to investigators that L. H. had been raped by two  neighborhood  boys.  One  of  L.  H.'s  doctors  testified  at 
trial  that  L.  H.  told  all  hospital  personnel  the  same  version of the rape, although she reportedly told one family member 
that  petitioner  raped  her.  L.  H.  was  interviewed  several days  after  the  rape  by  a  psychologist.  The  interview  was 
videotaped, lasted three hours over two days, and was intro-
duced  into  evidence  at  trial.  On  the  tape  one  can  see  that L.  H.  had  difficulty  discussing  the  subject  of  the  rape.  She 

spoke  haltingly  and  with  long  pauses  and  frequent  move-ment.  Early in the interview, L. H. expressed reservations 
about the questions being asked: 

"I'm  going  to  tell  the  same  story.  They  just  want  me 
to change it. . . .  They want me to say my Dad did it. . . .  I  don't  want  to  say  it.  .  .  .  I  tell  them  the  same,  same 

story."  Def. Exh. D-7, 01:29:07-:36. 
She told the psychologist that she had been playing in the garage when a boy came over and asked her about Girl Scout 

cookies she was selling; and that the boy "pulled [her by the 
legs  to]  the  backyard,"  id.,  at  01:47:41-:52,  where  he  placed 
his  hand  over  her  mouth,  "pulled  down  [her]  shorts,"  Def. 
Exh. D-8, 00:03:11-:12, and raped her, id., at 00:14:39-:40. 

Eight  days  after  the  crime,  and  despite  L.  H.'s  insistence 
that petitioner was not the offender, petitioner was arrested

Opinion of the Court 
for the rape.  The State's investigation had drawn the accu-racy  of  petitioner  and  L.  H.'s  story  into  question.  Though 

the  defense  at  trial  proffered  alternative  explanations,  the case  for  the  prosecution,  credited  by  the  jury,  was  based 
upon  the  following  evidence:  An  inspection  of  the  side  yard immediately  after  the  assault  was  inconsistent  with  a  rape 
having  occurred  there,  the  grass  having  been  found  mostly 
undisturbed but for a small patch of coagulated blood.  Peti-tioner said  that one of the perpetrators  fled the  crime scene 

on a blue 10-speed bicycle but gave inconsistent descriptions of  the  bicycle's  features,  such  as  its  handlebars.  Investiga-
tors found a bicycle matching petitioner and L. H.'s descrip-
tion in  tall  grass behind  a nearby  apartment,  and petitioner 
identified it as the bicycle one of the perpetrators was riding. 
Yet its tires  were flat, it  did  not have gears,  and it  was cov-
ered  in  spider  webs.  In  addition  police  found  blood  on  the 
underside of L. H.'s mattress.  This convinced them the rape 
took place in her bedroom, not outside the house. 

Police also found that petitioner made four telephone calls 
on the morning of the rape.  Sometime before 6:15 a.m., peti-
tioner  called  his  employer  and  left  a  message  that  he  was 
unavailable  to  work  that  day.  Petitioner  called  back  be-
tween 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. to ask a colleague how to get blood 
out of a white carpet because his daughter had " `just become 
a  young  lady.' "  Brief  for  Respondent  12.  At  7:37  a.m., 
petitioner  called  B  &  B  Carpet  Cleaning  and  requested  ur-
gent  assistance  in  removing  bloodstains  from  a  carpet. 
Petitioner did not call 911 until about an hour and a half later. 

About a month after petitioner's arrest L. H. was removed 
from  the  custody  of  her  mother,  who  had  maintained  until 
that  point that  petitioner  was  not  involved  in the  rape.  On 
June 22, 1998, L. H. was returned home and told her mother 
for the first time that petitioner had raped her.  And on De-
cember  16,  1999,  about  21  months  after  the  rape,  L.  H.  re-
corded  her  accusation  in  a  videotaped  interview  with  the 
Child Advocacy Center.

and sought the death penalty.  At all times relevant to peti-tioner's case, the statute provided: 

"A.  Aggravated  rape  is  a  rape  committed  .  .  .  where the  anal  or  vaginal  sexual  intercourse  is  deemed  to 
be  without  lawful  consent  of  the  victim  because  it  is committed  under  any  one  or  more  of  the  following 
circumstances: . . . . . 

"(4)  When the victim is under the age of twelve years. 
Lack  of  knowledge  of  the  victim's  age  shall  not  be  a defense. 

. . . . . 
"D.  Whoever  commits  the  crime  of  aggravated  rape 
shall  be  punished  by  life  imprisonment  at  hard  labor without  benefit  of  parole,  probation,  or  suspension  of 

sentence. "(1)  However,  if  the  victim  was  under  the  age  of 
twelve  years,  as  provided  by  Paragraph  A(4)  of  this 
Section: "(a)  And  if  the  district  attorney  seeks  a  capital  ver-

dict,  the  offender  shall  be  punished  by  death  or  life  im-prisonment at hard labor without  benefit of parole, pro-
bation, or suspension of sentence, in accordance with the determination of the jury." 

(Since  petitioner  was  convicted  and  sentenced,  the  statute 
has  been  amended  to  include  oral  intercourse  within  the definition  of  aggravated  rape  and  to  increase  the  age  of 

the  victim  from  12  to  13.  See  La.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 14:42  (West 
Supp. 2007).) 

Aggravating circumstances are set forth in La. Code Crim. 
Proc. Ann., Art. 905.4 (West 1997 Supp.).  In pertinent part 
and  at  all  times  relevant  to  petitioner's  case,  the  provision 
stated:

Opinion of the Court 
"A.  The  following  shall  be  considered  aggravating circumstances: 

"(1)  The offender was engaged in the  perpetration or attempted  perpetration  of  aggravated  rape,  forcible 
rape, aggravated kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated  burglary,  aggravated  arson,  aggravated  es-
cape,  assault  by  drive-by  shooting,  armed  robbery,  first degree robbery, or simple robbery. 

. . . . . 
"(10)  The  victim  was  under  the  age  of  twelve  years or sixty-five years of age or older." 

The trial began in August 2003.  L. H. was then  13 years old.  She testified that she " `woke up one morning and Pat-
rick  was  on  top  of  [her].' "  She  remembered  petitioner bringing her " `[a] cup of orange juice and pills chopped up in 
it' "  after  the  rape  and  overhearing  him  on  the  telephone saying  she  had  become  a  " `young  lady.' "  05-1981,  pp.  12, 
15,  16  (La.  5/22/07),  957  So.  2d  757,  767,  769,  770.  L.  H.  ac-knowledged that she had accused two neighborhood boys but 
testified petitioner told her to say this and that it was untrue. 
Id., at 769. The  jury  having  found  petitioner  guilty  of  aggravated 

rape,  the  penalty  phase  ensued.  The  State  presented  the testimony of S. L., who is the cousin and goddaughter of peti-
tioner's  ex-wife.  S.  L.  testified  that  petitioner  sexually abused  her  three  times  when  she  was  eight  years  old  and 
that  the  last  time  involved  sexual  intercourse.  Id.,  at  772. She  did  not  tell  anyone  until  two  years  later  and  did  not 
pursue legal action. The  jury  unanimously  determined  that  petitioner  should 
be sentenced to death.  The Supreme Court of Louisiana af-firmed.  See  id.,  at  779-789,  793;  see  also  State  v.  Wilson, 
96-1392,  96-2076  (La.  12/13/96),  685  So.  2d  1063  (upholding the  constitutionality  of  the  death  penalty  for  child  rape). 
The court rejected petitioner's reliance on Coker v.  Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977), noting that, while 

Coker bars the use of

Opinion of the Court 
the  death  penalty  as  punishment  for  the  rape  of  an  adult woman, it left open the question which, if any, other nonhom-

icide  crimes  can  be  punished  by  death  consistent  with  the Eighth  Amendment.  Because  " `children  are  a  class  that 
need special protection,' " the state court reasoned, the rape of  a  child  is  unique  in  terms  of  the  harm  it  inflicts  upon  the 
victim and our society.  957 So. 2d, at 781. The court acknowledged that petitioner would be the first 
person  executed  for  committing  child  rape  since  La.  Stat. 
Ann.  $ 14:42  was  amended  in  1995  and  that  Louisiana  is  in the minority of jurisdictions that authorize the death penalty 

for  the  crime  of  child  rape.  But  following  the  approach  of 
Roper  v.  Simmons,  543  U. S.  551  (2005),  and  Atkins  v.  Vir-
ginia,  536  U. S.  304  (2002),  it  found  significant  not  the  "nu-
merical counting of which [S]tates . . . stand for or against a 
particular capital prosecution," but "the direction of change." 
957 So. 2d,  at 783 (emphasis deleted).  Since  1993, the court 
explained,  four  more  States--Oklahoma,  South  Carolina, 
Montana,  and  Georgia--had  capitalized  the  crime  of  child 
rape, and at least eight States had authorized capital punish-
ment  for  other nonhomicide  crimes.  By  its  count, 14  of  the 
then-38  States  permitting  capital punishment,  plus  the  Fed-
eral Government, allowed the death penalty for nonhomicide 
crimes and 5 allowed the death penalty for the crime of child 
rape.  See id., at 785-786. 

The  state  court  next  asked  whether  "child  rapists  rank 
among  the  worst  offenders."  Id.,  at  788.  It  noted  the  se-
verity of the crime; that the execution of child rapists would 
serve  the  goals  of  deterrence  and  retribution;  and  that,  un-
like  in  Atkins  and  Roper,  there  were  no  characteristics  of 
petitioner that tended to mitigate his moral culpability.  957 
So.  2d,  at  788-789.  It  concluded:  "[S]hort  of  first-degree 
murder,  we  can  think  of  no  other  non-homicide  crime  more 
deserving [of capital punishment]."  Id., at 789. 

On  this  reasoning  the  Supreme  Court  of  Louisiana  re-
jected  petitioner's  argument  that  the  death  penalty  for  the

Opinion of the Court 
rape of a child under 12 years is disproportionate and upheld 
the  constitutionality  of  the  statute.  Chief  Justice  Calogero 
dissented.  Coker,  supra,  and  Eberheart  v.  Georgia,  433 
U. S. 917 (1977), in his view, "set out a bright-line and easily 
administered  rule"  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  precludes 
capital punishment for any  offense that does not involve the 
death of the victim.  957 So. 2d, at 794. 

We granted certiorari.  552 U. S. 1087 (2008). 

II 
The  Eighth  Amendment,  applicable to  the  States  through 
the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  provides  that  "[e]xcessive  bail 
shall not  be required,  nor  excessive  fines imposed, nor  cruel 
and  unusual  punishments  inflicted."  The  Amendment  pro-
scribes  "all  excessive  punishments,  as  well  as  cruel  and 
unusual  punishments  that  may  or  may  not  be  excessive." 
Atkins,  536  U. S.,  at  311,  n.  7.  The  Court  explained  in  At-
kins,  id.,  at  311,  and  Roper,  supra,  at  560,  that  the  Eighth 
Amendment's  protection  against  excessive  or  cruel  and  un-
usual  punishments  flows  from  the  basic  "precept  of  justice 
that  punishment  for  [a]  crime  should  be  graduated  and  pro-
portioned  to  [the]  offense."  Weems  v.  United  States,  217 
U. S.  349,  367  (1910).  Whether  this  requirement  has  been 
fulfilled  is  determined  not  by  the  standards  that  prevailed 
when  the  Eighth  Amendment  was  adopted  in  1791  but  by 
the  norms  that  "currently  prevail."  Atkins,  supra,  at  311. 
The  Amendment  "draw[s]  its  meaning  from  the  evolving 
standards  of  decency  that  mark  the  progress  of  a  maturing 
society."  Trop  v.  Dulles,  356  U. S.  86,  101  (1958)  (plurality 
opinion).  This is because "[t]he standard of extreme cruelty 
is  not  merely  descriptive,  but  necessarily  embodies  a  moral 
judgment.  The standard itself remains the same, but its ap-
plicability must change as the basic mores of society change." 
Furman  v.  Georgia,  408  U. S.  238,  382  (1972)  (Burger,  C.  J., 
dissenting).

Opinion of the Court 

III  

A  

The  existence  of  objective  indicia  of  consensus  against 
making a  crime  punishable  by  death was  a relevant  concern 
in  Roper,  Atkins,  Coker,  and  Enmund,  and  we  follow  the 
approach of those cases here.  The history of the death pen-
alty  for  the  crime  of  rape  is  an  instructive  beginning  point. 

In  1925,  18  States,  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  the  Fed-
eral Government had statutes that authorized the death pen-
alty  for  the  rape  of  a  child  or  an  adult.  See  Coker,  supra, 
at 593 (plurality opinion).  Between 1930 and 1964, 455 peo-
ple were executed for those crimes.  See 5 Historical Statis-
tics  of  the  United  States:  Earliest  Times  to  the  Present, 
pp. 5-262 to 5-263 (S. Carter et al. eds. 2006) (Table Ec343- 
357).  To our knowledge the last individual executed for the 
rape  of  a  child  was  Ronald  Wolfe  in  1964.  See  H.  Frazier, 
Death Sentences in Missouri, 1803-2005: A History and Com-
prehensive Registry of Legal Executions, Pardons, and Com-
mutations 143 (2006). 

In  1972,  Furman  invalidated  most  of  the  state  statutes 
authorizing  the  death  penalty  for  the  crime  of  rape;  and  in 
Furman's  aftermath  only  six  States  reenacted  their  capital 
rape  provisions.  Three  States--Georgia,  North  Carolina, 
and  Louisiana--did  so  with  respect  to  all  rape  offenses. 
Three  States--Florida,  Mississippi,  and  Tennessee--did  so 
with  respect  only  to  child  rape.  See  Coker,  supra,  at  594- 
595  (plurality  opinion).  All  six  statutes  were  later  invali-
dated under state or federal law.  See Coker, supra (striking 
down Georgia's capital rape statute); Woodson v.  North Car-
olina, 428 U. S. 280, 287, n. 6, 301-305 (1976) (plurality opin-
ion)  (striking  down  North  Carolina's  mandatory  death  pen-
alty  statute);  Roberts  v.  Louisiana,  428  U. S.  325  (1976) 
(striking down Louisiana's mandatory death penalty statute); 
Collins  v.  State, 550  S. W.  2d 643, 646  (Tenn.  1977) (striking 
down Tennessee's mandatory death penalty statute); Buford

Opinion of the Court 
v.  State,  403  So.  2d  943,  951  (Fla.  1981)  (holding  unconstitu-tional the imposition of death for child rape); 

Leatherwood v. 
State, 548 So. 2d 389, 402-403 (Miss. 1989) (striking down the death penalty for child rape on state-law grounds). 

Louisiana  reintroduced  the  death  penalty  for  rape  of  a child in 1995.  See La. Stat.  Ann. $ 14:42 (West  Supp. 1996). 
Under  the  current  statute,  any  anal,  vaginal,  or  oral  inter-
course  with  a  child  under  the  age  of  13  constitutes  aggra-vated  rape  and  is  punishable  by  death.  See  $ 14:42  (West 

Supp. 2007).  Mistake of age is not a defense, so the statute imposes  strict  liability  in  this  regard.  Five  States  have 
since  followed  Louisiana's  lead:  Georgia,  see  Ga.  Code  Ann. 

$ 16-6-1  (2007)  (enacted  1999);  Montana,  see  Mont.  Code 
Ann.  $ 45-5-503  (2007)  (enacted  1997);  Oklahoma,  see  Okla. 
Stat.,  Tit.  10,  $ 7115(K)  (West  2007  Supp.)  (enacted  2006); 
South Carolina,  see S. C.  Code Ann. $ 16-3-655(C)(1)  (Supp. 
2007)  (enacted  2006);  and  Texas,  see  Tex.  Penal  Code  Ann. 

$ 12.42(c)(3)  (West  Supp.  2007)  (enacted  2007);  see  also 

$ 22.021(a).  Four  of these  States'  statutes  are  more  narrow 
than  Louisiana's  in  that  only  offenders  with  a  previous  rape 
conviction are  death eligible.  See Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-5- 
503(3)(c); Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, $ 7115(K); S. C. Code Ann. $ 16- 
3-655(C)(1);  Tex.  Penal  Code  Ann.  $ 12.42(c)(3).  Georgia's 
statute  makes  child  rape  a  capital  offense  only  when  aggra-
vating  circumstances  are  present,  including  but  not  limited 
to  a prior  conviction.  See  Ga.  Code  Ann. $ 17-10-30  (Supp. 
2007). 

By  contrast,  44  States  have  not  made  child  rape  a  capital 
offense.  As  for  federal  law,  Congress  in  the  Federal  Death 
Penalty  Act  of  1994  expanded  the  number  of  federal  crimes 
for which the death penalty is a permissible sentence, includ-
ing certain  nonhomicide offenses;  but it  did  not  do  the  same 
for  child  rape  or  abuse.  See  108  Stat.  1972  (codified  as 
amended  in  scattered  sections  of  18  U. S. C.).  Under  18 
U. S. C.  $ 2245,  an  offender  is  death  eligible  only  when  the 
sexual abuse or exploitation results in the victim's death.

424  KENNEDY  v.  LOUISIANA 

Opinion of the Court 
Petitioner  claims  the  death  penalty  for  child  rape  is  not authorized  in  Georgia,  pointing  to  a  1979  decision  in  which 

the  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia  stated  that  "[s]tatutory  rape is not a capital crime in Georgia." 

Presnell v.  State, 243 Ga. 
131, 132-133, 252 S. E. 2d 625, 626.  But it appears Presnell was referring to the separate crime of statutory rape, which 

is  not  a  capital  offense  in  Georgia,  see  Ga.  Code  Ann.  $ 26- 
2018  (1969);  cf.  $ 16-6-3  (2007).  The  State's  current  capital rape  statute,  by  contrast,  is  explicit  that  the  rape  of  "[a]  fe-

male  who  is  less  than  ten  years  of  age"  is  punishable  "by death."  $$ 16-6-1(a)(2),  (b).  Based  on  a  recent  statement 
by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia  it  must  be  assumed  that 
this law is still in force: "Neither the United States Supreme 
Court,  nor  this  Court,  has  yet  addressed  whether  the  death 
penalty  is  unconstitutionally  disproportionate  for  the  crime 
of raping a  child."  State v.  Velazquez,  283  Ga.  206, 208, 657 
S. E. 2d 838, 840 (2008). 

Respondent  would  include  Florida  among  those  States 
that permit the death penalty for child rape.  The state stat-
ute does authorize, by its terms,  the death penalty  for "sex-
ual  battery  upon  . . . a  person  less  than  12  years  of  age." 
Fla. Stat. $ 794.011(2) (2007); see also $ 921.141(5) (2007).  In 
1981, however, the Supreme Court of Florida held the death 
penalty for  child sexual  assault to  be  unconstitutional.  See 
Buford, supra.  It acknowledged that Coker addressed only 
the constitutionality of the death penalty for rape of an adult 
woman,  403  So.  2d,  at  950,  but  held  that  "[t]he  reasoning  of 
the justices in Coker . . . compels [the conclusion] that a sen-
tence of death is grossly disproportionate and excessive pun-
ishment  for  the  crime  of  sexual assault  and is  therefore for-
bidden  by  the  Eighth  Amendment  as  cruel  and  unusual 
punishment,"  id.,  at  951.  Respondent  points  out  that  the 
state statute has not since been amended.  Pursuant to Fla. 
Stat.  $ 775.082(2)  (2007),  however,  Florida  state  courts  have 
understood  Buford  to  bind  their  sentencing  discretion  in 
child  rape  cases.  See,  e. g.,  Gibson  v.  State,  721  So.  2d  363,

Opinion of the Court 
367, and n. 2 (Fla. App. 1998) (deeming it irrelevant that "the Florida Legislature never changed the wording of the sexual 

battery  statute");  Cooper  v.  State,  453  So.  2d  67  (Fla.  App. 1984) ("After 

Buford, death was no longer a possible penalty 
in Florida for sexual battery"); see also Fla. Stat. $ 775.082(2) ("In the event the death penalty in a capital felony is held to 

be  unconstitutional  by  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  .  .  .  the 
court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to  death  for  a  capital  felony  .  .  .  shall  sentence  such  person 

to life imprisonment"). Definitive  resolution  of  state-law  issues  is  for  the  States' 
own courts,  and there may  be disagreement  over  the  statis-
tics.  It  is  further  true  that  some  States,  including  States 
that have addressed the issue in just the last few years, have 
made  child  rape  a  capital  offense.  The  summary  recited 
here,  however,  does  allow  us  to  make  certain  comparisons 
with the data cited in the Atkins, Roper, and Enmund cases. 

When  Atkins  was  decided  in  2002, 30  States,  including  12 
noncapital  jurisdictions,  prohibited  the  death  penalty  for 
mentally retarded offenders; 20 permitted it.  See 536 U. S., 
at 313-315.  When Roper was decided in 2005, the numbers 
disclosed a similar division among the States: 30 States pro-
hibited the death penalty for juveniles, 18 of which permitted 
the death  penalty  for other  offenders; and 20  States author-
ized it.  See 543 U. S., at 564.  Both in Atkins and in Roper, 
we  noted  that  the  practice  of  executing  mentally  retarded 
and juvenile offenders was infrequent.  Only five States had 
executed an offender known to have an IQ below 70 between 
1989  and  2002,  see  Atkins,  supra,  at  316;  and  only  three 
States  had  executed  a  juvenile  offender  between  1995  and 
2005, see Roper, supra, at 564-565. 

The  statistics  in  Enmund  bear  an  even  greater  similarity 
to the instant case.  There eight jurisdictions had authorized 
imposition  of  the  death  penalty  solely  for  participation  in  a 
robbery  during  which  an  accomplice  committed  murder,  see 
458  U. S.,  at  789,  and  six  defendants  between  1954  and  1982

Opinion of the Court 
had  been  sentenced  to  death  for  felony  murder  where  the defendant  did  not  personally  commit  the  homicidal  assault, 

id., at 794.  These facts, the Court concluded, "weigh[ed] on the  side  of  rejecting  capital  punishment  for  the  crime." 
Id., at 793. The  evidence  of  a  national  consensus  with  respect  to  the 
death  penalty  for  child  rapists,  as  with  respect  to  juveniles, mentally retarded offenders, and vicarious felony murderers, 
shows divided  opinion but,  on balance, an opinion against  it. Thirty-seven  jurisdictions--36  States  plus  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment--have  the  death  penalty.  As  mentioned  above, only six of those jurisdictions authorize the death penalty for 
rape of a child.  Though our review of national consensus is not confined to tallying the number of States with applicable 
death penalty legislation, it is of significance that, in 45 juris-dictions,  petitioner  could  not  be  executed  for  child  rape  of 
any  kind.  That  number  surpasses  the  30  States  in  Atkins and  Roper  and  the  42  States  in  Enmund  that  prohibited 
the  death penalty under the circumstances those  cases considered.* 

B 
At  least  one  difference  between  this  case  and  our  Eighth Amendment 

proportionality  precedents  must  be  addressed. Respondent and its 

amici suggest that some States have an 
"erroneous  understanding  of  this  Court's  Eighth  Amend-ment  jurisprudence."  Brief  for  Missouri  Governor  Matt

rehearing,  post,  p.  946,  we  find  that  the  military  penalty  does  not  affect 
our reasoning or conclusions.

Opinion of the Court 
rape,  have  been  interpreted  in  too  expansive  a  way,  leading 
some  state  legislatures  to  conclude  that  Coker  applies  to 
child rape  when in fact  its  reasoning  does not, or  ought  not, 
apply to that specific crime. 

This  argument  seems  logical  at  first,  but  in  the  end  it  is 
unsound.  In  Coker,  a  four-Member  plurality  of  the  Court, 
plus  Justice  Brennan  and  Justice  Marshall  in  concurrence, 
held  that  a  sentence  of  death  for  the  rape  of  a  16-year-old 
woman,  who  was  a  minor  under  Georgia  law,  see  Ga.  Code 
Ann.  $ 74-104  (1973),  yet  was  characterized  by the  Court  as 
an  adult,  was  disproportionate  and  excessive  under  the 
Eighth Amendment.  See 433 U. S., at 593-600; see also id., 
at 600 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); ibid. (Marshall, 
J., concurring in judgment).  (The Court did not explain why 
the 16-year-old victim qualified as an adult, but it may be of 
some  significance  that  she  was  married,  had  a  home  of  her 
own,  and  had  given  birth  to  a  son  three  weeks  prior  to  the 
rape.  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  in  Coker  v.  Georgia,  O.  T. 
1976, No. 75-5444, pp. 14-15.) 

The plurality noted that only one State had a valid statute 
authorizing the death penalty for adult rape and that "in the 
vast  majority  of  cases,  at  least  9  out  of  10,  juries  ha[d]  not 
imposed  the  death  sentence."  Coker,  433  U. S.,  at  597;  see 
also  id.,  at  594  ("Of  the  16  States  in  which  rape  had  been  a 
capital  offense,  only  three  provided  the  death  penalty  for 
rape  of  an  adult  woman  in  their  revised  statutes--Georgia, 
North Carolina, and Louisiana.  In the latter two States, the 
death  penalty  was  mandatory  for  those  found  guilty,  and 
those  laws  were  invalidated  by  Woodson  and  Roberts"). 
This  "history  and  .  .  .  objective  evidence  of  the  country's 
present judgment concerning the  acceptability  of death as a 
penalty  for  rape  of  an  adult  woman,"  id.,  at  593,  confirmed 
the Court's independent judgment that punishing adult rape 
by death was not proportional: 

"Rape  is  without  doubt  deserving  of  serious  punish-
ment; but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury

Opinion of the Court 
to  the  person  and  to  the  public,  it  does  not  compare 
with  murder,  which  does  involve  the  unjustified  taking 
of  human  life.  Although  it  may  be  accompanied  by 
another  crime,  rape  by  definition  does  not  include 
the  death  of  .  .  .  another  person.  The  murderer  kills; 
the  rapist,  if  no  more  than  that,  does  not.  .  .  .  We  have 
the  abiding  conviction  that  the  death  penalty,  which  `is 
unique  in  its severity  and irrevocability,'  Gregg v.  Geor-
gia,  428  U. S.,  at  187,  is  an  excessive  penalty  for  the 
rapist  who,  as  such,  does  not  take  human  life."  Id.,  at 

598 (footnote omitted). 

Confined  to  this  passage,  Coker's  analysis  of  the  Eighth 
Amendment  is  susceptible  of  a  reading  that  would  prohibit 
making  child  rape  a  capital  offense.  In  context,  however, 
Coker's holding was narrower than some of its language read 
in  isolation.  The  Coker  plurality  framed  the  question  as 
whether, "with respect to rape of an adult woman," the death 
penalty  is  disproportionate  punishment.  Id.,  at  592.  And 
it repeated the phrase "an adult woman" or "an adult female" 
in discussing the act of rape or the victim of rape eight times 
in  its  opinion.  See  Coker,  supra.  The  distinction  between 
adult and child rape was not merely rhetorical; it was central 
to the Court's reasoning.  The opinion does not speak to the 
constitutionality of the death penalty for child rape, an issue 
not  then  before  the  Court.  In  discussing  the  legislative 
background, for example, the Court noted: 

"Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee also authorized the 
death  penalty  in  some  rape  cases,  but  only  where  the 
victim was a child and the rapist an adult.  The Tennes-
see statute has since been invalidated because the death 
sentence was mandatory.  The upshot is that Georgia is 
the sole jurisdiction in the United States at the present 
time  that  authorizes  a  sentence  of  death  when  the  rape 
victim  is  an  adult  woman,  and  only  two  other  juris-
dictions  provide  capital  punishment  when  the  victim  is

Opinion of the Court 
a  child.  .  .  .  [This]  obviously  weighs  very  heavily  on the  side  of  rejecting  capital  punishment  as  a  suitable 

penalty  for  raping  an  adult  woman."  Id.,  at  595-596 (citation and footnote omitted). 

Still,  respondent contends,  it is  possible that state legisla-tures  have  understood  Coker to  state  a  broad  rule  that  cov-
ers  the  situation  of  the  minor  victim  as  well.  We  see  little evidence  of  this.  Respondent  cites  no  reliable  data  to  indi-
cate  that  state  legislatures  have  read  Coker  to  bar  capital punishment  for  child  rape  and,  for  this  reason,  have  been 
deterred  from  passing  applicable  death  penalty  legislation. In  the  absence  of  evidence  from  those  States  where  legisla-
tion  has  been  proposed  but  not  enacted  we  refuse  to  specu-late  about  the  motivations  and  concerns  of  particular  state 
legislators. The  position  of  the  state  courts,  furthermore,  to  which 
state legislators look for guidance on these matters, indicates that 

Coker has not blocked the emergence of legislative con-sensus.  The  state  courts  that  have  confronted  the  precise 

question  before  us  have  been  uniform  in  concluding  that 
Coker  did  not  address  the  constitutionality  of  the  death penalty  for  the  crime  of  child  rape.  See,  e. g.,  Wilson,  685 

So.  2d,  at  1066  (upholding  the  constitutionality  of  the  death penalty  for  rape  of  a  child  and  noting  that  "[t]he  plurality 
[in  Coker]  took  great  pains  in  referring  only  to  the  rape  of adult  women  throughout  their  opinion"  (emphasis  deleted)); 
Upshaw v.  State, 350 So. 2d 1358, 1360 (Miss. 1977) ("In Coker the Court took great pains to limit its decision to the applica-
bility of the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman. . . . As we view 

Coker the  Court carefully refrained from  decid-ing whether the death penalty for the rape of a female child 

under the  age of twelve years is  grossly  disproportionate to the crime").  See also Simpson v.  Owens, 207 Ariz. 261, 268,

that  the  constitutionality  of  the  death  penalty  for  nonhomi-
cide  crimes "is  the subject  of debate"); or from  a decision of 
a  state  intermediate  court  that  has  been  superseded  by  a 
more  specific  statement  of  the  law  by  the  State's  supreme 
court,  compare,  e. g.,  Parker  v.  State,  216  Ga.  App.  649,  650, 

n.  1,  455  S.  E.  2d  360,  361,  n.  1  (1995)  (characterizing  Coker 
as holding that the death penalty "is no longer permitted for 
rape  where  the  victim  is  not  killed"),  with  Velazquez,  283

The  Supreme  Court  of  Florida's  opinion  in  Buford  could 
be  read  to  support  respondent's  argument.  But  even  there 
the  state  court  recognized  that  "[t]he  [Supreme]  Court  has

Opinion of the Court 
reasoning  but  not the  holding of Coker  in  striking  down  the death  penalty  for  child  rape.  403  So.  2d,  at  950,  951.  The 

same is true of the Supreme Court of California's  opinion in Hernandez, supra, at 867, 69 P. 3d, at 464. 

We  conclude  on  the  basis  of  this  review  that  there  is  no clear  indication  that  state  legislatures  have  misinterpreted 
Coker to hold that the death penalty for child rape is uncon-stitutional.  The  small  number  of  States  that  have  enacted 
this  penalty,  then,  is  relevant  to  determining  whether  there is a consensus against capital punishment for this crime. 

C 
Respondent insists that the six States where child rape is a  capital  offense,  along  with  the  States  that  have  proposed 

but  not  yet  enacted  applicable  death  penalty  legislation,  re-flect a consistent direction of change in support of the death 
penalty for child rape.  Consistent change might counterbal-ance  an  otherwise  weak  demonstration  of  consensus.  See 
Atkins,  536  U. S.,  at  315  ("It  is  not  so  much  the  number  of these  States  that  is  significant,  but  the  consistency  of  the 
direction  of  change");  Roper,  543  U. S.,  at  565  ("Impressive in  Atkins  was  the  rate  of  abolition  of  the  death  penalty  for 
the  mentally  retarded").  But  whatever  the  significance  of consistent change where it is cited to show emerging support 
for  expanding  the  scope  of  the  death  penalty,  no  showing  of consistent change has been made in this case. 

Respondent  and  its  amici  identify  five  States  where,  in their  view,  legislation  authorizing  capital  punishment  for 
child rape is pending.  See Brief for Missouri Governor Matt Blunt  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  2,  14.  It  is  not  our  practice, 
nor is it sound, to find contemporary norms based upon state legislation  that  has  been  proposed  but  not  yet  enacted. 
There  are  compelling  reasons  not  to  do  so  here.  Since  the briefs  were  submitted  by  the  parties,  legislation  in  two  of 
the  five  States  has  failed.  See,  e. g.,  S.  195,  66th  Gen.  As-sembly, 2d Reg. Sess. (Colo. 2008) (rejected by Senate Appro-

Reg.  Sess.  (Miss.  2008)  (rejected  by  House  Committee  on 
Mar. 18, 2008).  In Tennessee, the House bills were rejected 
almost  a  year  ago,  and  the  Senate  bills  appear  to  have  died 
in committee.  See H. R. 601, 105th Gen. Assembly, 1st Reg. 
Sess.  (2007)  (taken  off  Subcommittee  calendar  on  Apr.  4, 
2007);  H.  R.  662,  ibid.  (failed  for  lack  of  second  on  Mar.  21, 
2007);  H.  R.  1099,  ibid.  (taken  off  notice  for  Judiciary  Com-
mittee  calendar  on  May  16,  2007);  S.  22,  ibid.  (referred  to 
General  Subcommittee  of  Senate Finance,  Ways,  and  Means 
Committee on June 11, 2007); S. 157, ibid. (referred to Senate 
Judiciary  Committee  on  Feb.  7,  2007;  action  deferred  until 
Jan.  2008);  S.  841,  ibid.  (referred  to  General  Subcommittee 
of  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  on  Mar.  27,  2007).  In  Ala-
bama,  the  recent  legislation  is  similar  to  a  bill  that  failed  in 
2007.  Compare H. R. 456, 2008 Leg., Reg. Sess. (2008), with 
H.  R.  335,  2007  Leg.,  Reg.  Sess.  (2007).  And  in  Missouri, 
the  2008  legislative  session  has  ended,  tabling  the  pending 
legislation.  See Mo. Const., Art. III, $ 20(a). 

Aside  from  pending  legislation,  it  is  true  that  in  the  last 
13  years  there  has  been  change  toward  making  child  rape  a 
capital offense.  This is evidenced by six new death penalty 
statutes, three enacted in the last two years.  But this show-
ing  is  not  as  significant  as  the  data  in  Atkins,  where  18 
States between 1986 and 2001 had enacted legislation prohib-
iting  the  execution  of  mentally  retarded  persons.  See  At-
kins,  supra,  at  313-315.  Respondent  argues  the  instant 
case is like Roper because, there, only five States had shifted 
their  positions  between  1989  and  2005,  one  less  State  than 
here.  See  Roper,  supra,  at  565.  But  in  Roper,  we  empha-
sized  that,  though  the  pace  of  abolition  was  not  as  great  as 
in  Atkins,  it  was  counterbalanced  by  the  total  number  of 
States  that  had  recognized  the  impropriety  of  executing  ju-
venile  offenders.  See  543  U. S.,  at  566-567.  When  we  de-
cided  Stanford  v.  Kentucky,  492  U. S.  361  (1989),  12  death

Opinion of the Court 
penalty States already prohibited the execution of any juve-nile under 18, and 15 prohibited the execution of any juvenile 

under  17.  See  Roper,  supra,  at  566-567  ("If  anything,  this shows  that  the  impropriety  of  executing  juveniles  between 
16  and  18  years  of  age  gained  wide  recognition  earlier"). Here,  the  total  number  of  States  to  have  made  child  rape  a 
capital  offense  after  Furman  is  six.  This  is  not  an  indica-tion of  a trend  or change  in  direction  comparable to the  one 
supported  by  data  in  Roper.  The  evidence  here  bears  a closer  resemblance  to  the  evidence  of  state  activity  in 

En-mund,  where  we  found  a  national  consensus  against  the 

death penalty for vicarious felony murder despite eight juris-dictions  having  authorized  the  practice.  See  458  U. S.,  at 
789, 792.  D 

There  are  measures  of  consensus  other  than  legislation. Statistics  about  the  number  of  executions  may  inform  the 
consideration  whether  capital  punishment  for  the  crime  of child  rape  is  regarded  as  unacceptable  in  our  society.  See, 
e. g., id., at 794-795; Roper, supra, at 564-565; Atkins, supra, at  316;  cf.  Coker,  433  U. S.,  at  596-597  (plurality  opinion). 
These  statistics  confirm  our  determination  from  our  review of  state  statutes that  there  is  a  social consensus  against  the 
death penalty for the crime of child rape. Nine States--Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,  Mississippi, 
Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas-- 
have permitted capital punishment for adult or child rape for some  length  of  time  between  the  Court's  1972  decision  in 

Furman and today.  See supra, at 422-423; Coker, supra, at 595 (plurality opinion).  Yet no individual has been executed 
for the rape of an adult or child since 1964, and no execution for  any  other  nonhomicide  offense  has  been  conducted  since 
1963.  See  Historical  Statistics  of  the  United  States,  at 
5-262  to  5-263  (Table  Ec343-357).  Cf.  Thompson  v.  Okla-
homa, 487 U. S. 815, 852-853 (1988) (O'Connor, J., concurring

in judgment) (that "four decades have gone by since the last execution  of  a  defendant  who  was  younger  than  16  at  the 

time of the  offense . . .  support[s] the  inference of a national consensus opposing the death penalty for 15-year-olds"). 

Louisiana  is  the  only  State  since  1964  that  has  sentenced an  individual  to  death  for  the  crime  of  child  rape;  and  peti-
tioner and Richard  Davis, who was  convicted and  sentenced to  death  for  the  aggravated  rape  of  a  5-year-old  child  by  a 
Louisiana  jury  in  December  2007,  see  State  v.  Davis,  Case No. 262,971 (1st Jud. Dist., Caddo Parish, La.) (cited in Brief 
for  Respondent  42,  and  n.  38),  are  the  only  two  individuals now  on  death  row  in  the  United  States  for  a  nonhomicide 
offense. After reviewing the authorities informed by contemporary 
norms, including the history of the death penalty for this and other  nonhomicide  crimes,  current  state  statutes  and  new 
enactments,  and  the  number  of  executions  since  1964,  we conclude there is a national consensus against capital punish-
ment for the crime of child rape. 

IV  

A  

As we have said in other Eighth Amendment cases, objec-tive evidence of contemporary values as it relates to punish-

ment  for  child  rape  is  entitled  to  great  weight,  but  it  does not  end  our  inquiry.  "[T]he  Constitution  contemplates  that 
in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on the question  of  the  acceptability  of  the  death  penalty  under  the 
Eighth  Amendment."  Coker,  supra,  at  597  (plurality  opin-ion);  see  also  Roper,  supra,  at  563;  Enmund,  supra,  at  797 
("[I]t  is  for  us  ultimately  to  judge  whether  the  Eighth Amendment permits imposition of the  death penalty").  We 
turn, then, to the resolution of the question before us, which is informed by our precedents and our own understanding of 
the Constitution and the rights it secures.

Opinion of the Court 
It must be  acknowledged that  there are  moral grounds to 
question  a  rule  barring  capital  punishment  for  a  crime 
against  an  individual  that  did  not  result  in  death.  These 
facts illustrate the point.  Here the victim's fright, the sense 
of  betrayal,  and the  nature  of  her  injuries caused  more  pro-
longed physical and mental suffering than, say, a sudden kill-
ing  by  an  unseen  assassin.  The  attack  was  not  just  on  her 
but  on  her  childhood.  For  this  reason,  we  should  be  most 
reluctant to rely upon the language of the plurality in Coker, 
which  posited  that,  for  the  victim  of  rape,  "life  may  not  be 
nearly so happy as it was," but it is not beyond repair.  433 
U. S.,  at  598.  Rape  has  a  permanent  psychological,  emo-
tional,  and  sometimes  physical  impact  on  the  child.  See  C. 
Bagley & K. King, Child Sexual Abuse: The Search for Heal-
ing 2-24, 111-112 (1990); Finkelhor & Browne, Assessing the 
Long-Term  Impact  of  Child  Sexual  Abuse:  A  Review  and 
Conceptualization, in Handbook on Sexual Abuse of Children 
55-60 (L. Walker ed. 1988).  We cannot dismiss the years of 
long  anguish  that  must  be  endured  by  the  victim  of  child 
rape. 

It does not follow, though, that capital punishment is a pro-
portionate  penalty  for  the  crime.  The  constitutional  prohi-
bition  against  excessive  or  cruel  and  unusual  punishments 
mandates  that  the  State's  power  to  punish  "be  exercised 
within the limits of civilized standards."  Trop, 356 U. S., at 
99,  100  (plurality  opinion).  Evolving  standards  of  decency 
that  mark  the  progress  of  a  maturing  society  counsel  us  to 
be most hesitant before interpreting the Eighth Amendment 
to allow the extension of the death penalty, a hesitation that 
has  special  force  where  no  life  was  taken  in  the  commission 
of  the  crime.  It  is  an  established  principle  that  decency,  in 
its  essence,  presumes  respect  for  the  individual  and  thus 
moderation  or  restraint  in  the  application  of  capital  punish-
ment.  See id., at 100.

Opinion of the Court 
cability,'  is  an  excessive  penalty  for  the  rapist  who,  as such,  does  not  take  human  life."  433  U. S.,  at  597-598 

(plurality opinion) (citation omitted). 
The  same  distinction  between  homicide  and  other  serious violent  offenses  against  the  individual  informed  the  Court's 

analysis in Enmund, 458 U. S. 782, where the Court held that the death penalty for the crime of vicarious felony murder is 
disproportionate  to  the  offense.  The  Court  repeated  there the  fundamental,  moral  distinction  between  a  "murderer" 
and a "robber," noting that while "robbery is a serious crime deserving serious punishment," it is not like death in its "se-
verity  and  irrevocability."  Id.,  at  797  (internal  quotation marks omitted). 

Consistent  with  evolving  standards  of  decency  and  the teachings of our precedents we conclude that, in determining 
whether the death penalty is excessive, there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and 
nonhomicide  crimes  against  individual  persons,  even  includ-ing child rape, on the other.  The latter crimes may be dev-
astating  in  their  harm,  as  here,  but  "in  terms  of  moral  de-pravity  and  of  the  injury  to  the  person  and  to  the  public,"

Ibid. In  reaching  our  conclusion  we  find  significant  the  number 
of  executions  that  would  be  allowed  under  respondent's  ap-proach.  The  crime  of  child  rape,  considering  its  reported 
incidents,  occurs  more  often  than  first-degree  murder.  Ap-proximately 5,702 incidents of vaginal, anal, or oral rape of a 
child under  the  age of  12 were reported  nationwide  in  2005; this is almost twice the total incidents of intentional murder 
for  victims  of  all  ages  (3,405)  reported  during  the  same  pe-riod.  See Inter-University Consortium for Political and So-
cial  Research,  National  Incident-Based  Reporting  System, 2005,  Study  No.  4720,  online  at  http://www.icpsr.umich.edu

case file).  Although we have no reliable statistics on convic-tions  for  child  rape,  we  can  surmise  that,  each  year,  there 

are  hundreds,  or  more,  of  these  convictions  just  in  jurisdic-tions  that  permit  capital  punishment.  Cf.  Brief  for  Louisi-
ana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici 
Curiae  1-2,  and  n.  2  (noting  that  there  are  now  at  least  70 
capital rape indictments pending in Louisiana and estimating 
the  actual  number  to  be  over  100).  As  a  result  of  existing rules, see generally 

Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 428-433 (plurality 
opinion),  only  2.2%  of  convicted  first-degree  murderers  are sentenced to death, see Blume, Eisenberg, & Wells, Explain-

ing  Death  Row's  Population  and  Racial  Composition,  1  J.  of 
Empirical  Legal  Studies  165,  171  (2004).  But  under  re-
spondent's  approach,  the  36  States  that  permit  the  death 
penalty could sentence to death all persons convicted of rap-
ing  a  child  less  than  12  years  of  age.  This  could  not  be 
reconciled  with  our  evolving  standards  of  decency  and  the 
necessity to constrain the use of the death penalty. 

It might be said that narrowing aggravators could be used 
in this context, as with murder offenses, to ensure the death 
penalty's restrained application.  We find it difficult to iden-
tify  standards  that  would  guide  the  decisionmaker  so  the 
penalty  is  reserved  for  the  most  severe  cases  of  child  rape 
and yet  not imposed in an arbitrary way.  Even were we to 
forbid,  say,  the  execution  of  first-time  child  rapists,  see 
supra, at 422-423, or require as an aggravating factor a find-
ing that the perpetrator's instant rape offense involved mul-
tiple  victims,  the  jury  still  must  balance,  in  its  discretion, 
those  aggravating  factors  against  mitigating  circumstances. 
In  this  context,  which  involves  a  crime  that  in  many  cases 
will overwhelm a decent person's judgment, we have no con-
fidence that the imposition of the death penalty would not be 
so  arbitrary  as  to  be  "freakis[h],"  Furman,  supra, at 310  
(Stewart,  J.,  concurring).  We  cannot  sanction  this  result 
when the harm to the victim, though grave, cannot be quanti-
fied in the same way as death of the victim.

442  KENNEDY  v.  LOUISIANA 

Opinion of the Court 
ment  and  counsels  against  a  constitutional  ruling  that  the death penalty can be expanded to include this offense. 

The  goal  of  retribution,  which  reflects  society's  and  the victim's interests in seeing that the offender is repaid for the 
hurt he caused, see Atkins, 536 U. S., at 319; Furman, supra, at  308  (Stewart,  J.,  concurring),  does  not  justify  the  harsh-
ness  of  the  death  penalty  here.  In  measuring  retribution, 
as  well  as  other  objectives  of  criminal  law,  it  is  appropriate to  distinguish  between  a  particularly  depraved  murder  that 

merits  death  as  a  form  of  retribution  and  the  crime  of  child rape.  See Part IV-A, 

supra; Coker, supra, at 597-598 (plu-
rality opinion). 

There  is  an  additional  reason  for  our  conclusion  that  im-
posing  the  death  penalty  for  child  rape  would  not  further 
retributive purposes.  In considering whether retribution is 
served, among other factors we have looked to whether capi-
tal punishment "has the potential . . . to allow the community 
as a whole, including the surviving family and friends of the 
victim, to affirm its own judgment that the culpability of the 
prisoner  is  so  serious  that  the  ultimate  penalty  must  be 
sought  and  imposed."  Panetti  v.  Quarterman,  551  U. S. 
930,  958  (2007).  In  considering  the  death  penalty  for  non-
homicide  offenses  this  inquiry  necessarily  also  must  include 
the  question  whether  the  death  penalty  balances  the  wrong 
to the victim.  Cf. Roper, 543 U. S., at 571. 

It  is  not  at  all  evident  that  the  child  rape  victim's  hurt  is 
lessened when the law permits the death of the perpetrator. 
Capital cases require a long-term commitment by those who 
testify  for  the  prosecution,  especially  when  guilt  and  sen-
tencing  determinations  are  in  multiple  proceedings.  In 
cases  like  this  the  key  testimony is  not  just  from  the  family 
but from the  victim herself.  During formative years of her 
adolescence, made  all  the  more daunting  for having  to come 
to terms  with  the  brutality  of her  experience, L. H. was re-
quired  to  discuss  the  case  at  length  with  law  enforcement 
personnel.  In  a  public  trial  she  was  required  to  recount

once  more all  the  details  of  the  crime  to a  jury  as the  State pursued the death of her stepfather.  Cf. G. Goodman et al., 

Testifying  in  Criminal  Court:  Emotional  Effects  on  Child Sexual  Assault  Victims  50,  62,  72  (1992);  Brief  for  National 
Association  of  Social  Workers  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  17-21. And  in  the  end  the  State  made  L.  H.  a  central  figure  in  its 
decision to seek the death penalty, telling the jury in closing 
statements:  "[L.  H.]  is  asking  you,  asking  you  to  set  up  a time and place when he dies."  Tr. 121 (Aug. 26, 2003). 

Society's  desire  to  inflict  the  death  penalty  for  child  rape by  enlisting  the  child  victim  to  assist  it  over  the  course  of 
years in asking  for capital punishment  forces a moral choice 
on  the  child,  who  is  not  of  mature  age  to  make  that  choice. 
The way the  death  penalty here  involves  the  child victim in 
its  enforcement  can  compromise  a  decent  legal  system;  and 
this is but a subset of fundamental difficulties capital punish-
ment  can  cause  in  the  administration  and  enforcement  of 
laws proscribing child rape. 

There  are,  moreover,  serious  systemic  concerns  in  prose-
cuting  the  crime  of  child  rape  that  are  relevant  to  the  con-
stitutionality  of  making  it  a  capital  offense.  The  problem 
of  unreliable,  induced,  and  even  imagined  child  testimony 
means there is a "special risk of wrongful execution" in some 
child rape  cases.  Atkins, supra, at 321.  See also  Brief for 
National  Association  of  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  et  al. 
as  Amici  Curiae  5-17.  This  undermines,  at  least  to  some 
degree,  the  meaningful  contribution  of  the  death  penalty 
to  legitimate  goals  of  punishment.  Studies  conclude  that 
children  are  highly  susceptible  to  suggestive  questioning 
techniques  like  repetition,  guided  imagery,  and  selective  re-
inforcement.  See  Ceci  &  Friedman,  The  Suggestibility  of 
Children: Scientific Research and Legal Implications, 86 Cor-
nell L. Rev. 33, 47 (2000) (there is "strong evidence that chil-
dren,  especially  young  children,  are  suggestible  to  a  signifi-
cant  degree--even  on  abuse-related  questions");  Gross,

Opinion of the Court 
United  States  1989  Through  2003,  95  J.  Crim.  L.  &  C.  523, 539 (2005) (discussing allegations  of abuse  at the Little Ras-

cals  Day  Care  Center);  see  also  Quas,  Davis,  Goodman,  & Myers,  Repeated  Questions,  Deception,  and  Children's  True 
and  False  Reports  of  Body  Touch,  12  Child  Maltreatment 60,  61-66  (2007)  (finding  that  4- to  7-year-olds  "were  able  to 
maintain  [a]  lie  about  body  touch  fairly  effectively  when 
asked  repeated,  direct  questions  during  a  mock  forensic interview"). 

Similar  criticisms  pertain  to  other  cases  involving  child witnesses; but child rape cases present  heightened concerns 
because the central narrative and account of the crime often 
comes  from  the  child  herself.  She  and  the  accused  are,  in 
most  instances,  the  only  ones  present  when  the  crime  was 
committed.  See  Pennsylvania  v.  Ritchie,  480  U. S.  39,  60 
(1987).  Cf. Goodman, supra, at 118.  And the question in a 
capital  case  is  not  just  the  fact  of  the  crime,  including,  say, 
proof of rape as distinct from abuse short of rape, but details 
bearing  upon  brutality  in  its  commission.  These  matters 
are  subject  to  fabrication  or  exaggeration,  or  both.  See 
Ceci  &  Friedman,  supra;  Quas,  supra.  Although  capital 
punishment  does  bring  retribution,  and  the  legislature  here 
has  chosen  to  use  it  for  this  end,  its  judgment  must  be 
weighed, in deciding the  constitutional question, against  the 
special  risks  of  unreliable  testimony  with  respect  to  this 
crime. 

With  respect  to  deterrence,  if  the  death  penalty  adds  to 
the  risk  of  nonreporting,  that,  too,  diminishes  the  penalty's 
objectives.  Underreporting  is  a  common  problem  with  re-
spect to child sexual abuse.  See Hanson, Resnick, Saunders, 
Kilpatrick,  &  Best,  Factors  Related  to  the  Reporting  of 
Childhood  Rape,  23  Child  Abuse  &  Neglect  559,  564  (1999)

of 18 did not disclose their abuse to authorities); Smith et al.,

Opinion of the Court 
(finding that 72% of women raped as children disclosed their abuse to someone, but that only 12% of the victims reported 

the  rape  to  authorities).  Although  we  know  little  about what differentiates those who  report from  those who  do not 
report, see Hanson, supra, at 561, one of the most commonly cited  reasons  for  nondisclosure  is  fear  of  negative  conse-
quences for the perpetrator, a concern that has special force 
where  the  abuser  is  a  family  member,  see  Goodman-Brown, Edelstein,  Goodman,  Jones,  &  Gordon,  Why  Children  Tell: 

A  Model  of  Children's  Disclosure  of  Sexual  Abuse,  27  Child Abuse  &  Neglect  525,  527-528  (2003);  Smith, 

supra,  at  283- 
284  (finding  that,  where  there  was  a  relationship  between 
perpetrator  and  victim,  the  victim  was  likely  to  keep  the 
abuse  a  secret  for  a  longer  period  of  time,  perhaps  because 
of  a  "greater  sense  of  loyalty  or  emotional  bond");  Hanson, 
supra,  at  565-566,  and  Table  3  (finding  that  a  "significantly 
greater  proportion  of  reported  than  nonreported  cases  in-
volved a stranger"); see also Ritchie, supra, at 60.  The ex-
perience of the amici who work with child victims indicates 
that, when the punishment is death, both the victim and the 
victim's  family  members  may  be  more  likely  to  shield  the 
perpetrator  from  discovery,  thus  increasing  underreporting. 
See  Brief  for  National  Association  of  Social  Workers  et 

al.  as  Amici  Curiae  11-13.  As  a  result,  punishment  by 
death  may  not  result  in  more  deterrence  or  more  effective 
enforcement. 

In  addition,  by  in  effect  making  the  punishment  for  child 
rape and murder equivalent, a State that punishes child rape 
by death may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to 
kill the victim.  Assuming the offender behaves in a rational 
way,  as  one  must  to  justify  the  penalty  on  grounds  of  de-
terrence, the penalty in some respects gives less protection, 
not  more,  to  the  victim,  who  is  often  the  sole  witness  to 
the  crime.  See  Rayburn,  Better  Dead  Than  R(ap)ed?:  The 
Patriarchal  Rhetoric  Driving  Capital  Rape  Statutes,  78 
St.  John's  L.  Rev.  1119,  1159-1160  (2004).  It  might  be  ar-

Opinion of the Court 
gued  that,  even  if  the  death  penalty  results  in  a  marginal increase in the incentive to kill, this is counterbalanced by a 

marginally  increased  deterrent  to  commit  the  crime  at  all. Whatever  balance  the  legislature  strikes,  however,  uncer-
tainty on the point makes the argument  for the penalty less compelling than for homicide crimes. 

Each  of  these  propositions,  standing  alone,  might  not  es-tablish  the  unconstitutionality  of  the  death  penalty  for  the 
crime  of  child  rape.  Taken  in  sum,  however,  they  demon-strate  the  serious  negative  consequences  of  making  child 
rape a  capital  offense.  These considerations  lead  us to con-clude,  in  our  independent  judgment,  that  the  death  penalty 
is not a proportional punishment for the rape of a child. 

V 
Our  determination  that  there  is  a  consensus  against  the death penalty for child rape raises the question whether the 

Court's  own  institutional  position  and  its  holding  will  have the  effect  of  blocking  further  or  later  consensus  in  favor  of 
the  penalty  from  developing.  The  Court,  it  will  be  argued, by  the  act  of  addressing  the  constitutionality  of  the  death 
penalty,  intrudes  upon  the  consensus-making  process.  By imposing a negative restraint, the argument runs, the Court 
makes  it  more  difficult  for  consensus  to  change  or  emerge. The  Court,  according  to  the  criticism,  itself  becomes  en-
meshed in the process, part judge and part the maker of that which it judges. 

These  concerns  overlook  the  meaning  and  full  substance of the established proposition that the Eighth Amendment is 
defined by "the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." 

Trop, 356 U. S., at 101 (plu-rality  opinion).  Confirmed  by  repeated,  consistent  rulings 

of  this  Court,  this  principle  requires  that  use  of  the  death penalty be restrained.  The rule of evolving standards of de-
cency  with  specific  marks  on  the  way  to  full  progress  and mature  judgment  means  that  resort  to  the  penalty  must  be

property  resulting  from  [an  oil]  discharge,"  $ 1321(o).  Exxon's  admis-
sion  that  the  CWA  does  not  displace  compensatory  remedies  for  the 
consequences of water pollution, even those for economic harms, leaves 
the company with the untenable claim that the CWA somehow preempts 
punitive  damages,  but  not  compensatory  damages,  for  economic  loss. 
Nothing in the statute points to that result, and the Court has rejected 
similar attempts to sever remedies from their causes of action, see Silk-
wood  v.  Kerr-McGee  Corp.,  464  U. S.  238,  255-256.  There  is  no  clear 
indication of congressional intent  to  occupy the entire  field of pollution 
remedies,  nor  is  it  likely  that  punitive  damages  for  private  harms  will 
have any frustrating effect on the CWA's remedial scheme.  Pp. 484-489. 

3.  The  punitive-damages  award  against  Exxon  was  excessive  as  a 
matter of maritime common law.  In the circumstances of this case, the 
award should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages. 
Pp. 489-515. 

(a)  Although  legal  codes  from  ancient  times  through  the  Middle 
Ages  called  for  multiple  damages  for  certain  especially  harmful  acts, 
modern  Anglo-American  punitive  damages  have  their  roots  in  18th-
century  English  law  and  became  widely  accepted  in  American  courts 
by  the  mid-19th  century.  See,  e. g.,  Day  v.  Woodworth,  13  How.  363, 
371.  Pp. 490-491. 

(b)  The prevailing American rule limits  punitive damages to cases 
of  "enormity,"  Day,  supra,  at  371,  in  which  a  defendant's  conduct  is 
outrageous, owing to gross negligence, willful, wanton, and reckless in-
difference  for  others'  rights,  or  even  more  deplorable  behavior.  The 
consensus  today  is that punitive  damages are aimed at  retribution and 
deterring harmful conduct.  Pp. 491-495. 

(c)  State  regulation  of  punitive  damages  varies.  A  few  States 
award  them  rarely,  or  not  at  all,  and  others  permit  them  only  when 
authorized  by  statute.  Many  States  have  imposed  statutory  limits  on 
punitive  awards,  in  the  form  of  absolute  monetary  caps,  a  maximum 
ratio of punitive to compensatory  damages, or, frequently, some combi-
nation of the two.  Pp. 495-497. 

(d)  American punitive damages have come under criticism in recent 
decades,  but the  most  recent  studies tend to  undercut much  of  it.  Al-
though  some  studies  show  the  dollar  amounts  of  awards  growing  over 
time,  even  in  real  terms,  most  accounts  show  that  the  median  ratio  of 
punitive  to  compensatory  awards  remains  less  than  1:1.  Nor  do  the 
data  show  a  marked  increase  in  the  percentage  of  cases  with  punitive 
awards.  The  real  problem  is  the  stark  unpredictability  of  punitive 
awards.  Courts  are  concerned  with  fairness  as  consistency,  and  the 
available data suggest that the spread between high and low individual 
awards  is  unacceptable.  The  spread  in  state  civil  trials  is  great,  and

the  outlier  cases  subject  defendants  to  punitive  damages  that  dwarf 
the  corresponding  compensatories.  The distribution  of  judge-assessed 
awards  is  narrower,  but  still  remarkable.  These  ranges  might  be  ac-
ceptable if they resulted from efforts to reach a generally accepted opti-
mal  level  of  penalty  and  deterrence  in  cases  involving  a  wide  range  of 
circumstances, but anecdotal evidence suggests that is not the case, see, 
e. g.,  BMW  of  North  America,  Inc.  v.  Gore,  517  U. S.  559,  565,  n.  8. 
Pp. 497-501. 

(e)  This  Court's  response  to  outlier  punitive-damages  awards  has 
thus  far  been  confined  by  claims  that  state-court  awards  violated  due 
process.  See, e. g., State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v.  Campbell, 
538  U. S.  408,  425.  In  contrast,  today's  enquiry  arises  under  federal 
maritime  jurisdiction  and  requires  review  of  a  jury  award  at  the  level 
of judge-made federal common law that precedes and should obviate any 
application  of  the  constitutional  standard.  In  this  context,  the  unpre-
dictability of high punitive awards is in tension with their punitive func-
tion  because  of  the  implication  of  unfairness  that  an  eccentrically  high 
punitive verdict carries.  A penalty should be reasonably predictable in 
its severity, so that even Holmes's "bad man" can look ahead with some 
ability to know what the stakes are in choosing one course of action or 
another.  And  a  penalty  scheme  ought  to  threaten  defendants  with  a 
fair probability of suffering in like degree for like damage.  Cf. Koon v. 
United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113.  Pp. 501-503. 

(f)  The Court considers three approaches, one verbal and two quan-
titative,  to  arrive  at  a  standard  for  assessing  maritime  punitive  dam-
ages.  Pp. 503-515. 

(i)  The  Court  is  skeptical  that  verbal  formulations  are  the  best 
insurance  against  unpredictable  outlier  punitive  awards,  in  light  of  its 
experience with attempts to produce consistency in the analogous busi-
ness of criminal sentencing.  Pp. 503-506. 

(ii)  Thus, the Court looks to quantified limits.  The option of set-
ting a hard dollar punitive cap, however, is rejected because there is no 
"standard"  tort  or  contract  injury,  making  it  difficult  to  settle  upon  a 
particular  dollar  figure  as  appropriate  across  the  board;  and  because  a 
judicially selected dollar cap would carry the serious drawback that the 
issue might not return to the docket before there was a need to revisit 
the figure selected.  Pp. 506-512. 

(iii)  The more promising alternative is to peg punitive awards to 
compensatory damages using a ratio or maximum multiple.  This is the 
model in many States and in analogous federal statutes allowing multi-
ple damages.  The question  is what  ratio is most  appropriate.  An ac-
ceptable standard can be found in the studies showing the median ratio 
of  punitive  to  compensatory  awards.  Those  studies  reflect  the  judg-
ments  of  juries  and  judges  in  thousands  of  cases  as  to  what  punitive

Opinion of the Court 
without  acquiescence  in  the  actions  causing  harm,  whether punitive  damages  have  been  barred  implicitly  by  federal 

statutory law making no provision for them, and whether the award  of  $2.5  billion  in  this  case  is  greater  than  maritime 
law  should  allow  in  the  circumstances.  We  are  equally  di-vided  on  the  owner's  derivative  liability,  and  hold  that  the 
federal  statutory  law  does  not  bar  a  punitive  award  on  top of damages for economic loss, but that the award here should 
be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages. 

I 
On  March  24,  1989,  the  supertanker  Exxon  Valdez grounded on Bligh  Reef off the Alaskan coast, fracturing its 

hull  and  spilling  millions  of  gallons  of  crude  oil  into  Prince William  Sound.  The  owner,  petitioner  Exxon  Shipping  Co. 
(now  SeaRiver  Maritime,  Inc.),  and  its  owner,  petitioner Exxon  Mobil  Corp.  (collectively,  Exxon),  have  settled  state 
and federal claims for environmental damage, with payments exceeding  $1  billion,  and  this  action  by  respondent  Baker 
and others, including commercial fishermen and native Alas-kans, was brought for economic losses to individuals depend-
ent on Prince William Sound for their livelihoods. 

A 
The tanker was over 900 feet long and was used by Exxon to carry crude oil from the end of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline 

in  Valdez,  Alaska,  to  the  lower  48  States.  On  the  night  of the  spill  it  was  carrying  53  million  gallons  of  crude  oil,  or 
over  a  million  barrels.  Its  captain  was  one  Joseph  Hazel-wood,  who  had  completed  a  28-day  alcohol  treatment  pro-
gram  while  employed  by  Exxon,  as  his  superiors  knew,  but dropped  out  of  a  prescribed  followup  program  and  stopped 
going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  According to the District  Court,  "[t]here  was  evidence  presented  to  the  jury 
that  after  Hazelwood  was  released  from  [residential  treat-ment],  he  drank  in  bars,  parking  lots,  apartments,  airports,

In  re  Exxon  Valdez,  No.  A89-0095-CV, 
Order No. 265 (D. Alaska, Jan. 27, 1995), p. 5, App. F to Pet. for  Cert.  255a-256a  (hereinafter  Order  265).  The  jury  also 

heard  contested  testimony  that  Hazelwood  drank  with Exxon officials and that members of the Exxon management 
knew of his relapse.  See ibid.  Although Exxon had a clear 
policy  prohibiting  employees  from  serving  onboard  within four hours of consuming alcohol, see 

In re Exxon Valdez, 270 
F.  3d  1215,  1238  (CA9  2001),  Exxon  presented  no  evidence that it monitored Hazelwood after his return to duty or con-

sidered  giving  him  a  shoreside  assignment,  see  Order  265, 
p. 5, supra, at 256a.  Witnesses testified that before the Val-
dez left port on the night of the disaster, Hazelwood downed 
at least five double vodkas in  the  waterfront bars  of Valdez, 
an intake of about 15 ounces of 80-proof alcohol, enough "that 
a  non-alcoholic  would  have  passed  out."  270  F.  3d,  at  1236. 

The  ship  sailed  at  9:12  p.m.  on  March  23,  1989,  guided  by 
a state-licensed pilot for the first leg out, through the Valdez 
Narrows.  At 11:20 p.m., Hazelwood took active control and, 
owing  to  poor  conditions  in  the  outbound  shipping  lane,  ra-
dioed  the  Coast  Guard  for  permission  to  move  east  across 
the  inbound  lane  to  a  less  icy  path.  Under  the  conditions, 
this  was  a  standard  move,  which  the  last  outbound  tanker 
had  also  taken,  and  the  Coast  Guard  cleared  the  Valdez  to 
cross the inbound lane.  The tanker accordingly steered east 
toward clearer waters, but the move put it in the path of an 
underwater reef off Bligh Island, thus requiring a turn back 
west  into  the  shipping  lane  around  Busby  Light,  north  of 
the reef. 

Two  minutes  before  the  required  turn,  however,  Hazel-
wood  left  the  bridge  and  went  down  to  his  cabin  in  order, 
he  said,  to  do  paperwork.  This  decision  was  inexplicable. 
There  was  expert  testimony  that,  even  if  their  presence  is 
not strictly necessary, captains simply do not quit the bridge 
during  maneuvers  like  this,  and  no  paperwork  could  have

Opinion of the Court 
justified  it.  And  in  fact  the  evidence  was  that  Hazelwood's presence was required, both because there should have been 

two officers on the bridge at all times and his departure left only  one,  and  because  he  was  the  only  person  on  the  entire 
ship  licensed  to  navigate  this  part  of  Prince  William  Sound. To  make  matters  worse,  before  going  below  Hazelwood  put 
the  tanker  on  autopilot,  speeding  it  up,  making  the  turn trickier, and any mistake harder to correct. 

As  Hazelwood  left,  he  instructed  the  remaining  officer, third mate Joseph Cousins, to move the tanker back into the 
shipping lane once it came abeam of Busby Light.  Cousins, unlicensed  to  navigate  in  those  waters,  was  left  alone  with 
helmsman Robert Kagan, a nonofficer.  For reasons that re-main a mystery, they failed to make the turn at Busby Light, 
and a later emergency maneuver attempted by Cousins came too late.  The tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, tearing the 
hull  open  and  spilling  11  million  gallons  of  crude  oil  into Prince William Sound. 

After Hazelwood returned to the  bridge and reported the grounding to the Coast Guard, he tried but failed to rock the 
Valdez  off  the  reef,  a  maneuver  which  could  have  spilled more oil and caused the ship to founder.

1  The Coast Guard's 

nearly  immediate  response  included  a  blood  test  of  Hazel-wood  (the  validity  of  which  Exxon  disputes)  showing  a 

blood-alcohol  level  of  .061  11  hours  after  the  spill.  Supp. App. 307sa.  Experts testified that to have this much alcohol 
in  his  bloodstream  so  long  after  the  accident,  Hazelwood  at 

1 As  it  turned  out,  the  tanker  survived  the  accident  and  remained  in 
Exxon's fleet, which it subsequently transferred to a wholly owned subsid-
iary,  SeaRiver  Maritime,  Inc.  The  Valdez  "was  renamed  several  times, 
finally to the SeaRiver Mediterranean, [and] carried oil between the Per-
sian  Gulf  and  Japan,  Singapore,  and  Australia  for  12  years.  .  .  .  In  2002, 
the ship was pulled from service and `laid up' off a foreign port (just where 
the owners won't say) and prepared for retirement, although, according to 
some  reports,  the  vessel  continues  in  service  under  a  foreign  flag."

Opinion of the Court 
the  time  of  the  spill  must  have  had  a  blood-alcohol  level  of around  .241,  Order  265,  p.  5,  supra,  at  256a,  three  times  the 

legal limit for driving in most States. In the aftermath of the  disaster, Exxon spent around $2.1 
billion  in  cleanup  efforts.  The  United  States  charged  the company with criminal violations of the Clean Water Act, 33 
U. S. C.  $$ 1311(a)  and  1319(c)(1);  the  Refuse  Act  of  1899,  33 U. S. C.  $$ 407  and  411;  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act,  16 
U. S. C.  $$ 703  and  707(a);  the  Ports  and  Waterways  Safety Act,  33  U. S. C.  $ 1232(b)(1);  and  the  Dangerous  Cargo  Act, 
46  U. S. C.  $ 3718(b).  Exxon  pleaded  guilty  to  violations  of the Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act, and the Migratory Bird 
Treaty  Act  and  agreed  to  pay  a  $150  million  fine,  later  re-duced to $25 million plus restitution of $100 million.  A civil 
action by the United States and the State of Alaska for envi-ronmental  harms  ended  with  a  consent  decree  for  Exxon  to 
pay at least $900 million toward restoring natural resources, and  it  paid  another  $303  million  in  voluntary  settlements 
with  fishermen,  property  owners,  and  other  private  parties. 

B 
The  remaining  civil  cases  were  consolidated  into  this  one against  Exxon,  Hazelwood,  and  others.  The  District  Court 

for the District of Alaska divided the plaintiffs seeking com-pensatory damages into three classes: commercial fishermen, 
Native  Alaskans,  and  landowners.  At  Exxon's  behest,  the court also certified a mandatory class of all plaintiffs seeking 
punitive  damages,  whose  number  topped  32,000.  Respond-ents  here,  to  whom  we  will  refer  as  Baker  for  convenience, 
are members of that class. For the  purposes of the  case, Exxon stipulated to  its  neg-
ligence  in  the  Valdez  disaster  and  its  ensuing  liability  for compensatory  damages.  The  court  designed  the  trial  ac-
cordingly:  Phase  I  considered  Exxon  and  Hazelwood's  reck-lessness and thus their potential for punitive liability; Phase 
II  set  compensatory  damages  for  commercial  fishermen  and

Opinion of the Court 
Native  Alaskans;  and  Phase  III  determined  the  amount  of punitive damages for which Hazelwood and Exxon were each 

liable.  (A contemplated Phase IV, setting compensation for still other plaintiffs, was obviated by settlement.) 

In Phase  I,  the jury  heard extensive testimony  about  Ha-zelwood's alcoholism and his conduct on the night of the spill, 
as well as conflicting testimony about Exxon officials' knowl-edge of Hazelwood's  backslide.  At the  close  of Phase  I,  the 
court instructed the jury in part that 

"[a]  corporation  is  responsible  for  the  reckless  acts  of those  employees  who  are  employed  in  a  managerial  ca-

pacity  while  acting  in  the  scope  of  their  employment. The  reckless  act  or  omission  of  a  managerial  officer  or 
employee of a corporation, in the course and scope of the performance  of  his duties,  is held  in  law to be  the  reck-
less act or omission of the corporation."  App. K to Pet. for Cert. 301a. 

The  court  went  on  that  "[a]n  employee  of  a  corporation  is employed  in  a  managerial  capacity  if  the  employee  super-
vises other employees and has responsibility for, and author-ity  over,  a  particular  aspect  of  the  corporation's  business." 
Ibid.  Exxon did not dispute that Hazelwood was a manage-rial  employee  under  this  definition,  see  App.  G,  id.,  at  264a, 
n. 8, and the jury found both Hazelwood and Exxon reckless and thus potentially liable for punitive damages, App. L, id., 
at 303a.2 In Phase II, the jury awarded $287 million in compensatory 
damages  to  the  commercial  fishermen.  After  the  court  de-ducted released claims, settlements, and other payments, the

fault  beyond  the  range  of  reckless  conduct.  The  record  sent  up  to  us 
shows that some thought was given to a trial plan that would have author-
ized  jury  findings  as  to  greater  degrees  of  culpability,  see  App.  164,  but 
that plan was not adopted, whatever the reason; Baker does not argue this 
was error.

Opinion of the Court 
balance  outstanding  was  $19,590,257.  Meanwhile,  most  of the  Native  Alaskan  class  had  settled  their  compensatory 

claims for $20 million, and those who opted out of that settle-ment ultimately settled for a total of around $2.6 million. 

In Phase  III,  the  jury heard about  Exxon's  management's acts and omissions arguably relevant to the  spill.  See App. 
1291-1320,  1353-1367.  At  the  close  of  evidence,  the  court 
instructed  the  jurors  on  the  purposes  of  punitive  damages, emphasizing that they were designed not to provide compen-

satory  relief  but  to  punish  and  deter  the  defendants.  See App. to Brief in Opposition 12a-14a.  The court charged the 
jury  to  consider  the  reprehensibility  of  the  defendants'  con-
duct,  their  financial  condition,  the  magnitude  of  the  harm, 
and  any  mitigating  facts.  Id.,  at  15a.  The  jury  awarded 
$5,000 in punitive damages against Hazelwood and $5 billion 
against Exxon. 

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit up-
held  the  Phase  I  jury  instruction  on  corporate  liability  for 
acts  of  managerial  agents  under  Circuit  precedent.  See 
In  re  Exxon  Valdez,  270  F.  3d,  at  1236  (citing  Protectus 
Alpha  Nav.  Co.  v.  North  Pacific  Grain  Growers,  Inc.,  767 
F.  2d  1379  (CA9  1985)).  With  respect  to  the  size  of  the 
punitive-damages  award,  however,  the  Circuit  remanded 
twice  for  adjustments  in  light  of  this  Court's  due  process 
cases before ultimately itself remitting the award to $2.5 bil-
lion.  See  270  F.  3d,  at  1246-1247;  472  F.  3d  600,  601,  625 
(2006) (per curiam), and 490 F. 3d 1066, 1068 (2007). 

We  granted  certiorari  to  consider  whether  maritime  law 
allows  corporate  liability  for  punitive  damages  on  the  basis 
of  the  acts  of  managerial  agents,  whether  the  Clean  Water 
Act  (CWA),  86  Stat.  816,  33  U. S. C.  $ 1251  et  seq.  (2000  ed. 
and  Supp.  V),  forecloses  the  award  of  punitive  damages  in 
maritime  spill  cases,  and  whether  the  punitive  damages 
awarded against Exxon in this case were excessive as a mat-
ter of maritime common law.  552 U. S. 989 (2007).  We now 
vacate and remand.

482  EXXON  SHIPPING  CO.  v.  BAKER 

Opinion of the Court 

II 
On  the  first  question,  Exxon  says  that  it  was  error  to  in-
struct  the  jury  that  a  corporation  "is  responsible  for  the reckless  acts  of . . .  employees . . . in a  managerial  capacity 

while acting in the scope of their employment." 3  App. K to Pet.  for  Cert.  301a.  The  Courts  of  Appeals  have  split  on 
this  issue,4  and  the  company  relies  primarily  on  two  cases, 
The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546 (1818), and Lake Shore & 
Michigan  Southern  R.  Co.  v.  Prentice,  147  U. S.  101  (1893), to argue that this Court's precedents are clear that punitive 

damages are not available against a shipowner for a shipmas-
ter's  recklessness.  The  former  was  a  suit  in  admiralty 
against the owners of The Scourge, a privateer whose officers 
and crew boarded and plundered a neutral ship, The Amiable 
Nancy.  In  upholding  an  award  of  compensatory  damages, 
Justice Story observed that, 

3 Baker  emphasizes  that the  Phase  I  jury  instructions  also  allowed  the 
jury to find Exxon independently reckless, and that the evidence for fixing 
Exxon's punitive liability at Phase III revolved around the recklessness of 
company officials in supervising Hazelwood and enforcing Exxon's alcohol 
policies.  Thus,  Baker  argues,  it  is  entirely  possible  that  the  jury  found 
Exxon reckless in its own right, and in no way predicated its liability for 
punitive  damages  on  Exxon's  responsibility  for  Hazelwood's  conduct. 
Brief for Respondents 36-39. 

The fact remains, however, that the jury was not required to  state the 
basis of Exxon's recklessness, and the basis for the finding could have been 
Exxon's  own recklessness  or  just Hazelwood's.  Any  error in  instructing 
on the latter ground cannot be overlooked, because "when it is impossible 
to know, in view of the general verdict returned whether the jury imposed 
liability on a permissible or an impermissible ground, the judgment must 
be reversed and the case remanded."  Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing 
Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Bresler,  398  U. S.  6,  11  (1970)  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted).

Opinion of the Court 
"if  this  were  a  suit  against  the  original  wrong-doers,  it might  be  proper  to  . . . visit  upon  them  in  the  shape  of 

exemplary  damages,  the  proper  punishment  which  be-longs to such lawless misconduct.  But it is to be consid-
ered, that this  is a suit against the owners of the priva-teer,  upon  whom  the  law  has,  from  motives  of  policy, 
devolved  a  responsibility  for  the  conduct  of  the  officers and  crew  employed  by  them,  and  yet,  from  the  nature 
of  the  service,  they  can  scarcely  ever  be  able  to  secure to  themselves  an  adequate  indemnity  in  cases  of  loss. 
They  are  innocent  of  the  demerit  of  this  transaction, having neither directed it, nor countenanced it, nor par-
ticipated  in  it  in  the  slightest  degree.  Under  such  cir-cumstances,  we  are  of  opinion,  that  they  are  bound  to 
repair  all  the  real  injuries  and  personal  wrongs  sus-tained  by  the  libellants,  but  they  are  not  bound  to  the 
extent  of  vindictive  damages."  The  Amiable  Nancy, supra, at 558-559 (emphasis in original). 

Exxon takes this statement as a rule barring punitive liabil-ity  against  shipowners  for  actions  by  underlings  not  "di-
rected," "countenanced," or "participated in" by the owners. Exxon further claims that the Court confirmed this rule in 
Lake Shore, supra, a railway  case  in which the  Court relied on The Amiable Nancy to announce, as a matter of pre-Erie 
R. Co. v.  Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), general common law, that "[t]hough [a] principal is liable to make compensation for 
[intentional torts] by his agent, he is not liable to be punished by exemplary damages for an intent in which he did not par-
ticipate."  147 U. S., at 110.  Because maritime law remains federal common law, and because the Court has never revis-
ited  the  issue,  Exxon  argues  that  Lake  Shore  endures  as sound  evidence  of  maritime  law.  And  even  if  the  rule  of 
Amiable  Nancy  and  Lake  Shore  does  not  control,  Exxon urges the Court to fall back to a modern-day variant adopted 
in the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in 
Kolstad v.  American Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526, 544 (1999),

484  EXXON  SHIPPING  CO.  v.  BAKER 

Opinion of the Court 
that  employers  are  not  subject  to  punitive  damages  for  dis-criminatory  conduct  by  their  managerial  employees  if  they 

can show that they maintained and enforced good-faith anti-discrimination policies. 

Baker supports the Ninth Circuit in upholding the instruc-tion,  as  it  did  on  the  authority  of  Protectus  Alpha  Nav.  Co., 
767  F.  2d  1379,  which  followed  the  Restatement  rule  recog-nizing  corporate  liability  in  punitive  damages  for  reckless 
acts of managerial employees, see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 909(c) (1977) (hereinafter Restatement).  Baker says 
that The Amiable Nancy offers nothing but dictum, because punitive  damages  were  not  at  issue,  and  that 

Lake  Shore merely  rejected  company  liability  for  the  acts  of  a  railroad 

conductor,  while  saying  nothing  about  liability  for  agents higher up the ladder, like ship captains.  He also makes the 
broader  point  that  the  opinion  was  criticized  for  failing  to reflect  the  majority  rule  of  its  own  time,  not  to  mention  its 
conflict with the respondeat superior rule in the overwhelm-ing  share  of  land-based  jurisdictions  today.  Baker  argues 
that the maritime rule should conform to modern land-based common law, where a majority of States allow punitive dam-
ages for the conduct of any employee, and most others follow the  Restatement,  imposing  liability  for  managerial  agents. 

The Court is equally divided on this question, and "[i]f the judges  are  divided, the  reversal  cannot  be  had,  for  no  order 
can be made."  Durant v.  Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107, 112 (1869). We  therefore  leave  the  Ninth  Circuit's  opinion  undisturbed 
in  this  respect,  though  it  should  go  without  saying  that  the disposition here is not precedential on the derivative liability 
question.  See, e. g., Neil v.  Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 192 (1972); Ohio ex rel. Eaton v.  Price, 364 U. S. 263, 264 (1960) (opinion 
of Brennan, J.).  III 

Exxon  next  says  that,  whatever  the  availability  of  mari-time  punitive  damages  at  common  law,  the  CWA  preempts 
them.  Baker responds  with both  procedural and merits ar-guments, and although we do not dispose of the issue on pro-

Opinion of the Court 
cedure, a short foray into its history is worthwhile as a cau-tionary tale. 

At  the  pretrial  stage,  the  District  Court  controlled  a flood  of  motions  by  an  order  staying  them  for  any  purpose 
except  discovery.  The  court  ultimately  adopted  a  case-management plan allowing receipt of seven specific summary 
judgment  motions  already  scheduled,  and  requiring  a  party with  additional  motions  to  obtain  the  court's  leave.  One  of 
the motions scheduled sought summary judgment for Exxon on  the  ground  that  the  Trans-Alaska  Pipeline  Authorization 
Act, 87 Stat. 584, 43 U. S. C. $$ 1651-1656, displaced maritime common law and foreclosed the  availability  of punitive dam-
ages.  The District Court denied the motion. After  the  jury  returned  the  Phase  III  punitive-damages 
verdict on September 16, 1994, the parties stipulated that all post-trial Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50 and 59 motions 
would  be  filed  by  September  30,  and  the  court  so  ordered. App.  1410-1411.  Exxon  filed  11  of  them,  including  several 
seeking  a  new  trial  or  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  on  one ground  or  another  going  to  the  punitive-damages  award,  all 
of  which  were  denied  along  with  the  rest.  On  October  23, 1995, almost 13 months after the stipulated motions deadline, 
Exxon moved for the District  Court to suspend the  motions stay, App. to Brief in Opposition 28a-29a, to allow it to file a 
"Motion and  Renewed Motion . . . for  Judgment on  Punitive Damages  Claims"  under  Rules  49(a)  and  58(2)  and,  "to  the 
extent they may be applicable, pursuant to Rules 50(b), 56(b), 56(d),  59(a),  and  59(e)," 

5  id.,  at  30a-31a.  Exxon's  accompa-

5 Most of the Rules under which Exxon sought relief are inapplicable on 
their  face.  See  Fed.  Rules  Civ.  Proc.  49(a),  56(b),  (d),  and  58(2).  Rules 
50  and 59  are less  inapt:  they allow,  respectively, entry  of  judgment  as  a 
matter  of  law  and  alteration  or  amendment  of  the  judgment.  (At  oral 
argument,  counsel  for  Exxon  ultimately  characterized  the  motion  as  one 
under Rule 50.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.) 

But to say that Rules 50 and 59 are less inapt than the other Rules is a 
long  way  from  saying  they  are  apt.  A  motion  under  Rule  50(b)  is  not 
allowed  unless  the  movant  sought  relief  on  similar  grounds  under  Rule 
50(a) before the case was submitted to the jury.  See Rule 50(b); see also,

486  EXXON  SHIPPING  CO.  v.  BAKER 

Opinion of the Court 
nying memorandum asserted that two recent cases, Glynn v. Roy  Al  Boat  Management  Corp.,  57  F.  3d  1495  (CA9  1995), 

and Guevara v.  Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d 1496 (CA5 1995), suggested that the rule of maritime punitive damages 
was  displaced  by  federal  statutes,  including  the  CWA.  On November 2, 1995, the District Court summarily denied Ex-
xon's  request  to  file  the  motion,  App.  to  Brief  in  Opposi-tion  35a,  and  in  January  1996  (following  the  settlement  of 
the  Phase  IV  compensatory  claims)  the  court  entered  final judgment. 

Exxon renewed the CWA preemption argument before the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of Appeals recognized that Exxon 
had  raised  the  CWA  argument  for  the  first  time  13  months after  the  Phase  III  verdict,  but  decided  that  the  claim 
"should not be treated as waived," because Exxon had "con-sistently  argued  statutory  preemption"  throughout  the  liti-
gation,  and  the  question  was  of  "massive  .  .  .  significance" given the "ambiguous circumstances" of the case.  270 F. 3d, 
at  1229.  On  the  merits,  the  Circuit  held  that  the  CWA  did not  preempt  maritime  common  law  on  punitive  damages. 
Id., at 1230. Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion, its 
reasons for reaching it do not hold up.  First, the reason the court  thought  that  the  CWA  issue  was  not  in  fact  waived 
was that Exxon had alleged other statutory grounds for pre-emption from the outset of the trial.  But that is not enough. 

e. g.,  Zachar  v.  Lee,  363  F.  3d  70,  73-74  (CA1  2004);  9B  C.  Wright  &  A. 
Miller,  Federal  Practice  and  Procedure  $ 2537,  pp.  603-604  (3d  ed.  2008). 
Rule 59(e) permits a court to alter or amend a judgment, but it "may not 
be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise arguments or present evidence 
that  could  have  been  raised  prior  to  the  entry  of  judgment."  11  C. 
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  $ 2810.1, pp. 127-128 
(2d ed. 1995) (footnotes omitted).  Where Exxon has been unable to dem-
onstrate that any Rule supported the motion, we need not choose the best 
of  the  worst,  and  risk  implying  that  this  last-minute  motion  was  appro-
priate under any Rule.  Suffice it to say that, whatever type of motion it 
was supposed to be, it was very, very late.

Opinion of the Court 
It  is  true  that  "[o]nce  a  federal  claim  is  properly  presented, 
a  party  can  make  any  argument  in  support  of  that  claim; 
parties  are  not  limited  to  the  precise  arguments  they  made 
below."  Yee  v.  Escondido,  503  U. S.  519,  534  (1992).  But 
this  principle  stops  well  short  of  legitimizing  Exxon's  un-
timely  motion.  If  "statutory  preemption"  were  a  sufficient 
claim  to  give  Exxon  license  to  rely  on  newly  cited  statutes 
anytime  it  wished,  a  litigant  could  add  new  constitutional 
claims as he went along, simply because he had "consistently 
argued"  that  a  challenged  regulation  was  unconstitutional. 
See  id.,  at  533  (rejecting  substantive  due  process  claim 
by  takings  petitioners  who  failed  to  preserve  it  below); 
Browning-Ferris  Industries  of  Vt.,  Inc.  v.  Kelco  Disposal, 
Inc.,  492  U. S.  257,  277,  n.  23  (1989)  (rejecting  due  process 
claim by Eighth Amendment petitioners). 

That  said,  the  motion  still  addressed  the  Circuit's  discre-
tion, to which the "massive" significance of the question and 
the  "ambiguous  circumstances"  of  the  case  were  said  to  be 
relevant.  270  F.  3d,  at  1229.  "It  is  the  general  rule,  of 
course,  that  a  federal  appellate  court  does  not  consider  an 
issue  not  passed  upon  below,"  Singleton  v.  Wulff,  428  U. S. 
106, 120 (1976), when to deviate from this rule being a matter 
"left  primarily  to  the  discretion  of  the  courts  of  appeals,  to 
be  exercised  on  the  facts  of  individual  cases,"  id.,  at  121. 
We have previously stopped short of stating a general princi-
ple  to  contain  appellate  courts'  discretion,  see  ibid.,  and  we 
exercise the same restraint today.6 

6 We do have to say, though, that the Court of Appeals gave short shrift 
to the District Court's commendable management of  this gargantuan liti-
gation, and if the case turned on the propriety of the Circuit's decision to 
reach  the  preemption  issue  we  would  take  up  the  claim  that  it  exceeded 
its  discretion.  Instead,  we  will  only  say  that  to  the  extent  the  Ninth 
Circuit  implied  that  the  unusual  circumstances  of  this  case  called  for  an 
exception  to  regular  practice,  we  think  the  record  points  the  other  way. 

Of course  the Court of Appeals was correct  that the case  was complex 
and  significant,  so  much  so,  in  fact,  that  the  District  Court  was  fairly

488  EXXON  SHIPPING  CO.  v.  BAKER 

Opinion of the Court 
As  to  the  merits,  we  agree  with  the  Ninth  Circuit  that Exxon's  late-raised  CWA  claim  should  fail.  There  are  two 

ways to construe Exxon's argument that the CWA's penalties for water pollution, see 33 U. S. C. $ 1321 (2000 ed. and Supp. 
V),  preempt  the  common  law  punitive-damages  remedies  at issue  here.  The  company  could  be  saying  that  any  tort  ac-
tion predicated on an oil spill is preempted unless $ 1321 ex-
pressly  preserves  it.  Section  1321(b)  (2000  ed.)  protects "the  navigable  waters  of  the  United  States,  adjoining 

shorelines, . . . [and] natural resources" of the United States, subject  to  a  saving  clause  reserving  "obligations . . .  under 
any  provision  of  law  for  damages  to  any  publicly  owned  or privately  owned  property  resulting  from  a  discharge  of  any 
oil,"  $ 1321(o).  Exxon  could  be  arguing  that,  because  the saving clause makes no mention of preserving punitive dam-
ages  for  economic  loss,  they  are  preempted.  But  so,  of 
course,  would  a  number  of  other  categories  of  damages 
awards that Exxon did not claim were preempted.  If Exxon 
were  correct  here,  there  would  be  preemption  of  provisions 
for  compensatory  damages  for  thwarting  economic  activity 
or, for that matter, compensatory damages for physical, per-
sonal injury from oil spills or other water pollution.  But we 
find  it  too  hard  to  conclude  that  a  statute  expressly  geared 
to  protecting  "water,"  "shorelines,"  and  "natural  resources" 

required to divide it into four phases, to oversee a punitive-damages class 
of 32,000 people, and to manage a motions industry that threatened to halt 
progress completely.  But the complexity of a case does not eliminate the 
value of waiver and forfeiture rules, which ensure that parties can deter-
mine  when  an  issue is  out  of  the  case,  and  that  litigation remains,  to  the 
extent possible, an orderly progression.  "The reason for the rules is not 
that litigation is a game, like golf, with arbitrary rules to test the skill of 
the  players.  Rather,  litigation  is  a  `winnowing  process,'  and  the  proce-
dures for preserving or waiving issues are part of the machinery by which 
courts  narrow  what  remains  to  be  decided."  Poliquin  v.  Garden  Way, 
Inc.,  989  F.  2d  527,  531  (CA1  1993)  (Boudin,  J.)  (citation  omitted).  The 
District  Court's  sensible  efforts  to  impose  order  upon  the  issues  in  play 
and the progress of the trial deserve our respect.

Opinion of the Court 
was  intended  to  eliminate  sub  silentio  oil  companies'  com-mon law duties to refrain from injuring the bodies and liveli-

hoods of private individuals. Perhaps  on  account  of  its  overbreadth,  Exxon  disclaims 
taking  this  position,  admitting  that  the  CWA  does  not  dis-place compensatory remedies for consequences of water pol-
lution,  even  those  for  economic  harms.  See,  e. g.,  Reply Brief for  Petitioners 15-16.  This concession,  however, 
leaves Exxon with the equally untenable claim that the CWA somehow preempts punitive damages, but not compensatory 
damages,  for  economic  loss.  But  nothing  in  the  statutory text  points  to  fragmenting  the  recovery  scheme  this  way, 
and  we  have  rejected  similar  attempts  to  sever  remedies from  their  causes  of  action.  See 

Silkwood  v.  Kerr-McGee 
Corp.,  464  U. S.  238,  255-256  (1984).  All  in  all,  we  see  no clear  indication  of  congressional  intent  to  occupy  the  entire 

field  of  pollution  remedies,  see,  e. g.,  United  States  v.  Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534 (1993) ("In order to abrogate a common-law 
principle, the statute must speak directly to the question ad-dressed by the common law" (internal quotation marks omit-
ted)); nor  for that  matter do we  perceive that punitive dam-ages for private harms will have any frustrating effect on the 
CWA  remedial  scheme,  which  would  point  to  preemption.7 

IV 
Finally, Exxon raises an issue of first impression about pu-nitive damages  in maritime  law, which  falls  within a federal 

court's jurisdiction to decide in the manner of a common law 

7 In this respect, this case differs from two invoked by Exxon, Middlesex 
County  Sewerage  Authority  v.  National  Sea  Clammers  Assn.,  453  U. S. 
1 (1981), and Milwaukee v.  Illinois, 451 U. S. 304 (1981), where plaintiffs' 
common law nuisance claims amounted to arguments for effluent-discharge 
standards different from those provided by the CWA.  Here, Baker's pri-
vate claims for economic injury do not threaten similar interference with 
federal  regulatory  goals  with  respect  to  "water,"  "shorelines,"  or  "natu-
ral resources."

Opinion of the Court 
court, subject to the authority of Congress to legislate other-wise  if  it  disagrees  with  the  judicial  result.  See  U.  S. 

Const.,  Art.  III,  $ 2,  cl.  1;  see,  e. g.,  Edmonds  v.  Compagnie Generale  Transatlantique,  443  U. S.  256,  259  (1979)  ("Admi-
ralty  law  is  judge-made  law  to  a  great  extent");  Romero  v. 
International  Terminal  Operating  Co.,  358  U. S.  354,  360- 361  (1959)  (constitutional  grant  "empowered  the  federal 

courts . . . to  continue  the  development  of  [maritime]  law"). In  addition  to  its  resistance  to  derivative  liability  for  puni-
tive  damages  and  its  preemption  claim  already  disposed  of, Exxon  challenges  the  size  of  the  remaining  $2.5  billion 
punitive-damages  award.  Other  than  its  preemption  argu-ment,  it  does  not  offer  a  legal  ground  for  concluding  that 
maritime  law should  never  award  punitive  damages,  or  that none  should  be  awarded  in  this  case,  but  it  does  argue  that 
this  award  exceeds  the  bounds  justified  by  the  punitive-damages  goal  of  deterring  reckless  (or  worse)  behavior  and 
the  consequently  heightened  threat  of  harm.  The  claim goes to our understanding of the place of punishment in mod-
ern civil law and reasonable standards of process in adminis-tering  punitive  law,  subjects  that  call  for  starting  with  a 
brief account of the history behind today's punitive damages. 

A 
The modern Anglo-American doctrine of punitive damages dates  back  at  least  to  1763,  when  a  pair  of  decisions  by  the 

Court  of  Common  Pleas  recognized  the  availability  of  dam-ages  "for  more  than  the  injury  received."  Wilkes  v.  Wood, 
Lofft 1,  18,  98 Eng. Rep.  489, 498  (1763) (Lord  Chief Justice Pratt).  In  Wilkes  v.  Wood,  one  of  the  foundations  of  the 
Fourth  Amendment,  exemplary  damages  awarded  against the Secretary of State, responsible for an unlawful search of 
John Wilkes's papers, were a spectacular #4,000.  See gener-ally 

Boyd  v.  United  States,  116  U. S.  616,  626  (1886).  And in Huckle  v.  Money,  2  Wils.  205,  206-207,  95  Eng.  Rep.  768, 

768-769  (K.  B.  1763),  the  same  judge  who  is  recorded  in

Opinion of the Court 
Wilkes  gave  an  opinion  upholding  a  jury's  award  of  #300 (against  a  government  officer  again)  although  "if  the  jury 

had  been  confined  by  their  oath  to  consider  the  mere  per-sonal  injury  only,  perhaps  [#20]  damages  would  have  been 
thought damages sufficient." Awarding  damages  beyond  the  compensatory  was  not, 
however, a wholly novel idea even then, legal codes from an-cient times through the Middle Ages having called for multi-
ple  damages  for  certain  especially  harmful  acts.  See,  e. g., Code  of  Hammurabi  $ 8,  p.  13  (R.  Harper  ed.  1904)  (tenfold 
penalty  for  stealing  the  goat  of  a  freed  man);  Statute  of Gloucester,  1278,  6  Edw.  I,  ch.  5,  1  Stat.  at  Large  66  (treble 
damages for waste).  But punitive damages were a common law  innovation  untethered  to  strict  numerical  multipliers, 
and  the  doctrine  promptly  crossed  the  Atlantic,  see,  e. g., Genay  v.  Norris, 1  S.  C.  L.  6,  7  (1784);  Coryell  v.  Colbaugh, 
1  N.  J.  L.  77  (1791),  to  become  widely  accepted  in  American courts  by  the  middle  of  the  19th  century,  see,  e. g.,  Day  v. 
Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852). 

B 
Early  common  law  cases  offered  various  rationales  for punitive-damages awards, which were then generally dubbed 

"exemplary,"  implying  that  these  verdicts  were  justified  as punishment  for  extraordinary  wrongdoing,  as  in  Wilkes's 
case.  Sometimes,  though,  the  extraordinary  element  em-phasized  was  the  damages  award  itself,  the  punishment 
being "for example's  sake," Tullidge v.  Wade, 3  Wils. 18, 19, 95  Eng.  Rep.  909  (K.  B.  1769)  (Lord  Chief  Justice  Wilmot), 
"to  deter  from  any  such  proceeding  for  the  future,"  Wilkes, 
supra,  at  19,  98  Eng.  Rep.,  at  498-499.  See  also  Coryell, 
supra, at 77 (instructing the jury "to give damages for exam-ple's sake, to prevent such offences in [the] future"). 

A  third  historical  justification,  which  showed  up  in  some of  the  early  cases,  has  been  noted  by  recent  commentators, 
and that was the need "to compensate for intangible injuries,

Opinion of the Court 
modern American jurisdictions, where juries are customarily instructed  on twin goals  of punitive awards.  See, e. g., Cal. 

Jury  Instr.,  Civil,  No.  14.72.2  (2008)  ("You  must  now  deter-mine  whether  you  should  award  punitive  damages  against 
defendant[s] .  . . for the  sake of example and by way of pun-
ishment");  N.  Y.  Pattern  Jury  Instr.,  Civil,  No.  2:278  (2007) ("The purpose of punitive damages is not  to compensate the 

plaintiff  but to punish the  defendant . . . and thereby  to dis-courage  the  defendant . . .  from  acting  in  a  similar  way  in 
the  future").  The  prevailing  rule  in  American  courts  also limits  punitive  damages  to  cases  of  what  the  Court  in 

Day, 
supra,  at  371,  spoke  of  as  "enormity,"  where  a  defendant's conduct  is  "outrageous,"  4  Restatement  $ 908(2),  owing  to 

"gross  negligence,"  "willful,  wanton,  and  reckless  indiffer-ence for the rights of others," or behavior even more deplor-
able, 1 Schlueter $ 9.3(A).10 Under  the  umbrellas  of  punishment  and  its  aim  of  deter-
rence,  degrees  of  relative  blameworthiness  are  apparent. 
Reckless conduct is not intentional or malicious, nor is it nec-essarily  callous  toward  the  risk  of  harming  others,  as  op-

posed  to  unheedful  of  it.  See,  e. g.,  2  Restatement  $ 500, Comment

indifference  to,  that  risk.  In  the  other  the  actor  has  such knowledge, or reason to know, of the facts, but does not real-
ize  or  appreciate  the  high  degree  of  risk  involved,  although a  reasonable  man  in  his  position  would  do  so").  Action 
taken  or  omitted  in  order  to  augment  profit  represents  an 
enhanced  degree  of  punishable  culpability,  as  of  course  does willful  or  malicious  action,  taken  with  a  purpose  to  injure. 

See  4  id.,  $ 908,  Comment  e,  p.  466  (1977)  ("In  determining the  amount  of  punitive  damages,  .  .  .  the  trier  of  fact  can 
properly consider not merely the act itself but all the circum-
stances  including  the  motives  of  the  wrongdoer  .  .  .  "); 
cf.  Alaska  Stat.  $ 09.17.020(g)  (2006)  (higher  statutory  limit 
applies  where  conduct  was  motivated  by  financial  gain  and 
its adverse consequences were known to the defendant); Ark. 
Code  Ann.  $ 16-55-208(b)  (2005)  (statutory  limit  does  not 
apply where the defendant intentionally pursued a course of 
conduct for the purpose of causing injury or damage). 

Regardless of culpability, however, heavier punitive 
awards have been thought to be justifiable when wrongdoing 
is  hard  to  detect  (increasing  chances  of  getting  away  with 
it), see, e. g., BMW of North America, Inc. v.  Gore, 517 U. S. 
559, 582 (1996) ("A higher ratio may also be justified in cases 
in which the injury is hard to detect"), or when the value of 
injury and the corresponding compensatory award are small 
(providing  low  incentives  to  sue),  see,  e. g.,  ibid.  ("[L]ow 
awards  of  compensatory  damages  may  properly  support  a 
higher ratio . . . if,  for  example, a particularly egregious act 
has  resulted  in  only  a  small  amount  of  economic  damages");

others  permit  punitive  damages  only  when  authorized  by statute: Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Washington as a mat-
ter of common law, and New Hampshire by statute codifying common  law  tradition.  See 

Ross  v.  Conoco,  Inc.,  02-0299, p. 14 (La. 10/15/02), 828 So. 2d 546, 555; Flesner v.  Technical 

Communications  Corp.,  410  Mass.  805,  813,  575  N.  E.  2d 1107,  1112 (1991);  Fisher  Properties, Inc. v.  Arden-Mayfair, 
Inc., 106 Wash. 2d 826, 852, 726 P. 2d 8, 23 (1986); N. H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.  $ 507:16  (1997);  see  also  Fay  v.  Parker,  53  N.  H. 

342,  382  (1872).  Michigan  courts  recognize  only  exemplary damages supportable as compensatory, rather than truly pu-
nitive, see Peisner v.  Detroit Free Press, Inc., 104 Mich. App. 59, 68, 304 N. W. 2d 814, 817 (1981), while Connecticut courts 
have  limited  what  they  call  punitive  recovery  to  the  "ex-penses of bringing the legal action, including attorney's fees, 
less taxable costs," Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. v.  Larsen, 232 Conn. 480, 517, n. 38, 656 A. 2d 1009, 1029, n. 38 (1995). 

As  for  procedure,  in  most  American  jurisdictions  the amount  of  the  punitive  award  is  generally  determined  by  a 
jury  in  the  first  instance,  and  that  "determination  is  then reviewed  by  trial  and  appellate  courts  to  ensure  that  it  is 
reasonable."  Pacific  Mut.  Life  Ins.  Co.  v.  Haslip,  499  U. S. 1,  15  (1991);  see  also 

Honda  Motor  Co.  v.  Oberg,  512  U. S. 415,  421-426  (1994).

Opinion of the Court 
imposing statutory limits on punitive awards, in the form of absolute  monetary  caps,  see, 

e. g.,  Va.  Code  Ann.  $ 8.01-38.1 
(Lexis  2007)  ($350,000  cap),  a  maximum  ratio  of  punitive to  compensatory  damages,  see, 

e. g.,  Ohio  Rev.  Code  Ann. 

$ 2315.21(D)(2)(a)  (Lexis  2001)  (2:1  ratio  in  most  tort  cases), or, frequently, some combination of the two, see, 

e. g., Alaska 
Stat.  $ 09.17.020(f )  (2006)  (greater  of  3:1  ratio  or  $500,000  in 
most  actions).  The  States  that  rely  on  a  multiplier  have adopted a variety of ratios, ranging from 5:1 to 1:1.

12 

Despite  these  limitations,  punitive  damages  overall  are higher  and  more  frequent  in  the  United  States  than  they 

are  anywhere  else.  See,  e. g.,  Gotanda,  Punitive  Damages: A Comparative Analysis, 42 Colum. J. Transnat'l  L. 391,  421 
(2004);  2  Schlueter  $ 22.0.  In  England  and  Wales,  punitive, or exemplary, damages are available only for oppressive, ar-
bitrary,  or  unconstitutional  action  by  government  servants; injuries  designed  by  the  defendant  to  yield  a  larger  profit 
than  the  likely  cost  of  compensatory  damages;  and  conduct 
for which punitive damages are expressly authorized by stat-
ute.  Rookes  v.  Barnard,  [1964]  1  All  E.  R.  367,  410-411 
(H. L.).  Even in the circumstances where punitive damages 
are  allowed,  they  are  subject  to  strict,  judicially  imposed 
guidelines.  The  Court  of  Appeal  in  Thompson  v.  Commis-
sioner of Police of Metropolis, [1998] Q. B. 498, 518, said that 

12 See, e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 510.265(1) (Vernon Supp. 2008) (greater 
of  5:1  or  $500,000  in  most  cases);  Ala.  Code  $$ 6-11-21(a),  (d)  (2005) 
(greater  of  3:1  or  $1.5  million  in  most  personal  injury  suits,  and  3:1  or 
$500,000  in  most  other  actions);  N.  D.  Cent.  Code  Ann.  $ 32-03.2-11(4) 
(Supp.  2007)  (greater  of  2:1  or  $250,000);  Colo.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-21- 
102(1)(a) (2007) (1:1). 

Oklahoma has a graduated scheme, with the limit on the punitive award 
turning on the nature of the defendant's conduct.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 23, 

$ 9.1(B) (West 2001) (greater of 1:1 or $100,000 in cases involving "reckless 
disregard");  $ 9.1(C)  (greater  of  2:1,  $500,000,  or  the  financial  benefit  de-
rived  by  the  defendant,  in  cases  of  intentional  and  malicious  conduct); 

$ 9.1(D)  (no  limit  where  the  conduct  is  intentional,  malicious,  and  life 
threatening).

Opinion of the Court 
a ratio of more than three times the amount of compensatory damages  will  rarely  be  appropriate;  awards  of  less  than 

#5,000  are  likely  unnecessary;  awards  of  #25,000  should  be exceptional; and #50,000 should be considered the top. 

For  further  contrast  with  American  practice,  Canada  and Australia  allow  exemplary  damages  for  outrageous  conduct, 
but  awards  are  considered  extraordinary  and  rarely  issue. See  2 Schlueter  $$ 22.1(B),  (D).  Noncompensatory  damages 
are  not  part  of  the  civil-code  tradition  and  thus  unavailable in such countries as France, Germany, Austria, and Switzer-
land.  See  id., $$ 22.2(A)-(C),  (E).  And  some  legal systems not  only  decline  to  recognize  punitive  damages  themselves 
but refuse to enforce foreign punitive judgments as contrary to public policy.  See, 

e. g., Gotanda, Charting Developments Concerning  Punitive  Damages:  Is  the  Tide  Changing?  45 

Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 507, 514, 518, 528 (2007) (noting refus-als  to  enforce  judgments  by  Japanese,  Italian,  and  German 
courts, positing that such refusals may be on the decline, but concluding,  "American  parties  should  not  anticipate  smooth 
sailing  when  seeking  to  have  a  domestic  punitive  damages award recognized and enforced in other countries").

American  punitive  damages  have  been  the  target  of  audi-ble criticism in recent decades, see, 

e. g., Note, Developments, The  Paths  of  Civil  Litigation,  113  Harv.  L.  Rev.  1783,  1784- 

1788 (2000) (surveying criticism), but the most recent studies tend to undercut much of it, see id., at 1787-1788.  A survey 
of  the  literature  reveals  that  discretion  to  award  punitive damages  has  not  mass-produced  runaway  awards,  and  al-
though  some  studies  show  the  dollar  amounts  of  punitive-damages awards growing over time, even in real terms,

Opinion of the Court 
ures thus show an overall restraint and suggest that in many instances  a  high  ratio  of  punitive  to  compensatory  damages 

is  substantially  greater  than  necessary  to  punish  or  deter. The real problem, it seems, is the stark unpredictability of 
punitive awards.  Courts of law are concerned with fairness as consistency, and evidence that the median ratio of punitive 
to  compensatory  awards  falls  within  a  reasonable  zone,  or that  punitive  awards  are  infrequent,  fails  to  tell  us  whether 
the spread between high and low individual awards is accept-able.  The  available  data  suggest  it  is  not.  A  recent  com-
prehensive  study  of  punitive  damages  awarded  by  juries  in state civil trials found a median ratio of punitive to compen-
satory  awards  of  just  0.62:1,  but  a  mean  ratio  of  2.90:1  and a  standard  deviation  of  13.81.  Juries,  Judges,  and  Punitive 
Damages  269.16  Even  to  those  of us  unsophisticated  in  sta-
damages  awards  in  San  Francisco  and  Cook  Counties  between  1960  and 
1984). 

One might  posit  that  ill effects  of punitive  damages are  clearest not  in 
actual awards but in the shadow that the punitive regime casts on settle-
ment  negotiations  and  other  litigation  decisions.  See,  e. g.,  Financial  In-
jury Jury  Verdicts  287; Polinsky,  Are Punitive Damages  Really  Insignifi-
cant,  Predictable,  and  Rational?  26  J.  Legal  Studies  663,  664-671  (1997). 
But  here  again  the  data  have  not  established  a  clear  correlation.  See, 
e. g., Eaton, Mustard, & Talarico, The Effects of Seeking Punitive Damages 
on  the  Processing  of  Tort  Claims,  34  J.  Legal  Studies  343,  357,  353-354, 
365  (2005)  (studying  data  from  six  Georgia  counties  and  concluding  that 
"the decision to seek punitive damages has no statistically significant im-
pact"  on  "whether  a  case  that  was  disposed  was  done  so  by  trial  or  by 
some other procedure, including settlement," or "whether a case that was 
disposed  by  means  other  than  a  trial  was  more  likely  to  have  been  set-
tled"); Kritzer & Zemans, The Shadow of Punitives, 1998 Wis. L. Rev. 157,

process."  BMW of North America,  Inc. v.  Gore, 646 So. 2d 619, 626 (1994) (per curiam).  We are aware of no scholarly

E 
The  Court's  response  to  outlier  punitive-damages  awards has  thus  far  been  confined  by  claims  at  the  constitutional 

level,  and  our  cases  have  announced  due  process  standards that  every  award  must  pass.  See, 

e. g.,  State  Farm  Mut. Automobile  Ins.  Co.  v.  Campbell,  538  U. S.  408,  425  (2003); 

Gore, 517 U. S., at 574-575.  Although "we have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by 
a  simple  mathematical  formula,"  id.,  at  582,  we  have  deter-mined  that  "few  awards  exceeding  a  single-digit  ratio  be-
tween  punitive  and  compensatory  damages,  to  a  significant degree,  will  satisfy  due  process," 

State  Farm,  538  U. S.,  at 425;  "[w]hen  compensatory  damages  are  substantial,  then  a 

lesser  ratio,  perhaps  only  equal  to  compensatory  damages, can  reach  the  outermost  limit  of  the  due  process  guaran-
tee," ibid. Today's  enquiry  differs  from  due  process  review  because 
the  case  arises  under  federal  maritime  jurisdiction,  and  we 

17 The  Court  is  aware  of  a  body  of  literature  running  parallel  to  anec-
dotal reports, examining the predictability of punitive awards by conduct-
ing numerous "mock juries," where different "jurors" are confronted with 
the  same  hypothetical  case.  See,  e. g.,  C.  Sunstein,  R.  Hastie,  J.  Payne, 
D.  Schkade,  &  W.  Viscusi,  Punitive  Damages:  How  Juries  Decide  (2002);

Opinion of the Court 
are  reviewing  a  jury  award  for  conformity  with  maritime 
law,  rather  than  the  outer  limit  allowed  by  due  process;  we 
are examining the verdict in the exercise of federal maritime 
common  law  authority,  which  precedes  and  should  obviate 
any  application  of  the  constitutional  standard.  Our  due 
process cases, on the contrary, have all involved awards sub-
ject  in  the  first  instance  to  state  law.  See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  414 
(fraud  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  under 
Utah  law);  Gore,  supra,  at  563,  and  n.  3  (fraud  under  Ala-
bama law); TXO, supra, at 452 (plurality opinion) (slander of 
title  under  West  Virginia  law);  Haslip,  499  U. S.,  at 7  (fraud 
under  Alabama  law).  These,  as  state-law  cases,  could  pro-
vide  no  occasion  to  consider  a  "common-law  standard  of  ex-
cessiveness,"  Browning-Ferris  Industries,  492  U. S.,  at  279, 
and  the  only  matter  of  federal  law  within  our  appellate  au-
thority was the constitutional due process issue. 

Our review of punitive damages today, then, considers not 
their  intersection  with the  Constitution, but the  desirability 
of  regulating  them  as  a  common  law  remedy  for  which  re-
sponsibility  lies  with  this  Court  as  a  source  of  judge-made 
law in the absence of statute.  Whatever may be the consti-
tutional  significance  of  the  unpredictability  of  high  punitive 
awards,  this  feature  of  happenstance  is  in  tension  with  the 
function of the awards as punitive, just because of the impli-
cation  of  unfairness  that  an  eccentrically  high  punitive  ver-
dict  carries  in  a  system  whose  commonly  held  notion  of  law 
rests  on  a  sense  of  fairness  in  dealing  with  one  another. 
Thus, a penalty should be reasonably predictable in its sever-
ity,  so  that  even  Justice  Holmes's  "bad  man"  can  look  ahead 
with  some  ability  to  know  what  the  stakes  are  in  choosing 
one  course  of  action  or  another.  See  The  Path  of  the  Law, 
10  Harv.  L.  Rev.  457,  459  (1897).  And  when  the  bad  man's 
counterparts turn  up from time  to time, the  penalty scheme 
they  face  ought  to  threaten  them  with  a  fair  probability  of 
suffering  in  like  degree  when  they  wreak  like  damage.

Opinion of the Court 
Cf. Koon v.  United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996) (noting the need  "to  reduce  unjustified  disparities"  in  criminal  sentenc-

ing "and so reach toward the evenhandedness and neutrality that  are  the  distinguishing  marks  of  any  principled  system 
of  justice").  The  common  sense  of  justice  would  surely  bar penalties  that  reasonable  people  would  think  excessive  for 
the harm caused in the circumstances.

With  that  aim  ourselves,  we  have  three  basic  approaches to consider, one verbal and two quantitative.  As mentioned 

before,  a  number  of  state  courts  have  settled  on  criteria  for judicial  review  of  punitive-damages  awards  that  go  well  be-
yond traditional "shock the conscience" or "passion and prej-udice" tests.  Maryland, for example, has set forth a nonex-
clusive  list  of  nine  review  factors  under  state  common  law that  include  "degree  of  heinousness,"  "the  deterrence  value 
of  [the  award],"  and  "[w]hether  [the  punitive  award]  bears a  reasonable  relationship  to  the  compensatory  damages 
awarded."  Bowden  v.  Caldor,  Inc.,  350  Md.  4,  25-39,  710 A. 2d 267, 277-284 (1998).  Alabama has seven general crite-
ria, such as "actual or likely harm [from the defendant's con-duct],"  "degree  of  reprehensibility,"  and  "[i]f  the  wrongful 
conduct  was  profitable  to  the  defendant."  Green  Oil  Co.  v. Hornsby,  539  So.  2d  218,  223-224  (1989)  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted).  But  see  McClain  v.  Metabolife  Int'l,  Inc., 259  F.  Supp.  2d  1225,  1236  (ND  Ala.  2003)  (noting  but  not 
deciding claim that post-trial review under Green Oil "is un-constitutionally vague and inadequate"). 

These  judicial  review  criteria  are  brought  to  bear  after juries  render  verdicts  under  instructions  offering,  at  best, 
guidance  no  more  specific  for  reaching  an  appropriate  pen-alty.  In Maryland, for example, which allows punitive dam-
ages  for  intentional  torts  and  conduct  characterized  by  "ac-tual  malice,"

Opinion of the Court 
of Baltimore, 336 Md. 145, 185, 647 A. 2d 405, 424-425 (1994), juries may be instructed that 

"[a]n award for punitive damages should be: "(1)  In  an  amount  that  will  deter  the  defendant  and 
others from similar conduct. "(2)  Proportionate to the wrongfulness of the defend-
ant's conduct and the defendant's ability to pay. "(3)  But  not  designed  to  bankrupt  or  financially  de-
stroy  a  defendant."  Md.  Pattern  Jury  Instr.,  Civil, No. 10:13 (4th ed. 2007). 

In Alabama, juries are instructed to fix an amount after con-sidering  "the  character  and  degree  of  the  wrong  as  shown 
by  the  evidence  in  the  case,  and  the  necessity  of  prevent-ing  similar  wrongs."  1  Ala.  Pattern  Jury  Instr.,  Civil, 
No. 23.21 (Supp. 2007). These  examples  leave  us  skeptical  that  verbal  formula-
tions,  superimposed  on  general  jury  instructions,  are  the best  insurance  against  unpredictable  outliers.  Instructions 
can  go  just  so  far  in  promoting  systemic  consistency  when awards  are  not  tied  to  specifically  proven  items  of  damage 
(the  cost  of  medical  treatment,  say),  and  although  judges  in the  States  that  take  this  approach  may  well  produce  just 
results  by  dint  of  valiant  effort,  our  experience  with  at-tempts  to  produce  consistency  in  the  analogous  business  of 
criminal  sentencing  leaves  us  doubtful  that  anything  but  a quantified  approach  will  work.  A  glance  at  the  experience 
there will explain our skepticism. The points of similarity are obvious.  "[P]unitive damages 
advance  the  interests  of  punishment  and  deterrence,  which are also  among the interests advanced  by the criminal  law."

18 This observation is  not at odds with the holding in Browning-Ferris, 
that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply 
to punitive  damages.  See 492  U. S., at  275.  That  conclusion  did  not  re-
ject the punitive nature of the damages, see ibid., but rested entirely upon

1977 Restatement $ 908, Comment a, at 464 (purposes of pu-nitive  damages  are  "the  same"  as  "that  of  a  fine  imposed 

after a conviction of a crime"); 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(2) (requir-ing  sentencing  courts  to  consider,  inter  alia,  "the  need  for 
the  sentence  imposed  . . . to  provide  just  punishment  for the  offense"  and  "to  afford  adequate  deterrence  to  criminal 
conduct"); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 1A1.1, comment. (Nov. 2007). 

It is instructive, then, that in the last quarter century fed-eral  sentencing  rejected  an  "indeterminate"  system,  with 
relatively  unguided  discretion  to  sentence  within  a  wide range,  under  which  "similarly  situated  offenders  were  sen-
tenced  [to],  and  did  actually  serve,  widely  disparate  sen-tences." 

19  Instead it became a system of detailed guidelines 

tied  to  exactly  quantified  sentencing  results,  under  the  au-thority  of  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act  of  1984,  18  U. S. C. 

$ 3551 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The  importance  of  this  for  us  is  that  in  the  old  federal 
sentencing  system  of  general  standards  the  cohort  of  even the most seasoned judicial penalty-givers defied consistency. 
Judges and defendants alike were "[l]eft at large, wandering in  deserts  of  uncharted  discretion,"  M.  Frankel,  Criminal 
Sentences:  Law  Without  Order  7-8  (1973),  which  is  very much the position of those imposing punitive damages today, 
be they judges or juries, except that they lack even a statu-tory  maximum;  their  only  restraint  beyond  a  core  sense  of 

our  conviction  that  "the  concerns  that  animate  the  Eighth  Amendment" 
were about  "plac[ing] limits on  the steps  a government may take against 
an  individual,"  ibid.  Thus  the  Clause  "does  not  constrain  an  award  of 
money  damages  in  a  civil  suit  when  the  government  neither  has  prose-
cuted  the  action  nor  has  any  right  to  receive  a  share  of  the  damages 
awarded."  Id.,  at  264.  We  noted  the  similarities  of  purpose  between 
criminal penalties and punitive damages and distinguished the two on the 
basis of their differing levels of state involvement.  See id., at 275.

Opinion of the Court 
fairness  is  the  due  process  limit.  This  federal  criminal-law development, with its many state parallels, strongly suggests 

that  as  long  "as  there  are  no  punitive-damages  guidelines, corresponding to the federal and state sentencing guidelines, 
it  is  inevitable  that  the  specific  amount  of  punitive  damages awarded whether by a judge or by a jury will be arbitrary." 
Mathias v.  Accor Economy Lodging, Inc., 347 F. 3d 672, 678 (CA7 2003). 

2 
This is why our better judgment is that eliminating unpre-dictable  outlying  punitive  awards  by  more  rigorous  stand-

ards than  the constitutional limit  will probably have to take the  form  adopted  in  those  States  that  have  looked  to  the 
criminal-law pattern of quantified limits.  One option would be to follow the States that set a hard dollar cap on punitive 
damages,  see  supra,  at  495-496,  a  course  that  arguably would come closest to the  criminal law, rather  like  setting a 
maximum term of years.  The trouble is, though, that there is no "standard" tort or contract injury, making it difficult to 
settle  upon  a  particular  dollar  figure  as  appropriate  across the board.  And of course a judicial selection of a dollar cap 
would carry a serious drawback; a legislature can pick a fig-ure, index it for  inflation,  and revisit  its provision whenever 
there  seems  to  be  a  need  for  further  tinkering,  but  a  court cannot  say  when  an  issue  will  show  up  on  the  docket  again. 
See,  e. g.,  Jones  &  Laughlin  Steel  Corp.  v.  Pfeifer,  462  U. S. 523,  546-547  (1983)  (declining  to  adopt  a  fixed  formula  to 
account  for  inflation  in  discounting  future  wages  to  present value,  in  light  of  the  unpredictability  of  inflation  rates  and 
variation among lost-earnings cases). The  more  promising  alternative  is  to  leave  the  effects  of 
inflation to the jury or judge who assesses the value of actual loss,  by  pegging  punitive  to  compensatory  damages  using  a 
ratio or maximum multiple.  See, e. g., 2 ALI Enterprise Re-sponsibility for Personal Injury: Reporters' Study 258 (1991)

Opinion of the Court 
Although the legal landscape is well populated with exam-ples  of  ratios  and  multipliers  expressing  policies  of  retribu-

tion  and  deterrence,  most  of  them  suffer  from  features  that stand in the way of borrowing them as paradigms of reason-

rule  of  divided  damages  in  favor  of  proportional  liability,  is  to  the  point 
here.  It  is  urged  "that  the  creation  of  a  new  rule  of  damages  in  mari-
time  collision  cases  is  a  task  for  Congress  and  not  for  this  Court.  But 
the  Judiciary  has  traditionally  taken  the  lead  in  formulating  flexible  and 
fair  remedies  in  the  law  maritime,  and  Congress  has  largely  left  to 
this  Court the  responsibility  for fashioning  the controlling  rules of  admi-
ralty  law."  (Internal  quotation  marks  and  footnote  omitted.)  See  also 
Exxon  Co.,  U.  S.  A.  v.  Sofec,  Inc.,  517  U. S.  830  (1996)  (holding  that 
proportional-liability rule  applies  only  to defendants  proximately causing 
an  injury);  McDermott,  Inc.  v.  AmClyde,  511  U. S.  202  (1994)  (adopting 
proportionate-fault  rule  for  calculation  of  nonsettling  maritime  tort  de-
fendants' compensatory liability). 

Indeed, the compensatory remedy sought in this case is itself entirely a 
judicial  creation.  The  common  law  traditionally  did  not  compensate 
purely  economic  harms,  unaccompanied  by  injury  to  person  or  property. 
See K. Abraham, Forms and Functions of Tort Law 247-248 (3d ed. 2007); 
see,  e. g.,  Robins  Dry  Dock  &  Repair  Co.  v.  Dahl,  266  U. S.  449  (1925) 
(imposing rule in maritime context).  But "[t]he courts have . . .  occasion-
ally created exceptions to the rule.  Perhaps the most noteworthy involve 
cases in which there has been natural-resource damage for which no party 
seems  to  have  a  cause  of  action."  Abraham,  supra,  at  249  (discussing 
Union  Oil  Co.  v.  Oppen,  501 F.  2d 558 (CA9  1974) (recognizing  exception 
for commercial fishermen)).  We raise the point not to express agreement 
or disagreement with the Ninth Circuit rule but to illustrate the entirely 
judge-made nature of the landscape we are surveying. 

To be sure, "Congress retains superior authority in these matters," and 
"[i]n this era, an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative 
enactments for policy guidance."  Miles v.  Apex  Marine Corp.,  498 U. S. 
19, 27 (1990).  But we may not slough off our responsibilities for common 
law remedies because Congress has not made a first move, and the absence 
of federal legislation constraining punitive damages does not imply a con-
gressional decision that there should be no quantified rule, cf. Rapanos v. 
United  States,  547  U. S.  715,  749  (2006)  (plurality  opinion)  (noting  the 
Court's  "oft-expressed  skepticism  toward  reading  the  tea  leaves  of  con-
gressional inaction").  Where there is a need for a new remedial maritime 
rule,  past  precedent  argues  for our  setting  a  judicially  derived  standard, 
subject of course to congressional revision.  See, e. g., Reliable Transfer, 
supra, at 409.

able  limitations  suited  for  application  to  this  case.  While  a slim  majority  of  the  States  with  a  ratio  have  adopted  3:1, 

others see fit to apply a lower one, see, e. g., Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann.  $ 13-21-102(1)(a)  (2007)  (1:1);  Ohio  Rev.  Code  Ann. 

$ 2315.21(D)(2)(a)  (Lexis  2005)  (2:1),  and  a  few  have  gone higher,  see, 

e. g.,  Mo.  Ann.  Stat.  $ 510.265(1)  (Supp.  2008) (5:1).  Judgments  may  differ  about  the  weight  to  be  given 

to the slight majority of 3:1 States, but one feature of the 3:1 schemes  dissuades  us  from  selecting  it  here.  With  a  few 
statutory  exceptions,  generally  for  intentional  infliction  of physical  injury  or  other  harm,  see,  e. g.,  Ala.  Code  $ 6-11- 
21( j) (2005); Ark. Code Ann. $ 16-55-208(b) (2005), the States with  3:1  ratios  apply  them  across  the  board  (as  do  other 
States using different fixed multipliers).  That is, the upper limit is not directed to cases like this one, where the tortious 
action  was  worse  than  negligent  but  less  than  malicious,22 exposing  the  tortfeasor  to  certain  regulatory  sanctions  and 
inevitable  damages  actions; 23  the  3:1  ratio  in  these  States also applies to awards in quite different cases involving some 
of the  most  egregious  conduct,  including  malicious  behavior and dangerous activity carried on for the purpose of increas-
ing  a  tortfeasor's  financial  gain.24  We  confront,  instead,  a 

22 Although  the  jury  heard  evidence  that  Exxon  may  have  felt  con-
strained not  to give Hazelwood a  shoreside assignment  because  of  a con-
cern  that  such  a  course  might  open  it  to  liabilities  in  personnel  litigation 
the employee  might initiate, see, e. g., App. F to Pet.  for Cert. 256a, such 
a  consideration,  if  indeed  it  existed,  hardly  constitutes  action  taken  with 
a specific purpose to cause harm at the expense of an established duty. 

23 We  thus  treat  this  case  categorically  as  one  of  recklessness,  for  that 

was the  jury's  finding.  But  by making  a  point  of its  contrast with  cases 
falling within categories of even greater fault we do not mean to suggest 
that Exxon's and Hazelwood's failings were less than reprehensible. 

24 Two of the States with 3:1 ratios do provide for slightly larger awards 

in  actions  involving  this  type  of  strategic  financial  wrongdoing,  but  the 
exceptions seem to apply to only a subset of those cases.  See Alaska Stat. 

$ 09.17.020(g)  (2006)  (where  the  defendant's  conduct  was  motivated  by  fi-
nancial  gain  and  the  adverse  consequences  of  the  conduct  were  actually 
known by the defendant or the person responsible for making policy deci-

Opinion of the Court 
case  of reckless  action,  profitless  to the  tortfeasor, resulting 
in substantial recovery for substantial injury.  Thus, a legis-
lative judgment that 3:1 is a reasonable limit overall is not a 
judgment that 3:1 is a reasonable limit in this particular type 
of case. 

For  somewhat  different  reasons,  the  pertinence  of  the  2:1 
ratio  adopted  by  treble-damages  statutes  (offering  compen-
satory damages plus a bounty of double that amount) is open 
to  question.  Federal  treble-damages  statutes  govern  areas 
far  afield  from  maritime  concerns  (not  to  mention  each 
other); 25  the  relevance  of  the  governing  rules  in  patent  or 
trademark  cases,  say,  is  doubtful  at  best.  And  in  some  in-
stances, we know that the considerations that went into mak-
ing a rule have no application here.  We know, for example, 
that  Congress  devised  the  treble-damages  remedy  for  pri-
vate  antitrust  actions  with  an  eye  to  supplementing  official 
enforcement by inducing private litigation, which might oth-
erwise have been too rare if nothing but compensatory dam-
ages were available at the end of the day.  See, e. g., Reiter, 
442 U. S., at 344.  That concern has no traction here, in this 
case of staggering damage inevitably provoking governmen-
tal  enforcers  to  indict  and  any  number  of  private  parties  to 
sue.  To take another example, although 18 U. S. C. $ 3571(d) 

sions  on  behalf  of  the  defendant,  the  normal  limit  is  replaced  by  the 
greater of four times the compensatory damages, four times the aggregate 
financial  gain  the  defendant  received  as  a  result  of  its  misconduct,  or  $7 
million);  Fla.  Stat.  $$ 768.73(1)(b),  (c)  (2007)  (normal  limit  replaced  by 
greater of 4:1 or $2 million where defendant's wrongful conduct was moti-
vated solely by unreasonable financial gain, and the unreasonably danger-
ous nature of the conduct, together with the high likelihood of injury, was 
actually  known  by  the  managing  agent,  director,  officer,  or  other  person 
responsible for making policy decisions on behalf of the defendant).

35 U. S. C. $ 284 (patent); 15 U. S. C. $ 1117 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (trade-

Opinion of the Court 
provides for a criminal penalty of up to twice a crime victim's loss,  this  penalty  is  an  alternative  to  other  specific  fine 

amounts  which  courts  may  impose  at  their  option,  see $$ 3571(a)-(c), a fact that makes us wary of reading too much 
into Congress's choice of ratio in one provision.  State envi-ronmental treble-damages schemes offer little more support: 
for  one  thing,  insofar  as  some  appear  to  punish  even  negli-gence,  see, 

e. g.,  Mass.  Gen.  Laws,  ch.  130,  $ 27  (2007),  while others target  only  willful conduct,  see,  e. g.,  Del.  Code  Ann., 

Tit. 25, $ 1401 (1989), some undershoot and others may over-shoot the target here.  For another, while some States have 
chosen  treble  damages,  others  punish  environmental  harms at  other  multiples.  See, 

e. g.,  N.  H.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 146- A:10 (2005) (damages of 1
1/2  times the harm caused to private 

property by oil discharge); Minn. Stat. Ann. $ 115A.99 (2005) (civil  penalty  of  2  to  5  times  the  costs  of  removing  unlawful 

solid waste).  All in all, the legislative signposts do not point the  way  clearly  to  2:1  as  a  sound  indication  of  a  reasonable 
limit.  3 

There is better evidence of an accepted limit of reasonable civil  penalty,  however,  in  several  studies  mentioned  before, 
showing  the  median  ratio  of  punitive  to  compensatory  ver-dicts,  reflecting  what  juries  and  judges  have  considered 
reasonable  across  many  hundreds  of  punitive  awards.  See supra,  at  497-498,  and  n.  14.  We  think  it  is  fair  to  assume 
that  the  greater  share  of  the  verdicts  studied  in  these  com-prehensive  collections  reflect  reasonable  judgments  about 
the  economic  penalties  appropriate in  their  particular  cases. These  studies  cover  cases  of  the  most  as  well  as  the  least 
blameworthy conduct triggering punitive liability, from mal-ice  and  avarice,  down  to  recklessness,  and  even  gross  negli-
gence in  some jurisdictions.  The  data  put the  median  ratio for  the  entire  gamut  of  circumstances  at  less  than  1:1,  see 
supra, at 497-498, and n. 14, meaning that the compensatory award exceeds the punitive award in most cases.  In a well-

Opinion of the Court 
The  provision  of  the  CWA  respecting  daily  fines  confirms our judgment that anything greater would be excessive here 

and in cases of this type.  Congress set criminal penalties of up  to  $25,000  per  day  for  negligent  violations  of  pollution 
restrictions, and up to $50,000 per day for knowing ones.  33 U. S. C.  $$ 1319(c)(1),  (2).  Discretion  to  double  the  penalty 
for knowing action compares to discretion to double the civil liability  on  conduct  going  beyond  negligence  and  meriting 

punitive  treatment.  And  our  explanation  of  the  constitu-tional  upper  limit  confirms  that  the  1:1  ratio  is  not  too  low. 
In State Farm, we said that a single-digit maximum is appro-
may mitigate maritime law's less generous scheme of compensatory dam-
ages.  Post,  at  519-520.  But  the  instructions  in  this  case  did  not  allow 
the jury to  set  punitives on the  basis  of  any such  consideration,  see Jury 
Instruction  No.  21,  App.  to  Brief  in  Opposition  12a  ("The  purposes  for 
which  punitive  damages  are  awarded  are:  (1)  to  punish  a  wrongdoer  for 
extraordinary  misconduct;  and  (2)  to  warn  defendants  and  others  and 
deter them from doing the same"), and the size of the underlying compen-
satory  damages  does  not  bespeak  economic  inadequacy;  the  case,  then, 
does  not  support  an  argument  that  maritime  compensatory  awards  need 
supplementing. 

And this Court has long held that "[p]unitive damages by definition are 
not  intended  to  compensate  the  injured  party,  but  rather  to  punish  the 
tortfeasor . . .  and  to  deter him and others from similar extreme conduct." 
Newport  v.  Fact  Concerts,  Inc.,  453  U. S.  247,  266-267  (1981);  see  supra, 
at  492-493.  Indeed,  any  argument  for  more  generous  punitive  damages 
in  maritime  cases  would  call  into  question  the  maritime  applicability  of 
the  constitutional  limit  on  punitive  damages  as  now  understood,  for  we 
have tied that limit to a conception of punitive damages awarded entirely 
for a punitive, not quasi-compensatory, purpose.  See, e. g., Philip Morris 
USA  v.  Williams,  549  U. S.  346,  352  (2007)  ("This  Court  has  long  made 
clear  that  `[p]unitive  damages  may  properly  be  imposed  to  further  a 
State's  legitimate  interests  in  punishing  unlawful  conduct  and  deterring 
its  repetition' "  (quoting  BMW  of  North  America,  Inc.  v.  Gore,  517  U. S. 
559,  568  (1996)));  State  Farm,  538  U. S.,  at  416  ("[P]unitive  damages  .  .  . 
are aimed at deterrence and retribution"); Cooper Industries, 532 U. S., at 
432  ("[C]ompensatory  damages  and  punitive  damages . . .  serve  distinct 
purposes.  The former are intended to redress the concrete loss that the

Syllabus 
(c)  The  Court's  interpretation  is  confirmed  by  analogous  arms-
bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately fol-
lowed the Second Amendment.  Pp. 600-603. 

(d)  The  Second  Amendment's  drafting  history,  while  of  dubious 
interpretive  worth,  reveals  three  state  Second  Amendment  proposals 
that  unequivocally  referred  to  an  individual  right  to  bear  arms. 
Pp. 603-605. 

(e)  Interpretation  of  the  Second  Amendment  by  scholars,  courts, 
and legislators, from  immediately  after its  ratification  through the  late 
19th century, also supports the Court's conclusion.  Pp. 605-619. 

(f)  None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpre-
tation.  Neither  United  States  v.  Cruikshank,  92  U. S.  542,  553,  nor 
Presser  v.  Illinois,  116 U. S. 252,  264-265, refutes  the individual-rights 
interpretation.  United  States  v.  Miller,  307  U. S.  174,  does  not  limit 
the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms  to  militia  purposes,  but  rather  limits 
the  type  of  weapon  to  which  the  right  applies  to  those  used  by  the 
militia, i. e., those in common use for lawful purposes.  Pp. 619-626. 

2.  Like  most  rights,  the  Second  Amendment  right  is  not  unlimited. 
It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner 
whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons 
prohibitions  have  been  upheld  under  the  Amendment  or  state  ana-
logues.  The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on long-
standing  prohibitions  on  the  possession  of  firearms  by  felons  and  the 
mentally  ill,  or  laws  forbidding  the  carrying  of  firearms  in  sensitive 
places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing con-
ditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.  Miller's hold-
ing that the sorts of weapons protected are those "in common use at the 
time" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying 
of dangerous and unusual weapons.  Pp. 626-628. 

3.  The  handgun  ban  and  the  trigger-lock  requirement  (as  applied  to 
self-defense)  violate  the  Second  Amendment.  The  District's  total  ban 
on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire 
class  of  "arms"  that  Americans  overwhelmingly  choose  for  the  lawful 
purpose  of  self-defense.  Under  any  of  the  standards  of  scrutiny  the 
Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition-- 
in  the  place  where  the importance  of the  lawful  defense  of  self,  family, 
and  property  is  most  acute--would  fail  constitutional  muster.  Simi-
larly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassem-
bled  or  bound  by  a  trigger  lock  makes  it  impossible  for  citizens  to  use 
arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitu-
tional.  Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licens-
ing  law  is  permissible  if  it  is  not  enforced  arbitrarily  and  capriciously, 
the  Court  assumes  that  a  license  will  satisfy  his  prayer  for  relief  and

(2001).  Wholly  apart  from  that  prohibition,  no  person  may carry  a  handgun  without  a  license,  but  the  chief  of  police 
may  issue  licenses  for  1-year  periods.  See  $$ 22-4504(a), 22-4506.  District  of  Columbia  law  also  requires  residents

576  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  v.  HELLER 

Opinion of the Court 
on  Second  Amendment  grounds,  to  enjoin  the  city  from  en-forcing the bar on the registration of handguns, the licensing 

requirement insofar as it  prohibits  the carrying  of a firearm in  the  home  without  a  license,  and  the  trigger-lock  require-
ment  insofar  as  it  prohibits  the  use  of  "functional  firearms within the home."  App. 59a.  The District Court dismissed 
respondent's  complaint,  see  Parker  v.  District  of  Columbia, 311  F.  Supp.  2d  103,  109  (2004).  The  Court  of  Appeals  for 
the District of Columbia Circuit, construing his complaint as seeking  the  right  to  render  a  firearm  operable  and  carry  it 
about  his  home  in  that  condition  only  when  necessary  for self-defense,

2  reversed,  see  Parker  v.  District  of  Columbia, 

478  F.  3d  370,  401  (2007).  It  held  that  the  Second  Amend-ment  protects  an  individual  right  to  possess  firearms  and 

that  the  city's  total  ban  on  handguns,  as  well  as  its  require-ment  that  firearms  in  the  home  be  kept  nonfunctional  even 
when  necessary  for  self-defense,  violated  that  right.  See id., at 395, 399-401.  The Court of Appeals directed the Dis-
trict Court to enter summary judgment for respondent. We granted certiorari.  552 U. S. 1035 (2007). 

II 
We  turn  first  to  the  meaning  of  the  Second  Amendment. 

A 
The Second Amendment provides: "A well regulated Mili-tia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right 

of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." In interpreting this text, we are guided by the principle that 
"[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the vot-ers;  its  words  and  phrases  were  used  in  their  normal  and 
ordinary  as distinguished  from  technical  meaning."  United 
States v.  Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 (1931); see also Gibbons v.  Ogden,  9  Wheat.  1,  188  (1824).  Normal  meaning  may  of 

2 That construction has not been challenged here.

580  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  v.  HELLER 

Opinion of the Court 
but  they  deal  with  the  exercise  or  reservation  of  powers, not rights.  Nowhere else in the Constitution does a "right" 

attributed  to  "the  people"  refer  to  anything  other  than  an individual right.

6 

What  is  more,  in  all  six  other  provisions  of  the  Consti-tution  that  mention  "the  people,"  the  term  unambiguously 

refers  to  all  members  of  the  political  community,  not  an  un-specified  subset.  As  we  said  in 

United  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 265 (1990): 

" `[T]he  people'  seems  to  have  been  a  term  of  art  em-ployed  in  select  parts  of the  Constitution.  .  .  . [Its  uses] 
sugges[t]  that  `the  people'  protected  by  the  Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, 
and  to  whom  rights  and  powers  are  reserved  in  the Ninth  and  Tenth  Amendments,  refers  to  a  class  of  per-
sons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise  developed  sufficient  connection  with  this 
country to be considered part of that community." 
This contrasts markedly with the phrase "the militia" in the prefatory clause.  As we will describe below, the "militia" in 

colonial America consisted of a subset of "the people"--those who were male, able bodied, and within a certain age range. 
Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right 

6 If  we  look  to  other  founding-era  documents,  we  find  that  some  state 
constitutions used the term "the people" to refer to the people collectively, 
in contrast to  "citizen," which was used to  invoke individual rights.  See 
Heyman,  Natural  Rights  and  the  Second  Amendment,  in  The  Second 
Amendment in Law and History 179, 193-195 (C. Bogus ed. 2000) (herein-
after Bogus).  But that usage was not remotely uniform.  See, e. g., N. C. 
Declaration of  Rights $ XIV  (1776),  in  5  The Federal  and State Constitu-
tions, Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws 2787, 2788 (F. Thorpe ed. 
1909) (hereinafter Thorpe) (jury trial); Md. Declaration of Rights $ XVIII 
(1776),  in  3  id.,  at  1686,  1688  (vicinage  requirement);  Vt.  Declaration  of 
Rights,  ch.  1,  $ XI  (1777),  in  6  id.,  at  3737,  3741  (searches  and  seizures); 
Pa. Declaration of Rights $ XII (1776), in 5 id., at 3082, 3083 (free speech). 
And,  most  importantly,  it  was  clearly  not  the  terminology  used  in  the 
Federal Constitution, given the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments.

Opinion of the Court 
to  "keep  and  bear  Arms"  in  an  organized  militia  therefore fits  poorly  with  the  operative  clause's  description  of  the 

holder of that right as "the people." We  start  therefore  with  a  strong  presumption  that  the 
Second  Amendment  right  is  exercised  individually  and  be-longs to all Americans. 

b.  "Keep and Bear A r m s."  We move  now from the 
holder  of  the  right--"the  people"--to  the  substance  of  the right: "to keep and bear Arms." 

Before  addressing  the  verbs  "keep"  and "bear,"  we  inter-pret  their  object:  "Arms."  The  18th-century  meaning  is  no 
different from the meaning today.  The 1773 edition of Sam-
uel  Johnson's  dictionary  defined  "arms"  as  "[w]eapons  of  of-
fence,  or  armour  of  defence."  1  Dictionary  of  the  English 
Language  106  (4th  ed.)  (reprinted  1978)  (hereinafter  John-
son).  Timothy  Cunningham's  important  1771  legal  diction-
ary  defined  "arms"  as  "any  thing  that  a  man  wears  for  his 
defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at 
or strike another."  1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary; 
see  also  N.  Webster,  American  Dictionary  of  the  English 
Language (1828) (reprinted 1989) (hereinafter Webster) 
(similar). 

The term was applied, then  as now, to weapons that were 
not  specifically  designed  for  military  use  and  were  not  em-
ployed  in  a  military  capacity.  For  instance,  Cunningham's 
legal dictionary  gave as an example of usage:  "Servants and 
labourers shall use bows and arrows on Sundays, &c. and not 
bear  other  arms."  See  also,  e. g.,  An  Act  for  the  trial  of 
Negroes,  1797  Del.  Laws  ch.  XLIII,  $ 6,  in  1  First  Laws  of 
the  State  of  Delaware  102,  104  (J.  Cushing  ed.  1981  (pt.  1)); 
see  generally  State  v.  Duke,  42  Tex.  455,  458  (1874)  (citing 
decisions  of  state  courts  construing  "arms").  Although  one 
founding-era thesaurus limited "arms" (as opposed to "weap-
ons")  to  "instruments  of  offence  generally  made  use  of  in 
war,"  even  that  source  stated  that  all  firearms  constituted 
"arms."  1  J.  Trusler,  The  Distinction  Between  Words  Es-

that  only  those  arms  in  existence  in  the  18th  century  are 
protected  by  the  Second  Amendment.  We  do  not  interpret 
constitutional  rights  that  way.  Just  as  the  First  Amend-
ment  protects  modern  forms  of  communications,  e. g.,  Reno 
v.  American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), 
and  the  Fourth  Amendment  applies  to  modern  forms  of 
search,  e. g.,  Kyllo  v.  United  States,  533  U. S.  27,  35-36 
(2001),  the  Second  Amendment  extends,  prima  facie,  to  all 
instruments  that  constitute  bearable  arms,  even  those  that 
were not in existence at the time of the founding. 

We  turn  to  the  phrases  "keep  arms"  and  "bear  arms." 
Johnson  defined  "keep"  as,  most  relevantly,  "[t]o  retain;  not 
to  lose,"  and  "[t]o  have  in  custody."  Johnson  1095.  Web-
ster  defined  it  as  "[t]o  hold;  to  retain  in  one's  power  or  pos-
session."  No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning 
of  "keep  Arms."  Thus,  the  most  natural  reading  of  "keep 
Arms" in the Second Amendment is to "have weapons." 

The  phrase "keep  arms"  was not  prevalent  in  the  written 
documents  of  the  founding  period  that  we  have  found,  but 
there  are  a  few  examples,  all  of  which  favor  viewing  the 
right  to  "keep  Arms"  as  an  individual  right  unconnected 
with  militia  service.  William  Blackstone,  for  example, 
wrote that Catholics convicted of not attending service in the 
Church  of  England  suffered  certain  penalties,  one  of  which 
was  that  they  were  not  permitted  to  "keep  arms  in  their 
houses."  4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 55 (1769) 
(hereinafter  Blackstone); see also 1  W. &  M.,  ch. 15, $ 4, in 3 
Eng. Stat. at Large 422 (1689) ("[N]o Papist . . . shall or may 
have or keep in his House . . . any Arms . . . "); 1 W. Hawkins, 
Treatise on the Pleas of the Crown 26 (1771) (similar).  Peti-
tioners  point  to  militia  laws  of  the  founding  period  that  re-
quired  militia  members  to  "keep"  arms  in  connection  with

militia  service,  and  they  conclude  from  this  that  the  phrase "keep  Arms"  has  a  militia-related  connotation.  See  Brief 

for  Petitioners  16-17  (citing  laws  of  Delaware,  New  Jersey, and  Virginia).  This  is  rather  like  saying  that,  since  there 
are  many  statutes  that  authorize  aggrieved  employees  to "file complaints" with federal agencies, the phrase "file com-
plaints"  has  an  employment-related  connotation.  "Keep arms"  was  simply  a  common  way  of  referring  to  possessing 
arms, for militiamen and everyone else.7

as a recognition of the natural right of defense "of one's per-

Opinion of the Court 
the phrase "keep and bear Arms" would be incoherent.  The word  "Arms"  would  have  two  different  meanings  at  once: 

"weapons"  (as  the  object  of  "keep")  and  (as  the  object  of "bear") one-half of an idiom.  It would be rather like saying 
"He  filled  and  kicked  the  bucket"  to  mean  "He  filled  the bucket and died."  Grotesque. 

Petitioners  justify  their  limitation  of  "bear  arms"  to  the military  context  by  pointing  out  the  unremarkable  fact  that 
it  was  often  used  in  that  context--the  same  mistake  they made  with  respect  to  "keep  arms."  It  is  especially  unre-
markable  that  the  phrase  was  often  used  in  a  military  con-text in the federal legal sources (such as records of congres-
sional  debate)  that  have  been  the  focus  of  petitioners' inquiry.  Those sources would have had little occasion to use 
it except in discussions about the standing army and the mili-tia.  And  the  phrases  used  primarily  in  those  military  dis-
cussions include not only "bear arms" but also "carry arms," "possess arms," and "have arms"--though no one thinks that 
those other phrases also had special military meanings.  See Barnett, Was the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Conditioned 
on Service in an Organized Militia? 83 Texas L. Rev. 237, 261 (2004).  The  common  references  to  those  "fit  to  bear  arms" 
in congressional discussions about the militia are matched by use  of  the  same  phrase  in  the  few  nonmilitary  federal  con-
texts  where  the  concept  would  be  relevant.  See,  e. g.,  30 Journals of Continental Congress 349-351 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 
1934).  Other  legal  sources  frequently  used  "bear  arms"  in nonmilitary contexts.

Opinion of the Court 
Under  the  auspices  of  the  1671  Game  Act,  for  example,  the Catholic Charles II had ordered general disarmaments of re-

gions  home  to  his  Protestant  enemies.  See  Malcolm  103- 106.  These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely 
wary  of  concentrated  military  forces  run  by  the  state  and to  be  jealous  of  their  arms.  They  accordingly  obtained  an 
assurance  from  William  and  Mary,  in  the  Declaration  of 
Right (which was codified as the English Bill of Rights), that Protestants  would  never  be  disarmed:  "That  the  Subjects 

which are Protestants, may have Arms for their Defence suit-able  to  their  Conditions,  and  as  allowed  by  Law."  1  W.  & 
M.,  ch.  2,  $ 7,  in  3  Eng.  Stat.  at  Large  441.  This  right  has 
long  been  understood  to  be  the  predecessor  to  our  Second 
Amendment.  See  E.  Dumbauld,  The  Bill  of  Rights  and 
What  It  Means  Today  51  (1957);  W.  Rawle,  A  View  of  the 
Constitution  of  the  United  States  of  America  122  (1825) 
(hereinafter Rawle).  It was clearly an individual right, hav-
ing nothing whatever  to do with service in a  militia.  To be 
sure,  it  was  an  individual  right  not  available  to  the  whole 
population,  given  that  it  was  restricted  to  Protestants,  and 
like  all  written  English  rights  it  was  held  only  against  the 
Crown,  not  Parliament.  See  Schwoerer,  To  Hold  and  Bear 
Arms: The English Perspective, in Bogus 207, 218; but see 3 
J.  Story,  Commentaries  on  the  Constitution  of  the  United 
States $ 1858 (1833) (hereinafter Story)  (contending that  the 
"right to bear arms" is a "limitatio[n] upon the power of par-
liament" as well).  But it was secured to them as individuals, 
according  to  "libertarian  political  principles,"  not  as  mem-
bers  of  a  fighting  force.  Schwoerer,  Declaration  of  Rights, 
at 283; see also id.,  at 78; G.  Jellinek, The Declaration of the 
Rights  of  Man  and  of  Citizens  49,  and  n. 7  (1901)  (reprinted 
1979). 

By  the  time  of  the  founding,  the  right  to  have  arms  had 
become  fundamental  for  English  subjects.  See  Malcolm 
122-134.  Blackstone,  whose  works,  we  have  said,  "consti-
tuted the preeminent authority on English law for the found-

ing  generation,"  Alden  v.  Maine,  527  U. S.  706,  715  (1999), cited  the  arms  provision  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  as  one  of  the 

fundamental  rights  of  Englishmen.  See  1  Blackstone  136, 139-140  (1765).  His  description  of  it  cannot  possibly  be 
thought  to  tie  it  to  militia  or  military  service.  It  was,  he said,  "the  natural  right  of  resistance  and  self-preservation," 
id., at 139,  and "the  right of having and using arms  for self-
preservation  and  defence,"  id.,  at  140;  see  also  3  id.,  at  2-4 (1768).  Other  contemporary  authorities  concurred.  See  G. 

Sharp, Tracts, Concerning the Ancient and Only True Legal Means  of  National  Defence,  by  a  Free  Militia  17-18,  27  (3d 
ed.  1782);  2  J.  de  Lolme,  The  Rise  and  Progress  of  the  Eng-
lish  Constitution  886-887  (1784)  (A.  Stephens  ed.  1838); 
W.  Blizard,  Desultory  Reflections  on  Police  59-60  (1785). 
Thus,  the  right  secured  in  1689  as  a  result  of  the  Stuarts' 
abuses was by the  time  of the  founding understood to be an 
individual  right  protecting  against  both  public  and  private 
violence. 

And,  of  course,  what  the  Stuarts  had  tried  to  do  to  their 
political enemies, George III had tried to do to the colonists. 
In  the  tumultuous  decades  of  the  1760's  and  1770's,  the 
Crown began to disarm the inhabitants of the most rebellious 
areas.  That provoked polemical reactions by Americans in-
voking  their  rights  as  Englishmen  to  keep  arms.  A  New 
York  article  of  April  1769  said  that  "[i]t  is  a  natural  right 
which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by 
the  Bill  of  Rights,  to  keep  arms  for  their  own  defence."  A 
Journal  of  the  Times:  Mar.  17,  New  York  Journal,  Supp.  1, 
Apr.  13,  1769,  in  Boston  Under  Military  Rule  79  (O.  Dicker-
son ed. 1936) (reprinted 1970); see also, e. g., Shippen, Boston

299  (H.  Cushing  ed.  1904)  (reprinted  1968).  They  under-
stood  the  right  to  enable  individuals  to  defend  themselves. 
As  the  most  important  early  American  edition  of  Black-
stone's Commentaries (by the law professor and former Anti-
federalist St.  George Tucker)  made clear  in  the  notes to the

Opinion of the Court 
description  of  the  arms  right,  Americans  understood  the "right of self-preservation" as permitting a citizen to "repe[l] 

force  by  force"  when  "the  intervention  of  society  in  his  be-half,  may  be  too  late  to  prevent  an  injury."  1  Blackstone's 
Commentaries  145-146,  n.  42  (1803)  (hereinafter  Tucker's Blackstone).  See  also  W.  Duer,  Outlines  of  the  Constitu-
tional Jurisprudence of the United States 31-32 (1833). There  seems to us no  doubt, on the  basis of both text  and 
history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual 
right  to  keep  and  bear  arms.  Of  course  the  right  was  not unlimited, just as the First Amendment's right of free speech 

was  not,  see,  e. g.,  United  States  v.  Williams,  553  U. S.  285 (2008).  Thus,  we  do  not  read  the  Second  Amendment  to 
protect  the  right  of  citizens  to  carry  arms  for  any  sort  of confrontation,  just  as  we  do  not  read  the  First  Amendment 
to  protect  the  right  of  citizens  to  speak  for  any  purpose. Before turning to limitations upon the individual right, how-
ever, we must determine whether the prefatory clause of the 
Second Amendment comports with our interpretation of the operative clause. 

2.  Prefatory Clause. 

The  prefatory  clause  reads:  "A  well  regulated  Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State . . . ."  

a.  "Well-Regulated  Militia."  In  United  States  v.  Mil-
ler,  307  U. S.  174,  179  (1939),  we  explained  that  "the  Militia 
comprised  all  males  physically  capable  of  acting  in  concert for  the  common  defense."  That  definition  comports  with 

founding-era  sources.  See,  e. g.,  Webster  ("The  militia  of  a country  are  the  able  bodied  men  organized  into  companies, 
regiments  and  brigades . . . and  required  by  law  to  attend 
military  exercises  on  certain  days  only,  but  at  other  times 
left  to  pursue  their  usual  occupations");  The  Federalist 
No.  46,  pp.  329,  334  (B.  Wright  ed.  1961)  (J.  Madison)  ("near 
half  a  million  of  citizens  with  arms  in  their  hands");  Letter 
to Destutt de Tracy (Jan.  26, 1811), in The Portable Thomas

Opinion of the Court 
Jefferson  520, 524  (M. Peterson  ed. 1975) ("the  militia  of the 
State,  that  is  to  say,  of  every  man  in  it  able  to  bear  arms"). 

Petitioners take a seemingly narrower view of the militia, 
stating  that  "[m]ilitias  are  the  state- and  congressionally-
regulated  military  forces  described  in  the  Militia  Clauses 
(art. I, $ 8, cls. 15-16)."  Brief for Petitioners 12.  Although 
we agree with petitioners' interpretive assumption that "mi-
litia"  means  the  same  thing  in  Article  I  and  the  Second 
Amendment,  we  believe  that  petitioners  identify  the  wrong 
thing, namely, the organized militia.  Unlike armies and na-
vies,  which  Congress  is  given  the  power  to  create  ("to 
raise  .  .  .  Armies";  "to  provide  .  .  .  a  Navy,"  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cls. 
12-13),  the  militia  is  assumed  by  Article  I  already  to  be  in 
existence.  Congress is given the power to "provide for call-
ing forth the Militia," $ 8, cl. 15; and the power not to create, 
but to "organiz[e]" it--and not to organize "a" militia, which 
is  what  one  would  expect  if  the  militia  were  to  be  a  federal 
creation,  but  to  organize  "the"  militia,  connoting  a  body  al-
ready in existence, ibid., cl. 16.  This is fully consistent with 
the  ordinary  definition  of  the  militia  as  all  able-bodied  men. 
From that pool, Congress has plenary power to organize the 
units  that  will  make  up  an  effective  fighting  force.  That  is 
what  Congress  did  in  the  first  Militia  Act,  which  specified 
that  "each  and  every  free  able-bodied  white  male  citizen  of 
the  respective  states,  resident  therein,  who  is  or  shall  be  of 
the  age  of  eighteen  years,  and  under  the  age  of  forty-five 
years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and 
respectively be enrolled in the militia."  Act of May 8, 1792, 
1  Stat. 271.  To  be  sure,  Congress need  not  conscript  every 
able-bodied  man  into  the  militia,  because  nothing  in  Article 
I suggests that in exercising its power to organize, discipline, 
and  arm  the  militia,  Congress  must  focus  upon  the  entire 
body.  Although  the  militia  consists  of  all  able-bodied  men, 
the  federally  organized  militia  may  consist  of  a  subset  of 
them.

Finally,  the  adjective  "well-regulated"  implies  nothing 
more  than  the  imposition  of  proper  discipline  and  training.

militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms"). b.  "Security of a Free State." 

The  phrase  "security  of 
a  free  State"  meant  "security  of  a  free  polity,"  not  security 
of each of the several States as the dissent below argued, see 
478 F. 3d, at 405, and n. 10.  Joseph Story wrote in his trea-
tise on the Constitution that "the word `state' is used in vari-
ous senses [and in] its most enlarged sense it means the peo-
ple  composing  a  particular  nation  or  community."  1  Story 

$ 208;  see  also  3  id.,  $ 1890  (in  reference  to  the  Second 
Amendment's  prefatory  clause:  "The  militia  is  the  natural 
defence of a free country").  It is true that the term "State" 
elsewhere in the Constitution refers to individual States, but 
the  phrase  "security  of  a  free  State"  and  close  variations 
seem to have been terms of art in 18th-century political dis-
course,  meaning  a  " `free  country' "  or  free  polity.  See  Vo-
lokh,  "Necessary  to  the  Security  of  a  Free  State,"  83  Notre 
Dame  L.  Rev.  1,  5  (2007);  see,  e. g.,  4  Blackstone  151  (1769); 
Brutus Essay III (Nov. 15, 1787), in The Essential Antifeder-
alist 251, 253 (W. Allen & G. Lloyd eds., 2d ed. 2002).  More-
over,  the  other  instances  of  "state"  in  the  Constitution  are 
typically accompanied by modifiers making clear that the ref-
erence  is  to  the  several  States--"each  state,"  "several 
states,"  "any  state,"  "that  state,"  "particular  states,"  "one 
state,"  "no  state."  And  the  presence  of  the  term  "foreign 
state"  in  Article  I  and  Article  III  shows  that  the  word 
"state" did not have a single meaning in the Constitution. 

There are many reasons why the militia was thought to be 
"necessary  to  the  security  of  a  free  State."  See  3  Story

and  suppressing  insurrections.  Second,  it  renders  large

litia.  The  Federalist  No.  29,  pp.  226,  227  (B.  Wright  ed. 1961).  Third,  when  the  able-bodied  men  of  a  nation  are 
trained  in  arms  and  organized,  they  are  better  able  to  re-sist tyranny. 

3.  Relationship  Between Prefatory  Clause and  Opera-tive Clause. 
We  reach  the  question,  then:  Does  the  preface  fit  with  an operative clause that creates an individual right to keep and 
bear arms?  It fits perfectly, once one knows the history that the  founding  generation  knew  and  that  we  have  described 
above.  That history showed that the way tyrants had elimi-nated a  militia consisting of all  the able-bodied men was not 
by  banning  the  militia  but  simply  by  taking  away  the  peo-ple's arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to sup-
press political opponents.  This is what had occurred in Eng-
land  that  prompted  codification  of the  right  to  have  arms  in the English Bill of Rights. 

The  debate  with  respect  to  the  right  to  keep  and  bear 
arms, as with other guarantees in the Bill of Rights, was not 
over  whether  it  was  desirable  (all  agreed  that  it  was)  but over  whether  it  needed  to  be  codified  in  the  Constitution. 

During  the  1788  ratification  debates,  the  fear  that  the  Fed-eral Government would disarm the people in order to impose 
rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.  See, 

e. g., Letters from The Fed-
eral  Farmer  III  (Oct.  10,  1787),  in  2  The  Complete  Anti-Federalist  234,  242  (H.  Storing  ed.  1981).  John  Smilie,  for 

example,  worried  not  only  that  Congress's  "command  of  the 
militia" could be used to create a "select militia," or to have 
"no  militia  at  all,"  but  also,  as  a  separate  concern,  that 
"[w]hen a select militia is formed; the people in general may 
be disarmed."  2 Documentary History of the Ratification of

mediately  followed  adoption  of  the  Second  Amendment. Four  States  adopted  analogues  to  the  Federal  Second 

Amendment  in  the  period  between  independence  and  the ratification  of  the  Bill of  Rights.  Two  of  them--Pennsylva-
nia  and  Vermont--clearly  adopted  individual  rights  uncon-nected  to  militia  service.  Pennsylvania's  Declaration  of 
Rights  of  1776  said:  "That  the  people  have  a  right  to  bear 
arms  for  the  defence  of  themselves  and  the  state  . . . ."  $ XIII,  in  5  Thorpe  3082,  3083  (emphasis  added).  In  1777, 

Vermont adopted the identical provision, except for inconse-quential  differences  in  punctuation  and  capitalization.  See 
Vt. Const., ch. 1, $ XV, in 6 id., at 3741. 

North  Carolina  also  codified  a  right  to  bear  arms  in  1776: 
"That  the  people  have  a  right  to  bear  arms,  for  the  defence 
of the State . . . ."  Declaration of Rights $ XVII, in 5 id., at 
2787,  2788.  This  could  plausibly  be  read  to  support  only  a 
right to bear arms in a militia--but that is a peculiar way to 
make  the  point  in  a  constitution  that  elsewhere  repeatedly 
mentions  the  militia  explicitly.  See  N.  C.  Const.,  $$ XIV, 
XVIII,  XXXV,  in  id.,  at  2789,  2791,  2793.  Many  colonial 
statutes  required  individual  arms  bearing  for  public-safety 
reasons--such as the 1770 Georgia law that "for the security 
and defence of this province from internal dangers and insur-
rections"  required  those  men  who  qualified  for  militia  duty 
individually  "to  carry  fire  arms"  "to  places  of  public  wor-
ship."  19  Colonial  Records  of  the  State  of  Georgia  137-139 

(A.  Candler  ed.  1911  (pt.  1))  (emphasis  added).  That  broad 
public-safety understanding was the connotation given to the 
North Carolina right by that State's Supreme Court in 1843. 
See State v.  Huntly, 25 N. C. 418, 422-423. 

The  1780  Massachusetts  Constitution  presented  another 
variation  on  the  theme:  "The  people  have  a  right  to  keep 
and  to  bear  arms  for  the  common  defence.  .  .  .  "  Pt.  First, 
Art. XVII, in 3 Thorpe 1888, 1892.  Once again, if one gives 
narrow  meaning  to  the  phrase  "common  defence"  this  can 
be  thought  to  limit  the  right  to  the  bearing  of  arms  in  a

Opinion of the Court 
In 1825, William Rawle, a prominent lawyer who had been 
a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly that ratified the Bill 
of  Rights,  published  an  influential  treatise,  which  analyzed 
the Second Amendment as follows: 

"The first [principle] is a declaration that a well regu-
lated  militia  is  necessary to  the  security  of a  free state; 
a proposition from which few will dissent. . . .  

"The corollary, from the first position is, that the right 
of  the  people  to  keep  and  bear  arms  shall  not  be 
infringed. 

"The  prohibition  is  general.  No  clause  in  the  consti-
tution could by any rule of construction be conceived to 
give  to congress a  power to disarm the people.  Such  a 
flagitious  attempt  could  only  be  made  under  some  gen-
eral pretence by a state legislature.  But if in any blind 
pursuit  of  inordinate  power,  either  should  attempt  it, 
this  amendment  may  be  appealed  to  as  a  restraint  on 
both."  Rawle 121-122.20 

Like Tucker, Rawle regarded the English game laws as vio-
lating the right codified in the Second Amendment.  See id., 
at  122-123.  Rawle  clearly  differentiated  between  the  peo-
ple's  right  to  bear  arms  and  their  service  in  a  militia:  "In  a 
people permitted and accustomed to bear arms, we have the 
rudiments of a militia, which properly consists of armed citi-
zens,  divided  into  military  bands,  and  instructed  at  least  in 
part,  in  the  use  of  arms  for  the  purposes  of  war."  Id.,  at 
140.  Rawle  further  said  that  the  Second  Amendment  right 
ought not "be abused to the disturbance of the public peace," 
such  as  by  assembling  with  other  armed  individuals  "for  an 

20 Rawle, writing before our decision in Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor 
of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), believed that the Second Amendment could 
be applied against the States.  Such a belief would of course be nonsensi-
cal on petitioners' view that it protected only a right to possess and carry 
arms when conscripted by the State itself into militia service.

tyrants  accomplish  their  purposes  without  resistance,  is,  by 
disarming the people, and making it an offence to keep arms, 
and  by  substituting  a  regular  army  in  the  stead  of  a  resort 
to  the  militia."  A  Familiar  Exposition  of  the  Constitution 
of the United States $ 450 (reprinted 1986). 

Antislavery  advocates routinely  invoked  the  right to  bear 
arms  for  self-defense.  Joel  Tiffany,  for  example,  citing 
Blackstone's  description  of  the  right,  wrote  that  "the  right 
to  keep  and  bear  arms,  also  implies  the  right  to  use them  if 
necessary in self defence; without this right to use the guar-
anty would have hardly been worth the paper it consumed." 
A  Treatise  on  the  Unconstitutionality  of  American  Slavery 
117-118  (1849);  see  also L.  Spooner, The  Unconstitutionality 
of Slavery 116 (1845) (right enables "personal defence").  In 
his  famous Senate  speech about the 1856  "Bleeding Kansas" 
conflict, Charles Sumner proclaimed: 

"The  rifle  has  ever  been  the  companion  of  the  pioneer 
and,  under  God,  his  tutelary  protector  against  the  red 
man  and  the  beast  of  the  forest.  Never  was  this  effi-
cient weapon more needed in just self-defense, than now 
in  Kansas,  and  at  least  one  article  in  our  National  Con-
stitution  must  be blotted out,  before the  complete  right 
to  it  can  in  any  way  be  impeached.  And  yet  such  is 
the  madness  of the  hour,  that,  in  defiance of  the  solemn 
guarantee, embodied in  the  Amendments to the  Consti-
tution,  that  `the  right  of  the  people  to  keep  and  bear 
arms  shall  not  be  infringed,'  the  people  of  Kansas  have 
been  arraigned  for  keeping  and  bearing  them,  and  the 
Senator  from  South  Carolina  has  had  the  face  to  say 
openly,  on  this  floor,  that  they  should  be  disarmed--of 
course, that the fanatics of Slavery, his allies and constit-
uents,  may  meet  no  impediment."  The  Crime  Against

612  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  v.  HELLER 

Opinion of the Court 
1843) (because free blacks were treated as a "dangerous pop-ulation,"  "laws  have  been passed  to  prevent  their  migration 

into  this  State;  to  make  it  unlawful  for  them  to  bear  arms; to  guard  even  their  religious  assemblages  with  peculiar 
watchfulness").  An  1829  decision  by the  Supreme  Court  of 
Michigan  said:  "The  constitution  of  the  United  States  also grants  to  the  citizen  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms.  But 

the grant of this privilege cannot be construed into the right in  him who keeps a gun to destroy his  neighbor.  No rights 
are intended to be granted by the constitution for an unlaw-ful or unjustifiable purpose." 

United States v.  Sheldon, in 5 
Transactions of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Michi-gan 337, 346 (W. Blume ed. 1940) (hereinafter Blume).  It is 

not  possible  to  read  this  as  discussing  anything  other  than an  individual  right  unconnected  to  militia  service.  If  it  did 
have  to  do  with  militia  service,  the  limitation  upon  it  would 
not be any "unlawful or unjustifiable purpose," but any non-military purpose whatsoever. 

In  Nunn  v.  State,  1  Ga.  243,  251  (1846),  the  Georgia  Su-
preme  Court  construed  the  Second  Amendment  as  protect-
ing  the  "natural  right  of  self-defence"  and  therefore  struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly.  Its opinion perfectly 

captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory 
clause, in continuity with the English right: 

"The  right  of  the  whole  people,  old  and  young,  men, 
women  and  boys,  and  not  militia  only,  to  keep  and  bear 
arms  of  every  description,  and  not  such  merely  as  are 
used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken  in  upon,  in  the  smallest  degree;  and  all  this  for 

the  important  end  to  be  attained:  the  rearing  up  and qualifying  a  well-regulated  militia,  so  vitally  necessary 

dridge's  allusion  to  the  existing  Virginia  "restriction"  upon  the  right  of 
free  blacks  "to  bear  arms"  could  only  have  referred  to  "laws  prohibiting 
free blacks from keeping weapons," Siegel, supra, at 497-498.

Opinion of the Court 
to the security of a free State.  Our opinion is, that any law,  State  or  Federal,  is  repugnant  to  the  Constitution, 

and  void,  which  contravenes  this  right,  originally  be-longing  to  our  forefathers,  trampled  under  foot  by 
Charles  I.  and  his  two  wicked  sons  and  successors,  re-established  by  the  revolution  of  1688,  conveyed  to  this 
land  of liberty by the  colonists,  and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own 

Magna Charta!"  Ibid. 

Likewise, in State v.  Chandler, 5 La. Ann. 489, 490 (1850), the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  held  that  citizens  had  a  right 

to  carry  arms  openly:  "This  is  the  right  guaranteed  by  the Constitution of the United States, and which is calculated to 
incite  men  to  a  manly  and  noble  defence  of  themselves,  if necessary,  and  of  their  country,  without  any  tendency  to  se-
cret advantages and unmanly assassinations." Those who believe that the Second Amendment preserves 
only a militia-centered right place great reliance on the Ten-nessee Supreme Court's 1840 decision in 

Aymette v.  State, 21 Tenn.  154.  The  case  does  not  stand  for  that  broad  propo-

sition;  in  fact,  the  case  does  not  mention  the  word  "militia" at  all,  except  in  its  quoting  of  the  Second  Amendment. 
Aymette  held  that  the  state  constitutional  guarantee  of  the right  to  "bear"  arms  did  not  prohibit  the  banning  of  con-
cealed weapons.  The  opinion first  recognized  that  both the state  right  and  the  federal  right  were  descendents  of  the 
1689  English  right,  but  (erroneously,  and  contrary  to  virtu-ally  all  other  authorities)  read  that  right  to  refer  only  to 
"protect[ion  of]  the  public  liberty"  and  "keep[ing]  in  awe those who are in power," 

id., at 158.  The court then adopted a sort of middle position, whereby citizens were permitted to 

carry arms openly, unconnected with any service in a formal militia,  but  were  given  the  right  to  use  them  only  for  the 
military  purpose  of  banding  together  to  oppose  tyranny. This  odd  reading  of  the  right  is,  to  be  sure,  not  the  one  we 
adopt--but  it  is  not  petitioners'  reading  either.  More  im-portantly, seven years earlier the Tennessee Supreme Court

Opinion of the Court 
had  treated  the  state  constitutional  provision  as  conferring a right "to all the free citizens of the State to keep and bear 

arms for their defence," Simpson, 5 Yer., at 360; and 21 years later the court held that the "keep" portion of the state con-
stitutional  right  included  the  right  to  personal  self-defense: "[T]he  right  to  keep  arms  involves,  necessarily,  the  right  to 
use  such  arms  for  all  the  ordinary  purposes,  and  in  all  the 
ordinary  modes  usual in  the  country, and  to which  arms are adapted,  limited  by  the  duties  of  a  good  citizen  in  times  of 

peace."  Andrews, 50 Tenn., at 178-179; see also ibid. (equat-ing state provision with Second Amendment). 

3.  Post-Civil War Legislation. 

In the aftermath of the Civil War, there was an outpouring of  discussion  of  the  Second  Amendment  in  Congress  and  in 

public  discourse,  as  people  debated  whether  and  how  to  se-cure constitutional rights for newly free slaves.  See gener-
ally  S.  Halbrook,  Freedmen,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment, and  the  Right  to  Bear  Arms,  1866-1876  (1998)  (hereinafter 
Halbrook); Brief for Institute for Justice  as Amicus Curiae. 
Since those discussions took place 75 years after the ratifica-tion of the Second Amendment, they do not provide as much 

insight  into  its  original  meaning  as  earlier  sources.  Yet those  born  and  educated  in  the  early  19th  century  faced  a 
widespread effort to limit arms ownership by a large number of citizens; their understanding of the origins and continuing 
significance of the Amendment is instructive. Blacks  were  routinely  disarmed  by  Southern  States  after 
the  Civil  War.  Those  who  opposed  these  injustices  fre-quently  stated  that  they  infringed  blacks'  constitutional 
right to keep and bear arms.  Needless to say, the claim was 
not that blacks were being prohibited from carrying arms in 
an  organized  state  militia.  A  Report  of  the  Commission  of 
the  Freedmen's  Bureau  in  1866  stated  plainly:  "[T]he  civil 
law  [of  Kentucky]  prohibits  the  colored  man  from  bearing 
arms. . . .  Their  arms  are  taken  from  them  by  the  civil

authorities. . . .  Thus,  the  right  of  the  people  to  keep  and bear  arms  as  provided  in  the  Constitution  is  infringed." 

H.  R.  Exec.  Doc.  No.  70,  39th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  233,  236. A joint congressional Report decried: 

"[I]n some parts of [South Carolina,] armed parties are, without  proper  authority,  engaged  in  seizing  all  fire-
arms found in the hands of the freedmen.  Such conduct is  in  plain  and  direct  violation  of  their  personal  rights 
as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, which declares that `the right of the people to keep and 
bear  arms  shall  not  be  infringed.'  The  freedmen  of South  Carolina  have  shown  by  their  peaceful  and  or-
derly  conduct  that  they  can  safely  be  trusted  with  fire-arms,  and  they  need  them  to  kill  game  for  subsistence, 
and to protect their crops from destruction by birds and animals."  Joint  Comm.  on  Reconstruction,  H.  R.  Rep. 
No.  30,  39th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  pt.  2,  p.  229  (1866)  (Pro-posed Circular of Brigadier General R. Saxton). 

The  view  expressed  in  these  statements  was  widely  re-ported  and  was  apparently  widely  held.  For  example,  an 
editorial  in  The  Loyal  Georgian  (Augusta)  on  February  3, 1866,  assured  blacks  that  "[a]ll  men,  without  distinction  of 
color,  have  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms  to  defend  their homes, families or themselves."  Halbrook 19. 

Congress  enacted  the  Freedmen's  Bureau  Act  on  July  16, 1866.  Section 14 stated: 

"[T]he right . . . to  have full and equal benefit of all laws and  proceedings  concerning  personal  liberty,  personal 
security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real  and personal, including the  constitutional 
right  to  bear  arms,  shall  be  secured  to  and  enjoyed  by all  the  citizens . . . without  respect  to  race  or  color,  or 
previous  condition  of  slavery.  .  .  .  "  14  Stat.  176-177.

gressional discussion of the  bill,  with even an  opponent of it saying  that  the  founding  generation  "were  for  every  man 

bearing  his  arms  about  him  and  keeping  them  in  his  house, his  castle,  for  his  own  defense."  Cong.  Globe,  39th  Cong., 
1st Sess., 362, 371 (1866) (Sen. Davis). Similar discussion attended the passage of the Civil Rights 
Act  of 1871 and  the  Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, Representative  Butler  said  of  the  Act:  "Section  eight  is  in-
tended  to  enforce  the  well-known  constitutional  provision guaranteeing the right of the citizen to `keep and bear arms,' 
and  provides  that  whoever  shall  take  away,  by  force  or  vio-lence, or by threats and intimidation, the arms and weapons 
which any person may have for his defense, shall be deemed guilty  of  larceny  of  the  same."  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  37,  41st 
Cong.,  3d  Sess.,  7-8  (1871).  With  respect  to  the  proposed Amendment, Senator Pomeroy described as one of the three 
"indispensable" "safeguards of liberty . . .  under  the  Consti-tution" a man's "right to bear arms for the defense of himself 
and  family  and  his  homestead."  Cong.  Globe,  39th  Cong., 1st  Sess.,  1182  (1866).  Representative  Nye  thought  the 
Fourteenth  Amendment  unnecessary  because  "[a]s  citizens of the  United States  [blacks] have  equal right  to protection, 
and  to  keep  and  bear  arms  for  self-defense."  Id.,  at  1073. It  was  plainly  the  understanding  in  the  post-Civil  War 
Congress that  the Second Amendment protected  an individ-ual right to use arms for self-defense. 

4.  Post-Civil War Commentators. 

Every  late-19th-century  legal  scholar  that  we  have  read interpreted  the  Second  Amendment  to  secure  an  individual 

right  unconnected  with  militia  service.  The  most  famous was  the  judge  and  professor  Thomas  Cooley,  who  wrote  a 
massively  popular  1868  Treatise  on  Constitutional  Limita-tions.  Concerning the Second Amendment it said: 

"Among the other defences to personal liberty should be  mentioned  the  right  of  the  people  to  keep  and  bear

Opinion of the Court 
arms.  . . . The alternative to a standing  army is  `a well-regulated militia,' but this cannot exist unless the people 

are trained to bearing arms.  How far it is in the power of the legislature to regulate this right, we shall not un-
dertake to say, as happily there has been very little occa-sion  to discuss that subject  by the  courts." 

Id., at 350. 

That Cooley understood the right not as connected to militia service,  but  as  securing  the  militia  by  ensuring  a  populace 

familiar  with  arms,  is  made  even  clearer  in  his  1880  work, General  Principles  of  Constitutional  Law.  The  Second 
Amendment,  he  said,  "was  adopted  with  some  modification and  enlargement  from  the  English  Bill  of  Rights  of  1688, 
where  it  stood  as  a  protest  against  arbitrary  action  of  the 
overturned  dynasty  in  disarming  the  people."  Id.,  at  270. In  a  section  entitled  "The  Right  in  General,"  he  continued: 

"It might be supposed from the phraseology of this pro-
vision  that  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms  was  only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpre-

tation not  warranted by the  intent.  The militia, as has 
been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under  the  law,  are  liable  to  the  performance  of  military 

duty,  and  are  officered  and  enrolled  for  service  when called  upon.  But  the  law  may  make  provision  for  the 
enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of  a  small  number  only,  or  it  may  wholly  omit  to  make 
any  provision  at  all;  and  if  the  right  were  limited  to those  enrolled,  the  purpose  of  this  guaranty  might  be 
defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the 
government  it  was  meant  to  hold  in  check.  The  mean-
ing of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from 
whom  the  militia  must be taken, shall have  the  right to 
keep  and  bear  arms;  and  they  need  no  permission  or 
regulation of law for the purpose.  But this enables gov-
ernment  to  have  a  well-regulated  militia;  for  to  bear 
arms implies something  more than the mere keeping; it

implies  the  learning  to  handle  and  use  them  in  a  way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient 

use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for vol-untary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws 
of public order."  Id., at 271. 
All  other  post-Civil  War  19th-century  sources  we  have 
found  concurred  with  Cooley.  One  example  from  each  dec-ade will convey the general flavor: 

"[The purpose of the Second Amendment is] to secure a 
well-armed  militia.  .  .  .  But  a  militia  would  be  useless 
unless  the  citizens  were enabled  to  exercise  themselves in  the  use  of  warlike  weapons.  To  preserve  this  privi-

lege,  and  to  secure  to  the  people  the  ability  to  oppose themselves  in  military  force  against  the  usurpations  of 
government,  as  well  as  against  enemies  from  without, that  government  is  forbidden  by  any  law  or  proceeding 
to invade or destroy the right to keep and bear arms. . . .  
The clause is analogous to the one securing the freedom of speech and of the press.  Freedom, not license, is se-

cured; the fair use, not the libellous abuse, is protected." J.  Pomeroy,  An  Introduction  to  the  Constitutional  Law 
of  the  United  States  $ 239,  pp.  152-153  (1868)  (herein-after Pomeroy). 
"As  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  and  the  con-stitutions of several  of the states, in terms more or less 
comprehensive,  declare  the  right  of  the  people  to  keep and bear arms, it has been a subject of grave discussion, 
in  some of  the  state  courts,  whether  a  statute  prohibit-ing persons, when not on a journey, or as travellers, from 
wearing  or  carrying  concealed  weapons,  be  constitu-
tional.  There has been a great difference of opinion on the  question."  2  J.  Kent,  Commentaries  on  American 

Law  *340,  n.  2  (O.  Holmes  ed.,  12th  ed.  1873)  (herein-after Kent).

Opinion of the Court 
"Some general knowledge of firearms is important to the public welfare; because it would be impossible, in case of 

war, to organize promptly an efficient force of volunteers unless  the  people  had  some  familiarity  with  weapons  of 
war.  The  Constitution  secures  the  right  of  the  people to  keep  and  bear  arms.  No  doubt,  a  citizen  who  keeps 
a  gun  or pistol  under  judicious precautions,  practises in safe  places  the  use  of  it,  and  in  due  time  teaches  his 
sons  to do the same, exercises  his  individual right.  No doubt, a person whose residence or duties involve pecu-
liar  peril  may  keep  a  pistol  for  prudent  self-defence." B.  Abbott,  Judge  and  Jury:  A  Popular  Explanation  of 
the  Leading  Topics  in  the  Law  of  the  Land  333  (1880) (hereinafter Abbott). 

"The  right  to  bear  arms  has  always  been  the  distinc-tive  privilege  of  freemen.  Aside  from  any  necessity  of 
self-protection to the person, it represents among all na-tions  power  coupled  with  the  exercise  of  a  certain 
jurisdiction. . . . [I]t was not necessary that the right to bear  arms  should  be  granted  in  the  Constitution,  for  it 
had always existed."  J. Ordronaux, Constitutional Leg-islation in the United States 241-242 (1891).

We now ask  whether any  of our precedents  forecloses  the conclusions  we  have  reached  about  the  meaning  of  the  Sec-

ond Amendment. United  States  v.  Cruikshank,  92  U. S.  542,  in  the  course 
of  vacating  the  convictions  of  members  of  a  white  mob  for depriving  blacks  of  their  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms,  held 
that the Second Amendment does not by its own force apply to anyone other than the Federal Government.  The opinion 
explained  that the  right  "is  not  a  right  granted  by  the  Con-stitution [or] in any manner dependent upon that instrument 
for its existence.  The second amendment . . .  means no more

and revolutionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by mi-litiamen  and  weapons  used  in  defense  of  person  and  home 

were one and the same."  State v.  Kessler, 289 Ore. 359, 368, 614  P.  2d  94,  98  (1980)  (citing  G.  Neumann,  Swords  and 
Blades  of  the  American  Revolution  6-15,  252-254  (1973)). Indeed,  that  is  precisely  the  way  in  which  the  Second 
Amendment's  operative  clause  furthers  the  purpose  an-nounced in its preface.  We therefore read 

Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons 

not  typically  possessed  by  law-abiding  citizens  for  lawful purposes,  such  as  short-barreled  shotguns.  That  accords 
with  the  historical  understanding  of  the  scope  of  the  right, see Part III, infra.

25 

We conclude that nothing in our precedents forecloses our adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amend-

ment.  It should be unsurprising that such a significant mat-ter  has  been  for  so  long  judicially  unresolved.  For  most  of 
our  history,  the  Bill  of  Rights  was  not  thought  applicable  to the States, and the Federal Government did not significantly 
regulate  the  possession  of  firearms  by  law-abiding  citizens. Other  provisions  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  have  similarly  re-
mained  unilluminated  for  lengthy  periods.  This  Court  first 

25 Miller was briefly mentioned in our decision in Lewis v.  United States, 
445 U. S. 55 (1980), an appeal from a conviction for being a felon in posses-
sion  of  a  firearm.  The  challenge  was  based  on  the  contention  that  the 
prior  felony  conviction  had  been  unconstitutional.  No  Second  Amend-
ment claim was raised or briefed by any party.  In the course of rejecting 
the  asserted  challenge,  the  Court  commented  gratuitously,  in  a  footnote, 
that  "[t]hese  legislative  restrictions  on  the  use  of  firearms  are  neither 
based upon constitutionally suspect criteria, nor do they trench upon any 
constitutionally protected liberties.  See United States v.  Miller . . . (the 
Second  Amendment  guarantees  no  right to  keep  and  bear  a  firearm  that 
does  not  have  `some  reasonable  relationship  to  the  preservation  or  effi-
ciency  of  a  well  regulated  militia')."  Id.,  at  65-66,  n.  8.  The  footnote 
then cites several Court of Appeals cases to the same effect.  It is incon-
ceivable that we would rest our interpretation of the basic meaning of any 
guarantee  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  upon  such  a  footnoted  dictum  in  a  case 
where the point was not at issue and was not argued.

We  also  recognize  another  important  limitation  on  the right  to  keep  and  carry  arms.  Miller  said,  as  we  have  ex-

plained,  that  the  sorts  of  weapons  protected  were  those  "in common use at the time."  307 U. S., at 179.  We think that 
limitation  is  fairly  supported  by  the  historical  tradition  of prohibiting  the  carrying  of  "dangerous  and  unusual  weap-
ons."  See  4  Blackstone  148-149  (1769);  3  B.  Wilson,  Works of  the  Honourable  James  Wilson  79  (1804);  J.  Dunlap,  The 
New-York  Justice  8  (1815);  C.  Humphreys,  A  Compendium of  the  Common  Law  in  Force  in  Kentucky  482  (1822);  1  W.

Criminal  Law  of  the  United  States  726  (1852).  See  also State  v.  Langford,  10  N.  C.  381,  383-384  (1824);  O'Neill  v. 
State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); English v.  State, 35 Tex. 473, 476 (1871); State v.  Lanier, 71 N. C. 288, 289 (1874). 

It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military  service--M-16  rifles  and  the  like--may  be  banned, 
then  the  Second  Amendment  right  is  completely  detached from the prefatory clause.  But as we have said, the concep-
tion  of  the  militia  at  the  time  of  the  Second  Amendment's ratification  was  the  body  of  all  citizens  capable  of  military 
service,  who  would  bring  the  sorts  of  lawful  weapons  that they possessed at home to militia duty.  It may well be true 
today that  a militia, to be as effective  as militias in the 18th century,  would  require  sophisticated  arms  that  are  highly 
unusual  in  society  at  large.  Indeed,  it  may  be  true  that  no amount  of  small  arms  could  be  useful  against  modern-day 
bombers and tanks.  But the fact that modern developments have  limited  the  degree  of  fit  between  the  prefatory  clause 

26 We  identify  these  presumptively  lawful  regulatory  measures  only  as 
examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.

protection of one's home and family," 478 F. 3d, at 400, would 
fail constitutional muster. 

Few  laws  in  the  history  of  our  Nation  have  come  close  to 
the  severe  restriction  of  the  District's  handgun  ban.  And 
some  of  those  few  have  been  struck  down.  In  Nunn  v. 
State, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a prohibition 
on  carrying  pistols  openly  (even  though  it  upheld  a  prohibi-
tion on carrying concealed weapons).  See 1 Ga., at 251.  In 
Andrews  v.  State,  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  likewise 
held  that  a  statute  that  forbade  openly  carrying  a  pistol 
"publicly  or  privately,  without  regard  to  time  or  place,  or 
circumstances," 50 Tenn., at 187, violated the state constitu-
tional  provision  (which  the  court  equated  with  the  Second 
Amendment).  That  was so even though the  statute did  not 
restrict  the  carrying  of  long  guns.  Ibid.  See  also  State  v. 
Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) ("A statute which, under the 
pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, 
or  which  requires  arms  to  be  so  borne  as  to  render  them 
wholly  useless  for  the  purpose  of  defence,  would  be  clearly 
unconstitutional"). 

It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissi-
ble to ban the possession  of handguns so long as the posses-
sion  of  other  firearms  (i. e.,  long  guns)  is  allowed.  It  is 
enough to note, as we have observed, that the American peo-
ple  have  considered  the  handgun  to  be  the  quintessential 
self-defense weapon.  There are many reasons that a citizen 
may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store 
in  a  location  that  is  readily  accessible  in  an  emergency;  it 
cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; 
it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength 
to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with 
one  hand  while  the  other  hand  dials  the  police.  Whatever 
the  reason,  handguns  are  the  most  popular  weapon  chosen 
by  Americans  for  self-defense  in  the  home,  and  a  complete 
prohibition of their use is invalid.

630  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  v.  HELLER 

Opinion of the Court 
We  must  also  address  the  District's  requirement  (as  ap-plied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the  home be 

rendered  and  kept  inoperable  at  all  times.  This  makes  it impossible  for  citizens  to  use  them  for  the  core  lawful  pur-
pose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.  The Dis-trict  argues  that  we  should  interpret  this  element  of  the 
statute  to  contain  an  exception  for  self-defense.  See  Brief 
for  Petitioners  56-57.  But  we  think  that  is  precluded  by the  unequivocal  text,  and  by  the  presence  of  certain  other 

enumerated  exceptions:  "Except  for  law  enforcement  per-sonnel  .  .  .  ,  each  registrant  shall  keep  any  firearm  in  his 
possession unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device unless such firearm is kept at his place 
of  business,  or  while  being  used  for  lawful  recreational  pur-poses  within  the  District  of  Columbia."  D.  C.  Code  $ 7- 
2507.02.  The nonexistence of a self-defense exception is also 
suggested by the D. C. Court of Appeals' statement that the 
statute  forbids  residents  to  use  firearms  to  stop  intruders, 
see McIntosh v.  Washington, 395 A. 2d 744, 755-756 (1978).28 

Apart  from  his  challenge  to  the  handgun  ban  and  the 
trigger-lock requirement respondent asked the  District 
Court  to  enjoin  petitioners  from  enforcing  the  separate  li-
censing requirement  "in  such  a manner  as to  forbid  the  car-
rying of a firearm within one's home or possessed land with-
out  a  license."  App.  59a.  The  Court  of  Appeals  did  not 
invalidate  the  licensing  requirement,  but  held  only  that  the 
District  "may  not  prevent  [a  handgun]  from  being  moved 
throughout one's house."  478 F. 3d, at 400.  It then ordered 
the  District  Court  to  enter  summary  judgment  "consistent 

28 McIntosh  upheld  the  law  against  a  claim  that  it  violated  the  Equal 
Protection  Clause  by  arbitrarily  distinguishing  between  residences  and 
businesses.  See  395  A.  2d,  at  755.  One  of  the  rational  bases  listed  for 
that distinction was the legislative finding "that for each intruder stopped 
by a firearm there are four gun-related accidents within the home."  Ibid. 
That tradeoff would not bear mention if the statute did not prevent stop-
ping intruders by firearms.

Syllabus 
that  Davis  had  standing,  but  rejected  his  claims  on  the  merits  and 
granted the FEC summary judgment. 

Held: 

1.  This Court has jurisdiction to hear Davis' appeal.  Pp. 732-736. 

(a)  Davis  has  standing  to  challenge  $ 319(b)'s  disclosure  require-
ments.  When he filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy 
and  had  been  forced  by  $ 319(b)  to  disclose  to  his  opponent  that  he  in-
tended  to  spend  more  than  $350,000  in  personal  funds.  He  also  faced 
the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure 
with further notifications once he passed the $350,000 mark.  Securing 
a  declaration that $ 319(b)  is unconstitutional  and an injunction against 
its  enforcement  would  have  spared  him  from  making  those  disclosures 
and also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue 
an  enforcement  action  based  on  alleged  $ 319(b)  violations  during  his 
2004  campaign.  Davis  also  has  standing  to  challenge  $ 319(a)'s  asym-
metrical contribution limits.  The standing inquiry focuses on whether 
the  party  invoking  jurisdiction  had  the  requisite  stake  in  the  outcome 
when  the  suit  was  filed,  see,  e. g.,  Friends  of  Earth,  Inc.  v.  Laidlaw 
Environmental  Services  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U. S.  167,  180,  and  a  party 
facing  prospective  injury  has  standing  where  the  threatened  injury  is 
real, immediate, and direct, see, e. g., Los Angeles v.  Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 
102.  Davis  faced  the  requisite  injury  from  $ 319(a)  when  he  filed  suit: 
He had already declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than 
$350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset 
was rapidly approaching.  Section 319(a) would shortly burden his per-
sonal expenditure by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on 
more  favorable  terms,  and  there  was  no  indication  that  his  opponent 
would forgo that opportunity.  Pp. 733-735. 

(b)  The  FEC's  argument that the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction because 
Davis' claims are moot also fails.  In Federal Election Comm'n v.  Wis-
consin  Right  to  Life,  Inc.,  551  U. S.  449,  this  Court  rejected  a  very 
similar claim of mootness, finding that the case "fit comfortably within the 
established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet 
evading  review."  Id.,  at  462.  That  "exception  applies  where  `(1)  the 
challenged  action  is  in  its  duration  too  short  to  be  fully  litigated  prior 
to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that 
the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.' " 
Ibid.  First,  despite  BCRA's  command  that  the  case  be  expedited  to 
the greatest possible extent and Davis' request that his case be resolved 
before  the  2006  election,  the  case  could  not  be  resolved  before  the 
2006  election.  See  ibid.  Second,  the  FEC  has  conceded  that  Davis'

Opinion of the Court 
Section  319(a)  of  the  Bipartisan  Campaign  Reform  Act  of 
2002  (BCRA),  116  Stat.  109,  2  U. S. C.  $ 441a-1(a),3  part  of 
the  so-called  "Millionaire's  Amendment,"  fundamentally  al-
ters  this  scheme  when,  as  a  result  of  a  candidate's  expendi-
ture  of  personal  funds,  the  "opposition  personal  funds 
amount"  (OPFA)  exceeds  $350,000.4  The  OPFA,  in  simple 
terms,  is  a  statistic  that  compares  the  expenditure  of  per-
sonal  funds  by  competing  candidates  and  also  takes  into 
account  to  some  degree  certain  other  fundraising.5  See 

$ 441a-1(a).  When  a  candidate's  expenditure  of  personal 
funds  causes  the  OPFA  to  pass  the  $350,000  mark  (for  con-
venience,  such  candidates  will  be  referred  to  as  "self-
financing"),  a  new,  asymmetrical  regulatory  scheme  comes 
into  play.  The  self-financing  candidate  remains  subject  to 
the  limitations  noted  above,  but  the  candidate's  opponent 
(the  "non-self-financing"  candidate)  may  receive  individual 
contributions  at  treble  the  normal  limit  (e. g.,  $6,900  rather 
than  the  current  $2,300),  even  from  individuals  who  have 
reached  the  normal  aggregate  contributions  cap,  and  may 
accept  coordinated  party  expenditures  without  limit.  See 

$$ 441a-1(a)(1)(A)-(C).  Once  the  non-self-financing  candi-
date's  receipts  exceed  the  OPFA,  the  prior  limits  are  re-
vived.  $ 441a-1(a)(3).  A candidate who does not spend the 

3 BCRA  $$ 319(a)  and  (b)  are  set  out  in  an  appendix  to  this  opinion. 
Although what we refer to  as $$ 319(a) and (b) are actually $ 315A(a)  and 
(b)  of  the  Federal  Election  Campaign  Act  of  1971,  which  were  added  to 
that  Act  by  BCRA  $ 319(a),  we  follow  the  convention  of  the  parties  in 
making reference to $$ 319(a) and (b). 

4 BCRA  $ 304  similarly  regulates  self-financed  Senate  bids.  116  Stat. 

97, 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(i). 

5 The OPFA is calculated as follows.  For each candidate, expenditures 

of personal funds are added to 50% of the funds raised for the election at 
issue  measured  at  designated  dates  in  the  year  preceding  the  election. 
The  resulting  figures  are  compared,  and  if  the  difference  is  greater  than 
$350,000, the asymmetrical limits take effect.  See $$ 441a-1(a)(1), (2).

Opinion of the Court 
contributions  received  under  the  asymmetrical  limits  must return them.  $ 441a-1(a)(4). 

In  order  to  calculate  the  OPFA,  certain  information  is needed  about  the  self-financing  candidate's  campaign  assets 
and  personal  expenditures.  Section  319(b)  thus  requires self-financing  candidates  to  make  three  types  of  disclosures. 
First, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must 
file  a  "[d]eclaration  of  intent"  revealing  the  amount  of personal  funds  the  candidate  intends  to  spend  in  excess 

of  $350,000.  2  U. S. C.  $ 441a-1(b)(1)(B).  A  candidate  who does  not  intend  to  cross  this  threshold  may  simply  declare 
an intent to spend no personal funds.  11 CFR $ 400.20(a)(2) 
(2008).  Second, within 24 hours of crossing or becoming ob-
ligated to cross the $350,000 mark, the candidate must file an 
"[i]nitial  notification."  2  U. S. C.  $ 441a-1(b)(1)(C).  Third, 
the  candidate  must  file  an  "[a]dditional  notification"  within 
24 hours of making or becoming obligated to make each addi-
tional  expenditure  of  $10,000  or  more  using  personal  funds. 

$ 441a-1(b)(1)(D).  The  initial  and  additional  notifications 
must provide the date and amount of each expenditure from 
personal  funds,  and  all  notifications  must  be  filed  with  the 
Federal Election Commission (FEC), all other candidates for 
the  seat,  and  the  national  parties  of  all  those  candidates. 

$ 441a-1(b)(1)(E).  Failure  to  comply  with  the  reporting 
requirements  may  result  in  civil  and  criminal  penalties. 

$$ 437g(a)(5)-(6), (d)(1). 

A non-self-financing candidate and the candidate's commit-
tee  face  less  extensive  disclosure  requirements.  Within  24 
hours  after  receiving  an  "initial"  or  "additional"  notification 
filed  by  a self-financing opponent, a  non-self-financing candi-
date  must  provide  notice  to  the  FEC  and  the  national  and 
state  committees  of  the  candidate's  party  if  the  non-self-
financing  candidate  concludes  based  on  the  newly  acquired 
information  that  the  OPFA  has  passed  the  $350,000  mark. 
11 CFR $ 400.30(b)(2).  In addition, when the additional con-
tributions  that  a  non-self-financing  candidate  is  authorized

Opinion of the Court 
to  receive  pursuant  to  the  asymmetrical  limitations  scheme equals  the  OPFA,  the  non-self-financing  candidate  must  no-

tify  the  FEC  and  the  appropriate  national  and  state  com-mittees  within  24  hours.  $ 400.31(e)(1)(ii).  The  non-self-
financing  candidate  must  also  provide  notice  regarding  any refunds  of  "excess  funds"  (funds  received  under  the  in-
creased  limits  but  not  used  in  the  campaign).  $$ 400.50, 400.54.  For their part, political parties must notify the FEC 
and  the  candidate  they  support  within  24  hours  of  making any  expenditures  that  exceed  the  normal  limit  for  coordi-
nated party expenditures.  $ 400.30(c)(2). 

B 
Appellant  Jack  Davis  was  the  Democratic  candidate  for the  House  of  Representatives  from  New  York's  26th  Con-

gressional  District  in  2004  and  2006.  In  both  elections,  he lost  to  the  incumbent.  In  his  brief,  Davis  discloses  having 
spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004 cam-paign.  Brief  for  Appellant  4.  He  reports  spending  $2.3 
million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds. 

Id.,  at  13.  His  opponent  in  2006  spent  no  personal funds.  Indeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the 

opportunity  for  Davis'  opponent  to  raise  nearly  $1.5  million under  $ 319(a)'s  asymmetrical  limits,  Davis'  opponent  ad-
hered to the normal contribution limits. Davis' 2006  candidacy began  in  March 2006, when  he filed 
with the FEC a "Statement of Candidacy" and, in compliance with  $ 319(b),  declared  that  he  intended  to  spend  $1  million 
in  personal funds during  the  general election.  Two  months later,  in  anticipation  of  this  expenditure  and  its  $ 319  conse-
quences,  Davis  filed  suit  against  the  FEC,  requesting  that $ 319  be  declared  unconstitutional  and  that  the  FEC  be  en-
joined from enforcing it during the 2006 election. After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed suit, 
the FEC's general counsel notified him that it had reason to believe  that  he  had  violated  $ 319  by  failing  to  report  per-

Opinion of the Court 
sonal  expenditures  during  the  2004  campaign.  The  FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which Davis would 

pay  a  substantial  civil  penalty.  Davis  responded  by  agree-ing  to  toll  the  limitations  period  for  an  FEC  enforcement 
action until resolution of this suit. Davis filed this action in the United States District Court 
for  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  a  three-judge  panel  was convened.  BCRA  $ 403,  116  Stat.  113,  note  following  2 
U. S. C. $ 437h.  While  Davis requested that the case be de-cided before the general election campaign began on Septem-
ber  12,  2006,  the  FEC  opposed  the  request,  asserting  the need  for  extensive  discovery,  and  the  request  was  denied. 
Ultimately,  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary judgment. 

Ruling  on  those  motions,  the  District  Court  began  by  ad-dressing  Davis'  standing 

sua  sponte.  The  court  concluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the mer-

its  and  granted  summary  judgment  for  the  FEC.  501 F. Supp. 2d 22 (2007).  Davis then invoked BCRA's exclusive 
avenue  for  appellate  review--direct  appeal  to  this  Court. Note following $ 437h.  We deferred full consideration of our 
jurisdiction, 552 U. S. 1135 (2008), and we now reverse. 

II 
Like the District Court, we must first ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear Davis' appeal.  Article III restricts fed-

eral courts to the resolution of cases and controversies.  Ar-izonans  for  Official  English  v.  Arizona,  520  U. S.  43,  64 
(1997).  That  restriction  requires  that  the  party  invoking federal  jurisdiction  have  standing--the  "personal  interest 
that  must  exist  at  the  commencement  of  the  litigation." 
Friends  of  Earth,  Inc.  v.  Laidlaw  Environmental  Services 
(TOC),  Inc.,  528  U. S.  167,  189  (2000)  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted).  But  it  is  not  enough  that  the  requisite  in-terest  exist  at  the  outset.  "To  qualify  as  a  case  fit  for

Opinion of the Court 
federal-court  adjudication,  `an  actual  controversy  must  be extant  at  all  stages  of  review,  not  merely  at  the  time  the 

complaint is filed.' "  Arizonans for Official English, supra, at  67.  The  FEC  argues  that  Davis'  appeal  fails  to  present 
a  constitutional  case  or  controversy  because  Davis  lacks standing and because his claims are moot.  We address each 
of these issues in turn.  A 

As  noted,  the  requirement  that  a  claimant  have  "stand-ing  is  an  essential  and  unchanging  part  of  the  case-or-
controversy  requirement  of  Article  III."  Lujan  v.  Defend-
ers of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992); see also Arizonans for  Official  English,  supra,  at  64.  To  qualify  for  standing, 

a  claimant  must  present  an  injury  that  is  concrete,  partic-ularized,  and  actual  or  imminent;  fairly  traceable  to  the 
defendant's  challenged  behavior;  and  likely  to  be  redressed by a favorable ruling.  Lujan, supra, at 560-561. 

The  District  Court  held,  and  the  parties  do  not  dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure re-
quirements  of  $ 319(b).  When  Davis  filed  suit,  he  had  al-ready  declared  his  2006  candidacy  and  had  been  forced  by 

$ 319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more  than  $350,000  in  personal  funds.  At  that  time,  Davis 
faced  the  imminent  threat  that  he  would  have  to  follow  up on  that  disclosure  with  further  notifications  after  he  in  fact 
passed  the  $350,000  mark.  Securing  a  declaration  that 

$ 319(b)'s  requirements  are  unconstitutional  and  an  injunc-tion  against  their  enforcement  would  have  spared  him  from 

making  those  disclosures.  That  relief  also  would  have  re-moved  the  real  threat  that  the  FEC  would  pursue  an 
enforcement  action  based  on  alleged  violations  of  $ 319(b) 
during  his  2004  campaign.  As  a  result,  Davis  possesses standing to challenge $ 319(b)'s disclosure requirement. 

The fact that Davis has standing to challenge $ 319(b) does 
not  necessarily  mean  that  he  also  has  standing  to  challenge

734  DAVIS  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
the  scheme  of  contribution  limitations  that  applies  when 

$ 319(a)  comes  into  play.  "[S]tanding  is  not  dispensed  in 
gross."  Lewis  v.  Casey,  518  U. S.  343,  358,  n.  6  (1996). 
Rather, "a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim 
he  seeks  to  press"  and  " `for  each  form  of  relief ' "  that  is 
sought.  DaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U. S.  332,  352 
(2006) (quoting Friends of Earth, supra, at 185). 

In  light  of  these  principles,  the  FEC  argues  that  Davis 
lacks standing to attack $ 319(a)'s asymmetrical limits. 
When  Davis  commenced  this  action,  his  opponent  had  not 
yet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his 
opponent  did  qualify  to  take  advantage  of  those  limits,  he 
chose  not  to  do  so.  Accordingly,  the  FEC  argues  that 

$ 319(a) did not cause Davis any injury. 

While  the  proof  required  to  establish  standing  increases 
as  the  suit  proceeds,  see  Lujan,  supra,  at  561,  the  standing 
inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking juris-
diction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit 
was  filed.  Friends  of  Earth,  supra,  at  180;  Arizonans  for 
Official  English,  supra,  at  68,  n.  22.  As  noted  above,  the 
injury  required  for  standing  need  not  be  actualized.  A 
party  facing  prospective  injury  has  standing  to  sue  where 
the  threatened  injury  is  real,  immediate,  and  direct.  Los 
Angeles  v.  Lyons,  461  U. S.  95,  102  (1983);  see  also  Babbitt 

v.  Farm  Workers,  442  U. S.  289,  298  (1979)  (A  plaintiff  may 
challenge  the  prospective  operation  of  a  statute  that  pre-
sents  a  realistic  and  impending  threat  of  direct  injury). 
Davis  faced  such  an  injury  from  the  operation  of  $ 319(a) 
when  he  filed  suit.  Davis  had  declared  his  candidacy  and 
his  intent  to  spend  more  than  $350,000  of  personal  funds  in 
the  general  election  campaign  whose  onset  was  rapidly  ap-
proaching.  Section 319(a) would shortly burden his expend-
iture  of  personal  funds  by  allowing  his  opponent  to  receive 
contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no in-
dication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity.  In-

deed,  the  record  at  summary  judgment  indicated  that  most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded con-

tributions  had  done  so.  App.  89.  In  these  circumstances, we  conclude  that  Davis  faced  the  requisite  injury  from 

$ 319(a) when he filed suit and has standing to challenge that provision's asymmetrical contribution scheme.

The FEC's mootness argument also fails.  This case closely  resembles  Federal  Election  Comm'n  v.  Wisconsin 

Right  to  Life,  Inc.,  551  U. S.  449  (2007).  There,  Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy cor-
poration,  wished  to  run  radio  and  TV  ads  within  30  days  of the  2004  Wisconsin  primary,  contrary  to  a  restriction  im-
posed  by  BCRA.  WRTL  sued  the  FEC,  seeking  declara-tory  and  injunctive  relief.  Although  the  suit  was  not  re-
solved before the 2004 election, we rejected the FEC's claim of mootness, finding that the case "fit comfortably within the 
established  exception  to  mootness  for  disputes  capable  of repetition,  yet  evading  review." 

Id.,  at  462.  That  "excep-tion applies where `(1) the challenged action is in its duration 

too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same com-
plaining  party  will  be  subject  to  the  same  action  again.' " 
Ibid. (quoting Spencer v.  Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17 (1998)). In  WRTL,  "despite  BCRA's  command  that  the  cas[e]  be 

expedited `to  the  greatest  possible  extent,' "  WRTL's claims could  not  reasonably  be  resolved  before  the  election  con-
cluded.  551  U. S.,  at  462  (quoting  $ 403(a)(4),  116  Stat.  114, note  following  2  U. S. C.  $ 437h).  Similarly,  in  this  case  de-
spite  BCRA's  mandate  to  expedite  and  Davis'  request  that 
his  case  be resolved  before  the  2004 general  election  season commenced,  Davis'  case  could  not  be  resolved  before  the 

2006  election  concluded,  demonstrating  that  his  claims  are capable of evading review.

736  DAVIS  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
As  to  the  second  prong  of  the  exception,  even  though WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit capa-

ble  of  repetition  where  "WRTL  credibly  claimed  that  it planned  on  running  `materially  similar'  future"  ads  subject 
to BCRA's prohibition and had,  in fact, sought an injunction 
that would permit such an ad during the 2006 election.  551 U. S., at 463 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, 

the  FEC  conceded  in  its  brief  that  Davis'  $ 319(a)  claim would be capable of repetition if Davis planned to self-finance 
another  bid  for  a  House  seat.  Brief  for  Appellee  14,  20-21, and  n.  5.  Davis  subsequently  made  a  public  statement  ex-
pressing his intent to do so.  See Reply Brief 16 (citing Ter-reri,  Democrat  Davis  Confirms  He'll  Run  Again  for  Con-
gress,  Rochester  Democrat  and  Chronicle,  Mar.  27,  2008, p.  5B).  As  a  result,  we  are  satisfied  that  Davis'  facial  chal-
lenge is not moot.6  III 

We  turn  to  the  merits  of  Davis'  claim  that  the  First Amendment is violated by the contribution limits that apply 
when  $ 319(a)  comes  into  play.  Under  this  scheme,  as  pre-viously  noted,  when  a  candidate  spends  more  than  $350,000 
in  personal  funds  and  creates  what  the  statute  apparently regards  as  a  financial  imbalance,  that  candidate's  opponent 
may  qualify  to  receive  both  larger  individual  contributions 
than  would  otherwise  be  allowed  and  unlimited  coordinated party  expenditures.  Davis  contends  that  $ 319(a)  unconsti-

tutionally burdens his exercise of his First Amendment right to  make  unlimited  expenditures  of  his  personal  funds  be-
cause making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect  of  enabling  his  opponent  to  raise  more  money  and  to 
use  that  money  to  finance  speech  that  counteracts  and  thus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis' own speech. 

6 In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether the threat of an 
FEC enforcement action for alleged 2004 violations would be sufficient to 
keep this controversy alive.

738  DAVIS  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Section  319(a),  however,  does  not  raise  the  contribution limits  across  the  board.  Rather,  it  raises  the  limits  only 

for  the  non-self-financing  candidate  and  does  so  only  when the  self-financing  candidate's  expenditure  of  personal  funds 
causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded.  We have never upheld  the  constitutionality  of  a  law  that  imposes  different 
contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other, and we agree with Davis that this scheme imper-
missibly  burdens  his  First  Amendment  right  to  spend  his own money for campaign speech. 

In  Buckley,  we  soundly  rejected  a  cap  on  a  candidate's expenditure  of  personal  funds  to  finance  campaign  speech. 
We  held that a "candidate  . . . has  a First Amendment  right to  engage  in  the  discussion  of  public  issues  and  vigorously 
and  tirelessly  to  advocate  his  own  election"  and  that  a  cap on  personal  expenditures  imposes  "a  substantial,"  "clea[r]," 
and  "direc[t]"  restraint  on  that  right.  424  U. S.,  at  52-53. We  found  that  the  cap  at  issue  was  not  justified  by  "[t]he 
primary governmental interest" proffered in its defense, i. e., "the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the po-
litical  process."  Id.,  at  53.  Far  from  preventing  these evils, "the use of personal funds," we observed, "reduces the 
candidate's dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts  the  coercive  pressures  and  attendant  risks  of 
abuse  to  which . . .  contribution  limitations  are  directed." 
Ibid.  We  also  rejected  the  argument  that  the  expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served "[t]he an-

cillary  interest  in  equalizing  the  relative  financial  resources of  candidates  competing  for  elective  office." 

Id.,  at  54. This  putative  interest,  we  noted,  was  "clearly  not  sufficient 

to justify the . . .  infringement of fundamental First Amend-ment rights."  Ibid. 

Buckley's emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to  spend  personal  funds  for  campaign  speech  is  instructive. 
While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate's expendi-

Opinion of the Court 
ture of personal funds,  it  imposes an  unprecedented penalty on  any  candidate  who  robustly  exercises  that  First  Amend-

ment  right.  Section  319(a)  requires  a  candidate  to  choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered 
political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  Many  candidates  who  can afford  to make large 
personal  expenditures  to  support  their  campaigns  may 
choose  to  do  so  despite  $ 319(a),  but  they  must  shoulder  a special  and  potentially  significant  burden  if  they  make  that 

choice.  See Day v.  Holahan, 34 F. 3d 1356, 1359-1360 (CA8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota law that increased a can-
didate's  expenditure  limits  and  eligibility  for  public  funds 
based  on  independent  expenditures  against  her  candidacy 
burdened  the  speech  of  those  making  the  independent  ex-
penditures);  Brief  for  Appellee  29  (conceding  that  "[$] 319 
does  impose  some  consequences  on  a  candidate's  choice  to 
self-finance  beyond  certain  amounts").  Under  $ 319(a),  the 
vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance 
campaign  speech  produces  fundraising  advantages  for  op-
ponents  in  the  competitive  context  of  electoral  politics. 
Cf.  Pacific  Gas  &  Elec.  Co.  v.  Public  Util.  Comm'n  of  Cal., 
475 U. S. 1, 14 (1986) (plurality opinion) (finding infringement 
on  speech  rights  where  if  the  plaintiff  spoke  it  could  "be 
forced . . . to  help disseminate hostile views"). 

The resulting drag on First Amendment rights is not con-
stitutional  simply  because  it  attaches  as  a  consequence  of  a 
statutorily  imposed  choice.  In  Buckley,  we  held  that  Con-
gress "may  engage in public  financing  of election campaigns 
and  may  condition  acceptance  of  public  funds  on  an  agree-
ment by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limi-
tations" even though we found an independent limit on over-
all campaign expenditures to be unconstitutional.  424 U. S., 
at  57,  n.  65;  see  id.,  at  54-58.  But  the  choice  involved  in 
Buckley  was  quite  different  from  the  choice  imposed  by 

$ 319(a).  In Buckley, a candidate, by forgoing public financ-
ing, could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited per-

Opinion of the Court 
dented  step  of  imposing  different  contribution  and  coordi-nated  party  expenditure  limits  on  candidates  vying  for  the 

same seat is antithetical to the First Amendment. 

IV 
The remaining issue that we must consider is the constitu-tionality  of  $ 319(b)'s  disclosure  requirements.  "[W]e  have 

repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seri-ously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed 
by the First Amendment."  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64.  As a result,  we  have  closely  scrutinized  disclosure  requirements, 
including requirements governing independent expenditures made to further individuals' political speech.  Id., at 75.  To 
survive  this  scrutiny,  significant  encroachments  "cannot  be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental 
interest."  Id.,  at  64.  Instead,  there  must  be  "a  `relevant correlation' or `substantial relation' between the governmen-
tal  interest  and  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed," and the governmental interest "must survive exacting scru-
tiny."  Ibid.  (footnotes  omitted).  That  is,  the  strength  of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the 
actual burden on First Amendment rights.  Id., at 68, 71. The $ 319(b) disclosure requirements were designed to im-
plement the asymmetrical contribution limits provided for in $ 319(a),  and  as  discussed  above,  $ 319(a)  violates  the  First 
Amendment.  In  light  of  that  holding,  the  burden  imposed by  the  $ 319(b)  requirements  cannot  be  justified,  and  it  fol-
lows that they too are unconstitutional.9 

* * * 
In  sum,  we  hold  that  $$ 319(a)  and  (b)  violate  the  First Amendment.  The  judgment  of  the  District  Court  is  re-

9 Because  we  conclude  that  $$ 319(a)  and  (b)  violate  the  First  Amend-
ment,  we  need  not  address  Davis'  claim  that  they  also  violate  the  equal 
protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
