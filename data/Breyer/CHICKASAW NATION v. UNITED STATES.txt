In these cases we must decide whether a particular sub-section in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 102 Stat. 2467-2486, 25 U. S. C. $$ 2701-2721 (1994 ed.), exempts tribes frompaying the gambling-related taxes that chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes--taxes that States need notpay. We hold that it does not create such an exemption.IThe relevant Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (Gaming Act)subsection, as codified in 25 U. S. C. $ 2719(d)(1), reads asfollows:#Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the San CarlosApache Tribe by Richard T. Treon; for the San Manuel Band of SerranoMission Indians by Jerome L. Levine and Frank R. Lawrence; for theSeminole Tribe of Florida et al. by Hans Walker, Jr., and Judith A. Shapiro; and for the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota) Community et al.by Mark J. Streitz and Michael J. Wahoske.Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the town of Ledyard, Connecticut, et al. by Benjamin S. Sharp, Guy R. Martin, and Donald C. Mitchell.Briefs of amici curiae were filed for the Lower Sioux Indian Community in Minnesota et al. by James M. Schoessler, Henry M. Buffalo, Jr.,Mark A. Anderson, and Dennis J. Peterson; and for the Muscogee (Creek)Nation by L. Susan Work.*Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join all but Part II-B of thisopinion.534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN87Cite as: 534 U. S. 84 (2001)Opinion of the Court"The provisions of [the Internal Revenue Code of1986] (including sections 1441, 3402(q), 6041, and 6050I,and chapter 35 of such [Code]) concerning the reportingand withholding of taxes with respect to the winningsfrom gaming or wagering operations shall apply to In-dian gaming operations conducted pursuant to this chapter, or under a Tribal-State compact entered into undersection 2710(d)(3) of this title that is in effect, in thesame manner as such provisions apply to State gamingand wagering operations."The subsection says that Internal Revenue Code provisionsthat "concer[n] the reporting and withholding of taxes" withrespect to gambling operations shall apply to Indian tribesin the same way as they apply to States. The subsectionalso says in its parenthetical that those provisions "includ[e]"Internal Revenue Code "chapter 35." Chapter 35, however,says nothing about the reporting or the withholding of taxes.Rather, that chapter simplyimposes taxes--excise taxes andoccupational taxes related to gambling--from which it exempts certain state-controlled gambling activities. See,e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 4401(a) (1994 ed.) (imposing 0.25% excisetax on each wager); $ 4411 (imposing $50 occupational tax oneach individual engaged in wagering business); $ 4402(3)(exempting state-operated gambling operations, such aslotteries).In this lawsuit two Native American Indian Tribes, theChoctaw and Chickasaw Nations, claim that the Gaming Actsubsection exempts them from paying those chapter 35 taxesfrom which States are exempt. Brief for Petitioners 34-36.They rest their claim upon the subsection's explicit paren-thetical reference to chapter 35. The Tenth Circuit rejectedtheir claim on the ground that the subsection, despite its par-enthetical reference, applies only to Code provisions thatconcern the "reporting and withholding of taxes." 208 F. 3d871, 883-884 (2000); see also 210 F. 3d 389 (2000). The Courtof Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, reached the534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN88 CHICKASAW NATION v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtopposite conclusion. Little Six, Inc. v. United States, 210F. 3d 1361, 1366 (2000). We granted certiorari in order toresolve the conflict. We agree with the Tenth Circuit.IIThe Tribes' basic argument rests upon the subsection's ex-plicit reference to "chapter 35"--contained in a parentheticalthat refers to four other Internal Revenue Code provisionsas well. The subsection's language outside the parentheticalsays that the subsection applies to those Internal RevenueCode provisions that concern "reporting and withholding."The other four parenthetical references are to provisionsthat concern, or at least arguably concern, reporting andwithholding. See 26 U. S. C. $ 1441 (1994 ed. and Supp. V)(withholding of taxes for nonresident alien); $ 3402(q) (withholding of taxes from certain gambling winnings); $ 6041 (re-porting by businesses of payments, including payments ofgambling winnings, to others); $ 6050I (reporting by busi-nesses of large cash receipts, arguably applicable to certaingambling winnings or receipts).But what about chapter 35? The Tribes correctly pointout that chapter 35 has nothing to do with "reporting andwithholding." Brief for Petitioners 28-29. They add thatthe reference must serve some purpose, and the only purposethat the Tribes can find is that of expanding the scope of theGaming Act's subsection beyond reporting and withholdingprovisions--to the tax-imposing provisions that chapter 35does contain. The Gaming Act therefore must exempt them(like States) from those tax payment requirements. TheTribes add that at least the reference to chapter 35 makesthe subsection ambiguous. And they ask us to resolve theambiguity by applying a special Indian-related interpreta-tive canon, namely, " `statutes are to be construed liberallyin favor of the Indians with ambiguous provisions inter-preted to their benefit.' "Id., at 13 (quoting Montana v.Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 766 (1985)).534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN89Cite as: 534 U. S. 84 (2001)Opinion of the CourtWe cannot accept the Tribes' claim. We agree with theTribes that rejecting their argument reduces the phrase"(including . . . chapter 35) . . ." to surplusage. Nonetheless,we can find no other reasonable reading of the statute.AThe language of the statute is too strong to bend as theTribes would wish--i. e., so that it gives the chapter 35 reference independent operative effect. For one thing, the lan-guage outside the parenthetical is unambiguous. It sayswithout qualification that the subsection applies to "provi-sions . . . concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes."And the language inside the parenthetical, prefaced with theword "including," literally says the same. To "include" is to"contain" or "comprise as part of a whole." Webster's NinthNew Collegiate Dictionary 609 (1985). In this instance thatwhich "contains" the parenthetical references--the "whole"of which the references are "parts"--is the phrase "provisions . . . concerning the reporting and withholding oftaxes . . . ." The use of parentheses emphasizes the factthat that which is within is meant simply to be illustrative,hence redundant--a circumstance underscored by the lack ofany suggestion that Congress intended the illustrative list tobe complete. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $ 3406 (1994 ed.) (backup withholding provision not mentioned in parenthetical).Nor can one give the chapter 35 reference independentoperative effect without seriously rewriting the language ofthe rest of the statute. One would have to read the word"including" to mean what it does not mean, namely, "includ-ing . . . and." One would have to read the statute as if, forexample, it placed "chapter 35" outside the parenthetical andsaid "provisions of the . . . Code including chapter 35 andalso provisions . . . concerning the reporting and withholdingof taxes . . . ." Or, one would have to read the language asif it said "provisions of the . . . Code . . . concerning thetaxation and the reporting and withholding of taxes . . . ."534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN90 CHICKASAW NATION v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe mention this latter possibility because the congressionalbill that became the law before us once did read that way.But when the bill left committee, it contained not the em-phasized words ("the taxation and") but the cross-referenceto chapter 35.We recognize the Tribes' claim (made here for the firsttime) that one could avoid rewriting the statute by readingthe language outside the parenthetical as if it referred totwo kinds of "provisions of the . . . Code": first, those "concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with respectto the winnings from gaming," and, second, those "concerning . . . wagering operations." See Reply Brief for Petitioners 8-10. The subsection's grammar literally permits thisreading. But that reading, even if ultimately comprehensible, is far too convoluted to believe Congress intended it.Nor is there any reason to think Congress intended to sweepwithin the subsection's scope every Internal Revenue Codeprovision concerning wagering--a result that this unnaturalreading would accomplish.The subject matter at issue also counsels against acceptingthe Tribes' interpretation. That subject matter is tax exemption. When Congress enacts a tax exemption, it ordinarily does so explicitly. We can find no comparable instance in which Congress legislated an exemption throughan inexplicit numerical cross-reference--especially a crossreference that might easily escape notice.As we have said, the more plausible role for the parenthetical to play in this subsection is that of providing anillustrative list of examples. So considered, "chapter 35"is simply a bad example--an example that Congress included inadvertently. The presence of a bad example in astatute does not warrant rewriting the remainder of thestatute's language. Nor does it necessarily mean that thestatute is ambiguous, i. e., "capable of being understood intwo or more possible senses or ways." Webster's NinthNew Collegiate Dictionary 77 (1985). Indeed, in ordinary534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN91Cite as: 534 U. S. 84 (2001)Opinion of the Courtlife, we would understand an analogous instruction--say,"Test drive some cars, including Plymouth, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and Kitchenaid"--not as creating ambiguity, but asreflecting a mistake. Here too, in context, common sensesuggests that the cross-reference is simply a drafting mis-take, a failure to delete an inappropriate cross-reference inthe bill that Congress later enacted into law. Cf. Little Six,Inc. v. United States, 229 F. 3d 1383, 1385 (CA Fed. 2000)(Dyk, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) ("Thelanguage of the provision has all the earmarks of a simplemistake in legislative drafting").BThe Gaming Act's legislative history on balance supportsour conclusion. The subsection as it appeared in the original Senate bill applied both to taxation and to reporting andwithholding. It read as follows:"Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code . . . concerningthe taxation and the reporting and withholding of taxeswith respect to gambling or wagering operations shallapply to Indian gaming operations . . . the same as theyapply to State operations." S. 555, 100th Cong., 1stSess., 37 (1987).With the "taxation" language present, it would have madesense to include chapter 35, which concerns taxation, in aparenthetical that included other provisions that concernreporting and withholding. But the Senate committee deleted the taxation language. Why did it permit the cross-reference to chapter 35 to remain? Committee documentsdo not say.The Tribes argue that the committee intentionally left itin the statute in order to serve as a substitute for the word"taxation." An amicus tries to support this view by pointing to a tribal representative's testimony that certain Tribeswere "opposed to any indication where Internal Revenue534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 CHICKASAW NATION v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwould be collecting taxes from the tribal bingo operations."Hearings on S. 555 and S. 1303 before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 109 (1987)(statement of Lionel John, Executive Director of UnitedSouth and Eastern Tribes). Other Tribes thought the "tax-ation" language too "vague," preferring a clear statement"that the Internal Revenue Service is not being granted authority to tax tribes." Id., at 433, 435 (statement of CharlesW. Blackwell, Representative of the American Indian TribalGovernment and Policy Consultants, Inc.).Substitution of "chapter 35" for the word "taxation," however, could not have served the tribal witnesses purposes,for doing so took from the bill the very words that madeclear the tribes would not be taxed and substituted languagethat made it more likely they would be taxed. Nor can webelieve that anyone seeking to grant a tax exemption wouldintentionally substitute a confusion-generating numericalcross-reference, see Part II-A, supra, for pre-existing language that unambiguously carried out that objective. It isfar easier to believe that the drafters, having included theentire parenthetical while the word "taxation" was still partof the bill, unintentionally failed to remove what had becomea superfluous numerical cross-reference--particularly sincethe tax-knowledgeable Senate Finance Committee neverreceived the opportunity to examine the bill. Cf. S. Doc.No. 100-1, Senate Manual 30 (1987) (proposed legislation concerning revenue measures shall be referred to the Committee on Finance).Finally, the Tribes point to a letter written by one of theGaming Act's authors, stating that "by including referenceto Chapter 35," Congress intended "that the tax treatmentof wagers conducted by tribal governments be the same asthat for wagers conducted by state governments underChapter 35." App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a. This letter, however, was written after the event. It expresses the viewsof only one member of the committee. And it makes no534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN93Cite as: 534 U. S. 84 (2001)Opinion of the Courteffort to explain the critical legislative circumstance, namely,the elimination of the word "taxation" from the bill. Theletter may express the Senator's interpretive preference, butthat preference cannot overcome the language of the statuteand the related considerations we have discussed. SeeHeintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995) (A "statement[made] not during the legislative process, but after the stat-ute became law . . . is not a statement upon which otherlegislators might have relied in voting for or against the Act,but it simply represents the views of one informed person onan issue about which others may (or may not) have thoughtdifferently"). Cf.New York Telephone Co. v. New York StateDept. of Labor, 440 U. S. 519, 564, n. 18 (1979) (Powell, J.,dissenting) ("The comments . . . of a single Congressman,delivered long after the original passage of the [act at issue],are of no aid in determining congressional intent . . .").In sum, to adopt the Tribes' interpretation would readback into the Act the very word "taxation" that the Sen-ate committee deleted. We ordinarily will not assume thatCongress intended " `to enact statutory language that ithas earlier discarded in favor of other language.' "INS v.Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 443 (1987) (quoting Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446U. S. 359, 392-393 (1980)); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp PavingCo., 419 U. S. 186, 200 (1974) (same); Mescalero Apache Tribev. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 157 (1973) (same). There is no specialreason for doing so here. CThe Tribes point to canons of interpretation that favortheir position. The Court has often said that " `every clauseand word of a statute' " should, " `if possible,' " be given" `effect.' " United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152(1883)). The Tribes point out that our interpretation deprives the words "chapter 35" of any effect. The Court hasalso said that "statutes are to be construed liberally in favor534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 CHICKASAW NATION v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof the Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted totheir benefit." Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S., at766; South Carolina v. Catawba Tribe, Inc., 476 U. S. 498,520 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). The Tribes point outthat our interpretation is not to the Indians' benefit.Nonetheless, these canons do not determine how to readthis statute. For one thing, canons are not mandatory rules.They are guides that "need not be conclusive." Circuit CityStores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115 (2001). They aredesigned to help judges determine the Legislature's intentas embodied in particular statutory language. And othercircumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcometheir force. In this instance, to accept as conclusive the canons on which the Tribes rely would produce an interpretation that we conclude would conflict with the intent embodied in the statute Congress wrote. Cf. Choteau v. Burnet,283 U. S. 691 (1931) (upholding taxation where congressionalintent reasonably clear); Superintendent of Five CivilizedTribes v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418 (1935) (same); Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, supra (same). In light of theconsiderations discussed earlier, we cannot say that the statute is "fairly capable" of two interpretations, cf. Montana v.Blackfeet Tribe, supra, at 766, nor that the Tribes' interpretation is fairly "possible."Specific canons "are often countered . . . by some maximpointing in a different direction." Circuit City Stores, Inc.v. Adams, supra, at 115. The canon requiring a court togive effect to each word "if possible" is sometimes offset bythe canon that permits a court to reject words "as surplusage" if "inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest ofthe statute . . . ." K. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition 525 (1960). And the latter canon has particular forcehere where the surplus words consist simply of a numericalcross-reference in a parenthetical. Cf. Cabell HuntingtonHospital, Inc. v. Shalala, 101 F. 3d 984, 990 (CA4 1996)534US1 Unit: $$U5 [02-28-02 13:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN95Cite as: 534 U. S. 84 (2001)Opinion of the Court("A parenthetical is, after all, a parenthetical, and it cannotbe used to overcome the operative terms of the statute").Moreover, the canon that assumes Congress intends itsstatutes to benefit the tribes is offset by the canon thatwarns us against interpreting federal statutes as provid-ing tax exemptions unless those exemptions are clearly expressed. See United States v. Wells Fargo Bank, 485 U. S.351, 354 (1988) ("[E]xemptions from taxation . . . must beunambiguously proved"); Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U. S. 1, 6(1956) ("[T]o be valid, exemptions to tax laws should beclearly expressed"); United States Trust Co. v. Helvering,307 U. S. 57, 60 (1939) ("Exemptions from taxation do notrest upon implication"). Nor can one say that the pro-Indiancanon is inevitably stronger--particularly where the interpretation of a congressional statute rather than an Indiantreaty is at issue. Cf.post, at 100 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).This Court's earlier cases are too individualized, involvingtoo many different kinds of legal circumstances, to warrantany such assessment about the two canons' relative strength.Compare, e. g., Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, 675-676 (1912)(interpreting statement in treaty-related Indian land patentsthat land is "nontaxable" as creating property right invali-dating later congressional effort to tax);Squire, supra, at 3(Indian canon offsetting tax canon when related statutoryprovision and history make clear that language freeing In-dian land " `of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever' " includes tax); McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S.164, 174 (1973) (state tax violates principle of Indian sovereignty embodied in treaty), with Mescalero, supra (relyingon tax canon to find Indians taxable); Choteau, supra (language makes clear no exemption); Five Tribes, supra (same).Consequently, the canons here cannot make the differencefor which the Tribes argue. We conclude that the judg-ments of the Tenth Circuit must be affirmed.
