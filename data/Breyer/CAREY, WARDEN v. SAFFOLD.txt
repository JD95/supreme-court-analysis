S. 214 (2002)Opinion of the Courtapplication for state collateral review is "pending" in thestate courts. $ 2244(d)(2).This case raises three questions related to the statutoryword "pending":(1) Does that word cover the time between a lower statecourt's decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higherstate court?(2) If so, does it apply similarly to California's unique statecollateral review system--a system that does not involve anotice of appeal, but rather the filing (within a reasonabletime) of a further original state habeas petition in a highercourt?(3) If so, was the petition at issue here (filed in the Califor-nia Supreme Court 41/2 months after the lower state courtreached its decision) pending during that period, or was itno longer pending because it failed to comply with statetimeliness rules?We answer the first two questions affirmatively, while remanding the case to the Court of Appeals for its furtherconsideration of the third.IIn 1990 Tony Saffold, the respondent, was convicted andsentenced in California state court for murder, assault with afirearm, and robbery. His conviction became final on directreview in April 1992. Because Saffold's conviction becamefinal before AEDPA took effect, the federal limitations pe-riod began running on AEDPA's effective date, April 24,1996, giving Saffold one year from that date (in the absenceof tolling) to file a federal habeas petition.A week before the federal deadline, Saffold filed a statehabeas petition in the state trial court. The state trial courtdenied the petition. Five days later Saffold filed a furtherpetition in the State Court of Appeal. That court denied hispetition. And 41/2 months later Saffold filed a further peti-tion in the California Supreme Court. That court also denied Saffold's petition, stating in a single sentence that it did536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN218 CAREY v. SAFFOLDOpinion of the Courtso "on the merits and for lack of diligence." App. G to Pet.for Cert. 1.Approximately one week later, in early June 1998, Saffoldfiled a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal DistrictCourt. The District Court noted that AEDPA required Saf-fold to have filed his petition by April 24, 1997. It recognized that the statute gave Saffold extra time by tolling itslimitations period while Saffold's application for state collat-eral review was "pending" in the state courts. But the District Court decided that Saffold's petition was "pending" onlywhile the state courts were actively considering it, and thatperiod did not include the intervals between the time a lowerstate court had denied Saffold's petition and the time he hadfiled a further petition in a higher state court. In Saffold'scase those intervals amounted to five days (between the trialcourt and intermediate court) plus 41/2 months (betweenthe intermediate court and Supreme Court), and those intervals made a critical difference. Without counting the intervals as part of the time Saffold's application for statecollateral review was "pending," the tolling period was notlong enough to make Saffold's federal habeas petition timely.Hence the District Court dismissed the petition.The Ninth Circuit reversed. It included in the "pending"period, and hence in the tolling period, the intervals betweenwhat was, in effect, consideration of a petition by a lowerstate court and further consideration by a higher statecourt--at least assuming a petitioner's request for that further higher court consideration was timely. Saffold v. Newland, 250 F. 3d 1262, 1266 (2001). It added that Saffold'spetition to the California Supreme Court was timely despitethe 41/2 months that had elapsed since the California Courtof Appeal decision. That is because the California SupremeCourt had denied Saffold's petition, not only because of"lack of diligence" but also "on the merits," a circumstancethat showed the California Supreme Court had "applied itsuntimeliness bar only after considering to some degree the536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN219Cite as: 536 U. S. 214 (2002)Opinion of the Courtunderlying federal constitutional questions raised." Id., at1267.We granted certiorari. We now vacate the judgment andremand the case.IIIn most States, relevant state law sets forth some versionof the following collateral review procedures. First, theprisoner files a petition in a state court of first instance, typi-cally a trial court. Second, a petitioner seeking to appealfrom the trial court's judgment must file a notice of appealwithin, say, 30 or 45 days after entry of the trial court's judgment. See, e. g., Ala. Rule App. Proc. 4 (2001); Colo. App.Rule 4(b)(1) (2001); Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.04(3) (2002).Third, a petitioner seeking further review of an appellatecourt's judgment must file a further notice of appeal to thestate supreme court (or seek that court's discretionary re-view) within a short period of time, say, 20 or 30 days, afterentry of the court of appeals judgment. See, e. g., Ala. RuleApp. Proc. 5 (2001); Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 13-4-108 (2001); Conn.Rule App. Proc. 80-1 (2002); Ky. Rule Civ. Proc. 76.20(2)(b)(2002). California argues here for a "uniform national rule"to the effect that an application for state collateral review isnot "pending" in the state courts during the interval between a lower court's entry of judgment and the timely filingof a notice of appeal (or petition for review) in the next court.Brief for Petitioner 36. Its rationale is that, during thisperiod of time, the petition is not under court consideration.California's reading of the word "pending," however, is notconsistent with that word's ordinary meaning. The dictionary defines "pending" (when used as an adjective) as "incontinuance" or "not yet decided." Webster's Third NewInternational Dictionary 1669 (1993). It similarly definesthe term (when used as a preposition) as "through the periodof continuance . . . of," "until the . . . completion of." Ibid.That definition, applied in the present context, means that anapplication is pending as long as the ordinary state collateral536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN220 CAREY v. SAFFOLDOpinion of the Courtreview process is "in continuance"--i. e., "until the comple-tion of " that process. In other words, until the application has achieved final resolution through the State's post-conviction procedures, by definition it remains "pending."California's reading would also produce a serious statutoryanomaly. A federal habeas petitioner must exhaust stateremedies before he can obtain federal habeas relief. Thestatute makes clear that a federal petitioner has not ex-hausted those remedies as long as he maintains "the rightunder the law of the State to raise" in that State, "by anyavailable procedure, the question presented." 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(c). We have interpreted this latter provision to require the federal habeas petitioner to "invok[e] one completeround of the State's established appellate review process."O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999). The exhaustion requirement serves AEDPA's goal of promoting"comity, finality, and federalism," Williams v. Taylor, 529U. S. 420, 436 (2000), by giving state courts "the first opportunity to review [the] claim," and to "correct" any "constitutional violation in the first instance." Boerckel, supra, at844-845. And AEDPA's limitations period--with its accompanying tolling provision--ensures the achievement of thisgoal because it "promotes the exhaustion of state remedieswhile respecting the interest in the finality of state courtjudgments." Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 178 (2001).California's interpretation violates these principles by encouraging state prisoners to file federal habeas petitionsbefore the State completes a full round of collateral review.This would lead to great uncertainty in the federal courts,requiring them to contend with habeas petitions that arein one sense unlawful (because the claims have not beenexhausted) but in another sense required by law (becausethey would otherwise be barred by the 1-year statute oflimitations).It is therefore not surprising that no circuit court has interpreted the word "pending" in the manner proposed by536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN221Cite as: 536 U. S. 214 (2002)Opinion of the CourtCalifornia. Every Court of Appeals to consider the argu-ment has rejected it. Melancon v. Kaylo, 259 F. 3d 401, 406(CA5 2001); Payton v. Brigano, 256 F. 3d 405, 408 (CA62001); Hizbullahankhamon v. Walker, 255 F. 3d 65, 72 (CA22001); Nyland v. Moore, 216 F. 3d 1264, 1267 (CA11 2000);Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F. 3d 417, 421-422 (CA3 2000); Taylorv. Lee, 186 F. 3d 557, 560-561 (CA4 1999); Nino v. Galaza,183 F. 3d 1003, 1005 (CA9 1999);Barnett v. LeMaster, 167F. 3d 1321, 1323 (CA10 1999). Like these courts, we answerthe first question in the affirmative.IIIHaving answered the necessarily predicate question ofhow the tolling provision ordinarily treats applications forstate collateral review in typical "appeal" States, we turnto the question whether this rule applies in California. California's collateral review system differs from that of otherStates in that it does not require, technically speaking, appellate review of a lower court determination. Instead it con-templates that a prisoner will file a new "original" habeaspetition. And it determines the timeliness of each filing ac-cording to a "reasonableness" standard. These differences,it is argued, require treating California differently from "ap-peal" States, in particular by not counting a petition as"pending" during the interval between a lower court's deter-mination and filing of another petition in a higher court.See, e. g., Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation asAmicus Curiae 5-18.California's "original writ" system, however, is not as spe-cial in practice as its terminology might suggest. As interpreted by the courts, California's habeas rules lead a pris-oner ordinarily to file a petition in a lower court first. In reRamirez, 89 Cal. App. 4th 1312, 1316, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 229,232 (2001) (appellate court "has discretion to refuse to issuethe writ . . . on the ground that application has not [first]been made . . . in a lower court");Harris v. Superior Court536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN222 CAREY v. SAFFOLDOpinion of the Courtof Cal., 500 F. 2d 1124, 1126 (CA9 1974) (same); 6 B. Witkin &N. Epstein, California Criminal Law $ 20, p. 540 (3d ed. 2000)(describing general policy that reviewing court will requireapplication to have been made first in lower court). And aprisoner who files a subsequent and similar petition in an-other lower court (say, another trial court) will likely findconsideration of that petition barred as successive. See,e. g., In re Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 767-771, 855 P. 2d 729, 740-744 (1993). At the same time, a prisoner who files that samepetition in a higher, reviewing court will find that he canobtain the basic appellate review that he seeks, even thoughit is dubbed an "original" petition. See In re Resendiz, 25Cal. 4th 230, 250, 19 P. 3d 1171, 1184 (2001) (reviewing courtgrants substantial deference to lower court's factual findings). Thus, typically a prisoner will seek habeas review ina lower court and later seek appellate review in a highercourt--just as occurred in this case.The upshot is that California's collateral review processfunctions very much like that of other States, but for thefact that its timeliness rule is indeterminate. Other States(with the exception of North Carolina, see Allen v. Mitchell,276 F. 3d 183, 186 (CA4 2001)), specify precise time limits,such as 30 or 45 days, within which an appeal must be taken,while California applies a general "reasonableness" standard.Still, we do not see how that feature of California law couldmake a critical difference. As mentioned, AEDPA's tollingrule is designed to protect the principles of "comity, finality,and federalism," by promoting "the exhaustion of state remedies while respecting the interest in the finality of statecourt judgments." Duncan, supra, at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). It modifies the 1-year filing rule (arule that prevents prisoners from delaying their federal filing) in order to give States the opportunity to complete onefull round of review, free of federal interference. Inclusionof California's "reasonableness" periods carries out that purpose in the same way, and to the same degree, as does inclu536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN223Cite as: 536 U. S. 214 (2002)Opinion of the Courtsion of the more specific appellate filing periods prevalent inother States. And exclusion of those periods in Californiawould undermine AEDPA's statutory goals just as it wouldin those States. See Part II,supra.The fact that California's timeliness standard is generalrather than precise may make it more difficult for federalcourts to determine just when a review application (i. e., afiling in a higher court) comes too late. But it is the State'sinterests that the tolling provision seeks to protect, and theState, through its supreme court decisions or legislation, canexplicate timing requirements more precisely should thatprove necessary.Ordinarily, for purposes of applying a federal statute thatinteracts with state procedural rules, we look to how a stateprocedure functions, rather than the particular name that itbears. See Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of Equalization,329 U. S. 69, 72 (1946) (looking to function rather than "designation" that state law gives a state-court judgment for purposes of determining federal jurisdiction); Department ofBanking of Neb. v. Pink, 317 U. S. 264, 268 (1942) (per curiam) (same). We find that California's system functions inways sufficiently like other state systems of collateral reviewto bring intervals between a lower court decision and a filingof a new petition in a higher court within the scope of thestatutory word "pending."The dissent contends that this application of the federaltolling provision to California's "original writ" system "willdisrupt the sound operation of the federal limitations periodin at least 36 States." Post, at 227 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).This is so, the dissent believes, because the prisoner is giventwo choices when his petition has been denied by the intermediate court: He can file a "petition for hearing" in the supreme court within 10 days, or he can file a "new petition"in the supreme court. In re Reed, 33 Cal. 3d 914, 918, andn. 2, 663 P. 2d 216, 217, and n. 2 (1983). Why is Californiadifferent, the dissent asks, from "appeal" States that also536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN224 CAREY v. SAFFOLDOpinion of the Courtgive their supreme courts the power to entertain originalhabeas petitions? Won't our interpretation of the federaltolling rule, as it applies to California, apply equally to thoseother States, meaning that even after the statutory time toappeal to the supreme court has expired, the federal limita-tions period may still be tolled because a prisoner might, atany time, file an original petition?The answer to this question is "no." In "appeal" systems,the original writ plays a different role. As the SupremeCourt of Idaho (one of the States cited by the dissent)explains:"The Supreme Court, having jurisdiction to review onappeal decisions of the district courts in habeas corpusproceedings . . . will not exercise its power . . . to grantanoriginal writ of habeas corpus, except in extraordinary cases." In re Barlow, 48 Idaho 309, 282 P. 380(1929).See also, e. g., Commonwealth v. Salzinger, 406 Pa. 268, 269,177 A. 2d 619, 620 (1962) ("extraordinary circumstances" required for exercise of original jurisdiction); La Belle v. Hancock, 99 N. H. 254, 255, 108 A. 2d 545 (1954) (per curiam)("original authority" to grant habeas relief "not ordinarilyexercised"); Ex parte Lambert, 37 Tex. Crim. 435, 436, 36S. W. 81, 82 (1896) ("[E]xcept in extraordinary cases, we willnot entertain jurisdiction as a court to grant original writsof habeas corpus").California, in contrast, has engrained original writs--bothat the appellate level and in the supreme court--into its normal collateral review process. As we have explained, andas the dissent recognizes, the only avenue for a prisoner tochallenge the denial of his application in the superior courtis to file a "new petition" in the appellate court. And tochallenge an appellate court denial, "[f]urther review [of ahabeas application] may be sought in [the supreme] court536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN225Cite as: 536 U. S. 214 (2002)Opinion of the Courteither by a new petition for habeas corpus or, preferably, bya petition for hearing." In re Reed, supra, at 918, n. 2, 663P. 2d, at 216, n. 2 (emphasis added). Unlike States such as,say, Idaho, see In re Barlow, supra, the original writ in California is not "extraordinary"--it is interchangeable with thepetition for hearing, with neither option bringing adverseconsequences to the petitioner. Consequently, we treat Cal-ifornia both assimilar to other States (in that its "originalwrit" system functions like the "appeal" systems of thoseother States), and differently from other States (in that therule we apply to original writs in California does not applyto original writs in other States, precisely because origi-nal writs in California function like appeals). And of course,as we have said, California remains free, through legisla-tive or judicial action, to adjust its "original writ" systemaccordingly. IVIt remains to ask whether Saffold delayed "unreasonably"in seeking California Supreme Court review. If so, his application would no longer have been "pending" during thisperiod. Saffold filed his petition for review in the CaliforniaSupreme Court 41/2 months after the California Court of Ap-peal issued its decision. The Ninth Circuit held that thisfiling was nonetheless timely. It based its conclusion pri-marily upon the fact that the California Supreme Courtwrote that it denied the petition "on the merits and for lackof diligence." These first three words, the Ninth Circuitsuggested, showed that the California Supreme Court couldnot have considered the petition too late, for, if so, why wouldit have considered the merits? 250 F. 3d, at 1267.There are many plausible answers to this question. Acourt will sometimes address the merits of a claim that itbelieves was presented in an untimely way: for instance,where the merits present no difficult issue; where the courtwants to give a reviewing court alternative grounds for deci536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN226 CAREY v. SAFFOLDOpinion of the Courtsion; or where the court wishes to show a prisoner (who maynot have a lawyer) that it was not merely a procedural technicality that precluded him from obtaining relief. Given thevariety of reasons why the California Supreme Court mayhave included the words "on the merits," those words cannotby themselves indicate that the petition was timely. Andthe Ninth Circuit's apparent willingness to take such wordsas an absolute bellwether risks the tolling of the federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisonerfailed to seek timely review in the state appellate courts.See, e. g., Welch v. Newland, 267 F. 3d 1013 (CA9 2001) (finding limitations period tolled during 4-year gap). The NinthCircuit's rule consequently threatens to undermine the statutory purpose of encouraging prompt filings in federal courtin order to protect the federal system from being forced tohear stale claims. See Duncan, 533 U. S., at 179.If the California Supreme Court had clearly ruled that Saffold's 41/2-month delay was "unreasonable," that would be theend of the matter, regardless of whether it also addressedthe merits of the claim, or whether its timeliness ruling was"entangled" with the merits. 250 F. 3d, at 1267. We cannotsay in this case, however, that the Ninth Circuit was wrongin its ultimate conclusion. Saffold argues that special circumstances were present here: He was not notified of theCourt of Appeal's decision for several months, and he filedwithin days after receiving notification. And he contends itis more likely that the phrase "lack of diligence" referred tothe delay between the date his conviction became final andthe date he first sought state postconviction relief--a matterirrelevant to the question whether his application was "pending" during the 41/2-month interval. We leave it to theCourt of Appeals to evaluate these and any other relevantconsiderations in the first instance. We also leave to theCourt of Appeals the decision whether it would be appropriate to certify a question to the California Supreme Court536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN227Cite as: 536 U.
