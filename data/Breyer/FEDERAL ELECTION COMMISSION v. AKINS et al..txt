The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has determinedthat the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)is not a "political committee" as defined by the Federal Elec-tion Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA or Act), 86 Stat. 11,as amended, 2 U. S. C. $ 431(4), and, for that reason, theFEC has refused to require AIPAC to make disclosures regarding its membership, contributions, and expendituresthat FECA would otherwise require.

AKINSOpinion of the CourtCommission's determination in court, and we remand thiscase for further proceedings.IIn light of our disposition of this case, we believe it neces-sary to describe its procedural background in some detail.As commonly understood, the FECA seeks to remedy anyactual or perceived corruption of the political process in several important ways. The Act imposes limits upon theamounts that individuals, corporations, "political committees" (including political action committees), and politicalparties can contribute to a candidate for federal political office. $$ 441a(a), 441a(b), 441b. The Act also imposes limitson the amount these individuals or entities can spend in coordination with a candidate. (It treats these expendituresas "contributions to" a candidate for purposes of the Act.)$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). As originally written, the Act set limitsupon the total amount that a candidate could spend of hisown money, and upon the amounts that other individuals,corporations, and "political committees" could spend independent of a candidate--though the Court found that cer-tain of these last-mentioned limitations violated the FirstAmendment. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 39-59 (1976)(per curiam); Federal Election Comm'n v. National Con-servative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 497 (1985);cf. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Fed-eral Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 613-619 (1996) (opinionof Breyer, J.).This case concerns requirements in the Act that extendbeyond these better-known contribution and expenditurelimitations. In particular, the Act imposes extensive recordkeeping and disclosure requirements upon groups thatfall within the Act's definition of a "political committee."Those groups must register with the FEC, appoint a treas-urer, keep names and addresses of contributors, track theamount and purpose of disbursements, and file complex FEC524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN15Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtreports that include lists of donors giving in excess of $200per year (often, these donors may be the group's members),contributions, expenditures, and any other disbursementsirrespective of their purposes. $$ 432-434.The Act's use of the word "political committee" calls tomind the term "political action committee," or "PAC," a termthat normally refers to organizations that corporations ortrade unions might establish for the purpose of making con-tributions or expenditures that the Act would otherwise prohibit. See $$ 431(4)(B), 441b. But, in fact, the Act's term"political committee" has a much broader scope. The Actstates that a "political committee" includes "any committee,club, association or other group of persons which receives"more than $1,000 in "contributions" or "which makes" morethan $1,000 in "expenditures" in any given year. $ 431(4)(A)(emphasis added).This broad definition, however, is less universally encompassing than at first it may seem, for later definitionalsubsections limit its scope. The Act defines the key terms"contribution" and "expenditure" as covering only thosecontributions and expenditures that are made "for thepurpose of influencing any election for Federal office."$$ 431(8)(A)(i), (9)(A)(i). Moreover, the Act sets forth detailed categories of disbursements, loans, and assistancein-kind that do not count as a "contribution" or an "expenditure," even when made for election-related purposes.$$ 431(8)(B), (9)(B). In particular, assistance given to help acandidate will not count toward the $1,000 "expenditure"ceiling that qualifies an organization as a "political committee" if it takes the form of a "communication" by an organization "to its members"--as long as the organization at issueis a "membership organization or corporation" and it is not"organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination . . . or electio[n] of any individual." $ 431(9)(B)(iii).This case arises out of an effort by respondents, a groupof voters with views often opposed to those of AIPAC, to524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN16 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Courtpersuade the FEC to treat AIPAC as a "political committee."Respondents filed a complaint with the FEC, stating thatAIPAC had made more than $1,000 in qualifying "expenditures" per year, and thereby became a "political committee."1 Record, Exh. B, p. 4. They added that AIPAC had violated the FEC provisions requiring "political committee[s]"to register and to make public the information about members, contributions, and expenditures to which we have justreferred. Id., at 2, 9-17. Respondents also claimed thatAIPAC had violated $ 441b of FECA, which prohibits corporate campaign "contribution[s]" and "expenditure[s]." Id.,at 2, 16-17. They asked the FEC to find that AIPAC hadviolated the Act, and, among other things, to order AIPACto make public the information that FECA demands of a "political committee." Id., at 33-34.AIPAC asked the FEC to dismiss the complaint. AIPACdescribed itself as an issue-oriented organization that seeksto maintain friendship and promote goodwill between theUnited States and Israel. App. 120; see also Brief forAIPAC as Amicus Curiae (AIPAC Brief) 1, 3. AIPAC conceded that it lobbies elected officials and disseminates information about candidates for public office. App. 43, 120; seealso AIPAC Brief 6. But in responding to the $ 441b charge,AIPAC denied that it had made the kinds of "expenditures"that matter for FECA purposes (i. e., the kinds of electionrelated expenditures that corporations cannot make, andwhich count as the kind of expenditures that, when theyexceed $1,000, qualify a group as a "political committee").To put the matter more specifically: AIPAC focused on certain "expenditures" that respondents had claimed were election related, such as the costs of meetings with candidates,the introduction of AIPAC members to candidates, and thedistribution of candidate position papers. AIPAC said thatits spending on such activities, even if election related, fellwithin a relevant exception. They amounted, said AIPAC,524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN17Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtto communications by a membership organization with itsmembers, App. 164-166, which the Act exempts from itsdefinition of "expenditures," $ 431(9)(B)(iii). In AIPAC'sview, these communications therefore did not violate $ 441b'scorporate expenditure prohibition. 2 Record, Doc. No. 19,pp. 2-6. (And, if AIPAC was right, those expenditureswould not count toward the $1,000 ceiling on "expenditures"that might transform an ordinary issue-related group into a"political committee." $ 431(4).)The FEC's General Counsel concluded that, between 1983and 1988, AIPAC had indeed funded communications of thesort described. The General Counsel said that those expenditures were campaign related, in that they amounted toadvocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.App. 106-108. He added that these expenditures were"likely to have crossed the $1,000 threshold." Id., at 146.At the same time, the FEC closed the door to AIPAC's invocation of the "communications" exception. The FEC saidthat, although it was a "close question," these expenditureswere not membership communications, because that exception applies to a membership organization's communicationswith its members, and most of the persons who belonged toAIPAC did not qualify as "members" for purposes of the Act.App. to Pet. for Cert. 97a-98a; see also App. 170-173. Still,given the closeness of the issue, the FEC exercised its discretion and decided not to proceed further with respect tothe claimed "corporate contribution" violation. App. to Pet.for Cert. 98a.The FEC's determination that many of the persons whobelonged to AIPAC were not "members" effectively foreclosed any claim that AIPAC's communications did not countas "expenditures" for purposes of determining whetherit was a "political committee." Since AIPAC's activitiesfell outside the "membership communications" exception,AIPAC could not invoke that exception as a way of escaping524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN18 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Courtthe scope of the Act's term "political committee" and theAct's disclosure provisions, which that definition triggers.The FEC nonetheless held that AIPAC was not subjectto the disclosure requirements, but for a different reason.In the FEC's view, the Act's definition of "political com-mittee" includes only those organizations that have as a"major purpose" the nomination or election of candidates.Cf.Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 79. AIPAC, it added,was fundamentally an issue-oriented lobbying organization,not a campaign-related organization, and hence AIPAC felloutside the definition of a "political committee" regardless.App. 146. The FEC consequently dismissed respondents'complaint.Respondents filed a petition in Federal District Courtseeking review of the FEC's determination dismissing theircomplaint. See $$ 437g(a)(8)(A), 437g(a)(8)(C). The District Court granted summary judgment for the FEC, and adivided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 66 F. 3d348 (CADC 1995). The en banc Court of Appeals reversed,however, on the ground that the FEC's "major purpose" testimproperly interpreted the Act's definition of a "politicalcommittee." 101 F. 3d 731 (CADC 1997). We granted theFEC's petition for certiorari, which contained the followingtwo questions:"1. Whether respondents had standing to challenge theFederal Election Commission's decision not to bring anenforcement action in this case."2. Whether an organization that spends more than$1,000 on contributions or coordinated expenditures in acalendar year, but is neither controlled by a candidatenor has its major purpose the nomination or election ofcandidates, is a `political committee' within the meaningof the [Act]." Brief for Petitioner I.We shall answer the first of these questions, but not thesecond.524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN19Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Solicitor General argues that respondents lack stand-ing to challenge the FEC's decision not to proceed againstAIPAC. He claims that they have failed to satisfy the "pru-dential" standing requirements upon which this Court hasinsisted. See, e. g., National Credit Union Admin. v. FirstNat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 488 (1998) (NCUA);Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153 (1970) (Data Processing). Headds that respondents have not shown that they "suffe[r] injury in fact," that their injury is "fairly traceable" to theFEC's decision, or that a judicial decision in their favorwould "redres[s]" the injury. E. g., Bennett v. Spear, 520U. S. 154, 162 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted);Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992).In his view, respondents' District Court petition consequently failed to meet Article III's demand for a "case" or"controversy."We do not agree with the FEC's "prudential standing"claim. Congress has specifically provided in FECA that"[a]ny person who believes a violation of this Act . . . hasoccurred, may file a complaint with the Commission."$ 437g(a)(1). It has added that "[a]ny party aggrieved by anorder of the Commission dismissing a complaint filed by suchparty . . . may file a petition" in district court seeking reviewof that dismissal. $ 437g(a)(8)(A). History associates theword "aggrieved" with a congressional intent to cast thestanding net broadly--beyond the common-law interests andsubstantive statutory rights upon which "prudential" stand-ing traditionally rested.Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v.FCC, 316 U. S. 4 (1942); FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Sta-tion, 309 U. S. 470 (1940); Office of Communication of theUnited Church of Christ v. FCC, 359 F. 2d 994 (CADC 1966)(Burger, J.); Associated Industries of New York State v.Ickes, 134 F. 2d 694 (CA2 1943) (Frank, J.). Cf. Administra-tive Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (stating that those "suf524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN20 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Courtfering legal wrong" or "adversely affected or aggrieved . . .within the meaning of a relevant statute" may seek judicialreview of agency action).Moreover, prudential standing is satisfied when the injuryasserted by a plaintiff " `arguably [falls] within the zone ofinterests to be protected or regulated by the statute . . . inquestion.' "NCUA, supra, at 488 (quoting Data Processing,supra, at 153). The injury of which respondents complain--their failure to obtain relevant information--is injury of akind that FECA seeks to address. Buckley, supra, at 66-67 ("political committees" must disclose contributors anddisbursements to help voters understand who provideswhich candidates with financial support). We have foundnothing in the Act that suggests Congress intended to exclude voters from the benefits of these provisions, or otherwise to restrict standing, say, to political parties, candidates,or their committees.Given the language of the statute and the nature of theinjury, we conclude that Congress, intending to protect voters such as respondents from suffering the kind of injuryhere at issue, intended to authorize this kind of suit. Consequently, respondents satisfy "prudential" standing requirements. Cf. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 820, n. 3 (1997)(explicit grant of authority to bring suit "eliminates any prudential standing limitations and significantly lessens the riskof unwanted conflict with the Legislative Branch").Nor do we agree with the FEC or the dissent that Congress lacks the constitutional power to authorize federalcourts to adjudicate this lawsuit. Article III, of course, limits Congress' grant of judicial power to "cases" or "controversies." That limitation means that respondents must show,among other things, an "injury in fact"--a requirement thathelps assure that courts will not "pass upon . . . abstract,intellectual problems," but adjudicate "concrete, living contest[s] between adversaries." Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S.433, 460 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); see also Bennett,524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 167; Lujan, supra, at 560-561. In our view, re-spondents here have suffered a genuine "injury in fact."The "injury in fact" that respondents have suffered con-sists of their inability to obtain information--lists of AIPACdonors (who are, according to AIPAC, its members), andcampaign-related contributions and expenditures--that, onrespondents' view of the law, the statute requires thatAIPAC make public. There is no reason to doubt their claimthat the information would help them (and others to whomthey would communicate it) to evaluate candidates for publicoffice, especially candidates who received assistance fromAIPAC, and to evaluate the role that AIPAC's financial assistance might play in a specific election. Respondents' injury consequently seems concrete and particular. Indeed,this Court has previously held that a plaintiff suffers an "injury in fact" when the plaintiff fails to obtain informationwhich must be publicly disclosed pursuant to a statute.Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 449(1989) (failure to obtain information subject to disclosureunder Federal Advisory Committee Act "constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue"). See alsoHavens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 373-374(1982) (deprivation of information about housing availabilityconstitutes "specific injury" permitting standing).The dissent refers to United States v. Richardson, 418U. S. 166 (1974), a case in which a plaintiff sought information(details of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) expenditures)to which, he said, the Constitution's Accounts Clause, Art. I,$ 9, cl. 7, entitled him. The Court held that the plaintiffthere lacked Article III standing. 418 U. S., at 179-180.The dissent says that Richardson and this case are "indistinguishable." Post, at 34. But as the parties' briefs suggest--for they do not mention Richardson--that case doesnot control the outcome here.Richardson's plaintiff claimed that a statute permittingthe CIA to keep its expenditures nonpublic violated the Ac524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Courtcounts Clause, which requires that "a regular Statement andAccount of the Receipts and Expenditures of all publicMoney shall be published from time to time." 418 U. S., at167-169. The Court held that the plaintiff lacked standingbecause there was "no `logical nexus' between the [plaintiff 's]asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of theCongress to require the Executive to supply a more detailedreport of the [CIA's] expenditures." Id., at 175; see also id.,at 174 (quotingFlast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 102 (1968), forthe proposition that in "taxpayer standing" cases, theremust be " `a logical nexus between the status asserted andthe claim sought to be adjudicated' ").In this case, however, the "logical nexus" inquiry is notrelevant. Here, there is no constitutional provision requiring the demonstration of the "nexus" the Court believedmust be shown in Richardson and Flast. Rather, there is astatute which, as we previously pointed out, supra, at 19-20,does seek to protect individuals such as respondents fromthe kind of harm they say they have suffered, i. e., failing toreceive particular information about campaign-related activities. Cf. Richardson, 418 U. S., at 178, n. 11.The fact that the Court in Richardson focused upon taxpayer standing, id., at 171-178, not voter standing, placesthat case at still a greater distance from the case before us.We are not suggesting, as the dissent implies, post, at 32-34,that Richardson would have come out differently if only theplaintiff had asserted his standing to sue as a voter, ratherthan as a taxpayer. Faced with such an assertion, the Richardson Court would simply have had to consider whether"the Framers . . . ever imagined that general directives [ofthe Constitution] . . . would be subject to enforcement by anindividual citizen." 418 U. S., at 178, n. 11 (emphasis added).But since that answer (like the answer to whether there wastaxpayer standing in Richardson) would have rested in significant part upon the Court's view of the Accounts Clause,it still would not control our answer in this case. All this is524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN23Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtto say that the legal logic which critically determined Richardson's outcome is beside the point here.The FEC's strongest argument is its contention that thislawsuit involves only a "generalized grievance." (Indeed, ifRichardson is relevant at all, it is because of its broad discussion of this matter, see id., at 176-178, not its basic ration-ale.) The FEC points out that respondents' asserted harm(their failure to obtain information) is one which is " `sharedin substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.' " Brief for Petitioner 28 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422U. S. 490, 499 (1975)). This Court, the FEC adds, has oftensaid that "generalized grievance[s]" are not the kinds ofharms that confer standing. Brief for Petitioner 28; see alsoLujan, 504 U. S., at 573-574; Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.737, 755-756 (1984); Valley Forge Christian College v.Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,454 U. S. 464, 475-479 (1982); Richardson, supra, at 176-178;Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923); Ex parte Levitt, 302 U. S. 633,634 (1937) (per curiam). Whether styled as a constitutionalor prudential limit on standing, the Court has sometimesdetermined that where large numbers of Americans sufferalike, the political process, rather than the judicial process,may provide the more appropriate remedy for a widelyshared grievance. Warth, supra, at 500; Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 222 (1974);Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179; id., at 188-189 (Powell, J., concurring); see also Flast, supra, at 131 (Harlan, J., dissenting).The kind of judicial language to which the FEC points,however, invariably appears in cases where the harm at issueis not only widely shared, but is also of an abstract and indefinite nature--for example, harm to the "common concernfor obedience to law." L. Singer & Sons v. Union PacificR. Co., 311 U. S. 295, 303 (1940); see also Allen, supra, at 754;Schlesinger, supra, at 217. Cf. Lujan, supra, at 572-578(injury to interest in seeing that certain procedures are fol524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN24 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Courtlowed not normally sufficient by itself to confer standing);Frothingham, supra, at 488 (party may not merely assertthat "he suffers in some indefinite way in common with peo-ple generally");Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113,125 (1940) (plaintiffs lack standing because they have failedto show injury to "a particular right of their own, as distin-guished from the public's interest in the administration ofthe law"). The abstract nature of the harm--for example,injury to the interest in seeing that the law is obeyed--deprives the case of the concrete specificity that characterizedthose controversies which were "the traditional concern ofthe courts at Westminster," Coleman, 307 U. S., at 460(Frankfurter, J., dissenting); and which today prevents aplaintiff from obtaining what would, in effect, amount to anadvisory opinion. Cf. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300U. S. 227, 240-241 (1937).Often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact thatit is widely shared go hand in hand. But their association isnot invariable, and where a harm is concrete, though widelyshared, the Court has found "injury in fact." See PublicCitizen, 491 U. S., at 449-450 ("The fact that other citizensor groups of citizens might make the same complaint afterunsuccessfully demanding disclosure . . . does not lessen[their] asserted injury"). Thus the fact that a political forummay be more readily available where an injury is widelyshared (while counseling against, say, interpreting a statuteas conferring standing) does not, by itself, automatically disqualify an interest for Article III purposes. Such an interest, where sufficiently concrete, may count as an "injury infact." This conclusion seems particularly obvious where (touse a hypothetical example) large numbers of individuals suffer the same common-law injury (say, a widespread masstort), or where large numbers of voters suffer interferencewith voting rights conferred by law. Cf. Lujan, supra, at572; Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 905 (1996). We concludethat, similarly, the informational injury at issue here, di524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN25Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtrectly related to voting, the most basic of political rights, issufficiently concrete and specific such that the fact that it iswidely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutionalpower to authorize its vindication in the federal courts.Respondents have also satisfied the remaining two constitutional standing requirements. The harm asserted is"fairly traceable" to the FEC's decision about which respondents complain. Of course, as the FEC points out, Brief forPetitioner 29-31, it is possible that even had the FEC agreedwith respondents' view of the law, it would still have decidedin the exercise of its discretion not to require AIPAC toproduce the information. Cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a (deciding to exercise prosecutorial discretion, see Heckler v.Chaney, 470 U. S. 821 (1985), and "take no further action" on$ 441b allegation against AIPAC). But that fact does notdestroy Article III "causation," for we cannot know that theFEC would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion in thisway. Agencies often have discretion about whether or notto take a particular action. Yet those adversely affected bya discretionary agency decision generally have standing tocomplain that the agency based its decision upon an improperlegal ground. See, e. g., Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967) (discussing presumption of reviewability of agency action); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park,Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 410 (1971). If a reviewing courtagrees that the agency misinterpreted the law, it will setaside the agency's action and remand the case--even thoughthe agency (like a new jury after a mistrial) might later, inthe exercise of its lawful discretion, reach the same resultfor a different reason. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80(1943). Thus respondents' "injury in fact" is "fairly traceable" to the FEC's decision not to issue its complaint, eventhough the FEC might reach the same result exercising itsdiscretionary powers lawfully. For similar reasons, thecourts in this case can "redress" respondents' "injury infact."524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN26 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the CourtFinally, the FEC argues that we should deny respondentsstanding because this case involves an agency's decision notto undertake an enforcement action--an area generally notsubject to judicial review. Brief for Petitioner 23, 29. InHeckler, this Court noted that agency enforcement decisions"ha[ve] traditionally been `committed to agency discretion,' "and concluded that Congress did not intend to alter that tradition in enacting the APA. 470 U. S., at 832; cf. 5 U. S. C.$ 701(a) (courts will not review agency actions where "statutes preclude judicial review," or where the "agency actionis committed to agency discretion by law"). We deal herewith a statute that explicitly indicates the contrary.In sum, respondents, as voters, have satisfied both prudential and constitutional standing requirements. Theymay bring this petition for a declaration that the FEC'sdismissal of their complaint was unlawful. See 2 U. S. C.$ 437g(a)(8)(A).IIIThe second question presented in the FEC's petition forcertiorari is whether an organization that otherwise satisfiesthe Act's definition of a "political committee," and thus issubject to its disclosure requirements, nonetheless falls outside that definition because "its major purpose" is not "thenomination or election of candidates." The question arisesbecause this Court, in Buckley, said:"To fulfill the purposes of the Act [the term `politicalcommittee'] need only encompass organizations that areunder the control of a candidate or the major purpose ofwhich is the nomination or election of a candidate." 424U. S., at 79.The Court reiterated in Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 252, n. 6 (1986):"[A]n entity subject to regulation as a `political committee' under the Act is one that is either `under the control524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Opinion of the Courtof a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomi-nation or election of a candidate.' "The FEC here interpreted this language as narrowing thescope of the statutory term "political committee," whereverapplied. And, as we have said, the FEC's General Coun-sel found that AIPAC fell outside that definition becausethe nomination or election of a candidate was not AIPAC's"major purpose." App. 146.The en banc Court of Appeals disagreed with the FEC.It read this Court's narrowing construction of the term "political committee" as turning on the First Amendment prob-lems presented by regulation of "independent expenditures"(i. e., "an expenditure by a person expressly advocating theelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate which ismade without cooperation or consultation with any candi-date," $ 431(17)). 101 F. 3d, at 741. The Court of Appealsconcluded that the language in this Court's prior decisionsnarrowing the definition of "political committee" did notapply where the special First Amendment "independentexpenditure" problem did not exist. Id., at 742-743.The Solicitor General argues that this Court's narrowingdefinition of "political committee" applies not simply in thecontext of independent expenditures, but across the board.We cannot squarely address that matter, however, becauseof the unusual and complex circumstances in which this casearises. As we previously mentioned,supra, at 16-17, theFEC considered a related question, namely, whether AIPACwas exempt from $ 441b's prohibition of corporate campaignexpenditures, on the grounds that the so-called "expenditures" involved only AIPAC's communications with its mem-bers. The FEC held that the statute's exception to the "expenditure" definition for communications by a "membershiporganization" did not apply because many of the persons whobelonged to AIPAC were not "members" as defined by FECregulation. The FEC acknowledged, however, that this wasa "close question." App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a; see also App.524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN28 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINSOpinion of the Court144-146, 170-171. In particular, the FEC thought thatmany of the persons who belonged to AIPAC lacked sufficient control of the organization's policies to qualify as "mem-bers" for purposes of the Act.A few months later, however, the Court of Appeals overturned the FEC's regulations defining "members," in partbecause that court thought the regulations defined membership organizations too narrowly in light of an organiza-tion's "First Amendment right to communicate with its`members.' " Chamber of Commerce v. Federal ElectionComm'n, 69 F. 3d 600, 605 (CADC 1995). The FEC hassubsequently issued proposed rules redefining "members."Under these rules, it is quite possible that many of the persons who belong to AIPAC would be considered "members."If so, the communications here at issue apparently would notcount as the kind of "expenditures" that can turn an organization into a "political committee," and AIPAC would falloutside the definition for that reason, rather than because ofthe "major purpose" test. 62 Fed. Reg. 66832 (1997) (proposed 11 CFR pts. 100 and 114).The consequence for our consideration of Question Twonow is that the FEC's new rules defining "membership organization" could significantly affect the interpretive issue presented by this question. If the Court of Appeals is right insaying that this Court's narrowing interpretation of "political committee" in Buckley reflected First Amendment concerns, 101 F. 3d, at 741, then whether the "membership communications" exception is interpreted broadly or narrowlycould affect our evaluation of the Court of Appeals' claimthat there is no constitutionally driven need to apply Buckley's narrowing interpretation in this context. The scope ofthe "membership communications" exception could also affect our evaluation of the Solicitor General's related argument that First Amendment concerns (reflected in Buckley'snarrowing interpretation) are present whenever the Act requires disclosure. In any event, it is difficult to decide the524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN29Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingbasic issue that Question Two presents without consideringthe special communicative nature of the "expenditures" hereat issue, cf. United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 121 (1948)(describing relation between membership communicationsand constitutionally protected rights of association). And, aconsidered determination of the scope of the statutory ex-emption that Congress enacted to address membership communications would helpfully inform our consideration of the"major purpose" test.The upshot, in our view, is that we should permit the FECto address, in the first instance, the issue presented by Question Two. We can thereby take advantage of the relevantagency's expertise, by allowing it to develop a more preciserule that may dispose of this case, or at a minimum, will aidthe Court in reaching a more informed conclusion. In ourview, the FEC should proceed to determine whether or notAIPAC's expenditures qualify as "membership communications," and thereby fall outside the scope of "expenditures"that could qualify it as a "political committee." If the FECdecides that despite its new rules, the communications heredo not qualify for this exception, then the lower courts, inreconsidering respondents' arguments, can still evaluate thesignificance of the communicative context in which the casearises. If, on the other hand, the FEC decides that AIPAC'sactivities fall within the "membership communications" exception, the matter will become moot.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
