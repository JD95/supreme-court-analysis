The federal Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA or Act) assimilates into federal law, and thereby makes applicable on fed-eral enclaves such as Army bases, certain criminal laws ofthe State in which the enclave is located. It says:"Whoever within or upon any [federal enclave] is guiltyof any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishableif committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of theState . . . in which such place is situated, . . . shall beguilty of a like offense and subject to like punishment."18 U. S. C. $ 13(a).The question in this case is whether the ACA makes applicable on a federal Army base located in Louisiana a statefirst-degree murder statute that defines first-degree murderto include the "killing of a human being . . . [w]hen the offender has the specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodilyharm upon a victim under the age of twelve . . . ." La. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 14:30(A)(5) (West 1986 and Supp. 1997).We hold that the ACA does not make the state provisionpart of federal law. A federal murder statute, 18 U. S. C.$ 1111, therefore governs the crime at issue--the killing ofa 4-year-old child "with malice aforethought" but without"premeditation." Under that statute this crime is seconddegree, not first-degree, murder.IA federal grand jury indictment charged that petitioner,Debra Faye Lewis, and her husband James Lewis, beat andkilled James' 4-year-old daughter while all three lived atFort Polk, a federal Army base in Louisiana. Relying onthe ACA, the indictment charged a violation of Louisiana'sfirst-degree murder statute. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30(West 1986 and Supp. 1993). Upon her conviction, the Dis523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN159Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the Courttrict Court sentenced Debra Lewis to life imprisonmentwithout parole. See $ 14:30(C) (West 1986).On appeal the Fifth Circuit held that Louisiana's stat-ute did not apply at Fort Polk. 92 F. 3d 1371 (1996). Itnoted that the Act made state criminal statutes applicableon federal enclaves only where the wrongful " `act or omission' " was " `not made punishable by any enactment of Con-gress.' "Id., at 1373-1374 (citing 18 U. S. C. $ 13). BecauseCongress made Lewis' acts "punishable" as federal seconddegree murder, and the federal and state laws were directedat roughly the same sort of conduct, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the ACA did not permit the application of Loui-siana's first-degree murder statute to petitioner's acts. 92F. 3d, at 1375-1377. The court nonetheless affirmed Lewis'conviction on the ground that in convicting her of the statecharge the jury had necessarily found all of the requisiteelements of federal second-degree murder.Id., at 1378;cf. Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S. 292, 305-306 (1996).And it affirmed the sentence on the ground that it was nogreater than the maximum sentence (life) permitted by thefederal second-degree murder statute. 92 F. 3d, at 1379-1380.We granted certiorari primarily to consider the FifthCircuit's ACA determination. We conclude that the holding was correct, though we also believe that Lewis is enti-tled to resentencing on the federal second-degree murderconviction. IIThe ACA applies state law to a defendant's acts or omis-sions that are "not made punishable byany enactment ofCongress." 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added). The basicquestion before us concerns the meaning of the italicizedphrase. These words say that the ACA doesnot assimilatea state statute if the defendant's "act" or "omission" is punished by "any [federal] enactment." If the words are takenliterally, Louisiana's law could not possibly apply to Lewis,523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN160 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfor there are several federal "enactments" that make Lewis'acts punishable, for example, the federal (second-degree)murder statute, $ 1111, and the federal assault law, $ 113.We agree with the Government, however, that this is not asensible interpretation of this language, since a literal reading of the words "any enactment" would dramatically sepa-rate the statute from its intended purpose.The ACA's basic purpose is one of borrowing state law tofill gaps in the federal criminal law that applies on federalenclaves. See Williams v. United States, 327 U. S. 711, 718-719 (1946) (ACA exists "to fill in gaps" in federal law whereCongress has not "define[d] the missing offenses"); UnitedStates v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 289 (1958) (ACA represents congressional decision of "adopting for otherwise undefined offenses the policy of general conformity to local law");United States v. Press Publishing Co., 219 U. S. 1, 9-10(1911) (state laws apply to crimes "which were not previouslyprovided for by a law of the United States"); Franklin v.United States, 216 U. S. 559, 568 (1910) (assimilation occurswhere state laws "not displaced by specific laws enacted byCongress").In the 1820's, when the ACA began its life, federal statutory law punished only a few crimes committed on federalenclaves, such as murder and manslaughter. See 1 Stat.113. The federal courts lacked the power to supplementthese few statutory crimes through the use of the commonlaw. See United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).Consequently James Buchanan, then a Congressman, couldpoint out to his fellow House Members a "palpable defect inour system," namely, that "a great variety of actions, towhich a high degree of moral guilt is attached, and whichare punished . . . at the common law, and by every State . . .may be committed with impunity" on federal enclaves. 40Annals of Cong. 930 (1823). Daniel Webster sought to curethis palpable defect by introducing a bill that both increasedthe number of federal crimes and also made "the residue"523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN161Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcriminal, see 1 Cong. Deb. 338 (1825), by assimilating statelaw where federal statutes did not provide for the "punishment" of an "offence." 4 Stat. 115. This law, with onlya few changes, has become today's ACA. SeeWilliams,supra, at 719-723 (describing history of ACA).Two features of the Act indicate a congressional intent toconfine the scope of the words "any enactment" more narrowly than (and hence extend the Act's reach beyond what)a literal reading might suggest. First, a literal interpretation of the words "any enactment" would leave federal crimi-nal enclave law subject to gaps of the very kind the Act wasdesigned to fill. The Act would be unable to assimilate evena highly specific state law aimed directly at a serious, narrowly defined evil, if the language of any federal statute,however broad and however clearly aimed at a different kindof harm, were to cover the defendant's act. Were there onlya state, and no federal, law against murder, for example, afederal prohibition of assault could prevent the state statutefrom filling the obvious resulting gap.At the same time, prior to its modern amendment theACA's language more clearly set limits upon the scope ofthe word "any." The original version of the ACA said thatassimilation of a relevant state law was proper when "anyoffence shall be committed . . . the punishment of which offence is not specially provided for by any law of the UnitedStates." 4 Stat. 115 (emphasis added); see also 30 Stat. 717(later reenactment also using "offense"). The word "offense" avoided the purpose-thwarting interpretation of theAct discussed above, for it limited the relevant federal "enactment" to an enactment that punished offenses of the samekind as those punished by state law. Presumably, a federalassault statute would not have provided punishment for the"offense" that state murder law condemned. Congresschanged the Act's language in 1909, removing the word "offense" and inserting the words "act or thing," 35 Stat. 1145,which later became the current "act or omission." But Con523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN162 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtgress did so for reasons irrelevant here, see H. R. Rep. No. 2,60th Cong., 1st Sess., 25 (1908) (stating that, technicallyspeaking, conduct otherwise not forbidden by law was not an"offense"), and did not intend to alter the basic meaning ofthe Act. See Williams, supra, at 722-723.For these or similar reasons, many lower courts haveinterpreted the words "any enactment" more narrowly thana literal reading might suggest. And they have appliedthe Act to assimilate state statutes in circumstances theythought roughly similar to those suggested by our assault/murder example above. See,e. g., United States v. Kaufman, 862 F. 2d 236, 238 (CA9 1988) (existence of federal lawpunishing the carrying of a gun does not prevent assimilationof state law punishing threatening someone with a gun);Fields v. United States, 438 F. 2d 205, 207-208 (CA2 1971)(assimilation of state malicious shooting law proper despiteexistence of federal assault statute); United States v. Brown,608 F. 2d 551, 553-554 (CA5 1979) (child abuse different inkind from generic federal assault, and so state law could beassimilated). But see United States v. Chaussee, 536 F. 2d637, 644 (CA7 1976) (stating a more literal test). Like theGovernment, we conclude that Congress did not intend therelevant words--"any enactment"--to carry an absolutelyliteral meaning.On the other hand, we cannot accept the narrow interpretation of the relevant words (and the statute's consequently broader reach) that the Solicitor General seems tourge. Drawing on our language in Williams, supra, at717, some lower courts have said that the words "any enactment" refer only to federal enactments that make criminal the same "precise acts" as those made criminal by therelevant state law. See, e. g., United States v. Johnson, 967F. 2d 1431, 1436 (CA10 1992). The Government apparentlyinterprets this test to mean that, with limited exceptions,the ACA would assimilate a state law so long as that statelaw defines a crime in terms of at least one element that does523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN163Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnot appear in the relevant federal enactment. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 27 ("[I]n the great majority of cases the questionof whether the State law offense has been made punishableby an enactment of Congress can be resolved by asking, isthere a Federal statute that contains precisely the same essential elements as the State statute"). But this interpreta-tion of federal "enactments" is too narrow.The Government's view of the "precise acts" test--whichcomes close to a "precise elements" test--would have theACA assimilate state law even where there is no gap to fill.Suppose, for example, that state criminal law (but not federal criminal law) makes possession of a state bank charteran element of an offense it calls "bank robbery"; or supposethat state law makes purse snatching criminal under a statute that is indistinguishable from a comparable federal lawbut for a somewhat different definition of the word "purse."Where, one might ask, is the gap? As Congress has enactedmore and more federal statutes, including many that are applicable only to federal enclaves, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 113(assault); $ 1460 (possession with intent to sell obscene materials), such possibilities become more realistic. And to thatextent the Government's broad view of assimilation threatens not only to fill nonexistent gaps, but also to rewrite eachfederal enclave-related criminal law in 50 different ways, depending upon special, perhaps idiosyncratic, drafting circumstances in the different States. See Williams, 327 U. S., at718 (ACA may not be used to "enlarg[e] . . . modif[y] or repea[l] existing provisions of the Federal Code"). It wouldalso leave residents of federal enclaves randomly subject tothree sets of criminal laws (special federal territorial criminal law, general federal criminal law, and state criminal law)where their state counterparts would be subject only to thelatter two types.Nothing in the Act's language or in its purpose warrantsimposing such narrow limits upon the words "any enactment" and thereby so significantly broadening the statute's523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN164 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtreach. Nor does the use by this Court of the words "preciseacts" in the leading case in which this Court has applied theAct, Williams, 327 U. S., at 717, help the Government in thisrespect. InWilliams, the Court held that the ACA did notassimilate a State's "statutory rape" crime (with a cut-off ageof 18) both because federal adultery and fornication statutescovered the defendant's "precise acts," and because the policies underlying a similar federal statute (with a cutoff ageof 16) made clear there was no gap to fill.Id., at 724-725.The Court's opinion refers to both of these circumstances anddoes not decide whether the Act would, or would not, haveapplied in the absence of only one. We cannot find a convincing justification in language, purpose, or precedent forthe Government's interpretation. Hence, we conclude that,just as a literal interpretation would produce an ACA thatis too narrow, see supra, at 161-162, so the Government'sinterpretation would produce an ACA that is too broad.In our view, the ACA's language and its gap-filling purpose taken together indicate that a court must first ask thequestion that the ACA's language requires: Is the defendant's "act or omission . . . made punishable by any enactmentof Congress." 18 U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added). If theanswer to this question is "no," that will normally end thematter. The ACA presumably would assimilate the statute.If the answer to the question is "yes," however, the courtmust ask the further question whether the federal statutesthat apply to the "act or omission" preclude application ofthe state law in question, say, because its application wouldinterfere with the achievement of a federal policy, see Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., 321 U. S. 383, 389-390 (1944),because the state law would effectively rewrite an offensedefinition that Congress carefully considered, see Williams,327 U. S., at 718, or because federal statutes reveal an intentto occupy so much of a field as would exclude use of theparticular state statute at issue, see id., at 724 (no assimilation where Congress has "covered the field with uniform fed523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN165Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the Courteral legislation"). See also Franklin, 216 U. S., at 568 (as-similation proper only where state laws "not displaced byspecific laws enacted by Congress").There are too many different state and federal criminallaws, applicable in too many different kinds of circumstances,bearing too many different relations to other laws, tocommon-law tradition, and to each other, for a touchstone toprovide an automatic general answer to this second question.Still, it seems fairly obvious that the Act will not applywhere both state and federal statutes seek to punish approxi-mately the same wrongful behavior--where, for example,differences among elements of the crimes reflect jurisdictional, or other technical, considerations, or where differences amount only to those of name, definitional language, orpunishment. See, e. g., United States v. Adams, 502 F. Supp.21, 25 (SD Fla. 1980) (misdemeanor/felony difference did notjustify assimilation).The Act's basic purpose makes it similarly clear that assimilation may not rewrite distinctions among the forms ofcriminal behavior that Congress intended to create. Williams, supra, at 717-718 (nothing in the history or language of the ACA to indicate that once Congress has "defined a penal offense, it has authorized such definition tobe enlarged" by state law). Hence, ordinarily, there willbe no gap for the Act to fill where a set of federal enactments taken together make criminal a single form of wrongful behavior while distinguishing (say, in terms of seriousness) among what amount to different ways of committingthe same basic crime.At the same time, a substantial difference in the kind ofwrongful behavior covered (on the one hand by the statestatute, on the other, by federal enactments) will ordinarilyindicate a gap for a state statute to fill--unless Congress,through the comprehensiveness of its regulation, cf. Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 604-605(1991), or through language revealing a conflicting policy, see523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWilliams, supra, at 724-725, indicates to the contrary in aparticular case. See also Johnson v. Yellow Cab, supra, at389-390; Blackburn v. United States, 100 F. 3d 1426, 1435(CA9 1996). The primary question (we repeat) is one of legislative intent: Does applicable federal law indicate an intentto punish conduct such as the defendant's to the exclusion ofthe particular state statute at issue?IIIWe must now apply these principles to this case. The rel-evant federal murder statute--applicable only on federalenclaves--read as follows in 1993, the time of petitioner'scrime:"$ 1111. Murder"(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human beingwith malice aforethought. Every murder perpetratedby poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful,deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate,any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexualabuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effectthe death of any human being other than him who iskilled, is murder in the first degree."Any other murder is murder in the second degree."(b) Within the special maritime and territorial juris-diction of the United States,"Whoever is guilty of murder in the first degree, shallsuffer death unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto `without capital punishment', in which eventhe shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life;"Whoever is guilty of murder in the second degree, shallbe imprisoned for any term of years or for life." 18U. S. C. $ 1111 (1988 ed.).523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN167Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThis statute says that "murder in the first degree" shallbe punished by death or life imprisonment. It says that"murder in the second degree" shall be punished by impris-onment for "any term of years or for life." It defines firstdegree murder as a "willful, deliberate, malicious, and pre-meditated killing," and also adds certain kinds of felonymurder (i. e., murder occurring during the commission ofother crimes) and certain instances of transferred intent(i. e., D's killing of A, while intending to murder B). It de-fines second-degree murder as "[a]ny other murder."Louisiana's statute says the following:"A. First degree murder is the killing of a human being:"(1) When the offender has specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated kid-napping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated escape,aggravated arson, aggravated rape, forcible rape, aggra-vated burglary, armed robbery, drive-by shooting, firstdegree robbery, or simple robbery."(2) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm upon a fireman or peace officerengaged in the performance of his lawful duties;"(3) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or toinflict great bodily harm upon more than one person; or"(4) When the offender has specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm and has offered, has been of-fered, has given, or has received anything of value forthe killing."(5) When the offender has the specific intent to kill orto inflict great bodily harm upon a victim under the ageof twelve or sixty-five years of age or older."(6) When the offender has the specific intent to kill orto inflict great bodily harm while engaged in the distribution, exchange, sale, or purchase, or any attemptthereof, of a controlled dangerous substance listed in523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN168 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSchedules I, II, III, IV, or V of the Uniform ControlledDangerous Substances Law."(7) When the offender has specific intent to kill andis engaged in the activities prohibited by R. S.14:107.1(C)(1).. . . . ."C. Whoever commits the crime of first degree murdershall be punished by death or life imprisonment at hardlabor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspensionof sentence in accordance with the determination of thejury." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30 (West 1986 and Supp.1997) (emphasis added).This statute says that murder in the first degree shallbe punished by "death or life imprisonment" without parole.It defines first-degree murder as the "killing of a humanbeing" with a "specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodilyharm" where the "offender" is committing certain other felonies or has been paid for the crime or kills more than onevictim, or kills a fireman, a peace officer, someone over theage of 64, or someone under the age of 12. In this case, thejury found that the defendant killed a child under the ageof 12 with a "specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodilyharm" upon that child.In deciding whether the ACA assimilates Louisiana'slaw, we first ask whether the defendant's "act or omission"is "made punishable by any enactment of Congress." 18U. S. C. $ 13(a) (emphasis added); see supra, at 164. The answer to this question is "yes." An "enactment of Congress,"namely, $ 1111, makes the defendant's "act . . . punishable" assecond-degree murder. This answer is not conclusive, however, for reasons we have pointed out. Rather, we must aska second question. See supra, at 164-165. Does applicablefederal law indicate an intent to punish conduct such as thedefendant's to the exclusion of the particular state statuteat issue?523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN169Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe concede at the outset the Government's claim that thetwo statutes cover different forms of behavior. The federalsecond-degree murder statute covers a wide range of con-duct; the Louisiana first-degree murder provision focusesupon a narrower (and different) range of conduct. We alsoconcede that, other things being equal, this considerationargues in favor of assimilation. Yet other things are notequal; and other features of the federal statute convince usthat Congress has intended that the federal murder statutepreclude application of a first-degree murder statute such asLouisiana's to a killing on a federal enclave.The most obvious such feature is the detailed manner inwhich the federal murder statute is drafted. It purportsto make criminal a particular form of wrongful behavior,namely, "murder," which it defines as "the unlawful killingof a human being with malice aforethought." It covers allvariants of murder. It divides murderous behavior into twoparts: a specifically defined list of "first-degree" murders andall "other" murders, which it labels "second-degree." Thisfact, the way in which "first-degree" and "second-degree"provisions are linguistically interwoven; the fact that the"first-degree" list is detailed; and the fact that the list setsforth several circumstances at the same level of generalityas does Louisiana's statute, taken together, indicate thatCongress intended its statute to cover a particular field--namely, "unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought"--as an integrated whole. The complete coverageof the federal statute over all types of federal enclave murder is reinforced by the extreme breadth of the possible sentences, ranging all the way from any term of years, to death.There is no gap for Louisiana's statute to fill.Several other circumstances offer support for the conclusion that Congress' omissions from its "first-degree" murderlist reflect a considered legislative judgment. Congress, forexample, has recently focused directly several times upon thecontent of the "first-degree" list, subtracting certain speci523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN170 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfied circumstances or adding others. See Pub. L. 99-646,100 Stat. 3623 (substituting "aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse" for "rape"); Pub. L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2138 (adding"escape, murder, kidnaping, treason, espionage," and "sabotage" to first-degree list). By drawing the line between firstand second degree, Congress also has carefully decided justwhen it does, and when it does not, intend for murderto be punishable by death--a major way in which the Louisi-ana first-degree murder statute (which provides the deathpenalty) differs from the federal second-degree provision(which does not). 18 U. S. C. $ 1111(b); La. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 14:30(C) (West Supp. 1997). The death penalty is a matterthat typically draws specific congressional attention. See,e. g., Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of1994, Pub. L. 103-322, $ 60003, 108 Stat. 1968 (section entitled"Specific Offenses For Which [the] Death Penalty Is Authorized"). As this Court said in Williams, "[w]here offenseshave been specifically defined by Congress and the public hasbeen guided by such definitions for many years," it is unusualfor Congress through general legislation like the ACA "toamend such definitions or the punishments prescribed forsuch offenses, without making clear its intent to do so." 327U. S., at 718 (footnote omitted).Further, Congress when writing and amending the ACAhas referred to the conduct at issue here--murder--as anexample of a crime covered by, not as an example of a gapin, federal law. See H. R. Rep. No. 1584, 76th Cong., 3dSess., 1 (1940) ("Certain of the major crimes . . . such . . . asmurder" are "expressly defined" by Congress; assimilationof state law is proper as to "other offenses"); 1 Cong. Deb.338 (1825) (Daniel Webster explaining original assimilationprovision as a way to cover "the residue" of crimes not "provide[d] for" by Congress; at the time federal law containeda federal enclave murder provision, see 1 Stat. 113); seealso United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S., at 289, and n. 5(citing 18 U. S. C. $ 1111 for proposition that Congress has523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN171Cite as: 523 U. S. 155 (1998)Opinion of the Courtincreasingly "enact[ed] for the enclaves specific criminal stat-utes" and "to that extent, [has] excluded the state laws fromthat field").Finally, the federal criminal statute before us applies onlyon federal enclaves. $ 1111(b). Hence, there is a sense inwhich assimilation of Louisiana law would treat those livingon federal enclaves differently from those living elsewherein Louisiana, for it would subject them to two sets of "terri-torial" criminal laws in addition to the general federal criminal laws that apply nationwide. See supra, at 163. Givenall these considerations, it is perhaps not surprising that wehave been unable to find a single reported case in which afederal court has used the ACA to assimilate a state murderlaw to fill a supposed "gap" in the federal murder statute.The Government, arguing to the contrary, says that Louisiana's provision is a type of "child protection" statute, filling a "gap" in federal enclave-related criminal law due tothe fact that Congress left "child abuse," like much otherdomestic relations law, to the States. See Brief for UnitedStates 23, 29-30. The fact that Congress, when writingvarious criminal statutes, has focused directly upon "childprotection" weakens the force of this argument. See, e. g.,21 U. S. C. $$ 859(a)-(b) (person selling drugs to minors issubject to twice the maximum sentence as one who deals toadults, and repeat offenders who sell to children subjectto three times the normal maximum); 18 U. S. C. $ 1201(g)("special rule" for kidnaping offenses involving minors, withenhanced penalties in certain cases); $$ 2241(c) and 2243 (prohibiting sexual abuse of minors); $ 2251 (prohibiting sexual exploitation of children); $ 2251A (selling and buying ofchildren); $ 2258 (failure to report child abuse). And, without expressing any view on the merits of lower court casesthat have assimilated state child abuse statutes despite thepresence of a federal assault law, $ 113, see, e. g., UnitedStates v. Brown, 608 F. 2d, at 553-554; United States v.Fesler, 781 F. 2d 384, 390-391 (CA5 1986), we note that the523US1 Unit: $U38 [04-29-00 20:21:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN172 LEWIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfederal assault prohibition is less comprehensive than thefederal murder statute, and the relevant statutory relationships are less direct than those at issue here. We concludethat the consideration to which the Government points is notstrong enough to open a child-related "gap" in the compre-hensive effort to define murder on federal enclaves.For these reasons we agree with the Fifth Circuit thatfederal law does not assimilate the child victim provision ofLouisiana's first-degree murder statute.IVThe Fifth Circuit affirmed petitioner's conviction on theground that the jury, in convicting petitioner under theLouisiana statute, necessarily found all of the requisite ele-ments of the federal second-degree murder offense. 92 F.3d, at 1379; cf. Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S., at 305-306. Petitioner does not contest the legal correctness ofthis conclusion.Petitioner, however, does argue that the Fifth Circuitwas wrong to affirm her sentence (life imprisonment). Shepoints out that the federal second-degree murder statute, unlike Louisiana's first-degree murder statute, does not makea life sentence mandatory. See 18 U. S.
