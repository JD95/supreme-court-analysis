Subsection (a) of 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 defines a crime. It for-bids an alien who once was deported to return to the UnitedStates without special permission, and it authorizes a prisonterm of up to, but no more than, two years. Subsection(b)(2) of the same section authorizes a prison term of upto, but no more than, 20 years for "any alien described" insubsection (a), if the initial "deportation was subsequentto a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony."The question before us is whether this latter provision de-fines a separate crime or simply authorizes an enhanced penalty. If the former, i. e., if it constitutes a separate crime,then the Government must write an indictment that mentions the additional element, namely, a prior aggravated fel-ony conviction. If the latter,i. e., if the provision simplyauthorizes an enhanced sentence when an offender also hasan earlier conviction, then the indictment need not mentionthat fact, for the fact of an earlier conviction is not an element of the present crime.We conclude that the subsection is a penalty provision,which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence fora recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the*Stephen R. Sady and Barbara E.

S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the CourtGovernment to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlierconviction, in the indictment.IIn September 1995, a federal grand jury returned an in-dictment charging petitioner, Hugo Almendarez-Torres, withhaving been "found in the United States . . . after being de-ported" without the "permission and consent of the AttorneyGeneral" in "violation of . . . Section 1326." App. 3. In De-cember 1995, Almendarez-Torres entered a plea of guilty.At a hearing, before the District Court accepted his plea,Almendarez-Torres admitted that he had been deported, thathe had later unlawfully returned to the United States, andthat the earlier deportation had taken place "pursuant to"three earlier "convictions" for aggravated felonies. Id., at10-14.In March 1996, the District Court held a sentencing hear-ing. Almendarez-Torres pointed out that an indictmentmust set forth all the elements of a crime. See Hamling v.United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974). He added that hisindictment had not mentioned his earlier aggravated felonyconvictions. And he argued that, consequently, the courtcould not sentence him to more than two years imprison-ment, the maximum authorized for an offender without anearlier conviction. The District Court rejected this argu-ment. It found applicable a Sentencing Guideline range of77 to 96 months, see United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 2L1.2; ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table)(Nov. 1995) (USSG), and it imposed a sentence of 85 months'imprisonment. App. 17.On appeal the Fifth Circuit also rejected petitioner's argu-ment. 113 F. 3d 515 (1996). Like seven other Circuits, ithas held that subsection (b)(2) is a penalty provision thatsimply permits a sentencing judge to impose a higher sentence when the unlawfully returning alien also has a recordof prior convictions.

The Ninth Circuit, however, has reached theopposite conclusion. United States v. Gonzalez-Medina, 976F. 2d 570, 572 (1992) (subsection (b)(2) constitutes separatecrime). We granted certiorari to resolve this differenceamong the Circuits.IIAn indictment must set forth each element of the crimethat it charges. Hamling v. United States, supra, at 117.But it need not set forth factors relevant only to the sentenc-ing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime. Withinlimits, see McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 84-91(1986), the question of which factors are which is normally amatter for Congress. See Staples v. United States, 511 U. S.600, 604 (1994) (definition of a criminal offense entrusted tothe legislature, " `particularly in the case of federal crimes,which are solely creatures of statute' ") (quotingLiparota v.United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985)). We therefore lookto the statute before us and ask what Congress intended.Did it intend the factor that the statute mentions, the prioraggravated felony conviction, to help define a separatecrime? Or did it intend the presence of an earlier convictionas a sentencing factor, a factor that a sentencing court mightuse to increase punishment? In answering this question, welook to the statute's language, structure, subject matter, con-text, and history--factors that typically help courts determine a statute's objectives and thereby illuminate its text.523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN229Cite as: 523 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto the question presented--whether Congress intended subsection (b)(2) to set forth a sentencing factor or a separatecrime--is reasonably clear.At the outset, we note that the relevant statutory subjectmatter is recidivism. That subject matter--prior commission of a serious crime--is as typical a sentencing factor asone might imagine. See, e. g., USSG $$ 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov.1997) (requiring sentencing judge to consider an offender'sprior record in every case); 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h) (instructingCommission to write Guidelines that increase sentences dramatically for serious recidivists); 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e) (ArmedCareer Criminal Act of 1984) (imposing significantly highersentence for felon-in-possession violation by serious recidivists); 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A)-(D) (same for drug distribution); United States Sentencing Commission, 1996 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 35, 49 (for year endingSept. 30, 1996, 20.3% of all federal cases involved offenderswith substantial criminal records (criminal history categoriesIV-VI); 44.2% of drug cases involved offenders with priorconvictions). Perhaps reflecting this fact, the lower courtshave almost uniformly interpreted statutes (that authorizehigher sentences for recidivists) as setting forth sentencingfactors, not as creating new crimes (at least where the conduct, in the absence of the recidivism, is independently unlawful). E. g., United States v. McGatha, 891 F. 2d 1520,1525 (CA11 1990) (18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)); United States v.Arango-Montoya, 61 F. 3d 1331, 1339 (CA7 1995) (21 U. S. C.$ 841(b)); United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d 21, 25, and n. 6(CADC 1987). And we have found no statute that clearlymakes recidivism an offense element in such circumstances.But cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1) (prior felony conviction an element but conduct not otherwise unlawful).With recidivism as the subject matter in mind, we turn tothe statute's language. In essence, subsection (a) says that"any alien" once "deported," who reappears in the United523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN231Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the CourtStates without appropriate permission, shall be fined or "imprisoned not more than 2 years." Subsection (b) says that"any alien described in" subsection (a), "whose deportationwas subsequent to a conviction" for a minor, or for a major,crime, may be subject to a much longer prison term.The statute includes the words "subject to subsection (b)"at the beginning of subsection (a), and the words "[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)" at the beginning of subsection (b).If Congress intended subsection (b) to set forth substantivecrimes, in respect to which subsection (a) would define alesser included offense, see Blockburger v. United States, 284U. S. 299, 304 (1932), what are those words doing there?The dissent believes that the words mean that the substantive crime defined by "subsection (a) is inapplicable to analien covered by subsection (b)," post, at 264, hence thewords represent an effort to say that a defendant cannot bepunished for both substantive crimes. But that is not whatthe words say. Nor has Congress ever (to our knowledge)used these or similar words anywhere else in the federalcriminal code for such a purpose. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 113(aggravated and simple assault); $$ 1111, 1112 (murder andmanslaughter); $ 2113 (bank robbery and incidental crimes);$$ 2241, 2242 (aggravated and simple sexual abuse). Andthis should come as no surprise since, for at least 60 years,the federal courts have presumed that Congress does notintend for a defendant to be cumulatively punished for twocrimes where one crime is a lesser included offense of theother. See Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 691-693(1980); Blockburger, supra.If, however, Congress intended subsection (b) to provideadditional penalties, the mystery disappears. The words"subject to subsection (b)" and "[n]otwithstanding subsection(a)" then are neither obscure nor pointless. They say, without obscurity, that the crime set forth in subsection (a),which both defines a crime and sets forth a penalty, is "sub523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN232 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtject to" subsection (b)'s different penalties (where the alien isalso a felon or aggravated felon). And (b)'s higher maximumpenalties may apply to an offender who violates (a) "notwith-standing" the fact that (a) sets forth a lesser penalty for onewho has committed the same substantive crime. Nor is itpointless to specify that (b)'s punishments, not (a)'s punishment, apply whenever an offender commits (a)'s offense in amanner set forth by (b).Moreover, the circumstances of subsection (b)'s adoptionsupport this reading of the statutory text. We have examined the language of the statute in 1988, when Congressadded the provision here at issue. That original languagedoes not help petitioner. In 1988, the statute read as follows(with the 1988 amendment underscored):"$ 1326. Reentry of deported alien; criminal penaltiesfor reentry of certain deported aliens."(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, anyalien who--"(1) has been . . . deported . . . , and thereafter"(2) enters . . . , or is at any time found in, the UnitedStates [without the Attorney General's consent or thelegal equivalent],"shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof,be punished by imprisonment of not more than twoyears, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both."(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section,in the case of any alien described in such subsection--"(1) whose deportation was subsequent to a convic-tion for commission of a felony (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined under title 18,imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; or"(2) whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alienshall be fined under such title, imprisoned not morethan 15 years, or both." 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 (1988 ed.) (em-phasis added).523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN233Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThus, at the time of the amendment, the operative languageof subsection (a)'s ordinary reentering-alien provision saidthat a reentering alien "shall be guilty of a felony, andupon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment of notmore than two years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000."The 1988 amendment, subsection (b), by way of contrast, re-ferred only to punishment--an increased punishment for thefelon, or the aggravated felon, whom subsection (a) has "de-scribed." Although one could read the language, "any aliendescribed in [subsection (a)]," standing alone, as importingsubsection (a)'s elements into new offenses defined in subsection (b), that reading seems both unusual and awkward whentaken in context, for the reasons just given. Linguisticallyspeaking, it seems more likely that Congress simply meantto "describe" an alien who, in the words of the 1988 statute,was "guilty of a felony" defined in subsection (a) and "convict[ed] thereof."As the dissent points out, post, at 265, Congress laterstruck from subsection (a) the words just quoted, and addedin their place the words, "shall be fined under title 18, orimprisoned not more than two years." See Immigration Actof 1990 (1990 Act), $ 543(b)(3), 104 Stat. 5059. But thisamendment was one of a series in the 1990 Act that uniformly updated and simplified the phrasing of various, disparate civil and criminal penalty provisions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act. See, e. g., 1990 Act, $ 543(b)(1)(amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1282(c)); $ 543(b)(2)(C) (amending 8U. S. C. $ 1325); $ 543( b)(4) (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1327);$ 543(b)(5) (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1328). The section of theAct that contained the amendment is titled "Increase in FineLevels; Authority of the INS to Collect Fines," and the relevant subsection, simply "Criminal Fine Levels." 1990 Act,$ 543(b), 104 Stat. 5057, 5059. Although the 1990 amendment did have the effect of making the penalty provision insubsection (a) (which had remained unchanged since 1952)parallel with its counterparts in later enacted subsection (b),523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN234 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtneither the amendment's language, nor the legislative his-tory of the 1990 Act, suggests that in this housekeepingmeasure, Congress intended to change, or to clarify, the fun-damental relationship between the two subsections.We also note that "the title of a statute and the headingof a section" are "tools available for the resolution of adoubt" about the meaning of a statute.Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947); see alsoINS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502U. S. 183, 189 (1991). The title of the 1988 amendment is"Criminalpenalties for reentry of certain deported aliens."$ 7345, 102 Stat. 4471 (emphasis added). A title that contains the word "penalties" more often, but certainly notalways, see post, at 266-267, signals a provision that dealswith penalties for a substantive crime.In this instance the amendment's title does not reflectcareless, or mistaken, drafting, for the title is reinforced bya legislative history that speaks about, and only about, thecreation of new penalties. See S. 973, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.(1987), 133 Cong. Rec. 8771 (1987) (original bill titled, "A billto provide for additional criminal penalties for deportedaliens who reenter the United States, and for other purposes"); 134 Cong. Rec. 27429 (1988) (section-by-section analysis referring to Senate bill as increasing penalties for unlawful reentry); id., at 27445 (remarks of Sen. D'Amato) (lawwould "increas[e] current penalties for illegal reentry afterdeportation"); id., at 27462 (remarks of Sen. Chiles) (lawwould "impose stiff penalties" against deported aliens previously convicted of drug offenses); 133 Cong. Rec. 28840-28841 (1987) (remarks of Rep. Smith) (corresponding Housebill creates three-tier penalty structure). The history, toour knowledge, contains no language at all that indicatesCongress intended to create a new substantive crime.Finally, the contrary interpretation--a substantive criminal offense--risks unfairness. If subsection (b)(2) sets fortha separate crime, the Government would be required to523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN235Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtprove to the jury that the defendant was previously deported"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravatedfelony." As this Court has long recognized, the introductionof evidence of a defendant's prior crimes risks significantprejudice. See, e. g., Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560(1967) (evidence of prior crimes "is generally recognized tohave potentiality for prejudice"). Even if a defendant's stip-ulation were to keep the name and details of the previousoffense from the jury, see Old Chief v. United States, 519U. S. 172, 178-179 (1997), jurors would still learn, from theindictment, the judge, or the prosecutor, that the defendanthad committed anaggravated felony. And, as we said lastTerm, "there can be no question that evidence of the . . .nature of the prior offense," here, that it was "aggravated"or serious, "carries a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant." Id., at 185 (emphasis added). Like several lowercourts, we do not believe, other things being equal, that Congress would have wanted to create this kind of unfairness inrespect to facts that are almost never contested. See,e. g.,United States v. Forbes, 16 F. 3d, at 1298-1300; United Statesv. Rumney, 867 F. 2d 714, 718-719 (CA1 1989); United Statesv. Brewer, 853 F. 2d 1319, 1324-1325 (CA6 1988) (en banc);United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d, at 25-26; Governmentof Virgin Islands v. Castillo, 550 F. 2d 850, 854 (CA3 1977).In sum, we believe that Congress intended to set fortha sentencing factor in subsection (b)(2) and not a separatecriminal offense.BWe must also consider several additional arguments thathave been or might be made for a contrary interpretationof the statute. First, one might try to derive a congres-sional intent to establish a separate crime from the magnitude of the increase in the maximum authorized sentence.The magnitude of the change that Congress made in 1988,however, proves little. That change--from a 2-year maxi-mum to 5- and 15-year maximums--is well within the range523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN236 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtset forth in other statutes that the lower courts have gen-erally interpreted as providing for sentencing enhancements. Compare 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 (1988 ed.) with 21 U. S. C.$$ 841(b)(1)(B) and (D) (distributing less than 50 kilograms ofmarijuana, maximum 5 years; distributing 100 or more kilograms of marijuana, 5 to 40 years), $$ 841(b)(1)(A) and (C)(distributing less than 100 grams of heroin, maximum 20years; distributing 1 kilogram or more of heroin, maximumof life imprisonment), $ 841(b)(1)(B) (distributing 500 gramsor more of cocaine, 5 to 40 years; same, with prior drug fel-ony conviction, 10 years to life); $ 962 (doubling maximumterm for second and subsequent violations of drug importation laws); 18 U. S. C. $ 844 (using or carrying explosive device during commission of felony, maximum 10 years; subsequent offense, maximum 20 years); $ 2241(c) (sexual abuseof children, maximum life; second offense, mandatory life);$ 2320(a) (trafficking in counterfeit goods, maximum 10 years;subsequent offense, maximum 20 years). Congress lateramended the statute, increasing the maximums to 10 and to20 years, respectively. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, $$ 130001(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2), 108 Stat.2023. But nothing suggests that, in doing so, Congress intended to transform that statute's basic nature. And thelater limits are close to the range suggested by other statutes regardless.Second, petitioner and the dissent point, in part, to statutory language that did not exist when petitioner was convicted in 1995. Petitioner, for example, points out that in1996, Congress added two new subsections, (b)(3) and (b)(4),which, petitioner says, created new substantive crimes. SeeAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,$ 401(c), 110 Stat. 1267 (adding subsection (b)(3)); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996(IIRIRA), $ 305(b), 110 Stat. 3009-606 to 3009-607 (addingsubsection (b)(4)). Both petitioner and the dissent also referto another 1996 statutory provision in which Congress used523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN237Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe word "offense" to refer to the subsection now before us.See IIRIRA, $ 334, 110 Stat. 3009-635.These later enacted laws, however, are beside the point.They do not declare the meaning of earlier law. Cf.FederalHousing Administration v. Darlington, Inc., 358 U. S. 84,90 (1958). They do not seek to clarify an earlier enactedgeneral term. Cf.Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969). They do not depend for their ef-fectiveness upon clarification, or a change in the meaning ofan earlier statute. Cf. Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. ShellOil Co., 444 U. S. 572, 595-596 (1980). They do not reflectany direct focus by Congress upon the meaning of the earlierenacted provisions. Cf. ibid.; Darlington, supra, at 86.Consequently, we do not find in them any forward lookinglegislative mandate, guidance, or direct suggestion abouthow courts should interpret the earlier provisions.Regardless, it is not obvious that the two new subsectionsto which petitioner points create new crimes (a matter onwhich we express no view) nor, in adding them, did Congressdo more than leave the legal question here at issue where itfound it. The fact that Congress used a technical, crimesuggesting word--"offense"--eight years later in a different,and minor, statutory provision proves nothing--not least because it is more than offset by different words in the samelater statute that suggest with greater force the exact opposite, namely, the precise interpretation of the relation of subsection (b) to subsection (a) that we adopt. See IIRIRA,$ 321(c), 110 Stat. 3009-628 (stating that a new definition of"aggravated felony" applies "under" subsection (b) "only toviolations" of subsection (a)).Finally, petitioner and the dissent argue that the doctrineof "constitutional doubt" requires us to interpret subsection(b)(2) as setting forth a separate crime. As Justice Holmessaid long ago: "A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score." United523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN238 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtStates v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916) (citingUnited States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909)); see also Ashwander v.TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)."This canon is followed out of respect for Congress, which weassume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations."Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 191 (1991); see also FTC v.American Tobacco Co., 264 U. S. 298, 305-307 (1924). Thedoctrine seeks in part to minimize disagreement betweenthe branches by preserving congressional enactments thatmight otherwise founder on constitutional objections. It isnot designed to aggravate that friction by creating (throughthe power of precedent) statutes foreign to those Congressintended, simply through fear of a constitutional difficultythat, upon analysis, will evaporate. Thus, those who invokethe doctrine must believe that the alternative is a seriouslikelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional.Only then will the doctrine serve its basic democratic function of maintaining a set of statutes that reflect, rather thandistort, the policy choices that elected representatives havemade. For similar reasons, the statute must be genuinelysusceptible to two constructions after, and not before, itscomplexities are unraveled. Only then is the statutory construction that avoids the constitutional question a "fair" one.Unlike the dissent, we do not believe these conditions aremet in the present case. The statutory language is somewhat complex. But after considering the matter in context,we believe the interpretative circumstances point significantly in one direction. More important, even if we were toassume that petitioner's construction of the statute is "fairlypossible," Jin Fuey Moy, supra, at 401, the constitutionalquestions he raises, while requiring discussion, simply do notlead us to doubt gravely that Congress may authorize courtsto impose longer sentences upon recidivists who commit aparticular crime. The fact that we, unlike the dissent, do523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN239Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnot gravely doubt the statute's constitutionality in this re-spect is a crucial point. That is because the "constitutionaldoubt" doctrine does not apply mechanically whenever therearises a significant constitutional question the answer towhich is not obvious. And precedent makes clear that theCourt need not apply (for it has not always applied) the doctrine in circumstances similar to those here--where a consti-tutional question, while lacking an obvious answer, does notlead a majority gravely to doubt that the statute is constitu-tional. See,e. g., Rust, 500 U. S., at 190-191 (declining toapply doctrine although petitioner's constitutional claims not"without some force"); id., at 204-207 (Blackmun, J., dissent-ing);United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 611 (1989);id., at 636 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); United States v. Locke,471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985); id., at 120 (Stevens, J., dissenting).IIIInvoking several of the Court's precedents, petitionerclaims that the Constitution requires Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the offense--irrespective of Congress'contrary intent. Moreover, petitioner says, that requirement carries with it three subsidiary requirements that theConstitution mandates in respect to ordinary, legislativelyintended, elements of crimes. The indictment must statethe "element." See, e. g., Hamling v. United States, 418U. S., at 117. The Government must prove that "element"to a jury. See, e. g., Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145,149 (1968). And the Government must prove the "element"beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., Patterson v. NewYork, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). We cannot find sufficientsupport, however, in our precedents or elsewhere, for petitioner's claim.This Court has explicitly held that the Constitution's DueProcess Clause "protects the accused against conviction ex-cept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN240 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). But Winship, thecase in which the Court set forth this proposition of constitutional law, does not decide this case. It said that the Consti-tution entitles juveniles, like adults, to the benefit of proofbeyond a reasonable doubt in respect to the elements of thecrime. It did not consider whether, or when, the Constitu-tion requires the Government to treat a particular fact as anelement, i. e., as a "fact necessary to constitute the crime,"even where the crime-defining statute does not do so.Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), provides peti-tioner with stronger support. The Court there struck downa state homicide statute under which the State presumedthat all homicides were committed with "malice," punishableby life imprisonment, unless the defendant proved that hehad acted in the heat of passion. Id., at 688. The Courtwrote that "if Winship were limited to those facts that constitute a crime as defined by state law, a State could undermine many of the interests that decision sought to protect"just by redefining "the elements that constitut[ed] differentcrimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solely on theextent of punishment." Id., at 698. It simultaneously heldthat the prosecution must establish "beyond a reasonabledoubt" the nonexistence of "heat of passion"--the fact that,under the State's statutory scheme, distinguished a homicidepunishable by a life sentence from a homicide punishable bya maximum of 20 years. Id., at 704. Read literally, thislanguage, we concede, suggests that Congress cannot permitjudges to increase a sentence in light of recidivism, or anyother factor, not set forth in an indictment and proved to ajury beyond a reasonable doubt.This Court's later case, Patterson v. New York, supra,however, makes absolutely clear that such a reading of Mullaney is wrong. The Court, in Patterson, pointed out thatthe State in Mullaney made the critical fact--the absence of"heat of passion"--not simply a potential sentencing factor,but also a critical part of the definition of "malice afore523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN241Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthought," which was itself in turn "part of " the statute'sdefinition of "homicide," the crime in question.Patterson,432 U. S., at 215-216. (The Maine Supreme Court, in defin-ing the crime, had said that "malice" was "presumed" unless"rebutted" by the defendant's showing of "heat of passion."Id., at 216.) The Court found this circumstance extremelyimportant. It said thatMullaney had considered (and held"impermissible") the shifting of a burden of proof "withrespect to a fact which the State deems so important thatit must be either proved or presumed." 432 U. S., at 215(emphasis added). And the Court then held that similarburden shifting was permissible with respect to New York'shomicide-related sentencing factor "extreme emotional disturbance." Id., at 205-206. That factor was not a factorthat the state statute had deemed "so important" in relationto the crime that it must be either "proved or presumed."Id., at 205-206, 215.The upshot is that Mullaney's language, if read literally,suggests that the Constitution requires that most, if not all,sentencing factors be treated as elements. But Pattersonsuggests the exact opposite, namely, that the Constitutionrequires scarcely any sentencing factors to be treated in thatway. The cases, taken together, cannot significantly helppetitioner, for the statute here involves a sentencing factor--the prior commission of an aggravated felony--that is neither "presumed" to be present, nor need be "proved" to bepresent, in order to prove the commission of the relevantcrime. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a) (defining offense elements).Indeed, as we have said, it involves one of the most frequently found factors that affects sentencing--recidivism.Nor does Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605 (1967), whichpetitioner cites, provide significant additional help, forSpecht was decided before Patterson (indeed before Winship); it did not consider the kind of matter here at issue;and, as this Court later noted, the Colorado defendant inSpecht was "confronted with `a radically different situation'523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN242 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfrom the usual sentencing proceeding." McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S., at 89. At most, petitioner might readall these cases, taken together, for the broad proposition thatsometimes the Constitution does require (though sometimesit does not require) the State to treat a sentencing factor asan element. But we do not see how they can help petitionermore than that.We turn then to the case upon which petitioner must pri-marily rely,McMillan v. Pennsylvania. The Court thereconsidered a Pennsylvania statute that set forth a sentenc-ing factor--"visibly possessing a firearm"--the presence ofwhich required the judge to impose a minimum prison termof five years. The Court held that the Constitution did notrequire the State to treat the factor as an element of thecrime. In so holding, the Court said that the State's "link[ing] the `severity of punishment' to `the presence or absenceof an identified fact' " did not automatically make of that factan "element." Id., at 84 (quoting Patterson v. New York,supra, at 214). It said, citing Patterson, that "the state legislature's definition of the elements of the offense is usuallydispositive." 477 U. S., at 85. It said that it would not "define precisely the constitutional limits" of a legislature'spower to define the elements of an offense. Id., at 86. Andit held that, whatever those limits might be, the State hadnot exceeded them. Ibid. Petitioner must therefore concede that "firearm possession" (in respect to a mandatoryminimum sentence) does not violate those limits. And hemust argue that, nonetheless, "recidivism" (in respect to anauthorized maximum) does violate those limits.In assessing petitioner's claim, we have examined McMillan to determine the various features of the case upon whichthe Court's conclusion arguably turned. The McMillanCourt pointed out: (1) that the statute plainly "does nottransgress the limits expressly set out in Patterson," ibid.;(2) that the defendant (unlike Mullaney's defendant) did notface " `a differential in sentencing ranging from a nominal523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN243Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtfine to a mandatory life sentence,' " 477 U. S., at 87 (quotingMullaney, 421 U. S., at 700); (3) that the statute did not"alte[r] the maximum penalty for the crime" but "operatessolely to limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting apenalty within the range already available to it," 477 U. S., at87-88; (4) that the statute did not "creat[e] a separate offensecalling for a separate penalty,"id., at 88; and (5) that thestatute gave "no impression of having been tailored to per-mit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags thedog of the substantive offense," but, to the contrary, "simplytook one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment . . . and dictated the preciseweight to be given that factor," id., at 88, 89-90.This case resembles McMillan in respect to most of thesefactors. But it is different in respect to the third factor, forit does "alte[r] the maximum penalty for the crime," id., at87; and it also creates a wider range of appropriate punishments than did the statute in McMillan. We nonethelessconclude that these differences do not change the constitutional outcome for several basic reasons.First, the sentencing factor at issue here--recidivism--is atraditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencingcourt's increasing an offender's sentence. See, e. g., Parke v.Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 26 (1992) (Recidivism laws "have a longtradition in this country that dates back to colonial times"and currently are in effect in all 50 States); U. S. Dept. ofJustice, Office of Justice Programs, Statutes Requiring theUse of Criminal History Record Information 17-41 (June1991) (50-state survey); USSG $$ 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov. 1997)(requiring sentencing court to consider defendant's prior record in every case). Consistent with this tradition, the Courtsaid long ago that a State need not allege a defendant's priorconviction in the indictment or information that alleges theelements of an underlying crime, even though the convictionwas "necessary to bring the case within the statute." Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S. 616, 624 (1912). That con523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN244 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtclusion followed, the Court said, from "the distinct natureof the issue," and the fact that recidivism "does not relateto the commission of the offense, but goes to the punishmentonly, and therefore . . . may be subsequently decided."Id., at 629 (emphasis added). The Court has not deviatedfrom this view. See Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 452 (1962)(due process does not require advance notice that trial forsubstantive offense will be followed by accusation that thedefendant is a habitual offender);Parke, supra, at 27 ("[A]charge under a recidivism statute does not state a separateoffense, but goes to punishment only"). And, as we saidbefore, supra, at 230, Congress, reflecting this tradition, hasnever, to our knowledge, made a defendant's recidivism anelement of an offense where the conduct proscribed is otherwise unlawful. See United States v. Jackson, 824 F. 2d21, 25, and n. 6 (CADC 1987) (opinion of R. Ginsburg, J.) (referring to fact that few, if any, federal statutes make "priorcriminal convictions . . . elements of another criminal offenseto be proved before the jury"). Although these precedentsdo not foreclose petitioner's claim (because, for example, thestate statute at issue in Graham and Oyler provided for ajury determination of disputed prior convictions), to holdthat the Constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an"element" of petitioner's offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition of treating recidivismas "go[ing] to the punishment only." Graham, supra, at 629.Second, the major difference between this case and McMillan consists of the circumstance that the sentencing factor at issue here (the prior conviction) triggers an increasein the maximum permissive sentence, while the sentencingfactor at issue in McMillan triggered a mandatory minimumsentence. Yet that difference--between a permissive maximum and a mandatory minimum--does not systematically, ornormally, work to the disadvantage of a criminal defendant.To the contrary, a statutory minimum binds a sentencingjudge; a statutory maximum does not. A mandatory mini523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN245Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmum can, as Justice Stevens dissenting in McMillanpointed out, "mandate aminimum sentence of imprisonmentmore than twice as severe as the maximum the trial judgewould otherwise have imposed." 477 U. S., at 95. It caneliminate a sentencing judge's discretion in its entirety.See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2241(c) (authorizing maximum term oflife imprisonment for sexual abuse of children; mandatinglife imprisonment for second offense). And it can produceunfairly disproportionate impacts on certain kinds of offenders. See United States Sentencing Commission, MandatoryMinimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System26-34 (Aug. 1991) (discussing "tariff " and "cliff " effects ofmandatory minimums). In sum, the risk of unfairness to aparticular defendant is no less, and may well be greater,when a mandatory minimum sentence, rather than a permissive maximum sentence, is at issue.Although McMillan pointed to a difference betweenmandatory minimums and higher authorized maximums, itneither "rested its judgment" on that difference, nor "rejected" the above analysis, as the dissent contends, post,at 254. Rather, McMillan said that the petitioners' argument in that case would have had "more superficial appeal"if the sentencing fact "exposed them to greater or additionalpunishment." 477 U. S., at 88 (emphasis added). For thereasons just given, and in light of the particular sentencingfactor at issue in this case--recidivism--we should take McMillan's statement to mean no more than it said, and therefore not to make a determinative difference here.Third, the statute's broad permissive sentencing rangedoes not itself create significantly greater unfairness.Judges (and parole boards) have typically exercised theirdiscretion within broad statutory ranges. See, e. g., supra,at 232, 236 (statutory examples); National Institute of Justice, Sentencing Reform in the United States (Aug. 1985)(survey of sentencing laws in the 50 States); L. Friedman,Crime and Punishment in American History 159-163 (1993)523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN246 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(history of indeterminate sentencing). And the SentencingGuidelines have recently sought to channel that discretionusing "sentencing factors" which no one here claims that theConstitution thereby makes "elements" of a crime.Finally, the remaining McMillan factors support the conclusion that Congress has the constitutional power to treatthe feature before us--prior conviction of an aggravatedfelony--as a sentencing factor for this particular offense(illegal entry after deportation). The relevant statutoryprovisions do not change a pre-existing definition of a well-established crime, nor is there any more reason here, thanin McMillan, to think Congress intended to "evade" theConstitution, either by "presuming" guilt or "restructuring"the elements of an offense. Cf. McMillan, supra, at 86-87,89-90.For these reasons, we cannot find in McMillan (a caseholding that the Constitution permits a legislature to requirea longer sentence for gun possession) significant support forthe proposition that the Constitution forbids a legislature toauthorize a longer sentence for recidivism.Petitioner makes two basic additional arguments in response. He points to what he calls a different "tradition"--that of courts having treated recidivism as an element ofthe related crime. See, e. g., Massey v. United States, 281F. 293, 297-298 (CA8 1922); Singer v. United States, 278F. 415, 420 (CA3 1922); People v. Sickles, 51 N. E. 288, 289(N. Y. 1898); see also post, at 256-257 (citing authority). Wedo not find this claim convincing, however, for any such tradition is not uniform. See Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S., at 566("The method for determining prior convictions varies . . .between jurisdictions affording a jury trial on this issue . . .and those leaving that question to the court"); Note, Recidivist Procedures, 40 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 332, 347 (1965) (as of1965, eight States' recidivism statutes provide for determination of prior convictions by judge, not jury). Nor does itappear modern. Compare State v. Thorne, 129 Wash. 2d523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN247Cite as: 523 U. S. 224 (1998)Opinion of the Court736, 776-784, 921 P. 2d 514, 533-538 (1996) (upholding staterecidivism law against federal constitutional challenge), withState v. Furth, 5 Wash. 2d 1, 11-19, 104 P. 2d 925, 930-933(1940). And it nowhere (to our knowledge) rested upona federal constitutional guarantee. See, e. g., Massey v.United States, supra, at 297 (applying federal law, notingjury determination of prior offense applied "unless the statute designates a different mode of procedure").Petitioner also argues, in essence, that this Court shouldsimply adopt a rule that any significant increase in a statu-tory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional "elements" requirement. We have explained why we believethe Constitution, as interpreted inMcMillan and earliercases, does not impose that requirement. We add that sucha rule would seem anomalous in light of existing case lawthat permits a judge, rather than a jury, to determine theexistence of factors that can make a defendant eligible forthe death penalty, a punishment far more severe than thatfaced by petitioner here. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639, 647 (1990) (rejecting capital defendant's argument thatevery finding of fact underlying death sentence must bemade by a jury);Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638, 640-641(1989) (per curiam) ( judge may impose death penalty basedon his finding of aggravating factor because such factor isnot element of offense to be determined by jury); Spazianov. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 465 (1984) (same). And we wouldalso find it difficult to reconcile any such rule with our precedent holding that the sentencing-related circumstances ofrecidivism are not part of the definition of the offense fordouble jeopardy purposes. Graham, 224 U. S., at 623-624.For these reasons, we reject petitioner's constitutionalclaim that his recidivism must be treated as an element ofhis offense.IVWe mention one final point. Petitioner makes no sepa-rate, subsidiary, standard of proof claims with respect to his523US1 Unit: $U43 [05-09-00 11:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN248 ALMENDAREZ-TORRES v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingsentencing, perhaps because he admitted his recidivism atthe time he pleaded guilty and would therefore find it difficult to show that the standard of proof could have made adifference to his case. Accordingly, we express no view onwhether some heightened standard of proof might apply tosentencing determinations that bear significantly on theseverity of sentence. Cf. United States v. Watts, 519 U. S.148, 156, and n. 2 (1997)(per curiam) (acknowledging, butnot resolving, "divergence of opinion among the Circuits" asto proper standard for determining the existence of "relevantconduct" that would lead to an increase in sentence).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
