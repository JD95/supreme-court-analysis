The Fair Housing Act forbids racial discrimination inrespect to the sale or rental of a dwelling. 82 Stat. 81,42 U. S. C. $$ 3604(b), 3605(a). The question before us iswhether the Act imposes personal liability without faultupon an officer or owner of a residential real estate corpora-tion for the unlawful activity of the corporation's employeeor agent. We conclude that the Act imposes liability with-out fault upon the employer in accordance with traditionalagency principles, i. e., it normally imposes vicarious liabilityupon the corporation but not upon its officers or owners.IFor purposes of this decision we simplify the backgroundfacts as follows: Respondents Emma Mary Ellen Holley and*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the CaliforniaAssociation of Realtors by June Babiracki Barlow and Neil Kalin; for theNational Association of Home Builders by Christopher G.

S. 280 (2003)Opinion of the CourtDavid Holley, an interracial couple, tried to buy a house inTwenty-Nine Palms, California. A real estate corporation,Triad, Inc., had listed the house for sale. Grove Crank, aTriad salesman, is alleged to have prevented the Holleysfrom obtaining the house--and for racially discriminatoryreasons.The Holleys brought a lawsuit in federal court againstCrank and Triad. They claimed, among other things, thatboth were responsible for a fair housing law violation. TheHolleys later filed a separate suit against David Meyer,the petitioner here. Meyer, they said, was Triad's president, Triad's sole shareholder, and Triad's licensed "officer/broker," see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, $ 2740 (1996) (formerlyCal. Admin. Code, tit. 10, $ 2740) (requiring that a corporation, in order to engage in acts for which a real estate licenseis required, designate one of its officers to act as the licensedbroker); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. $$ 10158, 10159, 10211(West 1987). They claimed that Meyer was vicariously liable in one or more of these capacities for Crank's unlawfulactions.The District Court consolidated the two lawsuits. It dismissed all claims other than the Fair Housing Act claimon statute of limitations grounds. It dismissed the claimsagainst Meyer in his capacity as officer of Triad because (1) itconsidered those claims as assertions of vicarious liability,and (2) it believed that the Fair Housing Act did not imposepersonal vicarious liability upon a corporate officer. TheDistrict Court stated that "any liability against Meyer as anofficer of Triad would only attach to Triad," the corporation.App. 31. The court added that the Holleys had "not urgedtheories that could justify reaching Meyer individually."Ibid. It later went on to dismiss for similar reasons claimsof vicarious liability against Meyer in his capacity as the"designated officer/ broker" in respect to Triad's real estatelicense. Id., at 52-55.537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 MEYER v. HOLLEYOpinion of the CourtThe District Court certified its judgment as final to permitthe Holleys to appeal its vicarious liability determinations.See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b). The Ninth Circuit reversedthose determinations. 258 F. 3d 1127 (2001). The Court ofAppeals recognized that "under general principles of tortlaw corporate shareholders and officers usually are not heldvicariously liable for an employee's action," but, in its view,"the criteria for the Fair Housing Act" are "different." Id.,at 1129. That Act, it said, "specified" liability "for those whodirect or control or have the right to direct or control theconduct of another"--even if they were not at all involvedin the discrimination itself and even in the absence of anytraditional agent/principal or employee/employer relationship, id., at 1129, 1131. Meyer, in his capacity as Triad'ssole owner, had "the authority to control the acts" of a Triadsalesperson. Id., at 1133. Meyer, in his capacity as Triad'sofficer, "did direct or control, or had the right to direct orcontrol, the conduct" of a Triad salesperson. Ibid. Andeven if Meyer neither participated in nor authorized the discrimination in question, that "control" or "authority to control" is "enough . . . to hold Meyer personally liable." Ibid.The Ninth Circuit added that, for similar reasons, Meyer,in his capacity as Triad's license-related officer/ broker, wasvicariously liable for Crank's discriminatory activity. Id.,at 1134-1135.Meyer sought certiorari. We granted his petition, 535U. S. 1077 (2002), to review the Ninth Circuit's holding thatthe Fair Housing Act imposes principles of strict liabilitybeyond those traditionally associated with agent/principalor employee/employer relationships. We agreed to decidewhether "the criteria under the Fair Housing Act . . . aredifferent, so that owners and officers of corporations" areautomatically and "absolutely liable for an employee's oragent's violation of the Act"--even if they did not direct orauthorize, and were otherwise not involved in, the unlawfuldiscriminatory acts.

Inrelevant part the Act forbids "any person or other entitywhose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate," for example, becauseof "race." 42 U. S. C. $ 3605(a). It adds that "[p]erson"includes, for example, individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, labor unions, and other organizations.$ 3602(d). It says nothing about vicarious liability.Nonetheless, it is well established that the Act providesfor vicarious liability. This Court has noted that an actionbrought for compensation by a victim of housing discrimina-tion is, in effect, a tort action. See Curtis v. Loether, 415U. S. 189, 195-196 (1974). And the Court has assumed that,when Congress creates a tort action, it legislates against alegal background of ordinary tort-related vicarious liabilityrules and consequently intends its legislation to incorporatethose rules. Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey,Ltd., 526 U. S. 687, 709 (1999) (listing this Court's precedentsthat interpret Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, in whichCongress created "a species of tort liability," "in light of thebackground of tort liability" (internal quotation marks omit-ted)). Cf. Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501U. S. 104, 108 (1991) ("Congress is understood to legislateagainst a background of common-law . . . principles");UnitedStates v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534 (1993) ("In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must `speak di-rectly' to the question addressed by the common law").It is well established that traditional vicarious liabilityrules ordinarily make principals or employers vicariously liable for acts of their agents or employees in the scope of theirauthority or employment. Burlington Industries, Inc. v.Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 756 (1998) ("An employer may be liablefor both negligent and intentional torts committed by an employee within the scope of his or her employment"); New Orleans, M., & C. R. Co. v.

HOLLEYOpinion of the Court("The principal is liable for the acts and negligence of theagent in the course of his employment, although he did notauthorize or did not know of the acts complained of "); seeRosenthal & Co. v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n,802 F. 2d 963, 967 (CA7 1986) (" `respondeat superior' . . . isa doctrine about employers . . . and other principals"); Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 219(1) (1957) (Restatement).And in the absence of special circumstances it is the corporation, not its owner or officer, who is the principal oremployer, and thus subject to vicarious liability for tortscommitted by its employees or agents. 3A W. Fletcher,Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations $ 1137,pp. 300-301 (rev. ed. 1991-1994); 10 id., $ 4877 (rev. ed. 1997-2001). The Restatement $ 1 specifies that the relevantprincipal/agency relationship demands not only control (orthe right to direct or control) but also "the manifestation ofconsent by one person to another that the other shall act onhis behalf . . . , and consent by the other so to act." (Emphasis added.) A corporate employee typically acts on behalfof the corporation, not its owner or officer.The Ninth Circuit held that the Fair Housing Act imposedmore extensive vicarious liability--that the Act went wellbeyond traditional principles. The Court of Appeals heldthat the Act made corporate owners and officers liable forthe unlawful acts of a corporate employee simply on the basisthat the owner or officer controlled (or had the right to control) the actions of that employee. We do not agree withthe Ninth Circuit that the Act extended traditional vicariousliability rules in this way.For one thing, Congress said nothing in the statute or inthe legislative history about extending vicarious liability inthis manner. And Congress' silence, while permitting aninference that Congress intended to apply ordinary background tort principles, cannot show that it intended to applyan unusual modification of those rules.537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 537 U. S. 280 (2003)Opinion of the CourtWhere Congress, in other civil rights statutes, has not ex-pressed a contrary intent, the Court has drawn the inferencethat it intended ordinary rules to apply. See, e. g., Burlington Industries, Inc., supra, at 754-755 (deciding an employer's vicarious liability under Title VII based on traditionalagency principles);Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986) ("Congress wanted courts to look toagency principles for guidance").This Court has applied unusually strict rules only whereCongress has specified that such was its intent. See, e. g.,United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1943)(Congress intended that a corporate officer or employee"standing in responsible relation" could be held liable in thatcapacity for a corporation's violations of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U. S. C.$$ 301-392); United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658, 673 (1975)(discussing, with respect to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, congressional intent to impose a duty on "responsible corporate agents"); United States v. Wise, 370 U. S. 405,411-414 (1962) (discussing 38 Stat. 736, currently 15 U. S. C.$ 24, which provides: "[W]henever a corporation shall violateany of the . . . antitrust laws, such violation shall be deemedto be also that of the individual directors, officers, or agentsof such corporation who shall have authorized, ordered, ordone any of the acts constituting in whole or in part suchviolation"); see also 46 U. S. C. $ 12507(d) ("If a person, notan individual, is involved in a violation [relating to a vesselidentification system], the president or chief executive of theperson also is subject to any penalty provided under thissection").For another thing, the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment (HUD), the federal agency primarily chargedwith the implementation and administration of the statute,42 U. S. C. $ 3608, has specified that ordinary vicarious liability rules apply in this area. And we ordinarily defer to anadministering agency's reasonable interpretation of a stat537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN288 MEYER v. HOLLEYOpinion of the Courtute. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984); Skidmore v.Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).A HUD regulation applicable during the relevant time periods for this suit provided that analogous administrativecomplaints alleging Fair Housing Act violations may be filed"against any person who directs or controls, or has theright to direct or control, the conduct of another person with respect to any aspect of the sale . . . ofdwellings . . .if that other person, acting within thescope of his or her authority as employee or agent of thedirecting or controlling person . . . has engaged . . . ina discriminatory housing practice." 24 CFR $ 103.20(b)(1999) (repealed) (emphasis added).See Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91,107 (1979) (treating administrative actions under 42 U. S. C.$ 3610 and civil actions under $ 3613 as alternative, but paral-lel, proceedings).When it adopted the similar predecessor to this regulation(then codified at 24 CFR $ 105.13, see 53 Fed. Reg. 24185(1988)), HUD explained that it intended to permit a "respondent" (defined at 42 U. S. C. $ 3602) to raise in an admin-istrative proceeding any defense "that could be raised incourt." 53 Fed. Reg., at 24185. It added that the under-scored phrase was designed to make clear that "a complaintmay be filed against a directing or controlling person withrespect to the discriminatory acts of another only if the otherperson was acting within the scope of his or her authority asemployee or agent of the directing or controlling person."Ibid. (emphasis added). HUD also specified that, by addingthe words "acting within the scope of his or her authority asemployee or agent of the directing or controlling person," itdisclaimed any "intent to impose absolute liability" on thebasis of the mere right "to direct or control." Ibid.; see 54Fed. Reg. 3232, 3261 (1989).537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 537 U. S. 280 (2003)Opinion of the CourtFinally, we have found no convincing argument in supportof the Ninth Circuit's decision to apply nontraditional vicarious liability principles--a decision that respondents do notdefend and in fact concede is incorrect. See Brief for Respondents 6, 10-11, 43 (conceding that traditional vicariousliability rules apply); Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 8, 22. The Ninth Circuit rested that decision primarilyupon the HUD regulation to which we have referred. TheNinth Circuit underscored the phrase " `or has the right todirect or contro[l] the conduct of another person.' " 258F. 3d, at 1130. Its opinion did not explain, however, why theNinth Circuit did not read these words as modified by thesubsequent words that limited vicarious liability to actionstaken as " `employee or agent of the directing or controllingperson.' " Id., at 1131. Taken as a whole, the regulation, inour view, says that ordinary, not unusual, rules of vicariousliability should apply.The Ninth Circuit also referred to several cases decided inother Circuits. The actual holdings in those cases, however,do not support the kind of nontraditional vicarious liabilitythat the Ninth Circuit applied. See Chicago v. MatchmakerReal Estate Sales Center, Inc., 982 F. 2d 1086 (CA7 1992)(defendant corporation liable for the acts of its agents; shareholder directly, not vicariously, liable); Walker v. Crigler, 976F. 2d 900 (CA4 1992) (owner of rental property liable for thediscriminatory acts of agent, the property's manager); Marrv. Rife, 503 F. 2d 735 (CA6 1974) (real estate agency's ownerliable for the discriminatory acts of his agency's salespersons, but without statement of whether agency was a corporation). Nor does the language of these cases provide a convincing rationale for the Ninth Circuit's conclusions.The Ninth Circuit further referred to an owner's or officer's "non delegable duty" not to discriminate in light of theAct's "overriding societal priority." 258 F. 3d, at 1131, 1132(citing Chicago v. Matchmaker Real Estate Sales Center,Inc., supra, at 1096-1097, and Walker v. Crigler, supra, at537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN290 MEYER v. HOLLEYOpinion of the Court904-905). And it added that "[w]hen one of two innocentpeople must suffer, the one whose acts permitted the wrongto occur is the one to bear the burden." 258 F. 3d, at 1132."[A] nondelegable duty is an affirmative obligation to ensure the protection of the person to whom the duty runs."General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania,458 U. S. 375, 396 (1982) (finding no nondelegable duty under42 U. S. C. $ 1981). Such a duty imposed upon a principalwould "go further" than the vicarious liability principles wehave discussed thus far to create liability "although [the prin-cipal] has himself done everything that could reasonably berequired of him," W. Prosser, Law of Torts $ 71, p. 470 (4thed. 1971), and irrespective of whether the agent was actingwith or without authority. The Ninth Circuit identifiesnothing in the language or legislative history of the Act tosupport the existence of this special kind of liability--thekind of liability that, for example, the law might impose incertain special circumstances upon a principal or employerthat hires an independent contractor. Restatement $ 214;see 5 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law of Torts $ 26.11 (2ded. 1986); Prosser, supra, $ 71, at 470-471. In the absence oflegal support, we cannot conclude that Congress intended,through silence, to impose this kind of special duty of protection upon individual officers or owners of corporations--whoare not principals (or contracting parties) in respect to thecorporation's unlawfully acting employee.Neither does it help to characterize the statute's objectiveas an "overriding societal priority." 258 F. 3d, at 1132. Weagree with the characterization. But we do not agree thatthe characterization carries with it a legal rule that wouldhold every corporate supervisor personally liable withoutfault for the unlawful act of every corporate employee whomhe or she has the right to supervise. Rather, which "of twoinnocent people must suffer," ibid., and just when, is a complex matter. We believe that courts ordinarily should determine that matter in accordance with traditional principles of537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN291Cite as: 537 U. S. 280 (2003)Opinion of the Courtvicarious liability--unless, of course, Congress, better ablethan courts to weigh the relevant policy considerations, hasinstructed the courts differently. Cf., e. g., Sykes, The Eco-nomics of Vicarious Liability, 93 Yale L. J. 1231, 1236 (1984)(arguing that the expansion of vicarious liability or shiftingof liability, due to insurance, may diminish an agent's incentives to police behavior). We have found no different instruction here. IIIARespondents, conceding that traditional vicarious liabilityrules apply, seesupra, at 289, argue that those principlesthemselves warrant liability here. For one thing, theysay, California law itself creates what amounts, under ordinary common-law principles, to an employer/employee orprincipal/agent relationship between (a) a corporate officerdesignated as the broker under a real estate license issuedto the corporation, and (b) a corporate employee/salesperson.Brief for Respondents 6-8, 13-36. Insofar as this argumentrests solely upon the corporate broker/officer's right to control the employee/salesperson, the Ninth Circuit consideredand accepted it. 258 F. 3d, at 1134-1135. But we must re-ject it given our determination in Part II that the "rightto control" is insufficient by itself, under traditional agencyprinciples, to establish a principal/agent or employer/employee relationship. BThe Ninth Circuit did not decide whether other aspects ofthe California broker relationship, when added to the "rightto control," would, under traditional legal principles and consistent with "the general common law of agency," Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 754 (internal quotation marks omitted), establish the necessary relationship.But in the absence of consideration of that matter by theCourt of Appeals, we shall not consider it. See Pennsylva537US2 Unit: $U17 [04-14-04 20:18:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN292 MEYER v. HOLLEYOpinion of the Courtnia Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.

S. 144, 147,n. 2 (1970))).Respondents also point out that, when traditional vicarious liability principles impose liability upon a corporation,the corporation's liability may be imputed to the corporation's owner in an appropriate case through a " `piercing ofthe corporate veil.' "United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S.51, 63, n. 9 (1998) (quoting United States v. Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan, 113 F. 3d 572, 580 (CA6 1997)). TheCourt of Appeals, however, did not decide the application of"veil piercing" in this matter either. It falls outside thescope of the question presented on certiorari. And we shallnot here consider it.The Ninth Circuit nonetheless remains free on remand todetermine whether these questions were properly raisedand, if so, to consider them.* * *The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
