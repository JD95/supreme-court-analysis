When an alien has been found to be unlawfully presentin the United States and a final order of removal has beenentered, the Government ordinarily secures the alien'sremoval during a subsequent 90-day statutory "removalperiod," during which time the alien normally is held incustody.A special statute authorizes further detention if the Government fails to remove the alien during those 90 days. Itsays:"An alien ordered removed [1] who is inadmissible . . .[2] [or] removable [as a result of violations of status requirements or entry conditions, violations of criminallaw, or reasons of security or foreign policy] or [3] whohas been determined by the Attorney General to be arisk to the community or unlikely to comply with theorder of removal, may be detained beyond the removalperiod and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] termsof supervision . . . ." 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed.,Supp. V).In these cases, we must decide whether this postremoval-period statute authorizes the Attorney General todetain a removable alien indefinitely beyond the removalperiod or only for a period reasonably necessary to securethe alien's removal. We deal here with aliens who wereadmitted to the United States but subsequently orderedremoved. Aliens who have not yet gained initial admissionto this country would present a very different question.See infra, at 693-694. Based on our conclusion that indefinite detention of aliens in the former category would raiseserious constitutional concerns, we construe the statute tocontain an implicit "reasonable time" limitation, the application of which is subject to federal-court review.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN683Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIAThe post-removal-period detention statute is one of a related set of statutes and regulations that govern detentionduring and after removal proceedings. While removal proceedings are in progress, most aliens may be released onbond or paroled. 66 Stat. 204, as added and amended, 110Stat. 3009-585, 8 U. S. C. $$ 1226(a)(2), (c) (1994 ed., Supp. V).After entry of a final removal order and during the 90-dayremoval period, however, aliens must be held in custody.$ 1231(a)(2). Subsequently, as the post-removal-period statute provides, the Government "may" continue to detain analien who still remains here or release that alien under supervision. $ 1231(a)(6).Related Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)regulations add that the INS District Director will initiallyreview the alien's records to decide whether further detention or release under supervision is warranted after the90-day removal period expires. 8 CFR $$ 241.4(c)(1), (h),(k)(1)(i) (2001). If the decision is to detain, then an INSpanel will review the matter further, at the expiration of a3-month period or soon thereafter. $ 241.4(k)(2)(ii). Andthe panel will decide, on the basis of records and a possiblepersonal interview, between still further detention or releaseunder supervision. $ 241.4(i). In making this decision, thepanel will consider, for example, the alien's disciplinary record, criminal record, mental health reports, evidence of rehabilitation, history of flight, prior immigration history, and favorable factors such as family ties. $ 241.4(f ). To authorizerelease, the panel must find that the alien is not likely to beviolent, to pose a threat to the community, to flee if released,or to violate the conditions of release. $ 241.4(e). And thealien must demonstrate "to the satisfaction of the Attorney General" that he will pose no danger or risk of flight.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN684 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the Court$ 241.4(d)(1). If the panel decides against release, it mustreview the matter again within a year, and can review itearlier if conditions change. $$ 241.4(k)(2)(iii), (v).B1We consider two separate instances of detention. Thefirst concerns Kestutis Zadvydas, a resident alien who wasborn, apparently of Lithuanian parents, in a displaced per-sons camp in Germany in 1948. When he was eight yearsold, Zadvydas immigrated to the United States with his par-ents and other family members, and he has lived here eversince.Zadvydas has a long criminal record, involving drugcrimes, attempted robbery, attempted burglary, and theft.He has a history of flight, from both criminal and deportationproceedings. Most recently, he was convicted of possessing,with intent to distribute, cocaine; sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment; released on parole after two years; taken intoINS custody; and, in 1994, ordered deported to Germany.See 8 U. S. C. $ 1251(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (delineatingcrimes that make alien deportable).In 1994, Germany told the INS that it would not acceptZadvydas because he was not a German citizen. Shortlythereafter, Lithuania refused to accept Zadvydas because hewas neither a Lithuanian citizen nor a permanent resident.In 1996, the INS asked the Dominican Republic (Zadvydas'wife's country) to accept him, but this effort proved unsuccessful. In 1998, Lithuania rejected, as inadequately docu-mented, Zadvydas' effort to obtain Lithuanian citizenshipbased on his parents' citizenship; Zadvydas' reapplication isapparently still pending.The INS kept Zadvydas in custody after expiration of theremoval period. In September 1995, Zadvydas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 chal533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN685Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the Courtlenging his continued detention. In October 1997, a FederalDistrict Court granted that writ and ordered him releasedunder supervision. Zadvydas v. Caplinger, 986 F. Supp.1011, 1027-1028 (ED La.). In its view, the Governmentwould never succeed in its efforts to remove Zadvydas fromthe United States, leading to his permanent confinement,contrary to the Constitution. Id., at 1027.The Fifth Circuit reversed this decision.Zadvydas v.Underdown, 185 F. 3d 279 (1999). It concluded thatZadvydas' detention did not violate the Constitution becauseeventual deportation was not "impossible," good-faith effortsto remove him from the United States continued, and hisdetention was subject to periodic administrative review.Id., at 294, 297. The Fifth Circuit stayed its mandate pend-ing potential review in this Court.2The second case is that of Kim Ho Ma. Ma was born inCambodia in 1977. When he was two, his family fled, takinghim to refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines andeventually to the United States, where he has lived as a resident alien since the age of seven. In 1995, at age 17, Mawas involved in a gang-related shooting, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to 38 months' imprisonment. Heserved two years, after which he was released into INScustody.In light of his conviction of an "aggravated felony,"Ma was ordered removed. See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1101(a)(43)(F)(defining certain violent crimes as aggravated felonies),1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (aliens convicted of ag-gravated felonies are deportable). The 90-day removal period expired in early 1999, but the INS continued to keepMa in custody, because, in light of his former gang member-ship, the nature of his crime, and his planned participationin a prison hunger strike, it was "unable to conclude that533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN686 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the CourtMr. Ma would remain nonviolent and not violate the condi-tions of release." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-38, p. 87a.In 1999, Ma filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. A panel of five judges in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington,considering Ma's and about 100 similar cases together, issueda joint order holding that the Constitution forbids post-removal-period detention unless there is "a realistic chancethat [the] alien will be deported" (thereby permitting classi-fication of the detention as "in aid of deportation").BinhPhan v. Reno, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1156 (1999). The DistrictCourt then held an evidentiary hearing, decided that therewas no "realistic chance" that Cambodia (which has no repatriation treaty with the United States) would accept Ma, andordered Ma released. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-38,at 60a-61a.The Ninth Circuit affirmed Ma's release. Kim Ho Ma v.Reno, 208 F. 3d 815 (2000). It concluded, based in part onconstitutional concerns, that the statute did not authorizedetention for more than a "reasonable time" beyond the90-day period authorized for removal.Id., at 818. And,given the lack of a repatriation agreement with Cambodia,that time had expired upon passage of the 90 days. Id., at830-831.3Zadvydas asked us to review the decision of the Fifth Circuit authorizing his continued detention. The Governmentasked us to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit forbidding Ma's continued detention. We granted writs in bothcases, agreeing to consider both statutory and related constitutional questions. See also Duy Dac Ho v. Greene, 204F. 3d 1045, 1060 (CA10 2000) (upholding Attorney General'sstatutory and constitutional authority to detain alien indefi-nitely). We consolidated the two cases for argument; andwe now decide them together.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN687Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIIWe note at the outset that the primary federal habeas cor-pus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, confers jurisdiction uponthe federal courts to hear these cases. See $ 2241(c)(3)(authorizing any person to claim in federal court that heor she is being held "in custody in violation of the Con-stitution or laws . . . of the United States"). Before 1952,the federal courts considered challenges to the lawfulnessof immigration-related detention, including challenges tothe validity of a deportation order, in habeas proceedings.SeeHeikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, 230, 235-236 (1953).Beginning in 1952, an alternative method for review ofde-portation orders, namely, actions brought in federal districtcourt under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), be-came available. See Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48,51-52 (1955). And in 1961 Congress replaced district courtAPA review with initial deportation order review in courtsof appeals. See Act of Sept. 26, 1961, $ 5, 75 Stat. 651 (for-merly codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)) (repealed 1996). The1961 Act specified that federal habeas courts were also avail-able to hear statutory and constitutional challenges to deportation (and exclusion) orders. See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1105a(a)(10),(b) (repealed 1996). These statutory changes left habeas untouched as the basic method for obtaining review of contin-uedcustody after a deportation order had become final. SeeCheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212, 215-216 (1968)(holding that $ 1105a(a) applied only to challenges to determi-nations made during deportation proceedings and motions toreopen those proceedings).More recently, Congress has enacted several statutoryprovisions that limit the circumstances in which judicial re-view of deportation decisions is available. But none applieshere. One provision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(h) (1994 ed., Supp. V),simply forbids courts to construethat section "to createany . . . procedural right or benefit that is legally enforce533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN688 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtable"; it does not deprive an alien of the right to rely on 28U. S. C. $ 2241 to challenge detention that is without statutory authority.Another provision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (1994 ed.,Supp. V), says that "no court shall have jurisdiction to re-view" decisions "specified . . . to be in the discretion of theAttorney General." The aliens here, however, do not seekreview of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion;rather, they challenge the extent of the Attorney General'sauthority under the post-removal-period detention statute.And the extent of that authority is not a matter of discretion.See also,e. g., $ 1226(e) (applicable to certain detention-related decisions in period preceding entry of final removalorder); $ 1231(a)(4)(D) (applicable to assertion of causes orclaims under $ 1231(a)(4), which is not at issue here);$$ 1252(a)(1), (a)(2)(C) (applicable to judicial review of "finalorder[s] of removal"); $ 1252(g) (applicable to decisions "tocommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute re-moval orders").We conclude that $ 2241 habeas corpus proceedings remainavailable as a forum for statutory and constitutional challenges to post-removal-period detention. And we turn tothe merits of the aliens' claims.IIIThe post-removal-period detention statute applies to cer-tain categories of aliens who have been ordered removed,namely, inadmissible aliens, criminal aliens, aliens who haveviolated their nonimmigrant status conditions, and aliens removable for certain national security or foreign relationsreasons, as well as any alien "who has been determined bythe Attorney General to be a risk to the community orunlikely to comply with the order of removal." 8 U. S. C.$ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V); see also 8 CFR $ 241.4(a)(2001). It says that an alien who falls into one of these cate533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN689Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the Courtgories "may be detained beyond the removal period and, ifreleased, shall be subject to [certain] terms of supervision."8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V).The Government argues that the statute means what itliterally says. It sets no "limit on the length of time beyondthe removal period that an alien who falls within one of theSection 1231(a)(6) categories may be detained." Brief forPetitioners in No. 00-38, p. 22. Hence, "whether to continueto detain such an alien and, if so, in what circumstances andfor how long" is up to the Attorney General, not up to thecourts. Ibid."[I]t is a cardinal principle" of statutory interpretation,however, that when an Act of Congress raises "a seriousdoubt" as to its constitutionality, "this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possibleby which the question may be avoided." Crowell v. Benson,285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932); see also United States v. X-CitementVideo, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78 (1994); United States v. Jin FueyMoy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916); cf. Almendarez-Torres v.United States, 523 U. S. 224, 238 (1998) (construction of statute that avoids invalidation best reflects congressional will).We have read significant limitations into other immigrationstatutes in order to avoid their constitutional invalidation.See United States v. Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194, 195, 202 (1957)(construing a grant of authority to the Attorney General toask aliens whatever questions he "deem[s] fit and proper"as limited to questions "reasonably calculated to keep theAttorney General advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue").For similar reasons, we read an implicit limitation into thestatute before us. In our view, the statute, read in light ofthe Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removalperiod detention to a period reasonably necessary to bringabout that alien's removal from the United States. It doesnot permit indefinite detention.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN690 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the CourtAA statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien wouldraise a serious constitutional problem. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause forbids the Government to "de-priv[e]" any "person . . . of . . . liberty . . . without due processof law." Freedom from imprisonment--from governmentcustody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint--liesat the heart of the liberty that Clause protects. See Fouchav.Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992). And this Court hassaid that government detention violates that Clause unlessthe detention is ordered in a criminal proceeding with ade-quate procedural protections, seeUnited States v. Salerno,481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987), or, in certain special and "narrow"nonpunitive "circumstances," Foucha, supra, at 80, where aspecial justification, such as harm-threatening mental illness,outweighs the "individual's constitutionally protected inter-est in avoiding physical restraint." Kansas v. Hendricks,521 U. S. 346, 356 (1997).The proceedings at issue here are civil, not criminal, andwe assume that they are nonpunitive in purpose and effect.There is no sufficiently strong special justification here forindefinite civil detention--at least as administered under thisstatute. The statute, says the Government, has two regulatory goals: "ensuring the appearance of aliens at future im-migration proceedings" and "[p]reventing danger to the community." Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 24. Butby definition the first justification--preventing flight--isweak or nonexistent where removal seems a remote possibility at best. As this Court said in Jackson v. Indiana, 406U. S. 715 (1972), where detention's goal is no longer practically attainable, detention no longer "bear[s] [a] reasonablerelation to the purpose for which the individual [was] committed." Id., at 738.The second justification--protecting the community--doesnot necessarily diminish in force over time. But we have533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN691Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the Courtupheld preventive detention based on dangerousness onlywhen limited to specially dangerous individuals and subjectto strong procedural protections. Compare Hendricks,supra, at 368 (upholding scheme that imposes detention upon"a small segment of particularly dangerous individuals" andprovides "strict procedural safeguards"), and Salerno, supra,at 747, 750-752 (in upholding pretrial detention, stressing"stringent time limitations," the fact that detention is reserved for the "most serious of crimes," the requirement ofproof of dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence, andthe presence of judicial safeguards), with Foucha, supra, at81-83 (striking down insanity-related detention system thatplaced burden on detainee to prove nondangerousness). Incases in which preventive detention is of potentially indefinite duration, we have also demanded that the dangerousness rationale be accompanied by some other special circumstance, such as mental illness, that helps to create thedanger. See Hendricks, supra, at 358, 368.The civil confinement here at issue is not limited, but potentially permanent. Cf. Salerno, supra, at 747 (noting that"maximum length of pretrial detention is limited" by "stringent" requirements); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 545-546 (1952) (upholding temporary detention of alien duringdeportation proceeding while noting that "problem of . . .unusual delay" was not present). The provision authorizingdetention does not apply narrowly to "a small segment ofparticularly dangerous individuals," Hendricks, supra, at368, say, suspected terrorists, but broadly to aliens orderedremoved for many and various reasons, including tourist visaviolations. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V)(referencing $ 1227(a)(1)(C)); cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 357-358 (only individuals with "past sexually violent behaviorand a present mental condition that creates a likelihood ofsuch conduct in the future" may be detained). And, oncethe flight risk justification evaporates, the only special cir533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN692 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtcumstance present is the alien's removable status itself,which bears no relation to a detainee's dangerousness. Cf.id., at 358; Foucha, supra, at 82.Moreover, the sole procedural protections available to thealien are found in administrative proceedings, where thealien bears the burden of proving he is not dangerous, without (in the Government's view) significant later judicial review. Compare 8 CFR $ 241.4(d)(1) (2001) (imposing burdenof proving nondangerousness upon alien) withFoucha,supra, at 82 (striking down insanity-related detention forthat very reason). This Court has suggested, however, thatthe Constitution may well preclude granting "an administrative body the unreviewable authority to make determinations implicating fundamental rights." Superintendent,Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S.445, 450 (1985) (O'Connor, J.); see also Crowell, 285 U. S., at87 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) ("[U]nder certain circumstances,the constitutional requirement of due process is a requirement of judicial process"). The Constitution demandsgreater procedural protection even for property. See SouthCarolina v. Regan, 465 U. S. 367, 393 (1984) (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment); Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U. S.589, 595-597 (1931) (Brandeis, J.). The serious constitutional problem arising out of a statute that, in these circumstances, permits an indefinite, perhaps permanent, deprivation of human liberty without any such protection is obvious.The Government argues that, from a constitutional perspective, alien status itself can justify indefinite detention,and points to Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,345 U. S. 206 (1953), as support. That case involved a oncelawfully admitted alien who left the United States, returnedafter a trip abroad, was refused admission, and was left onEllis Island, indefinitely detained there because the Government could not find another country to accept him. TheCourt held that Mezei's detention did not violate the Constitution. Id., at 215-216.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN693Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the CourtAlthough Mezei, like the present cases, involves indefinitedetention, it differs from the present cases in a critical respect. As the Court emphasized, the alien's extended de-parture from the United States required him to seek entryinto this country once again. His presence on Ellis Islanddid not count as entry into the United States. Hence, hewas "treated," for constitutional purposes, "as if stoppedat the border." Id., at 213, 215. And that made all thedifference.The distinction between an alien who has effected an entryinto the United States and one who has never entered runsthroughout immigration law. See Kaplan v. Tod, 267 U. S.228, 230 (1925) (despite nine years' presence in the UnitedStates, an "excluded" alien "was still in theory of law at theboundary line and had gained no foothold in the UnitedStates"); Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U. S. 185, 188-190(1958) (alien "paroled" into the United States pending admissibility had not effected an "entry"). It is well establishedthat certain constitutional protections available to personsinside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside ofour geographic borders. See United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 269 (1990) (Fifth Amendment's protections do not extend to aliens outside the territorial boundaries); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 784 (1950)(same). But once an alien enters the country, the legalcircumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause appliesto all "persons" within the United States, including aliens,whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary,or permanent. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 210 (1982);Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 77 (1976); Kwong Hai Chewv. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596-598, and n. 5 (1953); Yick Wov. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369 (1886); cf. Mezei, supra, at 212("[A]liens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming totraditional standards of fairness encompassed in due processof law"). Indeed, this Court has held that the Due Process533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN694 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the CourtClause protects an alien subject to a final order of deporta-tion, seeWong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238(1896), though the nature of that protection may vary de-pending upon status and circumstance, seeLandon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32-34 (1982); Johnson, supra, at 770.InWong Wing, supra, the Court held unconstitutional astatute that imposed a year of hard labor upon aliens subjectto a final deportation order. That case concerned substan-tive protections for aliens who had been ordered removed,not procedural protections for aliens whose removability wasbeing determined. Cf.post, at 704 (Scalia, J., dissenting).The Court held that punitive measures could not be imposedupon aliens ordered removed because "all persons within theterritory of the United States are entitled to the protection"of the Constitution. 163 U. S., at 238 (citing Yick Wo, supra,at 369 (holding that equal protection guarantee applies toChinese aliens)); see also Witkovich, 353 U. S., at 199, 201(construing statute which applied to aliens ordered deportedin order to avoid substantive constitutional problems). Andcontrary to Justice Scalia's characterization, see post, at703-705, in Mezei itself, both this Court's rejection of Mezei'schallenge to the procedures by which he was deemed excludable and its rejection of his challenge to continued detentionrested upon a basic territorial distinction. See Mezei,supra, at 215 (holding that Mezei's presence on Ellis Islandwas not "considered a landing" and did "not affec[t]" his legalor constitutional status (internal quotation marks omitted)).In light of this critical distinction between Mezei and thepresent cases, Mezei does not offer the Government significant support, and we need not consider the aliens' claim thatsubsequent developments have undermined Mezei's legalauthority.

Seepost, at 717-722 (dissenting opinion).The Government also looks for support to cases holdingthat Congress has "plenary power" to create immigrationlaw, and that the Judicial Branch must defer to Executiveand Legislative Branch decisionmaking in that area. Brieffor Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 17, 20 (citing Harisiadesv.Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580, 588-589 (1952)). But thatpower is subject to important constitutional limitations.SeeINS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 941-942 (1983) (Congressmust choose "a constitutionally permissible means of implementing" that power); The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130U. S. 581, 604 (1889) (congressional authority limited "by theConstitution itself and considerations of public policy andjustice which control, more or less, the conduct of all civilizednations"). In these cases, we focus upon those limitations.In doing so, we nowhere deny the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject them to supervision with conditionswhen released from detention, or to incarcerate them whereappropriate for violations of those conditions. See 8 U. S. C.$ 1231(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (granting authority to Attorney General to prescribe regulations governing supervision of aliens not removed within 90 days); $ 1253 (imposingpenalties for failure to comply with release conditions).The question before us is not one of " `confer[ring] on thoseadmitted the right to remain against the national will' "or " `sufferance of aliens' " who should be removed. Post,at 703 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted) (quoting Mezei, 345 U. S., at 222-223 (Jackson, J., dissenting)).Rather, the issue we address is whether aliens that the Government finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned toan indefinite term of imprisonment within the United States.Nor do the cases before us require us to consider the political branches' authority to control entry into the UnitedStates.

Neitherdo we consider terrorism or other special circumstanceswhere special arguments might be made for forms of preven-tive detention and for heightened deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters ofnational security. The sole foreign policy consideration theGovernment mentions here is the concern lest courts inter-fere with "sensitive" repatriation negotiations. Brief forRespondents in No. 99-7791, at 21. But neither the Govern-ment nor the dissents explain how a habeas court's effortsto determine the likelihood of repatriation, if handled withappropriate sensitivity, could make a significant difference inthis respect. See infra, at 699-700.Finally, the Government argues that, whatever liberty interest the aliens possess, it is "greatly diminished" by theirlack of a legal right to "liv[e] at large in this country." Brieffor Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 47; see also post, at 703(Scalia, J., dissenting) (characterizing right at issue as"right to release into this country"). The choice, however,is not between imprisonment and the alien "living at large."Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 47. It is betweenimprisonment and supervision under release conditions thatmay not be violated. See supra, at 695 (citing 8 U. S. C.$$ 1231(a)(3), 1253 (1994 ed., Supp. V)); 8 CFR $ 241.5 (2001)(establishing conditions of release after removal period).And, for the reasons we have set forth, we believe that analien's liberty interest is, at the least, strong enough to raisea serious question as to whether, irrespective of the procedures used, cf. post, at 722-724 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), theConstitution permits detention that is indefinite and potentially permanent. BDespite this constitutional problem, if "Congress has madeits intent" in the statute "clear, `we must give effect to thatintent.' " Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 336 (2000) (quotingSinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 215 (1962)).533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN697Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the CourtWe cannot find here, however, any clear indication of con-gressional intent to grant the Attorney General the powerto hold indefinitely in confinement an alien ordered removed.And that is so whether protecting the community from dangerous aliens is a primary or (as we believe) secondary statu-tory purpose. Cf.post, at 706, 708-709 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). After all, the provision is part of a statute thathas as its basic purpose effectuating an alien's removal.Why should we assume that Congress saw the alien's dangerousness as unrelated to this purpose?The Government points to the statute's word "may." Butwhile "may" suggests discretion, it does not necessarily suggest unlimited discretion. In that respect the word "may"is ambiguous. Indeed, if Congress had meant to authorizelong-term detention of unremovable aliens, it certainly couldhave spoken in clearer terms. Cf. 8 U. S. C. $ 1537(b)(2)(C)(1994 ed., Supp. V) ("If no country is willing to receive" aterrorist alien ordered removed, "the Attorney General may,notwithstanding any other provision of law, retain the alienin custody" and must review the detention determinationevery six months).The Government points to similar related statutes that require detention of criminal aliens during removal proceedings and the removal period, and argues that these show thatmandatory detention is the rule while discretionary releaseis the narrow exception. See Brief for Petitioners inNo. 00-38, at 26-28 (citing 8 U. S. C. $$ 1226(c), 1231(a)(2)).But the statute before us applies not only to terrorists andcriminals, but also to ordinary visa violators, see supra, at691; and, more importantly, post-removal-period detention,unlike detention pending a determination of removability orduring the subsequent 90-day removal period, has no obvioustermination point.The Government also points to the statute's history. Thathistory catalogs a series of changes, from an initial period(before 1952) when lower courts had interpreted statutory533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN698 ZADVYDAS v.

And later that year Congress enacted the presentlaw, which liberalizes pre-existing law by shortening the removal period from six months to 90 days, mandates detentionof certain criminal aliens during the removal proceedingsand for the subsequent 90-day removal period, and adds thepost-removal-period provision here at issue.

S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the CourtWe have found nothing in the history of these statutesthat clearly demonstrates a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention. Consequently,interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutionalthreat, we conclude that, once removal is no longer reason-ably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorizedby statute. See 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b ("Cessante ratione legis cessat ipse lex") (the rationale of a legal rule nolonger being applicable, that rule itself no longer applies).IVThe Government seems to argue that, even under our in-terpretation of the statute, a federal habeas court wouldhave to accept the Government's view about whether theimplicit statutory limitation is satisfied in a particular case,conducting little or no independent review of the matter. Inour view, that is not so. Whether a set of particular circumstances amounts to detention within, or beyond, a period rea-sonably necessary to secure removal is determinative ofwhether the detention is, or is not, pursuant to statutoryauthority. The basic federal habeas corpus statute grantsthe federal courts authority to answer that question. See 28U. S. C. $ 2241(c)(3) (granting courts authority to determinewhether detention is "in violation of the . . . laws . . . of theUnited States"). In doing so the courts carry out what thisCourt has described as the "historic purpose of the writ,"namely, "to relieve detention by executive authorities without judicial trial." Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 533 (1953)(Jackson, J., concurring in result).In answering that basic question, the habeas court mustask whether the detention in question exceeds a period reasonably necessary to secure removal. It should measurereasonableness primarily in terms of the statute's basic purpose, namely, assuring the alien's presence at the moment ofremoval. Thus, if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, thecourt should hold continued detention unreasonable and no533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN700 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtlonger authorized by statute. In that case, of course, thealien's release may and should be conditioned on any of thevarious forms of supervised release that are appropriate inthe circumstances, and the alien may no doubt be returnedto custody upon a violation of those conditions. See supra,at 695 (citing 8 U. S. C. $$ 1231(a)(3), 1253 (1994 ed., Supp. V);8 CFR $ 241.5 (2001)). And if removal is reasonably foreseeable, the habeas court should consider the risk of the alien'scommitting further crimes as a factor potentially justifyingconfinement within that reasonable removal period. Seesupra, at 690-692.We recognize, as the Government points out, that reviewmust take appropriate account of the greater immigrationrelated expertise of the Executive Branch, of the serious administrative needs and concerns inherent in the necessarilyextensive INS efforts to enforce this complex statute, andthe Nation's need to "speak with one voice" in immigrationmatters. Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 19. Butwe believe that courts can take appropriate account of suchmatters without abdicating their legal responsibility to review the lawfulness of an alien's continued detention.Ordinary principles of judicial review in this area recognize primary Executive Branch responsibility. They counseljudges to give expert agencies decisionmaking leeway inmatters that invoke their expertise. See Pension BenefitGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 651-652(1990). They recognize Executive Branch primacy in foreign policy matters. See Container Corp. of America v.Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 196 (1983). And they consequently require courts to listen with care when the Government's foreign policy judgments, including, for example,the status of repatriation negotiations, are at issue, and togrant the Government appropriate leeway when its judgments rest upon foreign policy expertise.We realize that recognizing this necessary Executive leeway will often call for difficult judgments. In order to limit533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN701Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthe occasions when courts will need to make them, we thinkit practically necessary to recognize some presumptively reasonable period of detention. We have adopted similar presumptions in other contexts to guide lower court determinations. See Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373, 379-380(1966) (plurality opinion) (adopting rule, based on definitionof "petty offense" in United States Code, that right to jurytrial extends to all cases in which sentence of six months orgreater is imposed); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500U. S. 44, 56-58 (1991) (O'Connor, J.) (adopting presumption,based on lower court estimate of time needed to process arrestee, that 48-hour delay in probable-cause hearing afterarrest is reasonable, hence constitutionally permissible).While an argument can be made for confining any presumption to 90 days, we doubt that when Congress shortened the removal period to 90 days in 1996 it believed thatall reasonably foreseeable removals could be accomplishedin that time. We do have reason to believe, however, thatCongress previously doubted the constitutionality of detention for more than six months. See Juris. Statement inUnited States v. Witkovich, O. T. 1956, No. 295, pp. 8-9.Consequently, for the sake of uniform administration in thefederal courts, we recognize that period. After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believethat there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respondwith evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the "reasonablyforeseeable future" conversely would have to shrink. This6-month presumption, of course, does not mean that everyalien not removed must be released after six months. Tothe contrary, an alien may be held in confinement until ithas been determined that there is no significant likelihood ofremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future.533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN702 ZADVYDAS v. DAVISScalia, J., dissentingVThe Fifth Circuit held Zadvydas' continued detention lawful as long as "good faith efforts to effectuate . . . deportationcontinue" and Zadvydas failed to show that deportation willprove "impossible." 185 F. 3d, at 294, 297. But this standard would seem to require an alien seeking release to showthe absence of any prospect of removal--no matter how unlikely or unforeseeable--which demands more than our reading of the statute can bear. The Ninth Circuit held that theGovernment was required to release Ma from detention because there was no reasonable likelihood of his removal inthe foreseeable future. 208 F. 3d, at 831. But its conclusionmay have rested solely upon the "absence" of an "extant orpending" repatriation agreement without giving due weightto the likelihood of successful future negotiations. See id.,at 831, and n. 30. Consequently, we vacate the judgmentsbelow and remand both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
