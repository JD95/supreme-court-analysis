Iowa taxes adjusted revenues from slot machines on ex-cursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20 percent. IowaCode $ 99F.11 (2003). Iowa law provides for a maximum taxrate of 36 percent on adjusted revenues from slot machinesat racetracks. $$ 99F.4A(6), 99F.11. The Iowa SupremeCourt held that this 20 percent/36 percent difference in taxrates violates the Federal Constitution's Equal ProtectionClause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. 648 N. W. 2d 555 (2002). We disagree and reverse the Iowa Supreme Court's determination.IBefore 1989, Iowa permitted only one form of gambling--parimutuel betting at racetracks--the proceeds of which ittaxed at a six percent rate. Iowa Code $ 99D.15 (1984). In1989, it authorized other forms of gambling, including slotmachines and other gambling games on riverboats, though itlimited bets to $5 and losses to $200 per excursion. 1989Iowa Acts ch. 67, $$ 3, 9(2); Iowa Code $ 99F.3 (1996). Iowataxed adjusted revenues from slot machine gambling atgraduated rates, with a top rate of 20 percent. 1989 IowaActs ch. 67, $ 11; Iowa Code $ 99F.11 (1996).In 1994, Iowa enacted a law that, among other things, re-moved the riverboat gambling $5/$200 bet/loss limits, 1994Iowa Acts ch. 1021, $ 19, authorized racetracks to operateslot machines, $ 13; Iowa Code $$ 99F.1(9), 99F.4A (1996), andimposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine ad-justed revenues with a top rate that started at 20 percentand would automatically rise over time to 36 percent, 1994Iowa Acts ch. 1021, $ 25; Iowa Code $ 99F.11 (1996). The Actdid not alter the tax rate on riverboat slot machine adjustedrevenues, thereby leaving the existing 20 percent rate inplace. Ibid.Respondents, a group of racetracks and an association ofdog owners, brought this lawsuit in state court challengingthe 1994 legislation on the ground that the 20 percent/36 per539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN106 FITZGERALD v. RACING ASSN. OF CENTRAL IOWAOpinion of the Courtcent tax rate difference that it created violated the FederalConstitution's Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. TheState District Court upheld the statute. The Iowa SupremeCourt disagreed and, by a 4-to-3 vote, reversed the DistrictCourt. The majority wrote that the "differential tax com-pletely defeats the alleged purpose" of the statute, namely,"to help the racetracks recover from economic distress," thatthere could "be no rational reason for this differential tax,"and that the Equal Protection Clause consequently forbidsits imposition. 648 N. W. 2d, at 560-562. We granted certiorari to review this determination.IIRespondents initially claim that the Iowa Supreme Court'sdecision rests independently upon state law. And theyargue that this state-law holding bars review of the federalissue. We disagree. The Iowa Supreme Court's opinion,after setting forth the language of both State and FederalEqual Protection Clauses, says that "Iowa courts are to`apply the same analysis in considering the state equal pro-tection claims as . . . in considering the federal equal protection claim.' " Id., at 558. We have previously held that, insuch circumstances, we shall consider a state-court decisionas resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support thisCourt's jurisdiction. SeePennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S.582, 588, n. 4 (1990) (no adequate and independent stateground where the court says that state and federal constitu-tional protections are " `identical' "). Cf.Michigan v. Long,463 U. S. 1032, 1041-1042 (1983) ( jurisdiction exists wherefederal cases are not "being used only for the purpose ofguidance" and instead are "compel[ling] the result"). Wetherefore find that this Court has jurisdiction to review theIowa Supreme Court's determination.IIIWe here consider whether a difference in state tax ratesviolates the Fourteenth Amendment's mandate that "[n]o539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN107Cite as: 539 U. S. 103 (2003)Opinion of the CourtState shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protectionof the laws," $ 1. The law in question does not distinguishon the basis of, for example, race or gender. See, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); United States v. Virginia,518 U. S. 515 (1996). It does not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state businesses. See,e. g., MetropolitanLife Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985). Neither does itfavor a State's long-time residents at the expense of resi-dents who have more recently arrived from other States.Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612(1985). Rather, the law distinguishes for tax purposesamong revenues obtained within the State of Iowa by twoenterprises, each of which does business in the State.Where that is so, the law is subject to rational-basis review:"[T]he Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long asthere is a plausible policy reason for the classification,the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to betrue by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenu-ated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational."Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992) (citationsomitted).See also id., at 11 (rational-basis review "is especially defer-ential in the context of classifications made by complex taxlaws"); Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522,527 (1959) (the Equal Protection Clause requires States,when enacting tax laws, to "proceed upon a rational ba-sis" and not to "resort to a classification that is palpablyarbitrary").The Iowa Supreme Court found that the 20 percent/36percent tax rate differential failed to meet this standardbecause, in its view, that difference "frustrated" what itsaw as the law's basic objective, namely, rescuing the racetracks from economic distress. 648 N. W. 2d, at 561. And539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN108 FITZGERALD v. RACING ASSN. OF CENTRAL IOWAOpinion of the Courtno rational person, it believed, could claim the contrary. Id.,at 561-562.The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, thatthe Iowa law, like most laws, might predominantly serve onegeneral objective, say, helping the racetracks, while contain-ing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable(perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing alaw that balances objectives but still serves the general ob-jective when seen as a whole. SeeRailroad Retirement Bd.v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 181 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment) (legislation is often the "product of multiple andsomewhat inconsistent purposes that led to certain compromises"). After all, if every subsidiary provision in a law designed to help racetracks had to help those racetracks andnothing more, then (since any tax rate hurts the racetrackswhen compared with a lower rate) there could be no taxationof the racetracks at all.Neither could the Iowa Supreme Court deny that the 1994legislation, seen as a whole, can rationally be understood todo what that court says it seeks to do, namely, advance theracetracks' economic interests. Its grant to the racetracksof authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree--even if its simultaneousimposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenues meansthat the law provides less help than respondents might like.At least a rational legislator might so believe. And theConstitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority(within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wishto help with their tax laws and how much help those lawsought to provide. "The `task of classifying persons for . . .benefits . . . inevitably requires that some persons who havean almost equally strong claim to favored treatment beplaced on different sides of the line,' and the fact the linemight have been drawn differently at some points is a matterfor legislative, rather than judicial, consideration." Id., at179 (citation omitted). See also ibid. ( judicial review is "at539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN109Cite as: 539 U. S. 103 (2003)Opinion of the Courtan end" once the court identifies a plausible basis on whichthe legislature may have relied);Nordlinger, supra, at 17-18.Once one realizes that not every provision in a law mustshare a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differ-ential here at issue. That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondentsconcede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respond-ents 8. See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557. These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin. Each re-flects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.And aside from simply aiding the financial position of theriverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage theeconomic development of river communities or to promoteriverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboatsto remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76-84, 86. Alternatively, they may havewanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previouslybeen taxed at the 20 percent rate. All these objectives arerational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could furtherand which suffice to uphold the different tax rates. See Allied Stores, supra, at 528; Nordlinger, supra, at 12. Seealso Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88 (1940) (imposingburden on respondents to "negative every conceivable basis"that might support different treatment).Respondents argue that Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), holds tothe contrary. Brief for Respondents 21. In that case, theCourt held that substantial differences in the level of property tax assessments that West Virginia imposed upon similar properties violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.But the Court later stated, when it upheld in Nordlingera California statute creating similar differences in propertytaxes, that "an obvious and critical factual difference be539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN110 FITZGERALD v. RACING ASSN. OF CENTRAL IOWAOpinion of the Courttween this case and Allegheny Pittsburgh is the absence ofany indication in Allegheny Pittsburgh that the policies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme could conceiv-ably have been the purpose for the . . . unequal assessment."505 U. S., at 14-15. The Court in Nordlinger added that"Allegheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the factsprecluded any plausible inference that the reason for theunequal assessment practice was to achieve the benefits ofan acquisition-value tax scheme." Id., at 16-17, and n. 7.Here, "the facts" do not "preclud[e]" an inference that thereason for the different tax rates was to help the riverboatindustry or the river communities.Id., at 16.IVWe conclude that there is "a plausible policy reason for theclassification," that the legislature "rationally may have . . .considered . . . true" the related justifying "legislative facts,"and that the "relationship of the classification to its goal isnot so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary orirrational." Id., at 11. Consequently the State's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal ProtectionClause. The Iowa Supreme Court's judgment to the contrary is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
