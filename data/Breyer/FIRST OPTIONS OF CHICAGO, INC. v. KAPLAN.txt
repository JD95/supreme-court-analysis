In this case we consider two questions about how courtsshould review certain matters under the federal ArbitrationAct, 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V): (1) how adistrict court should review an arbitrator's decision that theparties agreed to arbitrate a dispute, and (2) how a court ofappeals should review a district court's decision confirming,or refusing to vacate, an arbitration award.IThe case concerns several related disputes between, onone side, First Options of Chicago, Inc., a firm that clearsstock trades on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and, onthe other side, three parties: Manuel Kaplan; his wife, CarolKaplan; and his wholly owned investment company, MK Investments, Inc. (MKI), whose trading account First Optionscleared. The disputes center on a "workout" agreement,embodied in four separate documents, which governs the"working out" of debts to First Options that MKI and theKaplans incurred as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash. In 1989, after entering into the agreement, MKIlost an additional $1.5 million. First Options then took control of, and liquidated, certain MKI assets; demanded immediate payment of the entire MKI debt; and insisted that theKaplans personally pay any deficiency. When its demandswent unsatisfied, First Options sought arbitration by a panelof the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the National Futures Association et al. by Daniel J. Roth; and for the Philadelphia StockExchange, Inc., et al. by Lydia Gavalis.Gerald F. Rath, Steven W. Hansen, and Stuart J. Kaswell filed a brieffor the Securities Industry Association as amicus curiae.514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT941Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)Opinion of the CourtMKI, having signed the only workout document (out offour) that contained an arbitration clause, accepted arbitration. The Kaplans, however, who had not personally signedthat document, denied that their disagreement with FirstOptions was arbitrable and filed written objections to thateffect with the arbitration panel. The arbitrators decidedthat they had the power to rule on the merits of the parties'dispute, and did so in favor of First Options. The Kaplansthen asked the Federal District Court to vacate the arbitration award, see 9 U. S. C. $ 10 (1988 ed., Supp. V), and FirstOptions requested its confirmation, see $ 9. The court confirmed the award. Nonetheless, on appeal the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with the Kaplans thattheir dispute was not arbitrable; and it reversed the DistrictCourt's confirmation of the award against them. 19 F. 3d1503 (1994).We granted certiorari to consider two questions regardingthe standards that the Court of Appeals used to review thedetermination that the Kaplans' dispute with First Optionswas arbitrable. 513 U. S. 1040 (1994). First, the Court ofAppeals said that courts "should independently decidewhether an arbitration panel has jurisdiction over the meritsof any particular dispute." 19 F. 3d, at 1509 (emphasisadded). First Options asked us to decide whether this is so(i. e., whether courts, in "reviewing the arbitrators' decisionon arbitrability," should "apply a de novo standard of reviewor the more deferential standard applied to arbitrators' decisions on the merits") when the objecting party "submittedthe issue to the arbitrators for decision." Pet. for Cert. i.Second, the Court of Appeals stated that it would reviewa district court's denial of a motion to vacate a commercialarbitration award (and the correlative grant of a motion toconfirm it) "de novo." 19 F. 3d, at 1509. First Options argues that the Court of Appeals instead should have appliedan "abuse of discretion" standard. See Robbins v. Day, 954F. 2d 679, 681-682 (CA11 1992).514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT942 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLANOpinion of the CourtIIThe first question--the standard of review applied to anarbitrator's decision about arbitrability--is a narrow one.To understand just how narrow, consider three types ofdisagreement present in this case. First, the Kaplansand First Options disagree about whether the Kaplans arepersonally liable for MKI's debt to First Options. Thatdisagreement makes up the merits of the dispute. Second,they disagree about whether they agreed to arbitrate themerits. That disagreement is about the arbitrability of thedispute. Third, they disagree about who should have theprimary power to decide the second matter. Does thatpower belong primarily to the arbitrators (because the courtreviews their arbitrability decision deferentially) or to thecourt (because the court makes up its mind about arbitrability independently)? We consider here only this thirdquestion.Although the question is a narrow one, it has a certainpractical importance. That is because a party who has notagreed to arbitrate will normally have a right to a court'sdecision about the merits of its dispute (say, as here, its obligation under a contract). But, where the party has agreedto arbitrate, he or she, in effect, has relinquished much ofthat right's practical value. The party still can ask a courtto review the arbitrator's decision, but the court will set thatdecision aside only in very unusual circumstances. See, e. g.,9 U. S. C. $ 10 (award procured by corruption, fraud, or unduemeans; arbitrator exceeded his powers); Wilko v. Swan, 346U. S. 427, 436-437 (1953) (parties bound by arbitrator's decision not in "manifest disregard" of the law), overruled onother grounds, Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/AmericanExpress, Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989). Hence, who--court orarbitrator--has the primary authority to decide whether aparty has agreed to arbitrate can make a critical differenceto a party resisting arbitration.514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT943Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)Opinion of the CourtWe believe the answer to the "who" question (i. e., thestandard-of-review question) is fairly simple. Just as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whetherthe parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute, see, e. g., Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., ante, at 57; Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473U. S. 614, 626 (1985), so the question "who has the primarypower to decide arbitrability" turns upon what the partiesagreed about that matter. Did the parties agree to submitthe arbitrability question itself to arbitration? If so, thenthe court's standard for reviewing the arbitrator's decisionabout that matter should not differ from the standard courtsapply when they review any other matter that parties haveagreed to arbitrate. See AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986) (parties mayagree to arbitrate arbitrability); Steelworkers v. Warrior &Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 583, n. 7 (1960) (same). Thatis to say, the court should give considerable leeway to thearbitrator, setting aside his or her decision only in certainnarrow circumstances. See, e. g., 9 U. S. C. $ 10. If, on theother hand, the parties did not agree to submit the arbitrability question itself to arbitration, then the court should decide that question just as it would decide any other questionthat the parties did not submit to arbitration, namely, independently. These two answers flow inexorably from the factthat arbitration is simply a matter of contract between theparties; it is a way to resolve those disputes--but only thosedisputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration. See, e. g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 649; Mastrobuono, ante, at 57-58, and n. 9; Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 271 (1995); Mitsubishi MotorsCorp., supra, at 625-626.We agree with First Options, therefore, that a court mustdefer to an arbitrator's arbitrability decision when the parties submitted that matter to arbitration. Nevertheless,514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT944 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLANOpinion of the Courtthat conclusion does not help First Options win this case.That is because a fair and complete answer to the standardof-review question requires a word about how a court shoulddecide whether the parties have agreed to submit the arbitrability issue to arbitration. And, that word makes clearthat the Kaplans did not agree to arbitrate arbitrability here.When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate acertain matter (including arbitrability), courts generally(though with a qualification we discuss below) should applyordinary state-law principles that govern the formation ofcontracts. See,e. g., Mastrobuono, ante, at 62-63, and n. 9;Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 475-476 (1989);Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492-493, n. 9 (1987); G.Wilner, 1 Domke on Commercial Arbitration $ 4:04, p. 15 (rev.ed. Supp. 1993) (hereinafter Domke). The relevant statelaw here, for example, would require the court to seewhether the parties objectively revealed an intent to submitthe arbitrability issue to arbitration. See, e. g., Estate ofJesmer v. Rohlev, 241 Ill. App. 3d 798, 803, 609 N. E. 2d 816,820 (1993) (law of the State whose law governs the workoutagreement); Burkett v. Allstate Ins. Co., 368 Pa. 600, 608, 534A. 2d 819, 823-824 (1987) (law of the State where theKaplans objected to arbitrability). See generally Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 626.This Court, however, has (as we just said) added an important qualification, applicable when courts decide whether aparty has agreed that arbitrators should decide arbitrability:Courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is "clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]"evidence that they did so. AT&T Technologies, supra, at649; see Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 583, n. 7. In this mannerthe law treats silence or ambiguity about the question "who(primarily) should decide arbitrability" differently from theway it treats silence or ambiguity about the question"whether a particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable be514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT945Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcause it is within the scope of a valid arbitration agree-ment"--for in respect to this latter question the law reversesthe presumption. See Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 626(" `[A]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issuesshould be resolved in favor of arbitration' ") (quoting MosesH. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983));Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 582-583.But, this difference in treatment is understandable. Thelatter question arises when the parties have a contract thatprovides for arbitration of some issues. In such circum-stances, the parties likely gave at least some thought to thescope of arbitration. And, given the law's permissive policies in respect to arbitration, see, e. g., Mitsubishi Motors,supra, at 626, one can understand why the law would insistupon clarity before concluding that the parties did not wantto arbitrate a related matter. See Domke $ 12.02, p. 156 (issues will be deemed arbitrable unless "it is clear that thearbitration clause has not included" them). On the otherhand, the former question--the "who (primarily) shoulddecide arbitrability" question--is rather arcane. A partyoften might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their ownpowers. Cf. Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1508-1509 (1959), cited in Warrior &Gulf, 363 U. S., at 583, n. 7. And, given the principle that aparty can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration, one can understandwhy courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguityon the "who should decide arbitrability" point as giving thearbitrators that power, for doing so might too often forceunwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonablywould have thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would decide.Ibid. See generally Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470U. S. 213, 219-220 (1985) (Arbitration Act's basic purpose isto "ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate").514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT946 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLANOpinion of the CourtOn the record before us, First Options cannot show thatthe Kaplans clearly agreed to have the arbitrators decide(i. e., to arbitrate) the question of arbitrability. First Op-tions relies on the Kaplans' filing with the arbitrators a written memorandum objecting to the arbitrators' jurisdiction.But merely arguing the arbitrability issue to an arbitratordoes not indicate a clear willingness to arbitrate that issue,i. e., a willingness to be effectively bound by the arbitrator'sdecision on that point. To the contrary, insofar as theKaplans were forcefully objecting to the arbitrators decidingtheir dispute with First Options, one naturally would thinkthat they did not want the arbitrators to have binding authority over them. This conclusion draws added supportfrom (1) an obvious explanation for the Kaplans' presencebefore the arbitrators (i. e., that MKI, Mr. Kaplan's whollyowned firm, was arbitrating workout agreement matters);and (2) Third Circuit law that suggested that the Kaplansmight argue arbitrability to the arbitrators without losingtheir right to independent court review, Teamsters v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Assn., 574 F. 2d 783, 786-788 (1978); see 19 F. 3d, at 1512, n. 13.First Options makes several counterarguments: (1) thatthe Kaplans had other ways to get an independent court decision on the question of arbitrability without arguing theissue to the arbitrators (e. g., by trying to enjoin the arbitration, or by refusing to participate in the arbitration and thendefending against a court petition First Options would havebrought to compel arbitration, see 9 U. S. C. $ 4); (2) that permitting parties to argue arbitrability to an arbitrator without being bound by the result would cause delay and wastein the resolution of disputes; and (3) that the Arbitration Acttherefore requires a presumption that the Kaplans agreed tobe bound by the arbitrators' decision, not the contrary. Thefirst of these points, however, while true, simply does not sayanything about whether the Kaplans intended to be bound bythe arbitrators' decision. The second point, too, is inconclu514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT947Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsive, for factual circumstances vary too greatly to permit aconfident conclusion about whether allowing the arbitrator tomake an initial (but independently reviewable) arbitrabilitydetermination would, in general, slow down the dispute resolution process. And, the third point is legally erroneous, forthere is no strong arbitration-related policy favoring FirstOptions in respect to its particular argument here. Afterall, the basic objective in this area is not to resolve disputesin the quickest manner possible, no matter what the parties'wishes,Dean Witter Reynolds, supra, at 219-220, but toensure that commercial arbitration agreements, like othercontracts, " `are enforced according to their terms,' " Mastrobuono, ante, at 54 (quoting Volt Information Sciences, 489U. S., at 479), and according to the intentions of the parties,Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 626. See Allied-Bruce, 513U. S., at 271. That policy favors the Kaplans, not FirstOptions.We conclude that, because the Kaplans did not clearlyagree to submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration,the Court of Appeals was correct in finding that the arbitrability of the Kaplan/First Options dispute was subject to in-dependent review by the courts.IIIWe turn next to the standard a court of appeals shouldapply when reviewing a district court decision that refusesto vacate, see 9 U. S. C. $ 10 (1988 ed., Supp. V), or confirms,see $ 9, an arbitration award. Although the Third Circuitsometimes used the words "de novo" to describe this stand-ard, its opinion makes clear that it simply believes (as do allCircuits but one) that there is no special standard governingits review of a district court's decision in these circumstances. Rather, review of, for example, a district court de-cision confirming an arbitration award on the ground that theparties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration shouldproceed like review of any other district court decision find514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT948 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLANOpinion of the Courting an agreement between parties, e. g., accepting findings offact that are not "clearly erroneous" but deciding questionsof law de novo. See 19 F. 3d, at 1509.One Court of Appeals, the Eleventh Circuit, has said something different. Because of federal policy favoring arbitration, that court says that it applies a specially lenient "abuseof discretion" standard (even as to questions of law) whenreviewing district court decisions that confirm (but not thosethat set aside) arbitration awards. See,e. g., Robbins v.Day, 954 F. 2d, at 681-682. First Options asks us to holdthat the Eleventh Circuit's view is correct.We believe, however, that the majority of Circuits is rightin saying that courts of appeals should apply ordinary, notspecial, standards when reviewing district court decisionsupholding arbitration awards. For one thing, it is undesirable to make the law more complicated by proliferating review standards without good reasons. More importantly,the reviewing attitude that a court of appeals takes towarda district court decision should depend upon "the respectiveinstitutional advantages of trial and appellate courts," notupon what standard of review will more likely produce a particular substantive result. Salve Regina College v. Russell,499 U. S. 225, 231-233 (1991). The law, for example, tells allcourts (trial and appellate) to give administrative agencies adegree of legal leeway when they review certain interpretations of the law that those agencies have made. See, e. g.,Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984). But no one, to ourknowledge, has suggested that this policy of giving leewayto agencies means that a court of appeals should give extraleeway to a district court decision that upholds an agency.Similarly, courts grant arbitrators considerable leeway whenreviewing most arbitration decisions; but that fact does notmean that appellate courts should give extra leeway to district courts that uphold arbitrators. First Options arguesthat the Arbitration Act is special because the Act, in one514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT949Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsection, allows courts of appeals to conduct interlocutoryreview of certain antiarbitration district court rulings (e. g.,orders enjoining arbitrations), but not those upholding ar-bitration (e. g., orders refusing to enjoin arbitrations). 9U. S. C. $ 16 (1988 ed., Supp. V). But that portion of the Actgoverns the timing of review; it is therefore too weak a support for the distinct claim that the court of appeals shoulduse a differentstandard when reviewing certain districtcourt decisions. The Act says nothing about standards ofreview.We conclude that the Court of Appeals used the properstandards for reviewing the District Court's arbitrabilitydeterminations.IVFinally, First Options argues that, even if we rule againstit on the standard-of-review questions, we nonethelessshould hold that the Court of Appeals erred in its ultimateconclusion that the merits of the Kaplan/First Options dispute were not arbitrable. This factbound issue is beyondthe scope of the questions we agreed to review.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
