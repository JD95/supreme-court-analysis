The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO or Act), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961et seq., makes it "unlaw-ful for any person employed by or associated with anyenterprise . . . to conduct or participate . . . in the conduct ofsuch enterprise's affairs" through the commission of two ormore statutorily defined crimes--which RICO calls "a pat-tern of racketeering activity." $ 1962(c). The languagesuggests, and lower courts have held, that this provisionforesees two separate entities, a "person" and a distinct"enterprise."This case focuses upon a person who is the president andsole shareholder of a closely held corporation. The plaintiffclaims that the president has conducted the corporation'saffairs through the forbidden "pattern," though for presentpurposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within thescope of his authority as the corporation's employee. Inthese circumstances, are there two entities, a "person" anda separate "enterprise"? Assuming, as we must given theposture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint aretrue, we conclude that the "person" and "enterprise" hereare distinct and that the RICO provision applies.Petitioner, Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., is a corpora-tion that promotes boxing matches.

And the Court ofAppeals affirmed that dismissal. 219 F. 3d 115 (CA2 2000)(per curiam). In the appellate court's view, $ 1962(c) appliesonly where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separateentities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs ofwhich that "person" improperly conducts. Id., at 116. Inthis instance, "it is undisputed that King was an employee"of the corporation Don King Productions and also "actingwithin the scope of his authority."Id., at 117. Under theCourt of Appeals' analysis, King, in a legal sense, was partof, not separate from, the corporation. There was no "person," distinct from the "enterprise," who improperly con-ducted the "enterprise's affairs." And thus $ 1962(c) did notapply. Ibid.Other Circuits, applying $ 1962(c) in roughly similar circumstances, have reached a contrary conclusion. See, e. g.,Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F. 3d1144, 1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide CasselL. P., 52 F. 3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. RoyalOaks Motor Car Co., 46 F. 3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Severv. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F. 2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992). Wegranted certiorari to resolve the conflict. We now agreewith these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's interpretation of $ 1962(c) is erroneous.We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establishliability under $ 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to bya different name. The statute's language, read as ordinaryEnglish, suggests that principle. The Act says that itapplies to "person[s]" who are "employed by or associatedwith" the "enterprise." $ 1962(c). In ordinary English onespeaks of employing, being employed by, or associating withothers, not oneself. See Webster's Third New InternationalDictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defin533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN162 CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KINGOpinion of the Courting "employ"). In addition, the Act's purposes are consist-ent with that principle. Whether the Act seeks to preventa person from victimizing, say, a small business, S. Rep.No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969), or to prevent a person from using acorporation for criminal purposes, National Organizationfor Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 259 (1994), theperson and the victim, or the person and the tool, are different entities, not the same.The Government reads $ 1962(c) "to require some distinctness between the RICO defendant and the RICO enter-prise." Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 11. Andit says that this requirement is "legally sound and workable." Ibid. We agree with its assessment, particularlyin light of the fact that 12 Courts of Appeals have interpreted the statute as embodying some such distinctness requirement without creating discernible mischief in the administration of RICO. See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.Williamson, 224 F. 3d 425, 445 (CA5 2000); United States v.Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F. 3d 1268, 1270 (CA11) (enbanc), cert. denied, 531 U.

S. 158 (2001)Opinion of the Courtdenied, 531 U. S. 1050 (2001). Indeed, this Court previouslyhas said that liability "depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the `enterprise's affairs,' not just their own affairs." Reves v. Ernst &Young, 507 U. S. 170, 185 (1993).While accepting the "distinctness" principle, we nonetheless disagree with the appellate court's application of thatprinciple to the present circumstances--circumstances inwhich a corporate employee, "acting within the scope ofhis authority," 219 F. 3d, at 117, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporateowner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rightsand responsibilities due to its different legal status. Andwe can find nothing in the statute that requires more "separateness" than that. Cf. McCullough v. Suter, 757 F. 2d 142,144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical separateness sufficient to be distinct under $ 1962(c)).Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the affairs of a corporation through illegal acts comes within theterms of a statute that forbids any "person" unlawfully toconduct an "enterprise," particularly when the statute explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual . . . capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," anddefines "enterprise" to include a "corporation." 18 U. S. C.$$ 1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employeeand the corporation are different "persons," even where theemployee is the corporation's sole owner. After all, incorporation's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, withlegal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges differentfrom those of the natural individuals who created it, who ownit, or whom it employs. See United States v. Bestfoods, 524U. S. 51, 61-62 (1998); Burnet v. Clark, 287 U. S. 410, 415(1932); 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations $$ 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN164 CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KINGOpinion of the CourtWe note that the Second Circuit relied on earlier Circuitprecedent for its decision. But that precedent involvedquite different circumstances which are not presented here.This case concerns a claim that a corporate employee is the"person" and the corporation is the "enterprise." It is natu-ral to speak of a corporate employee as a "person employedby" the corporation. $ 1962(c). The earlier Second Circuitprecedent concerned a claim that a corporation was the "per-son" and the corporation, together with all its employees andagents, were the "enterprise." See Riverwoods ChappaquaCorp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N. A., 30 F. 3d 339, 344(1994) (affirming dismissal of complaint). It is less naturalto speak of a corporation as "employed by" or "associatedwith" this latter oddly constructed entity. And the SecondCircuit's other precedent also involved significantly differentallegations compared with the instant case. See Anatianv. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., 193 F. 3d 85, 89 (1999)(affirming dismissal where plaintiff alleged that same bankwas both "person" and "enterprise"), cert. denied, 528 U. S.1188 (2000); Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 F. 3d 1055,1064 (1996) (involving complaint alleging that corporate subsidiaries were "persons" and subsidiaries, taken together asparent, were "enterprise"), vacated on other grounds, 525U. S. 128 (1998); Bennett, supra, at 315, and n. 2 (same asAnatian). We do not here consider the merits of thesecases, and note only their distinction from the instant case.Further, to apply the RICO statute in present circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes as thisCourt has defined them. The Court has held that RICOboth protects a legitimate "enterprise" from those whowould use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 591 (1981), and also protects the publicfrom those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise"(whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" throughwhich "unlawful . . . activity is committed," NationalOrganization for Women, Inc., supra, at 259. A corporate533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN165Cite as: 533 U. S. 158 (2001)Opinion of the Courtemployee who conducts the corporation's affairs through anunlawful RICO "pattern . . . of activity," $ 1962(c), uses thatcorporation as a "vehicle" whether he is, or is not, its soleowner.Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction--between employees acting within the scope of corporate authority and those acting outside that authority--is inconsistent with a basic statutory purpose. Cf. Reves, supra, at 184(stating that an enterprise is " `operated,' " within $ 1962(c)'smeaning, "not just by upper management but also by lowerrung participants in the enterprisewho are under the direction of upper management" (emphasis added)). It wouldimmunize from RICO liability many of those at whom thisCourt has said RICO directly aims--e. g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seekingto further the purposes of that enterprise, act within thescope of their authority. Cf. Turkette, supra, at 581 (Congress "did nothing to indicate that an enterprise consistingof a group of individuals was not covered by RICO if thepurpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal").Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's history thatsignificantly favors an alternative interpretation. That history not only refers frequently to the importance of undermining organized crime's influence upon legitimate businesses but also refers to the need to protect the public fromthose who would run "organization[s] in a manner detrimental to the public interest." S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 82. Thislatter purpose, as we have said, invites the legal principle weendorse, namely, that in present circumstances the statuterequires no more than the formal legal distinction between"person" and "enterprise" (namely, incorporation) that ispresent here.In reply, King argues that the lower court's rule is consistent with (1) the principle that a corporation acts onlythrough its directors, officers, and agents, 1 Fletcher, supra,$ 30, (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KINGOpinion of the Courtfor the criminal acts of its employees where Congress so in-tends, Brief for Respondents 20-21, and (3) the Sherman Actprinciple limiting liability under 15 U. S. C. $ 1 by excluding"from unlawful combinations or conspiracies the activitiesof a single firm," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence TubeCorp., 467 U. S. 752, 769-770, n. 15 (1984). The alternativethat we endorse, however, is no less consistent with theseprinciples. It does not deny that a corporation acts throughits employees; it says only that the corporation and its em-ployees are not legally identical. It does not assert thatordinary respondeat superior principles make a corporationlegally liable under RICO for the criminal acts of its employees; that is a matter of congressional intent not before us.See,e. g., Gasoline Sales, Inc., 39 F. 3d, at 73 (holding thatcorporation cannot be "vicariously liable" for $ 1962(c) violations committed by its vice president). Neither is it incon-sistent with antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine turns on specific antitrust objectives.SeeCopperweld Corp., supra, at 770-771. Rather, we holdsimply that the need for two distinct entities is satisfied;hence, the RICO provision before us applies when a corpo-rate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner--whether he conductsthose affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority.For these reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
