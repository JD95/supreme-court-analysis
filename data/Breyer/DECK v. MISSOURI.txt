We here consider whether shackling a convicted offenderduring the penalty phase of a capital case violates the Federal Constitution. We hold that the Constitution forbids theuse of visible shackles during the penalty phase, as it forbidstheir use during the guilt phase, unless that use is "justifiedby an essential state interest"--such as the interest in courtroom security--specific to the defendant on trial.

S. 622 (2005)Opinion of the Court29. Deck was convicted and sentenced to death. The StateSupreme Court upheld Deck's conviction but set aside thesentence. 68 S. W. 3d 418, 432 (2002) (en banc). The Statethen held a new sentencing proceeding.From the first day of the new proceeding, Deck was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain. App. 58.Before the jury voir dire began, Deck's counsel objected tothe shackles. The objection was overruled. Ibid.; see alsoid., at 41-55. During the voir dire, Deck's counsel renewedthe objection. The objection was again overruled, the courtstating that Deck "has been convicted and will remain inlegirons and a belly chain." Id., at 58. After the voir dire,Deck's counsel once again objected, moving to strike the jurypanel "because of the fact that Mr. Deck is shackled in frontof the jury and makes them think that he is . . . violenttoday." Id., at 58-59. The objection was again overruled,the court stating that his "being shackled takes any fear outof their minds." Id., at 59. The penalty phase then proceeded with Deck in shackles. Deck was again sentenced todeath. 136 S. W. 3d 481, 485 (Mo. 2004) (en banc).On appeal, Deck claimed that his shackling violated bothMissouri law and the Federal Constitution. The MissouriSupreme Court rejected these claims, writing that there was"no record of the extent of the jury's awareness of the restraints"; there was no "claim that the restraints impeded"Deck "from participating in the proceedings"; and there was"evidence" of "a risk" that Deck "might flee in that he was arepeat offender" who may have "killed his two victims toavoid being returned to custody." Ibid. Thus, there was"sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court'sexercise of its discretion" to require shackles, and in anyevent Deck "has not demonstrated that the outcome of histrial was prejudiced. . . . Neither being viewed in shacklesby the venire panel prior to trial, nor being viewed whilerestrained throughout the entire trial, alone, is proof of prej544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 DECK v. MISSOURIOpinion of the Courtudice." Ibid. The court rejected Deck's other claims oferror and affirmed the sentence.We granted certiorari to review Deck's claim that hisshackling violated the Federal Constitution.IIWe first consider whether, as a general matter, the Consti-tution permits a State to use visible shackles routinely in theguilt phase of a criminal trial. The answer is clear: The lawhas long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during theguilt phase; it permits a State to shackle a criminal defend-ant only in the presence of a special need.This rule has deep roots in the common law. In the 18thcentury, Blackstone wrote that "it is laid down in our antientbooks, that, though under an indictment of the highest na-ture," a defendant "must be brought to the bar without irons,or any manner of shackles or bonds; unless there be evidentdanger of an escape." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries onthe Laws of England 317 (1769) (footnote omitted); see also3 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England *34 ("If felonscome in judgement to answer, . . . they shall be out of irons,and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not takeaway any manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer,but at their free will"). Blackstone and other English authorities recognized that the rule did not apply at "the timeof arraignment," or like proceedings before the judge.Blackstone, supra, at 317; see also Trial of ChristopherLayer, 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 99 (K. B. 1722). It was meant toprotect defendants appearing at trial before a jury. SeeKing v. Waite, 1 Leach 28, 36, 168 Eng. Rep. 117, 120 (K. B.1743) ("[B]eing put upon his trial, the Court immediately or-dered [the defendant's] fetters to be knocked off ").American courts have traditionally followed Blackstone's"ancient" English rule, while making clear that "in extremeand exceptional cases, where the safe custody of the prisonerand the peace of the tribunal imperatively demand, the man544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 544 U.

Wharton, Criminal Pleading andPractice $ 540a, p. 369 (8th ed. 1880); 12 Cyclopedia of Lawand Procedure 529 (1904). While these earlier courts disagreed about the degree of discretion to be afforded trialjudges, see post, at 643-648 (Thomas, J., dissenting), theysettled virtually without exception on a basic rule embodying notions of fundamental fairness: Trial courts may notshackle defendants routinely, but only if there is a particularreason to do so.More recently, this Court has suggested that a version ofthis rule forms part of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' due process guarantee. Thirty-five years ago, whenconsidering the trial of an unusually obstreperous criminaldefendant, the Court held that the Constitution sometimespermitted special measures, including physical restraints.Allen, 397 U. S., at 343-344. The Court wrote that "binding544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN628 DECK v. MISSOURIOpinion of the Courtand gagging might possibly be the fairest and most reasonable way to handle" such a defendant. Id., at 344. But theCourt immediately added that "even to contemplate such atechnique . . . arouses a feeling that no person should be triedwhile shackled and gagged except as a last resort." Ibid.Sixteen years later, the Court considered a special courtroom security arrangement that involved having uniformedsecurity personnel sit in the first row of the courtroom'sspectator section. The Court held that the Constitution allowed the arrangement, stating that the deployment of security personnel during trial is not "the sort of inherently prejudicial practice that, like shackling, should be permitted onlywhere justified by an essential state interest specific to eachtrial." Holbrook, 475 U. S., at 568-569. See also Estelle v.Williams, 425 U. S. 501, 503, 505 (1976) (making a defendantappear in prison garb poses such a threat to the "fairness ofthe factfinding process" that it must be justified by an "essential state policy").Lower courts have treated these statements as settingforth a constitutional standard that embodies Blackstone'srule. Courts and commentators share close to a consensusthat, during the guilt phase of a trial, a criminal defendanthas a right to remain free of physical restraints that are visible to the jury; that the right has a constitutional dimension;but that the right may be overcome in a particular instanceby essential state interests such as physical security, escapeprevention, or courtroom decorum. See, e. g., Dyas v. Poole,309 F. 3d 586, 588-589 (CA9 2002) (per curiam); Harrell v.Israel, 672 F. 2d 632, 635 (CA7 1982) (per curiam); State v.Herrick, 324 Mont. 76, 78-82, 101 P. 3d 755, 757-759 (2004);Hill v.

Jur. 2d, Criminal Law $$ 1016, 1019(1998); see generally Krauskopf, Physical Restraint of theDefendant in the Courtroom, 15 St. Louis U. L. J. 351 (1970-1971); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Discovery andTrial by Jury 15-3.2, pp. 188-191 (3d ed. 1996).Lower courts have disagreed about the specific proceduralsteps a trial court must take prior to shackling, about theamount and type of evidence needed to justify restraints, andabout what forms of prejudice might warrant a new trial,but they have not questioned the basic principle. They haveemphasized the importance of preserving trial court discretion (reversing only in cases of clear abuse), but they haveapplied the limits on that discretion described in Holbrook,Allen, and the early English cases. In light of this precedent, and of a lower court consensus disapproving routineshackling dating back to the 19th century, it is clear thatthis Court's prior statements gave voice to a principle deeplyembedded in the law. We now conclude that those statements identify a basic element of the "due process of law"protected by the Federal Constitution. Thus, the Fifth andFourteenth Amendments prohibit the use of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination,in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by astate interest specific to a particular trial. Such a determination may of course take into account the factors that courtshave traditionally relied on in gauging potential securityproblems and the risk of escape at trial.544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 DECK v. MISSOURIOpinion of the CourtIIIWe here consider shackling not during the guilt phase ofan ordinary criminal trial, but during the punishment phaseof a capital case. And we must decide whether that changeof circumstance makes a constitutional difference. To do so,we examine the reasons that motivate the guilt-phase constitutional rule and determine whether they apply with similarforce in this context.AJudicial hostility to shackling may once primarily have reflected concern for the suffering--the "tortures" and "torments"--that "very painful" chains could cause. Krauskopf,supra, at 351, 353 (internal quotation marks omitted); seealso Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 154, n. 4 (1992)(Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing English cases curbing the useof restraints). More recently, this Court's opinions have notstressed the need to prevent physical suffering (for not allmodern physical restraints are painful). Instead they haveemphasized the importance of giving effect to three fundamental legal principles.First, the criminal process presumes that the defendant isinnocent until proved guilty. Coffin v. United States, 156U. S. 432, 453 (1895) (presumption of innocence "lies at thefoundation of the administration of our criminal law"). Visible shackling undermines the presumption of innocence andthe related fairness of the factfinding process. Cf. Estelle,supra, at 503. It suggests to the jury that the justice system itself sees a "need to separate a defendant from the community at large." Holbrook, supra, at 569; cf. State v. Roberts, 86 N. J. Super., at 162, 206 A. 2d, at 202 ("[A] defendant`ought not be brought to the Bar in a contumelious Manner;as with his Hands tied together, or any other Mark of Ignominy and Reproach . . . unless there be some Danger of aRescous [rescue] or Escape' " (quoting 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)Opinion of the Courtof the Crown, ch. 28, $ 1, p. 308 (1716-1721) (section onarraignments))).Second, the Constitution, in order to help the accused se-cure a meaningful defense, provides him with a right tocounsel. See, e. g., Amdt. 6; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.335, 340-341 (1963). The use of physical restraints diminishes that right. Shackles can interfere with the accused's"ability to communicate" with his lawyer. Allen, 397 U. S.,at 344. Indeed, they can interfere with a defendant's abilityto participate in his own defense, say, by freely choosingwhether to take the witness stand on his own behalf.Cf. Cranburne's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 222 (K. B. 1696) ("Lookyou, keeper, you should take off the prisoners irons whenthey are at the bar, for they should stand at their ease whenthey are tried" (footnote omitted)); People v. Harrington, 42Cal., at 168 (shackles "impos[e] physical burdens, pains, andrestraints . . . , . . . ten[d] to confuse and embarrass" defendants' "mental faculties," and thereby tend "materially toabridge and prejudicially affect his constitutional rights").Third, judges must seek to maintain a judicial process thatis a dignified process. The courtroom's formal dignity,which includes the respectful treatment of defendants, reflects the importance of the matter at issue, guilt or innocence, and the gravity with which Americans consider anydeprivation of an individual's liberty through criminal punishment. And it reflects a seriousness of purpose that helpsto explain the judicial system's power to inspire the confidence and to affect the behavior of a general public whosedemands for justice our courts seek to serve. The routineuse of shackles in the presence of juries would underminethese symbolic yet concrete objectives. As this Court hassaid, the use of shackles at trial "affront[s]" the "dignity anddecorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking touphold." Allen, supra, at 344; see also Trial of ChristopherLayer, 16 How. St. Tr., at 99 (statement of Mr. Hungerford)("[T]o have a man plead for his life" in shackles before544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 DECK v. MISSOURIOpinion of the Court"a court of justice, the highest in the kingdom for criminalmatters, where the king himself is supposed to be personallypresent," undermines the "dignity of the Court").There will be cases, of course, where these perils of shackling are unavoidable. See Allen, supra, at 344. We do notunderestimate the need to restrain dangerous defendants toprevent courtroom attacks, or the need to give trial courtslatitude in making individualized security determinations.We are mindful of the tragedy that can result if judges arenot able to protect themselves and their courtrooms. Butgiven their prejudicial effect, due process does not permitthe use of visible restraints if the trial court has not takenaccount of the circumstances of the particular case.BThe considerations that militate against the routine use ofvisible shackles during the guilt phase of a criminal trialapply with like force to penalty proceedings in capital cases.This is obviously so in respect to the latter two considerations mentioned, securing a meaningful defense and main-taining dignified proceedings. It is less obviously so in respect to the first consideration mentioned, for the defendant'sconviction means that the presumption of innocence nolonger applies. Hence shackles do not undermine the jury'seffort to apply that presumption.Nonetheless, shackles at the penalty phase threaten re-lated concerns. Although the jury is no longer deciding between guilt and innocence, it is deciding between life anddeath. That decision, given the " `severity' " and " `finality' "of the sanction, is no less important than the decision aboutguilt.Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 732 (1998) (quot-ing Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357 (1977)).Neither is accuracy in making that decision any less criti-cal. The Court has stressed the "acute need" for reliabledecisionmaking when the death penalty is at issue. Monge,supra, at 732 (citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)Opinion of the Court(plurality opinion)). The appearance of the offender duringthe penalty phase in shackles, however, almost inevitably implies to a jury, as a matter of common sense, that court au-thorities consider the offender a danger to the community--often a statutory aggravator and nearly always a relevantfactor in jury decisionmaking, even where the State does notspecifically argue the point. Cf. Brief for Respondent 25-27.It also almost inevitably affects adversely the jury's percep-tion of the character of the defendant. SeeZant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 900 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurringin judgment) (character and propensities of the defendantare part of a "unique, individualized judgment regarding thepunishment that a particular person deserves"). And itthereby inevitably undermines the jury's ability to weighaccurately all relevant considerations--considerations thatare often unquantifiable and elusive--when it determineswhether a defendant deserves death. In these ways, the useof shackles can be a "thumb [on] death's side of the scale."Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 532 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (through control ofa defendant's appearance, the State can exert a "powerfulinfluence on the outcome of the trial").Given the presence of similarly weighty considerations, wemust conclude that courts cannot routinely place defendantsin shackles or other physical restraints visible to the juryduring the penalty phase of a capital proceeding. The constitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It permits a judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to takeaccount of special circumstances, including security concerns,that may call for shackling. In so doing, it accommodatesthe important need to protect the courtroom and its occupants. But any such determination must be case specific;that is to say, it should reflect particular concerns, say, special security needs or escape risks, related to the defendanton trial.544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN634 DECK v. MISSOURIOpinion of the CourtIVMissouri claims that the decision of its high court meetsthe Constitution's requirements in this case. It argues thatthe Missouri Supreme Court properly found: (1) that the rec-ord lacks evidence that the jury saw the restraints; (2) thatthe trial court acted within its discretion; and, in any event,(3) that the defendant suffered no prejudice. We find thesearguments unconvincing.The first argument is inconsistent with the record in thiscase, which makes clear that the jury was aware of theshackles. See App. 58-59 (Deck's attorney stated on therecord that "Mr. Deck [was] shackled in front of the jury"(emphasis added)); id., at 59 (trial court responded that "himbeing shackled takes any fear out of their minds"). The ar-gument also overstates the Missouri Supreme Court's holding. The court said: "Trial counsel made no record of theextent of the jury's awareness of the restraints throughoutthe penalty phase, and Appellant does not claim that the re-straints impeded him from participating in the proceedings."136 S. W. 3d, at 485 (emphasis added). This statement doesnot suggest that the jury was unaware of the restraints.Rather, it refers to the degree of the jury's awareness, andhence to the kinds of prejudice that might have occurred.The second argument--that the trial court acted withinits discretion--founders on the record's failure to indicatethat the trial judge saw the matter as one calling for discre-tion. The record contains no formal or informal findings.Cf. supra, at 632 (requiring a case-by-case determination).The judge did not refer to a risk of escape--a risk the Statehas raised in this Court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37--or athreat to courtroom security. Rather, he gave as his reasonfor imposing the shackles the fact that Deck already "hasbeen convicted." App. 58. While he also said that theshackles would "tak[e] any fear out of " the juror's "minds,"he nowhere explained any special reason for fear.Id., at 59.Nor did he explain why, if shackles were necessary, he chose544US2 Unit: $U49 [11-04-07 13:43:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN635Cite as: 544 U. S. 622 (2005)Thomas, J., dissentingnot to provide for shackles that the jury could not see--ap-parently the arrangement used at trial. If there is an exceptional case where the record itself makes clear that there areindisputably good reasons for shackling, it is not this one.The third argument fails to take account of this Court'sstatement in Holbrook that shackling is "inherently prejudicial." 475 U. S., at 568. That statement is rooted in ourbelief that the practice will often have negative effects,but--like "the consequences of compelling a defendant towear prison clothing" or of forcing him to stand trial whilemedicated--those effects "cannot be shown from a trial tran-script."Riggins, supra, at 137. Thus, where a court, with-out adequate justification, orders the defendant to wearshackles that will be seen by the jury, the defendant neednot demonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due processviolation. The State must prove "beyond a reasonabledoubt that the [shackling] error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman v. California,386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967).VFor these reasons, the judgment of the Missouri SupremeCourt is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
