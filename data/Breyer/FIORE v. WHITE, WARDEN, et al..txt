The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania convicted codefend-ants William Fiore and David Scarpone of violating a provision of Pennsylvania law forbidding any person to "operatea hazardous waste" facility without a "permit." Pa. Stat.Ann., Tit. 35, $ 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993) (reprinted at Ap-pendix A,infra). Each codefendant appealed to a differentintermediate state court, one of which affirmed Fiore's conviction, the other of which reversed Scarpone's. The Penn-sylvania Supreme Court denied further review of Fiore'scase, and his conviction became final. However, that courtagreed to review Scarpone's case, and it subsequently heldthat the statutory provision did not apply to those who, likeScarpone and Fiore, possessed a permit but deviated radi*Saul M.

S. 23 (1999)Opinion of the Courtcally from the permit's terms. Consequently, it set asideScarpone's conviction.In light of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision inCommonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 634 A. 2d 1109(1993), Fiore asked the Pennsylvania courts to reconsiderhis identical conviction. They denied his request. He thenbrought a federal habeas corpus petition in which he argued,among other things, that Pennsylvania's courts, either as amatter of Pennsylvania law or as a matter of federal con-stitutional law, must apply theScarpone interpretation ofthe statute to his identical case. If this proposition of lawis correct, he asserted, it would follow that the Common-wealth failed to produce any evidence at all with respectto one essential element of the crime (namely, the lack of apermit). On this reasoning, Fiore concluded that the Federal Constitution requires his release. See Jackson v. Vir-ginia, 443 U. S. 307, 316 (1979); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,364 (1970).The Federal District Court granted the habeas petition,but the Court of Appeals reversed that decision. We agreedto review the appellate court's rejection of Fiore's claim.Before deciding whether the Federal Constitution requiresthat Fiore's conviction be set aside in light ofScarpone,we first must know whether Pennsylvania itself considersScarpone to have explained what Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35,$ 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), always meant, or whether Pennsylvania considers Scarpone to have changed the law. Weinvoke the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's certification procedure in order to obtain that court's view of the matter. SeeAppendix B, infra.IThe relevant background circumstances include thefollowing:1. Fiore owned and operated a hazardous waste disposalfacility in Pennsylvania. Scarpone was the facility's generalmanager. Pennsylvania authorities, while conceding that528US1 Unit: $$U9 [06-14-01 18:21:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN26 FIORE v. WHITEOpinion of the CourtFiore and Scarpone possessed a permit to operate the facil-ity, claimed that their deliberate alteration of a monitoringpipe to hide a leakage problem went so far beyond the termsof the permit that the operation took place without a permitat all. A jury convicted them both of having "operate[d]a hazardous waste storage, treatment or disposal facility"without a "permit." Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, $ 6018.401(a)(Purdon 1993); seeCommonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740(Ct. Common Pleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), p. 2,App. 6 (marking date of conviction as Feb. 18, 1986). Thetrial court upheld the conviction, despite the existence ofa permit, for, in its view, the "alterations of the . . . piperepresented such a significant departure from the termsof the existing permit that the operation of the hazardouswaste facility was `un-permitted' after the alterations wereundertaken . . . ." Id., at 48, App. 44.2. Fiore appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 742 (1998) (grantingthe Superior Court jurisdiction over all appeals from a finalorder of a court of common pleas). That court affirmed theconviction "on the basis of the opinion of the court below."Commonwealth v. Fiore, No. 00485 PGH 1988 (May 12, 1989),pp. 2-3, App. 99-100. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Fiore leave to appeal on March 13, 1990; shortly there-after, Fiore's conviction became final.3. Fiore's codefendant, Scarpone, appealed his convictionto the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. See 42 Pa.Cons. Stat. $ 762(a)(2)(ii) (1998) (granting the CommonwealthCourt jurisdiction over appeals in regulatory criminal cases).That court noted the existence of a "valid permit," foundthe Commonwealth's interpretation of the statute "strainedat best," and set Scarpone's conviction aside. Scarpone v.Commonwealth, 141 Pa. Commw. 560, 567, 596 A. 2d 892, 895(1991). The court wrote:"The alteration of the monitoring pipe was clearly a vio-lation of the conditions of the permit. But to say that528US1 Unit: $$U9 [06-14-01 18:21:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 528 U. S. 23 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthe alteration resulted in the operation of a new facilitywhich had not been permitted is to engage in a semanticexercise which we cannot accept. . . . [W]e will not let[the provision's] language be stretched to include activities which clearly fall in some other subsection." Ibid.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Common-wealth Court's conclusion. It wrote:"[T]he Commonwealth did not make out the crime ofoperating a waste disposal facility without a permit . . . .Simply put, Mr. Scarpone did have a permit. . . . [T]oconclude that the alteration constituted the operationof a new facility without a permit is a bald fiction wecannot endorse. . . . The Commonwealth Court was rightin reversing Mr. Scarpone's conviction of operating with-out a permit when the facility clearly had one."Com-monwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa., at 279, 634 A. 2d, at1112.4. Fiore again asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court toreview his case, once after that court agreed to reviewScarpone's case and twice more after it decided Scarpone.See Appellee's Supplemental App. in No. 97-3288 (CA3),pp. 59, 61 (including docket sheets reflecting Fiore's filingson Jan. 30, 1992, Jan. 24, 1994, and Oct. 18, 1994). The courtdenied those requests.5. Fiore then sought collateral relief in the state courts.The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pa., re-fused to grant Fiore's petition for collateral relief--despiteScarpone--because "at the time of . . . conviction and directappeals, the interpretation of the law was otherwise," and"[t]he petitioner is not entitled to a retroactive applicationof the interpretation of the law set forth in Scarpone."Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Aug. 18, 1994),p. 6. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, both becauseFiore had previously litigated the claim and because Fiore's"direct appeal was no longer pending when the Supreme528US1 Unit: $$U9 [06-14-01 18:21:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN28 FIORE v. WHITEOpinion of the CourtCourt made the ruling which [Fiore] now seeks to have ap-plied to his case." Commonwealth v. Fiore, 445 Pa. Super.401, 416, 665 A. 2d 1185, 1193 (1995).6. Fiore sought federal habeas corpus relief. As we previously pointed out, supra, at 25, he argued that Pennsyl-vania had imprisoned him "for conduct which was not criminal under the statutory section charged." App. 194. TheFederal District Court, acting on a Magistrate's recommendation, granted the petition. The Court of Appeals for theThird Circuit reversed, however, primarily because it believed that "state courts are under no constitutional obliga-tion to apply their decisions retroactively." 149 F. 3d 221,222 (1998).7. We subsequently granted Fiore's petition for certiorarito consider whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Proc-ess Clause requires that his conviction be set aside.IIFiore essentially claims that Pennsylvania produced noevidence whatsoever of one element of the crime, namely,that he lacked "a permit." The validity of his federal claimmay depend upon whether the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Scarpone was always the stat-ute's meaning, even at the time of Fiore's trial.Scarponemarked the first time the Pennsylvania Supreme Court hadinterpreted the statute; previously, Pennsylvania's lowercourts had been divided in their interpretation. Fiore's andScarpone's trial court concluded that $ 6018.401(a)'s "permit"requirement prohibited the operation of a hazardous wastefacility in a manner that deviates from the permit's terms,and the Superior Court, in adjudicating Fiore's direct appeal,accepted the trial court's interpretation in a summary un-published memorandum. Then, the Commonwealth Court,in Scarpone's direct appeal, specifically rejected the inter-pretation adopted by the Superior Court in Fiore's case.And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Scarpone set forth528US1 Unit: $$U9 [06-14-01 18:21:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN29Cite as: 528 U. S. 23 (1999)Opinion of the Courtits authoritative interpretation of the statute, affirming theCommonwealth Court only after Fiore's conviction becamefinal. For that reason, we must know whether the Penn-sylvania Supreme Court's construction of the statute inScarpone stated the correct understanding of the statuteat the time Fiore's conviction became final, or whether itchanged the interpretation then applicable. Compare, e. g.,Buradus v. General Cement Prods. Co., 52 A. 2d 205, 208(Pa. 1947) (stating that "[i]n general, the construction placedupon a statute by the courts becomes a part of the act, fromthe very beginning"), with Commonwealth v. Fiore, supra,at 416-417, 665 A. 2d, at 1193; Commonwealth v. Fiore,CC No. 8508740 (Aug. 18, 1994), at 6 (refusing to apply theScarpone interpretation because "at the time of [Fiore's]conviction and direct appeals, the interpretation of the lawwas otherwise"). IIIWe certify the following question to the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court pursuant to that court's Rules RegardingCertification of Questions of Pennsylvania law:Does the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35,$ 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth inCommonwealthv. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993),state the correct interpretation of the law of Pennsylva-nia at the date Fiore's conviction became final?We respectfully request that the Pennsylvania SupremeCourt accept our certification petition because, in our view,the answer to this question will help determine the properstate-law predicate for our determination of the federal constitutional questions raised in this case.We recommend that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court designate William Fiore (the petitioner here) as appellant andboth Gregory White, Warden, and the Attorney General ofthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the respondents here)as appellees.528US1 Unit: $$U9 [06-14-01 18:21:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN30 FIORE v.
