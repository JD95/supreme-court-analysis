This case concerns the constitutional requirements sub-stantively limiting the civil commitment of a dangerous sexual offender--a matter that this Court considered in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997). The State of Kansasargues that the Kansas Supreme Court has interpreted ourdecision in Hendricks in an overly restrictive manner. Weagree and vacate the Kansas court's judgment.IIn Hendricks, this Court upheld the Kansas SexuallyViolent Predator Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a01et seq.(1994), against constitutional challenge. 521 U. S., at 371.In doing so, the Court characterized the confinement at issueas civil, not criminal, confinement. Id., at 369. And it heldthat the statutory criterion for confinement embodied in thestatute's words "mental abnormality or personality disorder"satisfied " `substantive' due process requirements." Id., at356, 360.In reaching its conclusion, the Court's opinion pointed outthat "States have in certain narrow circumstances providedfor the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable tocontrol their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to thepublic health and safety." Id., at 357. It said that "[w]ehave consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes" when (1) "the confinement takes place pursuant toproper procedures and evidentiary standards," (2) there is afinding of "dangerousness either to one's self or to others,"and (3) proof of dangerousness is "coupled . . . with the proofof some additional factor, such as a `mental illness' or `mentalvan and Michael E.

CRANEOpinion of the Courtabnormality.' " Id., at 357-358. It noted that the Kansas"Act unambiguously requires a finding of dangerousnesseither to one's self or to others," id., at 357, and then "linksthat finding to the existence of a `mental abnormality' or`personality disorder' that makes it difficult, if not impos-sible, for the person to control his dangerous behavior," id.,at 358 (citing Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a02(b) (1994)). And theCourt ultimately determined that the statute's "requirementof a `mental abnormality' or `personality disorder' is con-sistent with the requirements of . . . other statutes that wehave upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligiblefor confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness." 521 U. S., at 358.The Court went on to respond to Hendricks' claim thatearlier cases had required a finding, not of "mental abnor-mality" or "personality disorder," but of "mental illness."Id., at 358-359. In doing so, the Court pointed out that we"have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining[such] terms." Id., at 359. It then held that, to "the extentthat the civil commitment statutes we have considered setforth criteria relating to an individual's inability to controlhis dangerousness, the Kansas Act sets forth comparablecriteria." Id., at 360. It added that Hendricks' own con-dition "doubtless satisfies those criteria," for (1) he suffersfrom pedophilia, (2) "the psychiatric profession itself clas-sifies" that condition "as a serious mental disorder," and(3) Hendricks conceded that he cannot " `control the urge' "to molest children. And it concluded that this "admittedlack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of futuredangerousness, adequately distinguishes Hendricks fromother dangerous persons who are perhaps more properlydealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings."Ibid.IIIn the present case the State of Kansas asks us to re-view the Kansas Supreme Court's application ofHendricks.The State here seeks the civil commitment of Michael534US2 Unit: $U20 [04-10-03 18:04:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 534 U. S. 407 (2002)Opinion of the CourtCrane, a previously convicted sexual offender who, accord-ing to at least one of the State's psychiatric witnesses, suffers from both exhibitionism and antisocial personality dis-order. In re Crane, 269 Kan. 578, 580-581, 7 P. 3d 285, 287(2000); cf. also American Psychiatric Association, Diagnosticand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 569 (rev. 4th ed.2000) (DSM-IV) (detailing exhibitionism), 701-706 (detail-ing antisocial personality disorder). After a jury trial, theKansas District Court ordered Crane's civil commitment.269 Kan., at 579-584, 7 P. 3d, at 286-288. But the KansasSupreme Court reversed. Id., at 586, 7 P. 3d, at 290. Inthat court's view, the Federal Constitution as interpretedin Hendricks insists upon "a finding that the defendantcannot control his dangerous behavior"--even if (as provided by Kansas law) problems of "emotional capacity" andnot "volitional capacity" prove the "source of bad behavior"warranting commitment. 269 Kan., at 586, 7 P. 3d, at 290;see also Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a02(b) (2000 Cum. Supp.)(defining "[m]ental abnormality" as a condition that affectsan individual's emotional or volitional capacity). And thetrial court had made no such finding.Kansas now argues that the Kansas Supreme Courtwrongly read Hendricks as requiring the State alwaysto prove that a dangerous individual is completely unableto control his behavior. That reading, says Kansas, is fartoo rigid.IIIWe agree with Kansas insofar as it argues that Hendricksset forth no requirement oftotal or complete lack of control.Hendricks referred to the Kansas Act as requiring a "mentalabnormality" or "personality disorder" that makes it "diffi-cult, if not impossible, for the [dangerous] person to controlhis dangerous behavior." 521 U. S., at 358 (emphasis added).The word "difficult" indicates that the lack of control towhich this Court referred was not absolute. Indeed, as dif-ferentamici on opposite sides of this case agree, an abso-lutist approach is unworkable.

Poythress, & C. Slobogin, Psychological Evalua-tions for the Courts 200 (2d ed. 1997) (" `The line between anirresistible impulse and an impulse not resisted is probablyno sharper than that between twilight and dusk' "). More-over, most severely ill people--even those commonly termed"psychopaths"--retain some ability to control their behavior.See Morse, Culpability and Control, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1587,1634-1635 (1994); cf. Winick, Sex Offender Law in the 1990s:A Therapeutic Jurisprudence Analysis, 4 Psychol. Pub. Pol'y& L. 505, 520-525 (1998). Insistence upon absolute lack ofcontrol would risk barring the civil commitment of highlydangerous persons suffering severe mental abnormalities.We do not agree with the State, however, insofar as itseeks to claim that the Constitution permits commitmentof the type of dangerous sexual offender considered inHendricks without any lack-of-control determination. See Brieffor Petitioner 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22, 30-31. Hendricksunderscored the constitutional importance of distinguishinga dangerous sexual offender subject to civil commitment"from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings."521 U. S., at 360. That distinction is necessary lest "civilcommitment" become a "mechanism for retribution or general deterrence"--functions properly those of criminal law,not civil commitment. Id., at 372-373 (Kennedy, J., concurring); cf. also Moran, The Epidemiology of AntisocialPersonality Disorder, 34 Social Psychiatry & PsychiatricEpidemiology 231, 234 (1999) (noting that 40%-60% of themale prison population is diagnosable with antisocial personality disorder). The presence of what the "psychiatric profession itself classifie[d] . . . as a serious mental disorder"helped to make that distinction in Hendricks. And a criticaldistinguishing feature of that "serious . . . disorder" there534US2 Unit: $U20 [04-10-03 18:04:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN413Cite as: 534 U. S. 407 (2002)Opinion of the Courtconsisted of a special and serious lack of ability to controlbehavior.In recognizing that fact, we did not give to the phrase"lack of control" a particularly narrow or technical meaning.And we recognize that in cases where lack of control is atissue, "inability to control behavior" will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision. It is enough to say thatthere must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling be-havior. And this, when viewed in light of such features ofthe case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and theseverity of the mental abnormality itself, must be sufficientto distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose seriousmental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civilcommitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist con-victed in an ordinary criminal case. 521 U. S., at 357-358;see also Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 82-83 (1992) (re-jecting an approach to civil commitment that would permitthe indefinite confinement "of any convicted criminal" aftercompletion of a prison term).We recognize that Hendricks as so read provides a lessprecise constitutional standard than would those more defi-nite rules for which the parties have argued. But the Constitution's safeguards of human liberty in the area of mentalillness and the law are not always best enforced throughprecise bright-line rules. For one thing, the States retainconsiderable leeway in defining the mental abnormalitiesand personality disorders that make an individual eligible forcommitment. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 359; id., at 374-375(Breyer, J., dissenting). For another, the science of psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legaldeterminations, is an ever-advancing science, whose distinctions do not seek precisely to mirror those of the law.See id., at 359. See also, e. g., Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S.68, 81 (1985) (psychiatry not "an exact science"); DSM-IVxxx ("concept of mental disorder . . . lacks a consistent operational definition"); id., at xxxii-xxxiii (noting the "imperfectfit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and534US2 Unit: $U20 [04-10-03 18:04:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN414 KANSAS v. CRANEOpinion of the Courtthe information contained in [the DSM's] clinical diagnosis").Consequently, we have sought to provide constitutional guidance in this area by proceeding deliberately and contextually,elaborating generally stated constitutional standards andobjectives as specific circumstances require. Hendricks em-bodied that approach.IVThe State also questions how often a volitional problemlies at the heart of a dangerous sexual offender's seriousmental abnormality or disorder. It points out that theKansas Supreme Court characterized its state statute aspermitting commitment of dangerous sexual offenders who(1) suffered from a mental abnormality properly characterized by an "emotional" impairment and (2) suffered no "vo-litional" impairment. 269 Kan., at 583, 7 P. 3d, at 289.It adds that, in the Kansas court's view, Hendricks abso-lutely forbids the commitment of any such person. 269 Kan.,at 585-586, 7 P. 3d, at 290. And the State argues that itwas wrong to read Hendricks in this way. Brief for Petitioner 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.We agree that Hendricks limited its discussion to volitional disabilities. And that fact is not surprising. Thecase involved an individual suffering from pedophilia--amental abnormality that critically involves what a lay per-son might describe as a lack of control. DSM-IV 571-572(listing as a diagnostic criterion for pedophilia that an in-dividual have acted on, or been affected by, "sexual urges"toward children). Hendricks himself stated that he couldnot " `control the urge' " to molest children. 521 U. S., at360. In addition, our cases suggest that civil commitmentof dangerous sexual offenders will normally involve individuals who find it particularly difficult to control their be-havior--in the general sense described above. Cf.Seling v.Young, 531 U. S. 250, 256 (2001); cf. also Abel & Rouleau,Male Sex Offenders, in Handbook of Outpatient Treatmentof Adults: Nonpsychotic Mental Disorders 271 (M. Thase,534US2 Unit: $U20 [04-10-03 18:04:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN415Cite as: 534 U. S. 407 (2002)Scalia, J., dissentingB. Edelstein, & M. Hersen eds. 1990) (sex offenders' "com-pulsive, repetitive, driven behavior . . . appears to fit thecriteria of an emotional or psychiatric illness"). And it isoften appropriate to say of such individuals, in ordinary English, that they are "unable to control their dangerousness."Hendricks, supra, at 358.Regardless, Hendricks must be read in context. TheCourt did not draw a clear distinction between the purely"emotional" sexually related mental abnormality and the"volitional." Here, as in other areas of psychiatry, theremay be "considerable overlap between a . . . defective understanding or appreciation and . . . [an] ability to control . . .behavior." American Psychiatric Association Statement onthe Insanity Defense, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 681, 685 (1983)(discussing "psychotic" individuals). Nor, when considering civil commitment, have we ordinarily distinguished forconstitutional purposes among volitional, emotional, and cognitive impairments. See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 463U. S. 354 (1983);Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979).The Court in Hendricks had no occasion to consider whetherconfinement based solely on "emotional" abnormality wouldbe constitutional, and we likewise have no occasion to do soin the present case. * * *For these reasons, the judgment of the Kansas SupremeCourt is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
