The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) sued several of-ficers and directors of City Federal Savings Bank, claimingthat they had violated the legal standard of care they owedthat federally chartered, federally insured institution. Thecase here focuses upon the legal standard for determiningwhether or not their behavior was improper.

FDICOpinion of the Courtto federal common law, or to a special federal statute(103 Stat. 243, 12 U. S. C. $ 1821(k)) that speaks of "grossnegligence"?We conclude that state law sets the standard of conduct aslong as the state standard (such as simple negligence) isstricter than that of the federal statute. The federal statutenonetheless sets a "gross negligence" floor, which applies asa substitute for state standards that are more relaxed.IIn 1989, City Federal Savings Bank (City Federal), a fed-eral savings association, went into receivership. The RTC,as receiver, brought this action in the bank's name againstofficers and directors. (Throughout this opinion, we use themore colloquial term "bank" to refer to a variety of institu-tions such as "federal savings associations.") The complaintsaid that the defendants had acted (or failed to act) in waysthat led City Federal to make various bad development,construction, and business acquisition loans. It claimedthat these actions (or omissions) were unlawful becausethey amounted to gross negligence, simple negligence, andbreaches of fiduciary duty.The defendants moved to dismiss. They pointed to a fed-eral statute, 12 U. S. C. $ 1821(k), that says in part that a"director or officer" of a federally insured bank "may be heldpersonally liable for monetary damages" in an RTC-initiated"civil action . . . for gross negligence" or "similar conduct . . .that demonstrates a greater disregard of a duty of care (thangross negligence) . . . ." (Emphasis added.) They arguedthat, by authorizing actions for gross negligence or moreseriously culpable conduct, the statute intended to forbidactions based upon less seriously culpable conduct, such asconduct that rose only to the level of simple negligence. TheDistrict Court agreed and dismissed all but the gross negligence claims.519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT217Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe Third Circuit, providing an interlocutory appeal, 28U. S. C. $ 1292(b), reversed. It interpreted the federal statute as simply offering a safeguard against state legislationthat had watered down applicable state standards of care--below a gross negligence benchmark. As so interpreted, thestatute did not prohibit actions resting upon stricter standard of care rules--whether those stricter standard of carerules originated in state law (which the Circuit found applicable in the case of state-chartered banks) or in federalcommon law (which the Circuit found applicable in the caseof federally chartered banks). Resolution Trust Corp. v.Cityfed Financial Corp., 57 F. 3d 1231, 1243-1244, 1245-1249(1995). Noting that City Federal is a federally charteredsavings institution, the Circuit concluded that the RTC wasfree "to pursue any claims for negligence or breach of fiduciary duty available as a matter of federal common law."Id., at 1249.The defendants, pointing to variations in the Circuits' interpretations of the "gross negligence" statute, sought cer-tiorari. CompareResolution Trust Corp. v. Frates, 52 F. 3d295 (CA10 1995) ($ 1821(k) prohibits federal common-law actions for simple negligence), with Cityfed, supra, at 1246-1249 ($ 1821(k) does not prohibit federal common-law actionsfor simple negligence). And we granted review.IIWe begin by temporarily setting the federal "gross negli-gence" statute to the side, and by asking whether, werethere no such statute, federal common law would provide theapplicable legal standard. We recognize, as did the ThirdCircuit, that this Court did once articulate federal common-law corporate governance standards, applicable to federallychartered banks. Briggs v. Spaulding, 141 U. S. 132 (1891).See alsoMartin v. Webb, 110 U. S. 7, 15 (1884) (directorsmust "use ordinary diligence . . . and . . . exercise reasonable519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT218 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Courtcontrol"); Bowerman v. Hamner, 250 U. S. 504 (1919). Butthe Court found its rules of decision in federal common lawlong before it held, in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64(1938), that "[t]here is no federal general common law."Id.,at 78. The Third Circuit, while considering itself bound byBriggs, asked whether relevant federal common-law stand-ards could have survivedErie. We conclude that they didnot and that (except as modified in Part III, infra) state law,not federal common law, provides the applicable rules fordecision.This Court has recently discussed what one might call"federal common law" in the strictest sense, i. e., a rule ofdecision that amounts, not simply to an interpretation of afederal statute or a properly promulgated administrativerule, but, rather, to the judicial "creation" of a special federalrule of decision. See Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 640-643 (1981). The Court hassaid that "cases in which judicial creation of a special federalrule would be justified . . . are . . . `few and restricted.' "O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 512 U. S. 79, 87 (1994) (quotingWheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647, 651 (1963)). "Whetherlatent federal power should be exercised to displace statelaw is primarily a decision for Congress," not the federalcourts. Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S.63, 68 (1966). Nor does the existence of related federal statutes automatically show that Congress intended courts tocreate federal common-law rules, for " `Congress acts . . .against the background of the total corpus juris of the states. . . .' " Id., at 68 (quoting H. Hart & H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 435 (1953)). Thus, normally, when courts decide to fashion rules of federal commonlaw, "the guiding principle is that a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of statelaw . . . must first be specifically shown." 384 U. S., at 68.Indeed, such a "conflict" is normally a "precondition."O'Melveny, supra, at 87. See also United States v. Kimbell519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT219Cite as: 519 U.

S. 90, 98 (1991).No one doubts the power of Congress to legislate rules fordeciding cases like the one before us. Indeed, Congress hasenacted related legislation. Certain federal statutes specify, for example, how to form "national banks" (i. e., a feder-ally chartered bank), how to amend the articles of association, how shareholders are to vote, directors' qualifications,the form of a bank's "organization certificate," minimum capital requirements, and a list of corporate powers. See 12U. S. C. $ 21et seq. Other federal statutes regulate the activities of federally chartered savings associations in variousways. E. g., 12 U. S. C. $ 1464(b) (various regulations on savings associations, such as interest rate on loans). No oneargues, however, that either these statutes, or federal regulations validly promulgated pursuant to statute, set forthgeneral corporate governance standards of the sort at issueapplicable to a federally chartered savings association suchas City Federal. Cf. 61 Fed. Reg. 4866 (1996) (to be codifiedin 12 CFR $ 7.2000) (discussed infra, at 224) (describing governance procedures applicable to federally chartered national banks, but not federal savings associations). Consequently, we must decide whether the application of state-lawstandards of care to such banks would conflict with, andthereby significantly threaten, a federal policy or interest.We have examined each of the basic arguments that therespondent implicitly or explicitly raises. In our view, theydo not point to a conflict or threat that is significant, and weshall explain why. (The respondent, by the way, is now theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation--the FDIC--whichhas replaced the RTC pursuant to a new federal statute. 12U. S. C. $ 1441a(b)(4)(A).)First, the FDIC invokes the need for "uniformity." Federal common law, it says, will provide uniformity, but "[s]uperimposing state standards of fiduciary responsibility overstandards developed by a federal chartering authority would519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT220 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Court. . . `upset the balance' that the federal chartering authority`may strike . . . .' " Brief for Respondent 23 (quotingKamen, supra, at 103). To invoke the concept of "uniform-ity," however, is not to prove its need. Cf.Kimbell Foods,supra, at 730 (rejecting "generalized pleas for uniformity");O'Melveny, supra, at 88 (same).For one thing, the number of federally insured banks isabout equally divided between federally chartered andstate-chartered banks, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 1 Statistics on Banking: A Statistical History of theUnited States Banking Industry, p. B-9 (Aug. 1995) (TableSI-9) (showing that, in 1989, there were 1,595 federally chartered institutions and 1,492 state-chartered ones); and a federal standard that increases uniformity among the formerwould increase disparity with the latter.For another, our Nation's banking system has thriveddespite disparities in matters of corporate governance.Consider, for example, the divergent state-law governancestandards applicable to banks chartered in different States,e. g., Ind. Code $ 23-1-35-1(e)(2) (1994) (directors not liableunless conduct constitutes at least "willful misconduct orrecklessness"); Iowa Code $ 524.605 (1995) (providing ordinary negligence standard), as well as the different ways inwhich lower courts since 1891 have interpreted Briggs' "federal common law" standard. Compare Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Mason, 115 F. 2d 548, 551-552 (CA31940) (applying standard similar to simple negligence), withWashington Bancorporation v. Said, 812 F. Supp. 1256, 1266(DC 1993) (Briggs did not apply "simple negligence" standard of care). See R. Stevens & B. Nielson, The Standardof Care for Directors and Officers of Federally CharteredDepository Institutions: It's Gross Negligence Regardless ofWhether Section 1821(k) Preempts Federal Common Law,13 Ann. Review Banking L. 169, 172 (1994) (in part becauseof "widely varying results, the federal common law standardof care is neither fully developed, nor well settled"). See519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT221Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the Courtalso infra, at 223 (citing cases in which state governance lawhas been applied to national banks). Indeed, the Comptroller of the Currency, acting through regulation, permitsconsiderable disparity in the standard of care applicable tofederally chartered banks other than savings banks (whichare under the jurisdiction of the Office of Thrift Supervision(OTS), 12 U. S. C. $$ 1462a, 1463(a)). See 61 Fed. Reg. 4866(1996) (to be codified in 12 CFR $ 7.2000) (permitting banks,within broad limits, "to follow the corporate governance procedures of the law of the state in which the main office ofthe bank is located . . . [or] the Delaware General CorporationLaw . . . or the [Model Business Corporation Act]").Second, the FDIC at times suggests that courts mustapply a federal common-law standard of care simply becausethe banks in question are federally chartered. This argument, with little more, might have seemed a strong one during most of the first century of our Nation's history, for thenstate-chartered banks were the norm and federally chartered banks an exception--and federal banks often encountered hostility and deleterious state laws. See B. Klebaner,American Commercial Banking: A History 4-11 (1990) (tracing the origin of the dual banking system to the 1780 Philadelphia Bank and discussing proposals of a then-youngAlexander Hamilton); B. Hammond, Banks and Politics inAmerica: From the Revolution to the Civil War 41-66 (1957)(describing the controversial, but successful, Federalist proposals for the first and second federally chartered Bank ofthe United States).After President Madison helped to create the second Bankof the United States, for example, many States enacted lawsthat taxed the federal bank in an effort to weaken it. ThisCourt held those taxes unconstitutional. McCulloch v.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 (1819) ("[T]he power to taxinvolves the power to destroy"). See also Osborn v. Bankof United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824) (federal marshals actedlawfully in seizing funds from a state tax collector who had519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT222 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Courthurdled the counter at the Chilicothe Branch of the Bank ofthe United States and taken $100,000 from the vault). Still,10 years later President Andrew Jackson effectively killedthe bank. His Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney(later Chief Justice), believing state banks fully able to servethe Nation, took steps to "ushe[r] in the era of expansivestate banking." A. Pollard, J. Passaic, K. Ellis, & J. Daly,Banking Law in the United States 16 (1988). See alsoBris-coe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257 (1837) (permitting statebanks to issue paper money in certain circumstances).During and after the Civil War a federal banking systemreemerged. Moved in part by war-related financing needs,Treasury Secretary (later Chief Justice) Salmon P. Chaseproposed, and Congress enacted, laws providing for federallychartered banks, Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 43, 12 Stat. 655,and encouraging state banks to obtain federal charters.Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, 13 Stat. 99 (only federally chartered banks can issue national currency). See also Veazie v.Fenno, 8 Wall. 533 (1869) (opinion of Chase, C. J.) (upholdingconstitutionality of federal taxation of state banks). Justbefore World War I, Congress created the federal reservesystem. Act of Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251. After thatwar, it created several federal banking agencies with regula-tory authority over both federal and state banks. Act ofJune 16, 1933, ch. 89, 48 Stat. 162. And in 1933, it providedfor the federal chartering of savings banks. Act of June 13,1933, ch. 62, 48 Stat. 128.This latter history is relevant because in 1870 and thereafter this Court held that federally chartered banks are sub-ject to state law. See National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9Wall. 353, 361 (1870). In National Bank the Court distin-guished McCulloch by recalling that Maryland's taxes were"used . . . to destroy," and it added that federal banks"are subject to the laws of the State, and are governedin their daily course of business far more by the laws ofthe State than of the nation. All their contracts are519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT223Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the Courtgoverned and construed by State laws. Their acquisi-tion and transfer of property, their right to collect theirdebts, and their liability to be sued for debts, are allbased on State law. It is only when the State law incapacitates the banks from discharging their duties to thegovernment that it becomes unconstitutional." 9 Wall.,at 362.The Court subsequently found numerous state laws applica-ble to federally chartered banks. See,e. g., Davis v. ElmiraSavings Bank, 161 U. S. 275, 290 (1896) ("Nothing, of course,in this opinion is intended to deny the operation of generaland undiscriminating state laws on the contracts of nationalbanks, so long as such laws do not conflict with the letter orthe general objects and purposes of Congressional legisla-tion"); First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S.640, 656 (1924) (national banks "are subject to the laws of aState in respect of their affairs unless such laws interferewith the purposes of their creation, tend to impair or destroytheir efficiency as federal agencies or conflict with the paramount law of the United States"); Wichita Royalty Co. v.City Nat. Bank of Wichita Falls, 306 U. S. 103 (1939) (apply-ing state law to tort claim by depositor against directors ofa national bank); Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U. S.233, 248 (1944) ("[N]ational banks are subject to state laws,unless those laws infringe the national banking laws or im-pose an undue burden on the performance of the banks' functions"); California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479U. S. 272 (1987) (applying state employment discriminationlaw to federally chartered savings and loan association).For present purposes, the consequence is the following: Topoint to a federal charter by itself shows no conflict, threat,or need for "federal common law." It does not answer thecritical question.Third, the FDIC refers to a conflict of laws principle calledthe "internal affairs doctrine"--a doctrine that this Courthas described as519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT224 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Court"a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that onlyone State should have the authority to regulate a corporation's internal affairs--matters peculiar to therelationships among or between the corporation and itscurrent officers, directors, and shareholders--becauseotherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands." Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624,645 (1982).States normally look to the State of a business' incorporationfor the law that provides the relevant corporate governancegeneral standard of care. Restatement (Second) Conflict ofLaws $ 309 (1971). And by analogy, it has been argued,courts should look to federal law to find the standard of caregoverning officers and directors of federally chartered banks.See Resolution Trust Corporation v. Chapman, 29 F. 3d1120, 1123-1124 (CA7 1994).To find a justification for federal common law in this argu-ment, however, is to substitute analogy or formal symmetryfor the controlling legal requirement, namely, the existenceof a need to create federal common law arising out of a significant conflict or threat to a federal interest. O'Melveny,512 U. S., at 85, 87. The internal affairs doctrine shows nosuch need, for it seeks only to avoid conflict by requiring thatthere be a single point of legal reference. Nothing in thatdoctrine suggests that the single source of law must be fed-eral. SeeChapman, supra, at 1126-1127 (Posner, C. J., dis-senting). In the absence of a governing federal common law,courts applying the internal affairs doctrine could find (wedo not say that they will find) that the State closest analogically to the State of incorporation of an ordinary business isthe State in which the federally chartered bank has its mainoffice or maintains its principal place of business. Cf. 61Fed. Reg. 4866 (1996) (to be codified in 12 CFR $ 7.2000) (federally chartered commercial banks may "follow the corporategovernance procedures of the law of the state in which themain office of the bank is located"). So to apply state law,519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT225Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the Courtas we have said, would tend to avoid disparity between fed-erally chartered and state-chartered banks (that might benext door to each other). And, of course, if this approachproved problematic, Congress and federal agencies actingpursuant to congressionally delegated authority remain freeto provide to the contrary.Fourth, the FDIC points to statutes that provide the OTS,a federal regulatory agency, with authority to fine, or to re-move from office, savings bank officers and directors for certain breaches of fiduciary duty. The FDIC adds that in "thecourse of such proceedings, the OTS, applying the ordinarycare standard [of Briggs,] . . . has spoken authoritativelyrespecting the duty of care owed by directors and officers tofederal savings associations." Brief for Respondent 23-25(citations omitted). The FDIC does not claim, however, thatthese OTS statements, interpreting a pre-existing judgemade federal common-law standard (i. e., that of Briggs)themselves amounted to an agency effort to promulgate abinding regulation pursuant to delegated congressional authority. Nor have we found, in our examination of the relevant OTS opinions, any convincing evidence of a relevant,significant conflict or threat to a federal interest.Finally, we note that here, as in O'Melveny, the FDIC isacting only as a receiver of a failed institution; it is not pursuing the interest of the Federal Government as a bank insurer--an interest likely present whether the insured institution is state, or federally, chartered.In sum, we can find no significant conflict with, or threatto, a federal interest. The federal need is far weaker thanwas present in what the Court has called the " `few and restricted' instances," Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 313(1981), in which this Court has created a federal common law.Consider, for example, Hinderlider v. La Plata River &Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92 (1938) (controversy between two States regarding apportionment of streamwater);Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500 (1988)519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT226 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Court(Federal Government contractors and civil liability of federalofficials); United States v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 332 U. S.301, 305 (1947) (relationship between Federal Governmentand members of its Armed Forces); Howard v. Lyons, 360U. S. 593, 597 (1959) ( liability of federal officers in the courseof official duty); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376U. S. 398, 425 (1964) (relationships with other countries).See also Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981) ("[A]bsent some congressional authorization to formulate substantive rules of decision, federalcommon law exists only in such narrow areas as those concerned with the rights and obligations of the United States,interstate and international disputes implicating the conflicting rights of States or our relations with foreign nations,and admiralty cases"). Indeed, the interests in many of thecases where this Court has declined to recognize federalcommon law appear at least as strong as, if not stronger than,those present here. E. g., Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63 (1966) (applying state law to claimsfor land owned and leased by the Federal Government); Kimbell Foods, 440 U. S., at 726, 732-738 (applying state law topriority of liens under federal lending programs).We conclude that the federal common-law standards enunciated in cases such as Briggs did not survive this Court'slater decision in Erie v. Tompkins. There is no federal common law that would create a general standard of care applicable to this case.IIIWe now turn to a further question: Does federal statutorylaw (namely, the federal "gross negligence" statute) supplantany state-law standard of care? The relevant parts of thatstatute read as follows:"A director or officer of an insured depository institutionmay be held personally liable for monetary damages inany civil action by, on behalf of, or at the request or519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the Courtdirection of the Corporation . . . acting as conservator orreceiver . . . for gross negligence, including any similarconduct or conduct that demonstrates a greater disre-gard of a duty of care (than gross negligence) includingintentional tortious conduct, as such terms are definedand determined under applicable State law.Nothing inthis paragraph shall impair or affect any right of theCorporation under other applicable law." 12 U. S. C.$ 1821(k) (emphasis added).Lower courts have taken different positions about whetherthis statute, in stating that directors and officers "may beheld personally liable" for conduct that amounts to "grossnegligence" or worse, immunizes them from liability for conduct that is less culpable than gross negligence such as sim-ple negligence. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v.McSweeney, 976 F. 2d 532, 537, n. 5 (CA9 1992), cert. denied,508 U. S. 950 (1993);Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationv. Canfield, 967 F. 2d 443, 446, n. 3 (CA10) (en banc), cert.dism'd, 506 U. S. 993 (1992); Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-poration v. Swager, 773 F. Supp. 1244 (Minn. 1991). See alsoPet. for Cert. i ("The questions presented for review are: 1.Whether Section 1821(k) supplants `federal common law' andconstitutes the exclusive standard of liability in a civil dam-age action brought by the Resolution Trust Corporation. . ."); Brief for American Bankers Association et al. as AmiciCuriae 7-8.In our view, the statute's "gross negligence" standard provides only a floor--a guarantee that officers and directorsmust meet at least a gross negligence standard. It does notstand in the way of a stricter standard that the laws of someStates provide.For one thing, the language of the statute contains a sav-ing clause that, read literally, preserves the applicability ofstricter state standards. It says "[n]othing in this para-graph shall impair or affectany right of the Corporationunder other applicable law." 12 U. S. C. $ 1821(k) (emphasis519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT228 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Courtadded). The petitioner, in contending that the statute dis-places federal common law, says that "any right" means onlya right created elsewhere in the same Act of Congress, forexample, by various regulatory enforcement provisions.E. g., $ 1818(b) (cease-and-desist provision). But that is notwhat the Act says nor does its language compel so restrictivea reading. That language, read naturally, suggests an interpretation broad enough to save rights provided by otherstate, or federal, law.For another thing, Congress enacted the statute against abackground of failing savings associations, see 135 Cong.Rec. 121 (1989) (statement of Rep. Roth); 135 Cong. Rec. 1760(1989) (statement of Sen. Graham), large federal paymentsto insured bank depositors, and recent changes in state lawdesigned to limit pre-existing officer and director negligenceliability. See, e. g., Fla. Stat. $ 607.0831 (1993) ("recklessnessor an act or omission . . . committed in bad faith or withmalicious purpose"); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 1701.59(D) (1994)("deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of thecorporation"). The state-law changes would have made itmore difficult for the Federal Government to recover, fromnegligent officers and directors, federal funds spent to rescuefailing savings banks and their depositors. And the background as a whole supports a reading of the statute as aneffort to preserve the Federal Government's ability to recover funds by creating a standard of care floor.The legislative history, insofar as it is relevant, supportsthis conclusion. Members of Congress repeatedly referredto the harm that liability-relaxing changes in state law hadcaused the Federal Government, hence the taxpayer, as federal banking agencies tried to recover, from negligent officers and directors, some of the money that federal insurershad to pay to depositors in their failed banks. E. g., 135Cong. Rec. 7150-7151 (1989) (statement of Sen. Riegle)("[T]he establishment of a Federal standard of care is based519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of the Courton the overriding Federal interest in protecting the sound-ness of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fund andis very limited in scope. It is not a wholesale preemption oflongstanding principles of corporate governance . . ."). Tohave pre-empted state law with a uniform federal "grossnegligence" standard would have cured the problem in someinstances (where state law was weaker) but would have aggravated it in others (where state law was stronger).In fact, the legislative history says more. The relevantSenate Report addresses the point specifically. It says:"This subsection does not prevent the FDIC from pursuing claims under State law or under other applicableFederal law, if such law permits the officers or directorsof a financial institution to be sued (1) for violating alower standard of care, such as simple negligence."S. Rep. No. 101-19, p. 318 (1989).This Report was not published until two weeks after Congress enacted the law. But, as petitioner elsewhere con-cedes, the Report was circulated within Congress severalweeks before Congress voted. In fact Senator Riegle, theBanking Committee Chairman, read the statement, on hisown behalf and that of Senator Garn, six weeks before Con-gress voted on the law. 135 Cong. Rec. 12374 (1989).

S. 388, 407(1987) (refusing to "attach substantial weight" to a Repre-sentative's statementmade 10 days after the enactment ofthe law).The history is not all on one side. The Congressional Record contains one statement that suggests a competing congressional purpose, namely, to protect bank officers and directors from too strict a liability standard. 135 Cong. Rec.7150 (1989) (statement of Sen. Sanford) (supporting "provisions relating to State laws affecting the liability of officers and directors of financial institutions" because "thesechanges are essential if we are to attract qualified officers519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT230 ATHERTON v. FDICOpinion of the Courtand directors to serve in our financial institutions"). But wehave not found other such statements. And that statementis inconsistent with the language of the Senate Report. Itsuggests an interpretation of the statute largely rejected inthe lower courts, namely, that it pre-empts stricter state lawas applied to state-chartered, as well as to federally char-tered, institutions. See,e. g., McSweeney, 976 F. 2d, at 540-541 (rejecting the interpretation as applied to state-chartered banks);Canfield, 967 F. 2d, at 448-449 (same).The petitioner, in the courts below and as an alternativeground in this Court, made a final complicated argument toexplain why 12 U. S. C. $ 1821(k) displaces federal commonlaw. He points to the universally conceded fact that the"gross negligence" statute applies to federal, as well as tostate, banks. He then assumes, for sake of the argument,that in the absence of the statute, federal common law woulddetermine liability for federal banks. He then asks whyCongress would have applied the "gross negligence" statuteto federal banks unless it wanted that statute to set an abso-lute standard, not a floor. After all, on the assumption that,without the statute, federal common law would hold federaldirectors and officers to a standard as strict, or stricter,there would have been no need for the statute unless (asapplied to federal banks) it intended to set a universal standard, freeing officers and directors from the potentially lessstrict standard of the common law, and not what, given theassumptions, would be a totally unnecessary floor. This argument, taken to its logical conclusion, would also suggestthat state standards of simple negligence would be displacedby the federal gross negligence statute.One obvious short answer to this ingenious argument liesin the fact that our conclusion in Part II runs contrary to theargument's critical assumption, namely, that federal commonlaw sets the standard of liability applicable to federal banks.State law applies. Without that assumption, the need for a"gross negligence" floor in the case of federally charteredbanks is identical to the need in the case of state-chartered519us2$15Q 06-03-99 18:57:34 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 519 U. S. 213 (1997)Opinion of O'Connor, J.banks. In both instances, the floor is needed to limit stateefforts to weaken liability standards; in both instances a floorserves that purpose; and the reasons for believing the statuteonly sets such a floor are equally strong.A more thorough answer lies in the fact that Congressnowhere separated its consideration of federally chartered,from that of state-chartered, banks. Congress did not askwhether one looked to federal common law or to state law tofind the liability standard applicable to federally charteredbanks. Nor did it try to determine the content of federalcommon law. One can reconcile congressional silence on thematter with a "gross negligence" statute, the language ofwhich brings all banks (federal- and state-chartered) withinits scope, simply by assuming that Congress, when enactingthe statute, wanted to leave other law, including the lawapplicable to federally chartered banks, exactly where Congress found it. That, after all, is what the statute says.And the saving clause language taken at face value permitsCongress to achieve its basic objective (providing a "grossnegligence" floor) without having to unravel the arcane intricacies of federal common law. In our view, this under-standing of congressional intent better explains the statute'slanguage and history than the petitioner's interpretation,imputing to Congress an intent to apply a uniform "grossnegligence" standard to federally chartered, but not statechartered, institutions.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
