Under a longstanding practice, a court sometimes treatsas a request for habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 a motion that a pro se federal prisoner has labeled differently.Such recharacterization can have serious consequences forthe prisoner, for it subjects any subsequent motion under$ 2255 to the restrictive conditions that federal law imposesupon a "second or successive" (but not upon a first) federalhabeas motion. $ 2255, || 8. In light of these consequences,we hold that the court cannot so recharacterize a pro se litigant's motion as the litigant's first $ 2255 motion unless thecourt informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize,warns the litigant that the recharacterization will subjectsubsequent $ 2255 motions to the law's "second or successive"restrictions, and provides the litigant with an opportunity towithdraw, or to amend, the filing. Where these things arenot done, a recharacterized motion will not count as a $ 2255motion for purposes of applying $ 2255's "second or successive" provision.IThis case focuses upon two motions that Hernan O'RyanCastro, a federal prisoner acting pro se, filed in federal court.He filed the first motion in 1994, the second in 1997.AThe relevant facts surrounding the 1994 motion are thefollowing:*Paul Mogin and Lisa B. Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging reversal.540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 CASTRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(1) On July 5, 1994, Castro filed a pro se motion attackinghis federal drug conviction, a motion that he called a Rule33 motion for a new trial. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 33.(2) The Government, in its response, said that Castro'sclaims were "more properly cognizable" as federal habeascorpus claims, i. e., claims made under the authority of 28U. S. C. $ 2255. But, the Government added, it did notobject to the court's considering Castro's motion as havinginvoked both Rule 33 and $ 2255.(3) The District Court denied Castro's motion on the merits. In its accompanying opinion, the court generally re-ferred to Castro's motion as a Rule 33 motion; but the courttwice referred to it as a $ 2255 motion as well. App. 137-144.(4) Castro, still actingpro se, appealed, but he didnot challenge the District Court's recharacterization of hismotion.(5) The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed. It said inits one-paragraph order that it was ruling on a motion basedupon both Rule 33 and $ 2255. Judgt. order reported at 82F. 3d 429 (CA11 1996); App. 147.BThe relevant facts surrounding the 1997 motion are thefollowing:(1) On April 18, 1997, Castro, acting pro se, filed what hecalled a $ 2255 motion. The motion included claims notraised in the 1994 motion, including a claim of ineffectiveassistance of counsel.(2) The District Court denied the motion; Castro appealed;and the Court of Appeals remanded for further considerationof the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. It also askedthe District Court to consider whether, in light of the 1994motion, Castro's motion was his second $ 2255 motion, ratherthan his first.(3) On remand, the District Court appointed counsel forCastro. It then decided that the 1997 motion was indeed540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 540 U. S. 375 (2003)Opinion of the CourtCastro's second $ 2255 motion (the 1994 motion being hisfirst). And it dismissed the motion for failure to complywith one of $ 2255's restrictive "second or successive" condi-tions (namely, Castro's failure to obtain the Court of Appeals'permission to file a "second or successive" motion). $ 2255,|| 8. The District Court granted Castro a certificate to appeal its "second or successive" determination. $ 2253(c)(1).(4) The Eleventh Circuit affirmed by a split (2-to-1) vote.290 F. 3d 1270 (2002). The majority "suggested" and"urged" district courts in the future to "warn prisoners ofthe consequences of recharacterization and provide themwith the opportunity to amend or dismiss their filings."Id.,at 1273, 1274. But it held that the 1994 court's failure to doso did not legally undermine its recharacterization. Hence,Castro's current $ 2255 motion was indeed his second habeasmotion. Id., at 1274.Other Circuits have taken a different approach. E. g.,United States v. Palmer, 296 F. 3d 1135, 1145-1147 (CADC2002) (announcing a rulerequiring courts to notify pro selitigants prior to recharacterization and refusing to find the$ 2255 motion before it "second or successive" since such no-tice was lacking). We consequently granted Castro's petition for certiorari. IIWe begin with a jurisdictional matter. We asked the par-ties to consider the relevance of a provision in the federalhabeas corpus statutes that says that the"grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appealsto file a second or successive application . . . shall not bethe subject of a petition for . . . a writ of certiorari." 28U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(E).After receiving the parties' responses, we conclude that thisprovision does not bar our review here.Castro's appeal to the Eleventh Circuit did not concern an"authorization . . . to file a second or successive application."540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 CASTRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe District Court certified for appeal the question whetherCastro's $ 2255 motion was his first such motion or his second. Castro then argued to the Eleventh Circuit that his$ 2255 motion was his first; and he asked the court to reverse the District Court's dismissal of that motion. He no-where asked the Court of Appeals to grant, and it nowheredenied, any "authorization . . . to file a second or successiveapplication."The Government argues that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion had the effect of denying "authorization . . . to file a sec-ond . . . application" because the court said in its opinion thatCastro's motion could not meet the requirements for secondor successive motions. 290 F. 3d, at 1273. For that reason,the Government concludes, the court's decision falls withinthe scope of the jurisdictional provision. Brief for UnitedStates 16.In our view, however, this argument stretches the wordsof the statute too far. Given the context, we cannot takethese words in the opinion as a statutorily relevant "denial"of a request that was not made. Even if, for argument'ssake, we were to accept the Government's characterization,the argument nonetheless would founder on the statute's requirement that the "denial" must be the "subject" of the certiorari petition. The "subject" of Castro's petition is not theCourt of Appeals' "denial of an authorization." It is thelower courts' refusal to recognize that this $ 2255 motion ishis first, not his second. That is a very different question.Cf. Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U. S. 275,282-283 (1978) (statute barring court review of lawfulness of agency "emission standard" in criminal case doesnot bar court review of whether regulation is an "emissionstandard").Moreover, reading the statute as the Government suggestswould produce troublesome results. It would create procedural anomalies, allowing review where the lower court decision disfavors, but denying review where it favors, the Gov540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 540 U. S. 375 (2003)Opinion of the Courternment. Cf. Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637,641-642 (1998) (allowing the Government to obtain review ofa decision that a habeas corpus application is not "second orsuccessive"). It would close our doors to a class of habeaspetitioners seeking review without any clear indication thatsuch was Congress' intent. Cf. Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.651, 660-661 (1996). And any such conclusion would provedifficult to reconcile with the basic principle that we "readlimitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly." Utah v.Evans, 536 U. S. 452, 463 (2002).We conclude that we have the power to review Castro'sclaim, and we turn to the merits of that claim.IIIFederal courts sometimes will ignore the legal label thata pro se litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize themotion in order to place it within a different legal category.See, e. g., Raineri v. United States, 233 F. 3d 96, 100 (CA12000); United States v. Detrich, 940 F. 2d 37, 38 (CA2 1991);United States v. Miller, 197 F. 3d 644, 648 (CA3 1999); Rainesv. United States, 423 F. 2d 526, 528, n. 1 (CA4 1970); UnitedStates v. Santora, 711 F. 2d 41, 42 (CA5 1983); United Statesv. McDowell, 305 F. 2d 12, 14 (CA6 1962); Henderson v.United States, 264 F. 3d 709, 711 (CA7 2001); McIntyre v.United States, 508 F. 2d 403, n. 1 (CA8 1975) (per curiam);United States v. Eatinger, 902 F. 2d 1383, 1385 (CA9 1990)(per curiam); United States v. Kelly, 235 F. 3d 1238, 1242(CA10 2000); United States v. Jordan, 915 F. 2d 622, 625(CA11 1990); United States v. Tindle, 522 F. 2d 689, 693(CADC 1975) (per curiam). They may do so in order toavoid an unnecessary dismissal, e. g., id., at 692-693, to avoidinappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519, 520 (1972)(per curiam), or to create a better correspondence betweenthe substance of a pro se motion's claim and its underlying540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 CASTRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlegal basis, see Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U. S. 5, 10 (1980) (percuriam); Andrews v. United States, 373 U. S. 334 (1963).We here address one aspect of this practice, namely, certain legal limits that nine Circuits have placed on recharacterization. Those Circuits recognize that, by recharacterizing as a first $ 2255 motion a pro se litigant's filing that didnot previously bear that label, the court may make it significantly more difficult for that litigant to file another suchmotion. They have consequently concluded that a districtcourt may not recharacterize a pro se litigant's motion as arequest for relief under $ 2255--unless the court first warnsthe pro se litigant about the consequences of the recharacterization, thereby giving the litigant an opportunity to contestthe recharacterization, or to withdraw or amend the motion.See Adams v. United States, 155 F. 3d 582, 583 (CA2 1998)(per curiam); United States v. Miller, supra, at 646-647(CA3); United States v. Emmanuel, 288 F. 3d 644, 646-647(CA4 2002); In re Shelton, 295 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA6 2002)(per curiam); Henderson v. United States, supra, at 710-711(CA7); Morales v. United States, 304 F. 3d 764, 767 (CA82002); United States v. Seesing, 234 F. 3d 456, 463 (CA9 2000);United States v. Kelly, supra, at 1240-1241 (CA10); UnitedStates v. Palmer, 296 F. 3d, at 1146 (CADC); see also 290F. 3d, at 1273, 1274 (case below) (suggesting that courts provide such warnings).No one here contests the lawfulness of this judicially created requirement. The Government suggests that FederalRule of Appellate Procedure 47 provides adequate underlying legal authority for the procedural practice. Brief forUnited States 42. It suggests that this Court has the authority to regulate the practice through "the exercise" ofour "supervisory powers" over the Federal Judiciary. E. g.,McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 340-341 (1943).And it notes that limiting the courts' authority to recharacterize, approximately as the Courts of Appeals have done,540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 540 U. S. 375 (2003)Opinion of the Court"is likely to reduce and simplify litigation over questions ofcharacterization, which are often quite difficult." Brief forUnited States 42.We agree with these suggestions. We consequently hold,as almost every Court of Appeals has already held, that thelower courts' recharacterization powers are limited in thefollowing way:The limitation applies when a court recharacterizes apro se litigant's motion as a first $ 2255 motion. In such cir-cumstances the district court must notify thepro se litigantthat it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent$ 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on "secondor successive" motions, and provide the litigant an opportu-nity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it containsall the $ 2255 claims he believes he has. If the court fails todo so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a$ 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions thelaw's "second or successive" restrictions. $ 2255, || 8.IVThe District Court that considered Castro's 1994 motionfailed to give Castro warnings of the kind we have described.Moreover, this Court's "supervisory power" determinationsnormally apply, like other judicial decisions, retroactively, atleast to the case in which the determination was made. McNabb, supra, at 347 (applying new supervisory rule to casebefore the Court). Hence, given our holding in Part III,supra, Castro's 1994 motion cannot be considered a first$ 2255 motion, and his 1997 motion cannot be considered a"second or successive" motion--unless there is somethingspecial about Castro's case.The Government argues that there is something special:Castro failed to appeal the 1994 recharacterization. According to the Government, that fact makes the 1994 recharacter540US2 Unit: $$U9 [10-27-05 19:34:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 CASTRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtization valid as a matter of "law of the case." And, sincethe 1994 recharacterization is valid, the 1997 $ 2255 motionis Castro's second, not his first.We do not agree. No Circuit that has considered whetherto treat a $ 2255 motion as successive (based on a prior unwarned recharacterization) has found that the litigant's failure to challenge that recharacterization makes a difference.See Palmer, supra, at 1147; see also Henderson, 264 F. 3d,at 711-712; Raineri, 233 F. 3d, at 100; In re Shelton, supra,at 622. That is not surprising, for the very point of thewarning is to help the pro se litigant understand not only(1) whether he should withdraw or amend his motion, butalso (2) whether he should contest the recharacterization,say, on appeal. The "lack of warning" prevents his makingan informed judgment in respect to the latter just as it doesin respect to the former. Indeed, an unwarned pro se litigant's failure to appeal a recharacterization simply underscores the practical importance of providing the warning.Hence, an unwarned recharacterization cannot count as a$ 2255 motion for purposes of the "second or successive" provision, whether the unwarned pro se litigant does, or doesnot, take an appeal.The law of the case doctrine cannot pose an insurmountable obstacle to our reaching this conclusion. Assuming forargument's sake that the doctrine applies here, it simply"expresses" common judicial "practice"; it does not "limit"the courts' power. See Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S.436, 444 (1912) (Holmes, J.). It cannot prohibit a court fromdisregarding an earlier holding in an appropriate case which,for the reasons set forth, we find this case to be.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
