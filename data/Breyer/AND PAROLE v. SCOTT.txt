The question before us is whether defendants in a casefiled in a state court, with claims "arising under" federal law,can remove that case to federal court--where some claims,made against a State, are subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar. We conclude that the defendants can remove thecase to a federal court and that the court can decide thenonbarred claims. IIn 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections dis-missed Keith Schacht, a prison guard, for stealing items fromthe Oakhill Correctional Institution, a state prison. In Jan-uary 1996, Schacht filed a complaint in state court againstthe Department and several of its employees, both in their"personal" and in their "official" capacities. The complaint,in several different claims, alleged that the Department andits employees had deprived Schacht of "liberty" and "property" without "due process of law," thereby violating theFederal Constitution and civil rights laws.

The defendants immediately removed the case to federal court.The defendants' answer, filed in federal court, in partraised as a "defense" that the "eleventh amendment to theUnited States Constitution, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity, bars any claim under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against" theState itself, namely, the "defendant Wisconsin Departmentof Corrections [and] against any of the named defendants intheir official capacities."

S. 781, 782 (1978) (per curiam) (suit againststate agency is barred by the Eleventh Amendment).After further proceedings, the Federal District Courtconsidered those claims that were not against the State,that is, the claims against the individual defendants in their"personal capacit[ies]." It concluded as to those claims that,even if Schacht's factual allegations were true, Schachthad received the process that was his "due," and his dismissal did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

Id., at 34.The federal court also considered the defendants' motionto dismiss those claims filed against the State, i. e., the claimsagainst the Department of Corrections and its employees intheir "official capacities."

He did not assert that the DistrictCourt was wrong to have dismissed the claims against theState. He argued only that the court's disposition of the"personal capacity" claims, i. e., the grant of summary judgment, was legally erroneous. During the appeal, the Courtof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit itself raised the questionwhether the removal from state to federal court had beenlegally permissible. See 116 F. 3d 1151, 1153 (1997). Aftersupplemental briefing, the Court of Appeals concluded thatremoval had been improper and the federal courts lackedjurisdiction over Schacht's case. Ibid.The Court of Appeals pointed out that Schacht's originalstate-court complaint, while presenting only claims arisingunder federal law, asserted some of those claims against theState. Id., at 1152. The court added that the EleventhAmendment, as interpreted by this Court, prohibited the assertion of those claims in federal court. Ibid. (citing U. S.Const., Amdt. 11; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S 1, 10 (1890)).The Court of Appeals concluded that the presence of evenone such claim in an otherwise removable case deprived thefederal courts of removal jurisdiction over the entire case.116 F. 3d, at 1152-1153 (relying onFrances J. v. Wright, 19F. 3d 337, 341 (CA7 1994)). Hence, it held, the DistrictCourt's judgment must be vacated and the entire case re-turned to the state court for the litigation to begin all overagain. 116 F. 3d, at 1153-1154.We granted certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit's viewof the matter, and the similar views taken in several earliercases upon which that court relied, see,e. g., Frances J.,supra; McKay v. Boyd Constr. Co., 769 F. 2d 1084 (CA5 1985).Those decisions conflict with the decisions of other Courts ofAppeals. See, e. g., Kruse v. Hawai`i, 68 F. 3d 331 (CA91995); Henry v. Metropolitan Sewer Dist., 922 F. 2d 332 (CA61990); see also Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F. 2d 1211 (CA11524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTOpinion of the Court1986). We now conclude, contrary to the Seventh Circuit,that the presence in an otherwise removable case of a claimthat the Eleventh Amendment may bar does not destroy re-moval jurisdiction that would otherwise exist.IIThe governing provision of the federal removal statute au-thorizes a defendant to remove "any civil action brought ina State court of which the district courts of the United Stateshave original jurisdiction." 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). See alsoJudiciary Act of 1789, $ 12, 1 Stat. 79-80 (original removalstatute); Act of Mar. 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by Actof Aug. 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433 (setting forth removal powerin terms roughly similar to present law). The language ofthis section obviously permits the removal of a case that con-tains only claims that "arise under" federal law. That is because a federal statute explicitly grants the federal courts"original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under theConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," 28U. S. C. $ 1331. This case, however, requires us to considerwhat happens if one, or more, of those claims is subject to anEleventh Amendment bar. Does that circumstance destroyremoval jurisdiction that would otherwise exist?The primary argument that it does destroy removal jurisdiction has several parts. First, the argument distinguishesa case with federal-law claims that include one or more Eleventh Amendment claims from a case with both federal-lawclaims and state-law claims. See 116 F. 3d, at 1152. Wehave suggested that the presence of even one claim "arisingunder" federal law is sufficient to satisfy the requirementthat the case be within the original jurisdiction of the dis-trict court for removal. See Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156, 163-166 (1997). In Chicago,for example, we wrote:"[The] federal claims suffice to make the actions `civilactions' within the `original jurisdiction' of the district524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcourts for purposes of removal. . . . Nothing in the ju-risdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the]complaints, by virtue of their federal claims, were `civilactions' within the federal courts' `original jurisdic-tion.' "Id., at 166 (citation omitted).See also Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58(1987); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction LaborersVacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 7-12 (1983).This statement, however, and others like it, appear in thecontext of cases involving both federal-law and state-lawclaims. And the Seventh Circuit found a significant difference between such cases and cases in which the EleventhAmendment applies to some of the federal-law claims. See116 F. 3d, at 1152. In the former cases the state-law claimsfall within the supplemental jurisdiction of the federalcourts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows federal courts tohear and decide state-law claims along with federal-lawclaims when they "are so related to claims in the actionwithin such original jurisdiction that they form part of thesame case or controversy." 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(a); see Chi-cago, supra, at 164-166. Cf. $ 1441(c) (explicitly providingdiscretionary removal jurisdiction over entire case wherefederal claim is accompanied by a "separate and independent" state-law claim). In the latter cases, the comparableclaims do not fall within the federal courts' "pendent" jurisdiction, but rather, it is argued, are claims that the EleventhAmendment prohibits the federal courts from deciding.Second, the argument emphasizes the "jurisdictional" na-ture of this difference. The Seventh Circuit, for example,said: "Claims barred by sovereign immunity stand on differ-ent footing than other claims that are not independently removable, because of the affirmative limitation on jurisdictionimposed by the sovereign immunity doctrines." 116 F. 3d,at 1152 (citing Frances J., supra, at 340-341, and n. 4). Thatis to say, according to the Court of Appeals, neither the law524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTOpinion of the Courtpermitting supplemental jurisdiction, nor any other law, see,e. g., $ 1441(c), gives the federal court the power to decide aclaim barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See PennhurstState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 121(1984); Frances J., 19 F. 3d, at 341.Third, the argument looks to removal based upon "diversity jurisdiction," 28 U. S. C. $ 1332, for analogical authority that leads to its conclusion, namely, that this "jurisdictional" problem is so serious that the presence of even oneEleventh-Amendment-barred claim destroys removal jurisdiction with respect to all claims (i. e., the entire "case").See, e. g., 116 F. 3d, at 1152 (citing Frances J., supra, at 341);McKay v. Boyd Constr. Co., 769 F. 2d, at 1086-1087 (discussing analogy to removal based on diversity jurisdiction). Acase falls within the federal district court's "original" diversity "jurisdiction" only if diversity of citizenship among theparties is complete, i. e., only if there is no plaintiff and nodefendant who are citizens of the same State. See Cardenv. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 187 (1990); Strawbridgev. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806). But cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.21; Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826,832-838 (1989) (Rule 21 authorizes courts to dismiss nondiverse defendants in order to cure jurisdictional defects, instead of the entire case). Consequently, this Court has indicated that a defendant cannot remove a case that containssome claims against "diverse" defendants as long as there isone claim brought against a "nondiverse" defendant. SeeCaterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 68-69 (1996). If theanalogy is appropriate, then, an Eleventh Amendment barwith respect to one claim would prevent removal of a casethat contains some "arising under" claims, which, had theystood alone, would have permitted removal. Frances J.,supra, at 341; McKay, supra, at 1087.We find the analogy unconvincing. This case differs significantly from a diversity case with respect to a federal dis524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Opinion of the Courttrict court's original jurisdiction. The presence of the nondiverse party automatically destroys original jurisdiction:No party need assert the defect. No party can waive thedefect or consent to jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694,702 (1982); People's Bank v. Calhoun, 102 U. S. 256, 260-261(1880). No court can ignore the defect; rather a court, noticing the defect, must raise the matter on its own. InsuranceCorp. of Ireland, supra, at 702; Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co.v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884).The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not automatically destroy original jurisdiction. Rather, the EleventhAmendment grants the State a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so. The Statecan waive the defense. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 241 (1985); Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S.436, 447 (1883). Nor need a court raise the defect on itsown. Unless the State raises the matter, a court can ignoreit. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 515,n. 19 (1982).These differences help to explain why governing authorityhas treated the defects differently for purposes of originaljurisdiction. Where original jurisdiction rests upon Congress' statutory grant of "diversity jurisdiction," this Courthas held that one claim against one nondiverse defendantdestroys that original jurisdiction. See, e. g., NewmanGreen, Inc., supra, at 829 ("When a plaintiff sues more thanone defendant in a diversity action, the plaintiff must meetthe requirements of the diversity statute for each defendantor face dismissal"). But, where original jurisdiction restsupon the Statute's grant of "arising under" jurisdiction, theCourt has assumed that the presence of a potential EleventhAmendment bar with respect to one claim, has not destroyedoriginal jurisdiction over the case. E. g., Pugh, 438 U. S.,at 782; Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265 (1986). See also524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTOpinion of the CourtHenry, 922 F. 2d, at 338-339; Roberts v. College of the Desert,870 F. 2d 1411, 1415 (CA9 1988). Cf.Pennhurst, supra, at121 (suggesting that courts must analyze the applicability ofthe Eleventh Amendment to each claim rather than case aswhole). Since a federal court would have original jurisdiction to hear this case had Schacht originally filed it there,the defendants may remove the case from state to federalcourts. See $ 1441(a).Other considerations further undermine the analogy. Forexample, for purposes of removal jurisdiction, we are to lookat the case as of the time it was filed in state court--priorto the time the defendants filed their answer in federal court.See, e. g., St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,303 U. S. 283, 291 (1938) ("[T]he status of the case as disclosed by the plaintiff 's complaint is controlling in the caseof a removal, since the defendant must file his petition beforethe time for answer or forever lose his right to remove").As of that time, a case that involved "incomplete diversity"automatically would have fallen outside the federal courts'"original jurisdiction." By contrast, as of that time, theState's participation as a defendant would not automaticallyhave placed the case outside the federal courts' jurisdictionalauthority. That is because the underlying relevant condition (the federal courts' effort to assert jurisdiction over anobjecting State) could not have existed prior to removal, see,e. g., Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980), and because the State might not have asserted the defense in federal court, but could have decided instead to defend on themerits. (Here, for example, the State, while not waiving itsEleventh Amendment defense, has asserted in the alternative that Schacht could not state a $ 1983 claim against theState. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S.58, 64 (1989).)These differences between "diversity" and "EleventhAmendment" cases with respect to original and removal jurisdiction are sufficient to destroy the analogy upon which524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe lower court opinions rest. A case such as this one ismore closely analogous to cases in which a later event, say,the change in the citizenship of a party or a subsequent re-duction of the amount at issue below jurisdictional levels,destroys previously existing jurisdiction. In such cases, afederal court willkeep a removed case. See St. Paul Mer-cury Indemnity Co., supra, at 293-295; Phelps v. Oaks, 117U. S. 236, 240-241 (1886); Kanouse v. Martin, 15 How. 198,207-210 (1854). See also Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill,484 U. S. 343, 350, and n. 7 (1988) (federal court may exercisejurisdiction over remaining state-law claims under supplemental jurisdiction, if all federal-law claims are eliminatedbefore trial). Here, too, at the time of removal, this case fellwithin the "original jurisdiction" of the federal courts. TheState's later invocation of the Eleventh Amendment placedthe particular claim beyond the power of the federal courtsto decide, but it did not destroy removal jurisdiction overthe entire case. IIIWe must consider one further argument that respondenthas made. That argument is not based upon an analogy butupon the specific language of a particular statutory provision,28 U. S. C. $ 1447(c). The provision says: "If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lackssubject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded."Ibid. Respondent argues that, at least after the State as-serted its Eleventh Amendment defense, the federal court"lacked subject matter jurisdiction." Brief for Respondent19. He points out that the statute says that the entire "caseshall be remanded" to the state court. That is to say, hecontends that, if the "district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction" over any claim, then every claim, i. e., the entire"case," must be "remanded" to the state court.Even making the assumption that Eleventh Amendmentimmunity is a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction--a question we have not decided--we reject respondent's argument524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTOpinion of the Courtbecause we do not read the statute in this way. An ordinaryreading of the language indicates that the statute refers toan instance in which a federal court "lacks subject matterjurisdiction" over a "case," and not simply over one claimwithin a case. Cf. $ 1441(c) (permitting "the entire case" tobe removed or remanded, when one or more "non-removableclaims or causes of action" is joined with a federal question"claim or cause of action"). Conceivably, one might alsoread the statute's reference to "case" to include a claimwithin a case as well as the entire case. But neither readinghelps Schacht. The former reading would make the provision inapplicable here; the latter would make it applicable,but requires remand only of the relevant claims, and not theentire case as Schacht contends.Nor does the statute's purpose favor Schacht's interpretation. The statutory section that contains the provisiondeals, not with the question of what is removable, but withthe procedures that a federal court is to follow after removaloccurs. It is entitled: "Procedure after removal generally."$ 1447. In substance, the section differentiates between removals that are defective because of lack of subject-matterjurisdiction and removals that are defective for some otherreason, e. g., because the removal took place after relevanttime limits had expired. For the latter kind of case, theremust be a motion to remand filed no later than 30 days afterthe filing of the removal notice. $ 1447(c). For the formerkind of case, remand may take place without such a motionand at any time. Ibid. The provision, then, helps to specifya procedural difference that flows from a difference in thekinds of reasons that could lead to a remand. That objectiveis irrelevant to the kind of problem presented in this case.We repeat our conclusion: A State's proper assertion of anEleventh Amendment bar after removal means that the federal court cannot hear the barred claim. But that circumstance does not destroy removal jurisdiction over the remaining claims in the case before us. A federal court can524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Kennedy, J., concurringproceed to hear those other claims, and the District Courtdid not err in doing so.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Kennedy, concurring.In joining the opinion of the Court, I write to observe wehave neither reached nor considered the argument that, bygiving its express consent to removal of the case from statecourt, Wisconsin waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.Insofar as the record shows, this issue was not raised in theproceedings below; and it was not part of the briefs filed hereor the arguments made to the Court. The question shouldbe considered, however, in some later case.Removal requires the consent of all of the defendants.See,e. g., Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Martin, 178 U. S. 245,248 (1900); 14A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 3731, p. 504 (2d ed. 1985). Herethe State consented to removal but then registered a promptobjection to the jurisdiction of the United States DistrictCourt over the claim against it. By electing to remove, theState created the difficult problem confronted in the Courtof Appeals and now here. This is the situation in which lawusually says a party must accept the consequences of its ownacts. It would seem simple enough to rule that once a Stateconsents to removal, it may not turn around and say theEleventh Amendment bars the jurisdiction of the federalcourt. Consent to removal, it can be argued, is a waiver ofthe Eleventh Amendment immunity.Given the latitude accorded the States in raising the immu-nity at a late stage, however, a rule of waiver may not be allthat obvious. The Court has said the Eleventh Amendmentbar may be asserted for the first time on appeal, so a Statewhich is sued in federal court does not waive the EleventhAmendment simply by appearing and defending on the mer524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTKennedy, J., concurringits. See Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc.,458 U. S. 670, 683, n. 18 (1982) (plurality opinion); see alsoCalderon v. Ashmus, 523 U. S. 740, 745, n. 2 (1998); Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89,99, n. 8 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 678 (1974);Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S.459, 467 (1945).I have my doubts about the propriety of this rule. In per-mitting the belated assertion of the Eleventh Amendmentbar, we allow States to proceed to judgment without facingany real risk of adverse consequences. Should the Stateprevail, the plaintiff would be bound by principles of res judicata. If the State were to lose, however, it could void theentire judgment simply by asserting its immunity on appeal.This departure from the usual rules of waiver stems fromthe hybrid nature of the jurisdictional bar erected by theEleventh Amendment. In certain respects, the immunitybears substantial similarity to personal jurisdiction requirements, since it can be waived and courts need not raise theissue sua sponte. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,457 U. S. 496, 516, n. 19 (1982). Permitting the immunity tobe raised at any stage of the proceedings, in contrast, is moreconsistent with regarding the Eleventh Amendment as alimit on the federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction. SeeInsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites deGuinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702-704 (1982) (comparing personaljurisdiction with subject-matter jurisdiction). We havenoted the inconsistency. Although the text is framed interms of the extent of the "Judicial power of the UnitedStates," U. S. Const., Amdt. 11, our precedents have treatedthe Eleventh Amendment as "enact[ing] a sovereign immunity from suit, rather than a nonwaivable limit on the federal judiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction." Idaho v. Coeurd'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267 (1997); see alsoE. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction $ 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed.1994) (noting that allowing waiver of the immunity "seems524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Kennedy, J., concurringinconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a re-striction on the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction").The Court could eliminate the unfairness by modifyingour Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence to make it more consistent with our practice regarding personal jurisdiction.Under a rule inferring waiver from the failure to raise theobjection at the outset of the proceedings, States would beprevented from gaining an unfair advantage. See Fed. RuleCiv. Proc. 12(h)(1).We would not need to make this substantial revision tofind waiver in the circumstances here, however. Even if appearing in federal court and defending on the merits is notsufficient to constitute a waiver, a different case may be presented when a State under no compulsion to appear in federal court voluntarily invokes its jurisdiction. As the Courtrecognized in Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S.273, 284 (1906), "where a State voluntarily becomes a partyto a cause and submits its rights for judicial determination,it will be bound thereby and cannot escape the result of itsown voluntary act by invoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment."An early decision of this Court applied this principle inholding that a State's voluntary intervention in a federalcourt action to assert its own claim constituted a waiver ofthe Eleventh Amendment. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,447-448 (1883); see also Employees of Dept. of Public Healthand Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 294, n. 10 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (citing Clark v. Barnard with approval);Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,276 (1959) (same); Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18, 24-25(1933) (same). The Court also found a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment when a State voluntarily appeared in bankruptcy court to file a claim against a common fund. Gardnerv. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 574 (1947). Since a State whichis made a defendant to a state-court action is under no com524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. SCHACHTKennedy, J., concurringpulsion to appear in federal court and, like any other defendant, has the unilateral right to block removal of the case, anyappearance the State makes in federal court may well beregarded as voluntary in the same manner as the appearances which gave rise to the waivers in Clark and Gardner.Some Courts of Appeals, following this reasoning, haverecognized that consent to removal may constitute a waiver.Newfield House, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare,651 F. 2d 32, 36, n. 3 (CA1), cert. denied, 454 U. S. 1114 (1981);see also Estate of Porter v. Illinois, 36 F. 3d 684, 691 (CA71994); Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F. 2d 1211, 1214 (CA11 1986);Gwinn Area Community Schools v. Michigan, 741 F. 2d 840,847 (CA6 1984). These cases have first inquired, however,whether state law authorized the attorneys representing theState to waive the Eleventh Amendment on its behalf. Petitioners cited this qualification when we raised the issue atoral argument in the instant case. This was also the Court'sapparent concern in Ford Motor Co., in which it held:"It is conceded by the respondents that if it is withinthe power of the administrative and executive officers ofIndiana to waive the state's immunity, they have doneso in this proceeding. The issue thus becomes one oftheir power under state law to do so. As this issue hasnot been determined by state courts, this Court mustresort to the general policy of the state as expressed inits Constitution, statutes and decisions. Article 4, $ 24of the Indiana Constitution provides:" `Provision may be made, by general law, for bringingsuit against the State, as to all liabilities originatingafter the adoption of this Constitution; but no special actauthorizing such suit to be brought, or making compensation to any person claiming damages against the State,shall ever be passed.'"We interpret this provision as indicating a policy prohibiting state consent to suit in one particular case in524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN397Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)Kennedy, J., concurringthe absence of a general consent to suit in all similarcauses of action. Since the state legislature may waivestate immunity only by general law, it is not to be pre-sumed in the absence of clear language to the contrary,that they conferred on administrative or executive offi-cers discretionary power to grant or withhold consent inindividual cases. . . . It would seem, therefore, that noproperly authorized executive or administrative officerof the state has waived the state's immunity to suit inthe federal courts." 323 U. S., at 467-469 (footnotesomitted).See also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 396, n. 2 (1975).Notwithstanding the quoted language from Ford MotorCo., the absence of specific authorization, it seems to me, isnot an insuperable obstacle to adopting a rule of waiver inevery case where the State, through its attorneys, consentsto removal from the state court to the federal court. If theStates know or have reason to expect that removal will con-stitute a waiver, then it is easy enough to presume that anattorney authorized to represent the State can bind it to thejurisdiction of the federal court (for Eleventh Amendmentpurposes) by the consent to removal.It is true as well that the Court's recent cases have disfavored constructive waivers of the Eleventh Amendment andhave required the State's consent to suit be unequivocal.Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 246-247(1985); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S., at 673. The conductwhich may give rise to the waiver in the instance of removalis far less equivocal than the conduct at issue in those cases,however. Here the State's consent amounted to a direct in-vocation of the jurisdiction of the federal courts, an actconsiderably more specific than the general participation ina federal program found insufficient inAtascadero andEdelman.These questions should be explored.

UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuitNo. 97-1192. Argued June 8, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998When various investigations of the 1993 dismissal of White House TravelOffice employees were beginning, Deputy White House Counsel VincentW. Foster, Jr., met with petitioner Hamilton, an attorney at petitionerlaw firm, to seek legal representation. Hamilton took handwrittennotes at their meeting. Nine days later, Foster committed suicide.Subsequently, a federal grand jury, at the Independent Counsel's request, issued subpoenas for, inter alia, the handwritten notes as part ofan investigation into whether crimes were committed during the priorinvestigations into the firings. Petitioners moved to quash, arguing,among other things, that the notes were protected by the attorneyclient privilege. The District Court agreed and denied enforcement ofthe subpoenas. In reversing, the Court of Appeals recognized thatmost courts assume the privilege survives death, but noted that suchreferences usually occur in the context of the well-recognized testamentary exception to the privilege allowing disclosure for disputes amongthe client's heirs. The court declared that the risk of posthumous revelation, when confined to the criminal context, would have little to nochilling effect on client communication, but that the costs of protectingcommunications after death were high. Concluding that the privilegeis not absolute in such circumstances, and that instead, a balancing testshould apply, the court held that there is a posthumous exception to theprivilege for communications whose relative importance to particularcriminal litigation is substantial.Held: Hamilton's notes are protected by the attorney-client privilege.This Court's inquiry must be guided by "the principles of the commonlaw . . . as interpreted by the courts . . . in light of reason and experience." Fed. Rule Evid. 501. The relevant case law demonstrates thatit has been overwhelmingly, if not universally, accepted, for well over acentury, that the privilege survives the client's death in a case such asthis. While the Independent Counsel's arguments against the privilege's posthumous survival are not frivolous, he has simply not satisfiedhis burden of showing that "reason and experience" require a departurefrom the common-law rule. His interpretation--that the testamentaryexception supports the privilege's posthumous termination because inpractice most cases have refused to apply the privilege posthumously;524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATESSyllabusthat the exception reflects a policy judgment that the interest in settlingestates outweighs any posthumous interest in confidentiality; and that,by analogy, the interest in determining whether a crime has been committed should trump client confidentiality, particularly since the estate'sfinancial interests are not at stake--does not square with the case law'simplicit acceptance of the privilege's survival and with its treatment oftestamentary disclosure as an "exception" or an implied "waiver." Andhis analogy's premise is incorrect, since cases have consistently recognized that the testamentary exception furthers the client's intent,whereas there is no reason to suppose the same is true with respect togrand jury testimony about confidential communications. Knowingthat communications will remain confidential even after death serves aweighty interest in encouraging a client to communicate fully andfrankly with counsel; posthumous disclosure of such communicationsmay be as feared as disclosure during the client's lifetime. The Independent Counsel's suggestion that a posthumous disclosure rule willchill only clients intent on perjury, not truthful clients or those asserting the Fifth Amendment, incorrectly equates the privilege againstself-incrimination with the privilege here at issue, which serves muchbroader purposes. Clients consult attorneys for a wide variety ofreasons, many of which involve confidences that are not admissions ofcrime, but nonetheless are matters the clients would not wish divulged.The suggestion that the proposed exception would have minimal impactif confined to criminal cases, or to information of substantial importancein particular criminal cases, is unavailing because there is no case lawholding that the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases,and because a client may not know when he discloses information to hisattorney whether it will later be relevant to a civil or criminal matter,let alone whether it will be of substantial importance. Balancing expost the importance of the information against client interests, evenlimited to criminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into theprivilege's application and therefore must be rejected. The argumentthat the existence of, e. g., the crime-fraud and testamentary exceptionsto the privilege makes the impact of one more exception marginal failsbecause there is little empirical evidence to support it, and because theestablished exceptions, unlike the proposed exception, are consistentwith the privilege's purposes. Indications in United States v. Nixon,418 U. S. 683, 710, and Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, that privilegesmust be strictly construed as inconsistent with truth seeking are inapposite here, since those cases dealt with the creation of privileges notrecognized by the common law, whereas here, the Independent Counselseeks to narrow a well-established privilege.

One of the first entries in the notes isthe word "Privileged." Nine days later, Foster committedsuicide.In December 1995, a federal grand jury, at the request ofthe Independent Counsel, issued subpoenas to petitionersHamilton and Swidler & Berlin for, inter alia, Hamilton'shandwritten notes of his meeting with Foster. Petitionersfiled a motion to quash, arguing that the notes were protectedby the attorney-client privilege and by the work-productprivilege. The District Court, after examining the notesin camera, concluded they were protected from disclosureby both doctrines and denied enforcement of the subpoenas.The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitreversed. In re Sealed Case, 124 F. 3d 230 (1997). Whilerecognizing that most courts assume the privilege survivesdeath, the Court of Appeals noted that holdings actuallymanifesting the posthumous force of the privilege are rare.Instead, most judicial references to the privilege's posthumous application occur in the context of a well-recognizedexception allowing disclosure for disputes among the client'sheirs. Id., at 231-232. It further noted that most commentators support some measure of posthumous curtailment ofthe privilege. Id., at 232. The Court of Appeals thoughtthat the risk of posthumous revelation, when confined to thecriminal context, would have little to no chilling effect onclient communication, but that the costs of protecting communications after death were high. It therefore concludedthat the privilege was not absolute in such circumstances,and that instead, a balancing test should apply. Id., at 233-234. It thus held that there is a posthumous exception tothe privilege for communications whose relative importanceto particular criminal litigation is substantial. Id., at 235.While acknowledging that uncertain privileges are disfavored, Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.

The Court of Ap-peals also held that the notes were not protected by thework-product privilege.The dissenting judge would have affirmed the DistrictCourt's judgment that the attorney-client privilege pro-tected the notes.Id., at 237. He concluded that thecommon-law rule was that the privilege survived death. Hefound no persuasive reason to depart from this accepted rule,particularly given the importance of the privilege to full andfrank client communication. Id., at 237.Petitioners sought review in this Court on both theattorney-client privilege and the work-product privilege.1We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1045 (1998), and we nowreverse.The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications. UpjohnCo. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981); Hunt v. Black-burn, 128 U. S. 464, 470 (1888). The privilege is intended toencourage "full and frank communication between attorneysand their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of jus-tice." Upjohn, supra, at 389. The issue presented here isthe scope of that privilege; more particularly, the extent towhich the privilege survives the death of the client. Ourinterpretation of the privilege's scope is guided by "the prin-ciples of the common law . . . as interpreted by the courts. . . in the light of reason and experience." Fed. Rule Evid.501;Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371 (1933).The Independent Counsel argues that the attorney-clientprivilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential com-munications where the client has died and the information isrelevant to a criminal proceeding. There is some authorityfor this position. One state appellate court,Cohen v.Jenkintown Cab Co., 238 Pa. Super. 456, 357 A. 2d 689 (1976),1 Because we sustain the claim of attorney-client privilege, we do notreach the claim of work-product privilege.524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN404 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtand the Court of Appeals below have held the privilege maybe subject to posthumous exceptions in certain circumstances. In Cohen, a civil case, the court recognized thatthe privilege generally survives death, but concluded that itcould make an exception where the interest of justice wascompelling and the interest of the client in preserving theconfidence was insignificant.Id., at 462-464, 357 A. 2d, at692-693.But other than these two decisions, cases addressing theexistence of the privilege after death--most involving thetestamentary exception--uniformly presume the privilegesurvives, even if they do not so hold. See, e. g., Mayberryv. Indiana, 670 N. E. 2d 1262 (Ind. 1996); Morris v. Cain, 39La. Ann. 712, 1 So. 797 (1887); People v. Modzelewski, 611N. Y. S. 2d 22, 203 A. 2d 594 (App. Div. 1994). Several StateSupreme Court decisions expressly hold that the attorneyclient privilege extends beyond the death of the client, evenin the criminal context. See In re John Doe Grand JuryInvestigation, 408 Mass. 480, 481-483, 562 N. E. 2d 69, 70(1990); State v. Doster, 276 S. C. 647, 650-651, 284 S. E. 2d218, 219 (1981); State v. Macumber, 112 Ariz. 569, 571, 544P. 2d 1084, 1086 (1976). In John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, for example, the Massachusetts Supreme JudicialCourt concluded that survival of the privilege was "the clearimplication" of its early pronouncements that communications subject to the privilege could not be disclosed at anytime. 408 Mass., at 483, 562 N. E. 2d, at 70. The court further noted that survival of the privilege was "necessarilyimplied" by cases allowing waiver of the privilege in testamentary disputes. Ibid.Such testamentary exception cases consistently presumethe privilege survives. See, e. g., United States v. Osborn,561 F. 2d 1334, 1340 (CA9 1977); DeLoach v. Myers, 215 Ga.255, 259-260, 109 S.

They view testa524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 524 U. S. 399 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmentary disclosure of communications as an exception to theprivilege: "[T]he general rule with respect to confidentialcommunications . . . is that such communications are privi-leged during the testator's lifetime and, also, after the testator's death unless sought to be disclosed in litigation betweenthe testator's heirs."Osborn, 561 F. 2d, at 1340. The ra-tionale for such disclosure is that it furthers the client's intent. Id., at 1340, n. 11.2Indeed, in Glover v. Patten, 165 U. S. 394, 406-408 (1897),this Court, in recognizing the testamentary exception,expressly assumed that the privilege continues after theindividual's death. The Court explained that testamentarydisclosure was permissible because the privilege, whichnormally protects the client's interests, could be impliedlywaived in order to fulfill the client's testamentary intent.Id., at 407-408 (quoting Blackburn v. Crawfords, 3 Wall. 175(1866), andRussell v. Jackson, supra).The great body of this case law supports, either by holdingor considered dicta, the position that the privilege does sur-vive in a case such as the present one. Given the languageof Rule 501, at the very least the burden is on the Independ2 About half the States have codified the testamentary exception by providing that a personal representative of the deceased can waive the privilege when heirs or devisees claim through the deceased client (as opposedto parties claiming against the estate, for whom the privilege is notwaived). See, e. g., Ala. Rule Evid. 502 (1996); Ark. Code Ann. $ 16-41-101, Rule 502 (Supp. 1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 27-503, Rule 503 (1995).These statutes do not address expressly the continuation of the privilegeoutside the context of testamentary disputes, although many allow theattorney to assert the privilege on behalf of the client apparently withouttemporal limit. See, e. g., Ark. Code Ann. $ 16-41-101, Rule 502(c) (Supp.1997). They thus do not refute or affirm the general presumption in thecase law that the privilege survives. California's statute is exceptional inthat it apparently allows the attorney to assert the privilege only so longas a holder of the privilege (the estate's personal representative) exists,suggesting the privilege terminates when the estate is wound up. SeeCal. Code Evid. Ann. $$ 954, 957 (West 1995). But no other State hasfollowed California's lead in this regard.524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtent Counsel to show that "reason and experience" require adeparture from this rule.The Independent Counsel contends that the testamentaryexception supports the posthumous termination of the privilege because in practice most cases have refused to apply theprivilege posthumously. He further argues that the excep-tion reflects a policy judgment that the interest in settlingestates outweighs any posthumous interest in confidentiality.He then reasons by analogy that in criminal proceedings, theinterest in determining whether a crime has been committedshould trump client confidentiality, particularly since the financial interests of the estate are not at stake.But the Independent Counsel's interpretation simply doesnot square with the case law's implicit acceptance of the privilege's survival and with the treatment of testamentary disclosure as an "exception" or an implied "waiver." And thepremise of his analogy is incorrect, since cases consistentlyrecognize that the rationale for the testamentary exceptionis that it furthers the client's intent, see, e. g., Glover, supra.There is no reason to suppose as a general matter that grandjury testimony about confidential communications furthersthe client's intent.Commentators on the law also recognize that the generalrule is that the attorney-client privilege continues afterdeath. See, e. g., 8 Wigmore, Evidence $ 2323 (McNaughtonrev. 1961); Frankel, The Attorney-Client Privilege After theDeath of the Client, 6 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 45, 78-79 (1992); 1J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence $ 94, p. 348 (4th ed. 1992).Undoubtedly, as the Independent Counsel emphasizes, various commentators have criticized this rule, urging that theprivilege should be abrogated after the client's death whereextreme injustice would result, as long as disclosure wouldnot seriously undermine the privilege by deterring clientcommunication. See, e. g., C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, 2Federal Evidence $ 199, pp. 380-381 (2d ed. 1994); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers $ 127, Comment524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN407Cite as: 524 U. S. 399 (1998)Opinion of the Courtd (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Mar. 29, 1996). But eventhese critics clearly recognize that established law supportsthe continuation of the privilege and that a contrary rulewould be a modification of the common law. See,e. g., Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra, at 379; Restatement of the LawGoverning Lawyers, supra, $ 127, Comment c; 24 C. Wright& K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5498, p. 483(1986).Despite the scholarly criticism, we think there are weightyreasons that counsel in favor of posthumous application.Knowing that communications will remain confidential evenafter death encourages the client to communicate fully andfrankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and theconsequent withholding of information from counsel, may bereduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure ina criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that itvanishes altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends or family.Posthumous disclosure of such communications may be asfeared as disclosure during the client's lifetime.The Independent Counsel suggests, however, that his proposed exception would have little to no effect on the client'swillingness to confide in his attorney. He reasons that onlyclients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by arule of disclosure after death, as opposed to truthful clientsor those asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege. Thisis because for the latter group, communications disclosed bythe attorney after the client's death purportedly will revealonly information that the client himself would have revealedif alive.The Independent Counsel assumes, incorrectly we believe,that the privilege is analogous to the Fifth Amendment'sprotection against self-incrimination. But as suggestedabove, the privilege serves much broader purposes. Clientsconsult attorneys for a wide variety of reasons, only one ofwhich involves possible criminal liability. Many attorneys524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtact as counselors on personal and family matters, where, inthe course of obtaining the desired advice, confidences aboutfamily members or financial problems must be revealed inorder to assure sound legal advice. The same is true of owners of small businesses who may regularly consult their at-torneys about a variety of problems arising in the course ofthe business. These confidences may not come close to anysort of admission of criminal wrongdoing, but nonetheless bematters which the client would not wish divulged.The contention that the attorney is being required to disclose only what the client could have been required to dis-close is at odds with the basis for the privilege even duringthe client's lifetime. In related cases, we have said that theloss of evidence admittedly caused by the privilege is justified in part by the fact that without the privilege, the clientmay not have made such communications in the first place.See Jaffee, 518 U. S., at 12; Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S.391, 403 (1976). This is true of disclosure before and afterthe client's death. Without assurance of the privilege's post-humous application, the client may very well not have madedisclosures to his attorney at all, so the loss of evidence ismore apparent than real. In the case at hand, it seems quiteplausible that Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide,may not have sought legal advice from Hamilton if he hadnot been assured the conversation was privileged.The Independent Counsel additionally suggests that hisproposed exception would have minimal impact if confined tocriminal cases, or, as the Court of Appeals suggests, if it islimited to information of substantial importance to a particu-lar criminal case.3 However, there is no case authority forthe proposition that the privilege applies differently in crimi3 Petitioners, while opposing wholesale abrogation of the privilege incriminal cases, concede that exceptional circumstances implicating a criminal defendant's constitutional rights might warrant breaching the privilege. We do not, however, need to reach this issue, since such exceptionalcircumstances clearly are not presented here.524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN409Cite as: 524 U. S. 399 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnal and civil cases, and only one commentator ventures sucha suggestion, see Mueller & Kirkpatrick,supra, at 380-381.In any event, a client may not know at the time he disclosesinformation to his attorney whether it will later be relevantto a civil or a criminal matter, let alone whether it will be ofsubstantial importance. Balancing ex post the importanceof the information against client interests, even limited tocriminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into theprivilege's application. For just that reason, we have rejected use of a balancing test in defining the contours of theprivilege. SeeUpjohn, 449 U. S., at 393; Jaffee, supra, at17-18.In a similar vein, the Independent Counsel argues thatexisting exceptions to the privilege, such as the crime-fraudexception and the testamentary exception, make the impactof one more exception marginal. However, these exceptionsdo not demonstrate that the impact of a posthumous exception would be insignificant, and there is little empirical evidence on this point.4 The established exceptions are con4 Empirical evidence on the privilege is limited. Three studies do notreach firm conclusions on whether limiting the privilege would discouragefull and frank communication. Alexander, The Corporate Attorney ClientPrivilege: A Study of the Participants, 63 St. John's L. Rev. 191 (1989);Zacharias, Rethinking Confidentiality, 74 Iowa L. Rev. 352 (1989); Comment, Functional Overlap Between the Lawyer and Other Professionals:Its Implications for the Privileged Communications Doctrine, 71 Yale L. J.1226 (1962). These articles note that clients are often uninformed or mistaken about the privilege, but suggest that a substantial number of clientsand attorneys think the privilege encourages candor. Two of the articlesconclude that a substantial number of clients and attorneys think the privilege enhances open communication, Alexander, supra, at 244-246, 261, andthat the absence of a privilege would be detrimental to such communication, Comment, 71 Yale L. J., supra, at 1236. The third article suggestsinstead that while the privilege is perceived as important to open communication, limited exceptions to the privilege might not discouragesuch communication, Zacharias, supra, at 382, 386. Similarly, relativelyfew court decisions discuss the impact of the privilege's application afterdeath. This may reflect the general assumption that the privilege sur524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN410 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsistent with the purposes of the privilege, see Glover, 165U. S., at 407-408; United States v. Zolin, 491 U. S. 554, 562-563 (1989), while a posthumous exception in criminal casesappears at odds with the goals of encouraging full and frankcommunication and of protecting the client's interests. A"no harm in one more exception" rationale could contributeto the general erosion of the privilege, without reference tocommon-law principles or "reason and experience."Finally, the Independent Counsel, relying on cases such asUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 710 (1974), and Branz-burg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665 (1972), urges that privileges bestrictly construed because they are inconsistent with theparamount judicial goal of truth seeking. But bothNixonand Branzburg dealt with the creation of privileges not recognized by the common law, whereas here we deal with oneof the oldest recognized privileges in the law. And we areasked, not simply to "construe" the privilege, but to narrowit, contrary to the weight of the existing body of case law.It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for wellover a century, that the attorney-client privilege survivesthe death of the client in a case such as this. While thearguments against the survival of the privilege are by nomeans frivolous, they are based in large part on specula-tion--thoughtful speculation, but speculation nonetheless--as to whether posthumous termination of the privilege woulddiminish a client's willingness to confide in an attorney. Inan area where empirical information would be useful, it isscant and inconclusive.Rule 501's direction to look to "the principles of the com-mon law as they may be interpreted by the courts of theUnited States in the light of reason and experience" does notmandate that a rule, once established, should endure for alltime. Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371, 381 (1933). Butvives--if attorneys were required as a matter of practice to testify orprovide notes in criminal proceedings, cases discussing that practice wouldsurely exist.524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 524 U.
