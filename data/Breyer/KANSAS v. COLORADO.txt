We again consider a long-running water dispute betweenColorado and Kansas. The water is that of the ArkansasRiver, once proudly called the "Nile of America." The riveroriginates high in the Rocky Mountains. It runs eastwardthrough Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, beforejoining the Mississippi near the town of Arkansas Post. Fordecades, Kansas and Colorado disagreed about the divisionof its upper waters. See Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46(1907); Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S. 383 (1943). In 1949,they entered into an interstate compact. See ArkansasRiver Compact (Compact), 63 Stat. 145 (agreeing to "[e]qui-tably divide and apportion" the waters (internal quotationmarks omitted)). But the disagreements have persisted.Present proceedings began in 1985, when Kansas chargedthat Colorado had violated the Compact. Kansas pointedout that Compact Art. IV-D says:"This Compact is not intended to impede or prevent fu-ture beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN91Cite as: 543 U.

IV-D. 2 First Report of Special Master336 (hereinafter Report). We accepted the Special Master'srecommendations and remanded the case for remedies.Kansas v. Colorado, 514 U. S. 673, 694 (1995) (Kansas I).The Special Master set forth proposed remedies in his Second and Third Reports. He said that Colorado had overdepleted more than 400,000 acre-feet of usable river flowfrom 1950 through 1994. Second Report 112. He recommended that Colorado pay Kansas monetary damages tomake up for the depletions. Third Report 119. He dividedlosses into six categories, calculating damages somewhat differently in each category. See id., at 120. And he recommended that Kansas be awarded prejudgment interest ondamages reflecting losses incurred from 1969 through 1994.Id., at 107. We subsequently adopted the Special Master'srecommendations with one exception; we held prejudgmentinterest would run from 1985 (not 1969). Kansas v. Colo543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtrado, 533 U. S. 1, 15-16 (2001) (Kansas III). See infra, at95-97. And we remanded the case. 533 U. S., at 20.The Master has now filed a Fourth Report setting forthhis resolution of certain remaining issues. Kansas takes exception to several of the Fourth Report's recommendations.We overrule Kansas' exceptions and adopt all of the SpecialMaster's recommendations. IKansas asked the Special Master to recommend that weappoint a River Master with authority to decide (within clearerror limits) various technical disputes related to decree en-forcement. SeeTexas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 134(1987) (appointing a River Master to "make the calculationsprovided for in [a] decree" concerning the Pecos River).The Special Master rejected Kansas' request, recommendinginstead that "the Court retain continuing jurisdiction in thiscase for a limited period of time" to permit the Special Master himself to resolve any lingering issues (subject, of course,to this Court's review). Fourth Report 135. Kansas hererenews its request for appointment of a River Master.We recognize that this Court has previously appointed aRiver Master to help resolve water-related disputes amongStates. Texas v. New Mexico, supra, at 134-135; New Jersey v. New York, 347 U. S. 995, 1002-1004 (1954). But it hasdone so only twice before, each time on recommendation ofthe Special Master, always as a discretionary matter, andonly because it was convinced that such an appointmentwould significantly aid resolution of further disputes. SeeVermont v. New York, 417 U. S. 270, 275 (1974) (per curiam)("[I]t is a rare case" where we will install a River Master).We are not convinced that such an appointment is appro-priate here.For one thing, further disputes in this case, while techni-cal, may well require discretionary, policy-oriented decisionmaking directly and importantly related to the underlyinglegal issues. In this respect, potential disputes in this case543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN93Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the Courtdiffer at least in degree from those that we have asked RiverMasters to resolve. Implementation of the Pecos River Decree, for example, involved application of a largely noncon-troversial mathematical curve. The curve correlates inflowsat various New Mexico River locations with expected out-flows so that engineers can estimate, for any given inflow,the amount of water that is required to be available forTexas' use. See Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 572-573(1983); see alsoTexas v. New Mexico, 446 U. S. 540 (1980)(per curiam). Lingering disputes between Texas and NewMexico, we thought, would involve not the curve's shape butwhether officials had properly measured the flows. 482U. S., at 134-135. Although these disputes might call for a"degree of judgment," they would often prove capable of mechanical resolution and would usually involve marginal calculation adjustments. Id., at 134; see id., at 135-136; FourthReport 128 (The Pecos River Master "does not adjudicatethe kinds of disputes" potentially at issue here).Administration of the decree in this case, by contrast, willinvolve not a simple curve but a highly complex computermodel, the Hydrologic-Institutional Model (H-I Model orModel). The H-I Model seeks to determine just what theprecise water flows into Kansas would have been had Colorado not allowed increased consumption of ground waterafter 1949. See 2 First Report 231. Modeling disputes--and there have been many--involve not just measurementinputs, but basic assumptions underlying the Model. See,e. g., Kansas I, supra, at 685-687; 2 First Report 237-240;Fourth Report 123-124. Their resolution may well call forhighly judgmental decisionmaking about matters that (compared to the Pecos) are more importantly related to the parties' basic legal claims. See id., at 128.Moreover, the need for a River Master is diminished bythe fact that the parties may find it possible to resolve futuretechnical disputes through arbitration. The interstate compact itself creates an Arkansas River Compact Administra543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 KANSAS v.

TheAdministration consists of three representatives from eachState and a representative of the United States acting aschair. Art. VIII-C. Each State has one vote; the UnitedStates has no vote. Art. VIII-D. In case of an equally divided vote, the Administration (with the consent of bothStates) may refer a matter for resolution to the "Representa-tive of the United States or other arbitrator or arbitrators."Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The arbitrator'sdeterminations are binding.Ibid.At oral argument, counsel for Kansas suggested a willingness to use arbitration, noting that "in the one case [he was]aware of, Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by Colorado." Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Colorado's counsel responded that Colorado had proposed "that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate inthat." Id., at 26; see also Reply Brief for Colorado OpposingExceptions 15. These comments suggest that neither partyopposes arbitration, and indeed that Colorado would acceptit. Nor have the parties expressed any opposition to the useof other less formal means to resolve disputes, such as jointconsultation with experts, negotiation, and informal mediation. See, e. g., Kansas v. Nebraska, 538 U. S. 720 (2003)(Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska resolved Republican Riverdispute by settlement and stipulation); Fourth Report 134(discussing ongoing "joint efforts" and "cooperation" amongthe States to resolve lingering disputes over the waters ofthe Republican River).The Special Master recommended both binding arbitrationand these other less formal methods as alternatives, whileopposing appointment of a River Master and observing thatsuch an appointment would "simply" make it "easier to continue this litigation." Id., at 136.For all of these reasons, we deny Kansas' River Masterrequest.543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN95Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIIKansas takes excepti on to the Special Master 's pre-judgment interest calculation. The calculation and the objection grow out of the special history of this litigation.After we initially remanded this case for remedial determinations, see Kansas I, 514 U. S. 673, the Special Masterfound that Colorado's unlawful water depletion had harmedKansas beginning in 1950 and that Colorado must pay mone-tary damages reflecting that harm. Kansas asked the Special Master to award prejudgment interest on those damagesincurred through 1994. Colorado replied that the Compact--like the common law--did not foresee interest pay-ments in respect to unliquidated claims, particularly where,as here, damages were highly speculative. And even withthe best of good will, said Colorado, it still could not haveknown prior to the filing of the complaint (in 1985) how muchit owed Kansas. See Third Report 92-94; Kansas III, 533U. S., at 11-13; Brief for Defendant in Kansas III, O. T. 2000,No. 105, Orig., pp. 28-32.The Special Master resolved the argument by deciding tocalculate prejudgment interest on the basis of what he called" `considerations of fairness.' " Third Report 97 (quotingBoard of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308 U. S.343, 352 (1939)). In a kind of Solomonic compromise, he di-vided the prejudgment period into three temporal subcategories: (1) an Early Period, the period from 1950, when Colo-rado's unlawful water depletion began, through 1968, whenColorado should first have known about it; (2) a Middle Pe-riod, the period from 1969 through 1984; and (3) a Late Period, the period from 1985, when Kansas filed its complaint,through 1994, the last year for which evidence was availableat the time of the trial on damages. He adjusted damagesfromall three periods (Early, Middle, and Late) for inflation.But he awarded additional prejudgment interest, reflectingKansas' loss of use of the money, "only from 1969 to the dateof judgment." Third Report 107. Both Kansas and Colo543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN96 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtrado interpreted his order as awarding interest only on Mid-dle and Late Damages (1969-1994), not on Early Damages(1950-1968). Kansas III, Exception and Brief for PlaintiffKansas 9; App. to Fourth Report 12-13. The resulting totaldamages award, including prejudgment interest, came to $38million. Ibid.On appeal to this Court, Colorado attacked the award ofany prejudgment interest, while Kansas called for full pre-judgment interest. We accepted the Special Master's equitable approach. We were unable to conclude that Coloradoshould have known that prejudgment interest would "automatically" be imposed "in order to achieve full compen-sation." 533 U. S., at 14. But, we added, Colorado didbelieve (or should have believed) that we would assess " `con-siderations of fairness' " in order to achieve a just and equitable remedy. Ibid. Hence "the Special Master acted prop-erly . . . in only awarding as much prejudgment interest aswas required by a balancing of the equities." Ibid.The Special Master, we found, properly refused to "awardprejudgment interest for any years before either party wasaware of the excessive pumping in Colorado."Id., at 15.We then applied our own "considerations of fairness" andconcluded that "prejudgment interest should begin to ac-crue," not as of 1969 (the Special Master's date), but asof 1985. Id., at 14-15. We wrote in an accompanyingfootnote:"Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and JusticeThomas would not allow any prejudgment interest. . . .Justice Kennedy and The Chief Justice are of theopinion that prejudgment interest should run from thedate of the filing of the complaint [1985]. Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and [Justice Stevens] . . . agree with the Special Master's viewthat interest should run from the time when Coloradoknew or should have known that it was violating theCompact [1969]. In order to produce a majority for a543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN97Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the Courtjudgment, the four Justices who agree with the SpecialMaster have voted to endorse the position expressed inthe text." Id., at 15, n. 5.On remand, the Special Master, seeking to remain faithfulto our determination, calculated prejudgment interest from1985 onward, and calculated that interest on (post-1984) LateDamages alone,i. e., completely exempting both Early Dam-ages and Middle Damages from prejudgment interest. Kansas now objects to this last-mentioned limitation; it chal-lenges the sum upon which post-1984 interest runs. Kansassays the Special Master should have calculated prejudgmentinterest (from 1985)on all damages, i. e., on Early Damages,Middle Damages, and Late Damages alike. After all, saysKansas, "[p]rejudgment interest serves to compensate forthe loss of use of money due as damages . . . thereby achieving full compensation for the injury those damages are in-tended to redress," West Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S.305, 310-311, n. 2 (1987) (citing Comment, Prejudgment In-terest: Survey and Suggestion, 77 Nw. U. L. Rev. 192 (1982)).See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff 29. Kansas lost the"use of " all the "money due as damages," i. e., Early andMiddle Damages as well (which were "due" at least by 1985).Why then, asks Kansas, calculate post-1984 interest on onlysome of the damages then due?Kansas' argument would make good sense in an ordinarycase. But the question here is not about the ordinarycase, but rather what theKansas III paragraph we quotedabove means in context. And the Kansas III context is aspecial one.For one thing, like the Special Master, we did not seek toprovide compensation for all lost investment opportunities;rather, we sought to weigh the equities. For another, it wasapparent that the Special Master's earlier determination in-volved both a decision about when to begin to calculate interest (1969) and what to calculate that interest upon (MiddleDamages and Late Damagesonly). Brief for Plaintiff in543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN98 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtKansas v. Colorado, O. T. 2000, No. 105, Orig., pp. 9, 25, n. 8.All damages incurred before his selected date were totallyexempt from interest. Kansas contested the when by arguing that we should award interest for the entire period.Kansas also contested the what by arguing that, even accepting the Special Master's preferred date, interest should runon Early Damages as well as Middle and Late Damages.See id., at 25, n. 8 ("Even if a defendant's good-faith ignorance of its breach were a valid reason to deny prejudgmentinterest, it would not justify the Special Master's recommendation to deny Kansas compensation for its loss of use ofmoney [reflecting Early Damages] after 1968").In overruling Kansas' exception and sustaining Colorado'sexception, we said nothing about the Special Master's totalexemption of Early Damages. 533 U. S., at 14. Thus, wechanged the when (from 1969 to 1985) in Kansas III, but(despite Kansas' argument) we did not change the methodology for calculating the what. In context, our silence fairlyimplies acceptance, not rejection, of the Special Master'sunderlying methodology. Moving the date forward thusmeant moving the exemption period forward as well. Andthat methodology now yields a post-1985 interest calculationbased upon Late Damages only.This view of our prior opinion is reinforced by the resulting numbers. The Special Master's original 1969 date (andmethodology) produced a total damages award to Kansas,including prejudgment interest, of about $38 million (in 1998dollars). Were we to accept Kansas' argument (and calculate post-1984 interest on all damages), the final damagesaward would be roughly $53 million (in 2002 dollars). App.to Fourth Report 12. We cannot reconcile that numericalresult with our acceptance in Kansas III of the Special Master's equitable approach and with our own equitable determination. That determination implied a modest adjustment ofthe $38 million award in Colorado's favor, not, as Kansas now543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN99Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the Courtseeks, an adjustment of the award in its own favor. App. toFourth Report 12.Consequently, we overrule Kansas' objection.IIIKansas and Colorado have agreed to use a computermodel, the H-I Model, to measure Colorado's future Compactcompliance. This highly complex set of computer programsdetermines whether Colorado's post-1949 wells deplete theriver of usable water that the Compact makes available forKansas. It does so by trying to account for almost everyArkansas-River-connected drop of water that arrives in,stays in, or leaves Colorado, whether by way of rain, snow,high mountain streams, well pumping of underground water,evaporation, canal seepage, transmountain imports, reservoir storage, or otherwise. 2 First Report 233-235. Withall "switches" turned on, the Model predicts how much riverwater will leave Colorado for Kansas during a given month.Id., at 234-235. To obtain a figure representing an unlawfuldepletion (or lawful accretion) under the Compact, the Modelsubtracts from this figure (the actual flow) a number representing a hypothetical prediction of how much water wouldhave flowed into Kansas had Colorado not dug and operatedpost-1949 wells. The Model obtains this prediction througha computer rerun with the Model's "post-1949 well" switchturned off. Ibid. The final figure is then adjusted to reflectdepletions to usable, as opposed to total, flow. App. to Second Report 37.Not surprisingly, the Model's ability to calculate depletionshas proved highly controversial, leading to many Model mod-ifications during this litigation. See,e. g., 2 First Report236-240 (describing Colorado's objections to the originalModel). The Special Master has recommended use of theModel together with a 10-year measurement period to determine the amounts of any future depletions. Fourth Report139. That is to say, a determination of whether Colorado543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN100 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtowes Kansas water in Year 11 will be made by taking theModel's total result for Years 1-10, for year 12 by the Model'stotal result for Years 2-11, and so forth. Id., at 117; App.to Fourth Report 86, Exh. 14. Kansas takes exception tothe 10-year measurement period.Kansas seeks a measurement period of one year. In support, Kansas points to Compact Art. V-E(5), 63 Stat. 148,which says that there "shall be no allowance or accumulationof credits or debits for or against either State." (Internalquotation marks omitted.) Kansas argues that a 10-year period averages out oversupply and undersupply during theinterim years, with the likely effect of awarding Colorado a"credit" in dry years for oversupply in wet years. Kansasadds that Art. IV-D, 63 Stat. 147, forbids Colorado to depletethe river water's "availability for use." (Internal quotationmarks omitted.) Kansas says that the 10-year measurementperiod in effect frees Colorado from the obligation to compensate Kansas for years (within the 10-year period) whenoverpumping may have made water "unavailable" for Kansas' use. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Kansas alsonotes that the parties and the Special Master have used a1-year measuring period in this litigation for purposes of calculating past damages. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff 37-40, 43-44.Like the Special Master, we are not persuaded by Kansas'arguments. The literal words of the Compact are not determinative. The Compact's language essentially forbids offsetting debits with "credits," but it does not define thelength of time over which a "credit" is measured. Any period of measurement inevitably averages interim periodflows just as it overlooks interim period lack of water "availability." Thus annual measurement offsets and overlooksseasonal differences; seasonal measurement, monthly differences; monthly measurement, weekly differences, and soforth.543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN101Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the CourtAt the same time, practical considerations favor the Special Master's measurement approach. Model results overmeasurement periods of less than 10 years are highly inaccurate. The Special Master found, for example, that the current iteration of the Model, if used to project river diversions(including well pumping) during a single year, produces figures that overpredict actual diversions in some years andunderpredict them in others by as much as 22%. FourthReport 111. Similar inaccuracies plague the Model's projection of actual river flows. Id., at 112. If projected diversions and flows deviate substantially in this way from actualmeasured diversions and flows, 1-year estimates of finaldepletions to usable flow--the figure that determines Kansas' damages--cannot be accurate. Id., at 115 ("I find thatthe H-I model is not sufficiently accurate on a short-termbasis to be used to determine compact compliance on amonthly or annual basis"). But measured over long periodsof time, say, the full 540 months between 1950 and 1994, theModel's predicted and observed diversions "matched almostperfectly." Id., at 114. For this reason, the Master concluded that "[o]nly by using longer term averages do themodel simulations more closely match historic data." Id.,at 115. Thus, the 10-year measurement period is needed toensure Model accuracy.Nor is Kansas likely to suffer serious harm through use ofa 10-year measuring period. That is because Colorado hasdeveloped a water replacement program designed to minimize depletions. See Amended Rules and Regulations Governing the Diversion and Use of Tributary Ground Water inthe Arkansas River Basin (Use Rules), App. to Fourth Report 36, Exh. 6; Fourth Report 8-13. The program protectsboth Kansas water users and senior Colorado users by insisting that Colorado users with junior rights (and in particularthose who obtain water from post-1949 wells) replace theriver water that they use. They must either (1) buy replace543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN102 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtment water, say, from the Rockies' western slope or (2) buyland irrigated under pre-1949 water rights and remove itfrom cultivation. Id., at 10-13. In practice, junior usersbelong to one of three associations that conduct these transactions, reporting the details monthly to the Colorado StateEngineer 's Office, and receiving replacement "credits, "which they divide among their members. Id., at 13.Were the replacement program and the H-I Model bothto work perfectly, the Model's net depletion figure, whetherdetermined each month, each year, or each decade, would bezero (that is, there would be no difference between actualflow and what the flow would have been under precompactconditions). Of course, perfection is impossible; and Kansasclaims certain defects in the Use Rules. See id., at 27. Butoperation of the Rules should help to diminish the realamount of any depletion, thereby limiting any negative effectthat a 10-year measurement period might have upon Kansas.See id., at 119-120; see also id., at 32. The 1997-1999 results, showing essentially no aggregate depletion, suggestthe water replacement program will have this effect. Ibid.Kansas argues that the Compact's framers expected annual measurement. And they quote a Colorado Commissioner as recognizing that there would be " `no carry-overfrom year to year,' " see Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff39 (quoting Joint Exhibit 3, pp. 14-84). Assuming, arguendo, that the framers opposed such carryover, they werelikely unaware of the modern difficulties of complex computer modeling. And we believe that those framers, in anyevent, would have preferred accurate measurement. Afterall, a "credit" for surplus water that rests upon inaccuratemeasurement is not really a credit at all.Kansas also points out that earlier in this litigation bothparties agreed to the use of annual measurement for purposes of calculating past damages. The parties made thatstipulation, however, before the Special Master fully exam543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN103Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the Courtined the Model's accuracy. In any event, their previousagreements do not govern this determination.We overrule Kansas' exception.IVAs we just mentioned, measuring the depletion caused byColorado's post-1949 wells involves taking account of Colorado's water replacement program, which credits Coloradowith non-Arkansas water pumped into the Arkansas andwith Arkansas water not used because farmers have re-moved from cultivation lands previously irrigated underpre-1949 water rights. The Special Master has recom-mended that "the final amounts of Replacement Plan creditsto be applied toward Colorado's Compact obligations shall bethe amounts determined by the Colorado Water Court, andany appeals therefrom." Fourth Report 138, || 9. Kansastakes exception to this recommendation.Kansas points out that the Colorado Water Court is a statecourt. It says that a " `State cannot be its own ultimatejudge in a controversy with a sister State,' " Exceptions andBrief for Plaintiff 45-46 (quotingWest Virginia ex rel. Dyerv. Sims, 341 U. S. 22, 28 (1951)), and that this Court must" `pass upon every question essential' " to resolving the dis-pute, Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff 46 (quoting Oklahoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 241 (1991), in turn quot-ing Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S. 163, 176-177 (1930)).Kansas believes that the Special Master's recommendationviolates these well-established principles.Kansas' objection founders, however, upon additional lan-guage in the Master's full recommendation. The recommendation adds:"This is not to say, however, that the Colorado WaterCourts are empowered to make a final determination onany matter essential to compact compliance at the State-line, or that Colorado's reliance on such Water Court actions will necessarily satisfy its compact obligations. . . .543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN104 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtAll replacement credits, no matter how determined, aresubject to the right of Kansas to seek relief under theCourt's original jurisdiction [as set forth in] SectionVIII." Fourth Report 138-139, || 9.In the cross-referenced Section VIII, the Special Mastermakes clear that Colorado's replacement plan rules affect therights, not only of Kansas water users, but also of Coloradosenior water users; that both groups of water users havesimilar litigation incentives; and that permitting the Colo-rado Water Court initially to consider challenges to creditallocations will help prevent inconsistent determinations.Id., at 93-95.In our view, the Special Master's full recommendationwill help to avoid the potential conflict he mentioned. Italso adequately preserves Kansas' rights to contest anyadverse Water Court determination. We overrule Kansas'exception. VThe Special Master found that Colorado complied with theCompact for the period 1997-1999. Kansas takes exceptionon the ground that the Special Master used a measurementperiod "greater than one year." Exceptions and Brief forPlaintiff 47. Kansas concedes that its objection rests uponits claim that the Special Master cannot use "an accountingperiod longer than one year." Ibid. Having found againstKansas on that matter,supra, at 100-103, we must overrulethis exception.VIAt the end of its brief, Kansas lists 15 disputed issues thatthe Special Master has not yet decided. It groups them intothree categories:1. "Disputed H-I Model Calibration Issues" ("[c]alibra-tion procedures, parameters and criteria," "[c]anal capacities," "altered diversion records," "statistical out-liers," "Sisson-Stubbs water right" representation);543US1 Unit: $$U6 [03-06-07 12:48:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN105Cite as: 543 U. S. 86 (2004)Opinion of the Court2. "Disputed 1997-1999 Accounting Issues" ("[d]ry-upacreage," "Sisson-Stubbs credit," "winter water bookovers" credit);3. "Disputed Future Compliance Issues" ("[d]ry-upacreage monitoring," "[d]ry-up credits" and externalsource "return flow obligations," credit beyond "precompact uses," "[s]pecial waters monitoring," winter waterrelease credit timing, "[o]ffset [a]ccount" accounting procedures, "consumptive use credit and return flow obligations"). Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff 48-49.Kansas takes exception to the Special Master's refusal tomake recommendations on these issues now. It points outthat we cannot leave unanswered important questions " `essential' " to our " `determination of a controversy' " betweenthe States. Id., at 49 (quoting Oklahoma v. New Mexico,supra, at 241). And Kansas asks us to require the SpecialMaster to decide them.As the Special Master found, however, there are good reasons not to decide these issues immediately. There is noneed to resolve most of the issues in the second category.They involve challenges to the accuracy of the figures usedto determine whether Colorado depleted the river between1997 and 1999. The Special Master concluded that Coloradowas in compliance during 1997-1999, in the process relyingupon Kansas' own figures. Fourth Report 30-31. As far aswe can tell from the briefs, these issues are mostly moot.The passage of time will produce more accurate resolutionof disputes in the first and third categories (and any of thosein the second that arise again in the future). The partieswill learn more about matters relevant to their resolution,namely, the H-I Model's strengths, weaknesses, and methodsof monitoring and measurement.
