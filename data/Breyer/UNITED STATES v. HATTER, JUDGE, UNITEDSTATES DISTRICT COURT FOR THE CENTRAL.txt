S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the CourtMedicare and Social Security taxes from a small number offederal judges who held office nearly 20 years ago--beforeCongress extended the taxes to federal employees in theearly 1980's.In our view, the Clause does not prevent Congress fromimposing a "non-discriminatory tax laid generally" uponjudges and other citizens, O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S.277, 282 (1939), but it does prohibit taxation that singles outjudges for specially unfavorable treatment. Consequently,unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Congress mayapply the Medicare tax--a nondiscriminatory tax--to then-sitting federal judges. The special retroactivity-related Social Security rules that Congress enacted in 1984, however,effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment. Hence, like the Court of Appeals, weconclude that the Clause forbids the application of the SocialSecurity tax to those judges.IAThe Medicare law before us is straightforward. In 1965,Congress created a Federal Medicare "hospital insurance"program and tied its financing to Social Security. See SocialSecurity Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 291. The Medicarelaw required most American workers (whom Social Securitycovered) to pay an additional Medicare tax. But it didnot require Federal Government employees (whom SocialSecurity did not cover) to pay that tax. See 26 U. S. C.$$ 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.).In 1982, Congress, believing that "[f]ederal workers shouldbear a more equitable share of the costs of financing the ben-efits to which many of them eventually became entitled,"S. Rep. No. 97-494, pt. 1, p. 378 (1982), extended both Medi-care eligibility and Medicare taxes to all currently employedfederal employees as well as to all newly hired federal em-ployees, Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982,532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN562 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the Court$ 278, 96 Stat. 559-563. That new law meant that (as of Jan-uary 1, 1983) all federal judges, like all other federal employees and most other citizens, would have to contribute be-tween 1.30% and 1.45% of their federal salaries to Medicare'shospital insurance system. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101(b)(4)-(6).The Social Security law before us is more complex. In1935, Congress created the Social Security program. SeeSocial Security Act, 49 Stat. 620. For nearly 50 years, thatprogram covered employees in the private sector, but itdid not cover Government employees. See 26 U. S. C.$$ 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.) (excluding federal employees);$ 3121(b)(7) (excluding state employees). In 1981, a NationalCommission on Social Security Reform, convened by thePresident and chaired by Alan Greenspan, noting the needfor "action . . . to strengthen the financial status" of SocialSecurity, recommended that Congress extend the program tocover Federal, but not state or local, Government employees.Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform 2-1, 2-7 (Jan. 1983). In particular, the Commissionrecommended that Congress require all incoming federal employees (those hired after January 1, 1984) to enter the SocialSecurity system and to pay Social Security taxes. Id., at2-7. The Commission emphasized that "present Federalemployees will not be affected by this recommendation."Id., at 2-8.In 1983, Congress enacted the Commission's recommendation into law (effective January 1, 1984) with an important exception. See Social Security Amendments of 1983,$ 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 69 (amending 26 U. S. C. $$ 3121(b)(5),(6)). As the Commission had recommended, Congress required all newly hired federal employees to participate inthe Social Security program. It also permitted, withoutrequiring, almost all (about 96%) then-currently employedfederal employees to participate.Contrary to the Commission's recommendation, however,the law added an exception. That exception seemed to re532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN563Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtstrict the freedom of choice of the remaining 4% of all cur-rent employees. This class consisted of the President, VicePresident, high-level Executive Branch employees, Membersof Congress, a few other Legislative Branch employees, andall federal judges. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 410(a)(5)(C)-(G); seealso H. R. Rep. No. 98-25, p. 39 (1983); H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 98-542, p. 13 (1983) (noting that for these current federalemployees "the rules are being changed in the middle of thegame"). The new law seemed torequire this class of currentfederal employees to enter into the Social Security program,see 42 U. S. C. $$ 410(a)(5)(C)-(G). But, as to almost all ofthese employees, the new law imposed no additional financialobligation or burden.That is because the new law then created an exception tothe exception, see Federal Employees' Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983, $$ 203(a)(2), 208, 97Stat. 1107, 1111 (codified at note following 5 U. S. C. $ 8331).The exception to the exception said that any member of thissmall class of current high-level officials (4% of all thencurrent employees) who contributed to a "covered" retirement program nonetheless could choose to modify theirparticipation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction--for retirement and Social Security--unchanged. A"covered" employee paying 7% of salary to a "covered" program could continue to pay that 7% and no more, in effectavoiding any additional financial obligation as a result of joining Social Security.The exception to the exception defined a "covered" program to include the Civil Service Retirement and DisabilitySystem--a program long available to almost all federal employees--as well as any other retirement system to which anemployee must contribute. $$ 203(a)(2)(A), (D). The definition of "covered" program, however, did not encompass thepension system for federal judges--a system that is noncontributory in respect to a judge (but contributory in respectto a spouse).532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN564 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the CourtThe upshot is that the 1983 law was specifically aimedat extending Social Security to federal employees. It leftabout 96% of those who were currently employed free tochoose not to participate in Social Security, thereby avoidingany increased financial obligation. It required the remaining 4% to participate in Social Security while freeing themof any added financial obligation (or additional payroll deduction) so long as they previously had participated in othercontributory retirement programs. But it left those whocould not participate in a contributory program without achoice. Their financial obligations (and payroll deductions)had to increase. And this last mentioned group consistedalmost exclusively of federal judges.BThis litigation began in 1989, when eight federal judges,all appointed before 1983, sued the Government for "compensation" in the United States Claims Court. They arguedthat the 1983 law, in requiring them to pay Social Securitytaxes, violated the Compensation Clause. Initially, theClaims Court ruled against the judges on jurisdictionalgrounds. 21 Cl. Ct. 786 (1990). The Court of Appeals reversed. 953 F. 2d 626 (CA Fed. 1992). On remand, eightmore judges joined the lawsuit. They contested the extension to judges of the Medicare tax as well.The Court of Federal Claims held against the judges onthe merits. 31 Fed. Cl. 436 (1994). The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995). The Government petitioned thisCourt for a writ of certiorari. Some Members of this Courtwere disqualified from hearing the matter, and we failed tofind a quorum of six Justices. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1. Consequently, the Court of Appeals' judgment was affirmed "withthe same effect as upon affirmance by an equally dividedcourt." 519 U. S. 801 (1996); see 28 U. S. C. $ 2109.532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN565Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the CourtOn remand from the Court of Appeals, the Court of Federal Claims found (a) that the 6-year statute of limitations,see 28 U. S. C. $$ 2401(a), 2501, barred some claims, includingall Medicare claims; and (b) that, in any event, a subsequentlyenacted judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation, making damages minimal. 38 Fed. Cl. 166 (1997). TheCourt of Appeals (eventually en banc) reversed both determinations. 203 F. 3d 795 (CA Fed. 2000).The Government again petitioned for certiorari. It askedthis Court to consider two questions:(1) Whether Congress violated the Compensation Clausewhen it extended the Medicare and Social Security taxesto the salaries of sitting federal judges; and(2) If so, whether any such violation ended when Congresssubsequently increased the salaries of all federal judgesby an amount greater than the new taxes.Given the specific statutory provisions at issue and thepassage of time, seven Members of this Court had (and nowhave) no financial stake in the outcome of this case. Consequently a quorum was, and is, available to consider the questions presented. And we granted the Government's petitionfor a writ of certiorari.IIAt the outset, the judges claim that the "law of the case"doctrine prevents us from now considering the first questionpresented, namely, the scope of the Compensation Clause.They note that the Government presented that same question in its petition from the Court of Appeals' earlier rulingon liability. They point out that our earlier denial of thatpetition for lack of a quorum had the "same effect as" an"affirmance by an equally divided court," 28 U. S. C. $ 2109.And they add that this Court has said that an affirmance byan equally divided Court is "conclusive and binding upon theparties as respects that controversy." United States v.Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 216 (1942).532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN566 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the CourtPink, however, concerned a case, United States v. MoscowFire Ins. Co., 309 U. S. 624 (1940), in which this Court hadheard oral argument and apparently considered the meritsprior to concluding that affirmance by an equally dividedCourt was appropriate. The law of the case doctrine pre-sumes a hearing on the merits. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan,440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). This case does not involvea previous consideration of the merits. Indeed, when thiscase previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum,we could not consider either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of certiorari.This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding otherequivalent substitute forums, convinces us that Pink's state-ment does not control the outcome here, that the "law of thecase" doctrine does not prevent our considering both issuespresented, and that we should now proceed to decide them.IIIThe Court of Appeals upheld the judges' claim of tax im-munity upon the authority ofEvans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245(1920). That case arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evanschallenged Congress' authority to include sitting federaljudges within the scope of a federal income tax law that theSixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier.See Revenue Act of 1918, $ 213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining "grossincome" to include judicial salaries). In Evans itself, theCourt held that the Compensation Clause barred applicationof the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge beforeCongress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264. A few yearslater, the Court extended Evans, making clear that its ra-tionale covered not only judges appointed before Congressenacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took placeafter the tax had become law. SeeMiles v. Graham, 268U. S. 501, 509 (1925).Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruledMiles. O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277 (1939). But,532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN567Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtas the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expresslyoverruleEvans itself. 64 F. 3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals added that, if "changes in judicial doctrine" had sig-nificantly underminedEvans' holding, this "Court itselfwould have overruled the case." Ibid. Noting that thiscase is likeEvans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O'Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appealsheld thatEvans controlled the outcome. 64 F. 3d, at 650.Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxesto these preenactment judges violated the CompensationClause.The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans tothe instant case, given that "it is this Court's prerogativealone to overrule one of its precedents." State Oil Co. v.Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijas v.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans. We now overrule Evans insofar as it holdsthat the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply agenerally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries offederal judges, whether or not they were appointed beforeenactment of the tax.The Court's opinion in Evans began by explaining why theCompensation Clause is constitutionally important, and webegin by reaffirming that explanation. As Evans pointsout, 253 U. S., at 251-252, the Compensation Clause, alongwith the Clause securing federal judges appointments "during good Behavior," U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1--the practicalequivalent of life tenure--helps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the "complete independence of thecourts of justice." The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossitered. 1961). Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of thethree" branches of Government. Id., at 465-466. It has "noinfluence over either the sword or the purse." Id., at 465.532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN568 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the CourtIt has "no direction either of the strength or of the wealthof the society."Ibid. It has "neither FORCE nor WILLbut merely judgment." Ibid.Hamilton's view, and that of many other Founders, wasinformed by firsthand experience of the harmful conse-quences brought about when a King of England "madeJudges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of theiroffices, and the amount and payment of their salaries." TheDeclaration of Independence || 11. And Hamilton knew that"a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power overhis will." The Federalist No. 79, at 472. For this reason,he observed, "[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixedprovision for their support." Ibid.; see also id., No. 48, at310 (J. Madison) ("[A]s the legislative department alone hasaccess to the pockets of the people, and has . . . fulldiscretion . . . over the pecuniary rewards of those who fillthe other departments, a dependence is thus created in thelatter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments ofthe former").Evans properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure exist, "not to benefit the judges," but "asa limitation imposed in the public interest." 253 U. S., at253. They "promote the public weal," id., at 248, in partby helping to induce "learned" men and women "to quit thelucrative pursuits" of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294, but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit necessaryif judges are "to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty," W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in theUnited States 143 (1911).Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important. A judge may have to decide "betweenthe Government and the man whom that Government isprosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN569Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtcommunity, and the poorest and most unpopular." Proceed-ings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 616 (1830). A judge's decision may affect an individ-ual's "property, his reputation, his life, his all."Ibid. Inthe "exercise of these duties," the judge must "observe theutmost fairness."Ibid. The judge must be "perfectly andcompletely independent, with nothing to influence or contro[l] him but God and his conscience." Ibid. The "great-est scourge . . . ever inflicted," Marshall thought, "was anignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary." Id., at 619.Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these constitutional principles. See, e. g., Wilson,Lectures on Law (1791), in 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J.Andrews ed. 1896) (stating that judges should be "completely independent" in "their salaries, and in their offices");McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec.11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 539 (J.Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished compensationdisposes judges to be "more easy and independent"); see also1 Kent, supra, at *294 ("[P]ermanent support" and the "tenure of their office" "is well calculated . . . to give [ judges] therequisite independence"). They are no less important todaythan in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule Evansdoes not, in our view, diminish their importance.We also agree with Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond alegislative effort directly to diminish a judge's pay, say, byordering a lower salary. 253 U. S., at 254. Otherwise alegislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law,for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect.Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans' application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before it--a nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges the same way ittreated other citizens. Evans' basic holding was that the532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN570 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the CourtCompensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clauseforbids "all diminution," including "taxation," "whether forone purpose or another." Id., at 255. The Federal Circuitrelied upon this holding. 64 F. 3d, at 650. But, in our view,it is no longer sound law.For one thing, the dissenters inEvans cast the majority'sreasoning into doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by JusticeBrandeis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers "noreason for exonerating" a judge "from the ordinary duties ofa citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a manto pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as ajudge." 253 U. S., at 265. Holmes analogized the "diminution" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a statelaw might impose upon interstate commerce. If "there wasno discrimination against such commerce the tax constitutedone of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted." Id., at 267.For another thing, this Court's subsequent law repudiatedEvans' reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after Miles extendedEvans' tax immunity to judges appointed after enactmentof the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. SeeO'Malley, 307 U. S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in sodoing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. TheCourt said that the question was whether judges are immune"from the incidences of taxation to which everyone elsewithin the defined classes . . . is subjected." 307 U. S., at282. Holding that judges are not "immun[e] from sharingwith their fellow citizens the material burden of the government," ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal professionhad criticized Evans' contrary conclusion, and that courtsoutside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U. S., at 281. And the Court concluded that "anon-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not,when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN571Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtof his salary within the prohibition of Article III." Id., at282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles "cannot survive." 307U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that "[b]ecauseMiles relied on Evans v. Gore, O'Malley must also be readto undermine the reasoning of Evans." United States v.Will, 449 U. S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980).Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandeis, and of this Court inO'Malley, is correct. There is no good reason why a judgeshould not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. Weconcede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannotdirectly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitableeffort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid.(distinguishing between measures that directly and thosethat indirectly diminish judicial compensation). And thoseprophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute ruleforbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, whereindirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood thata nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent.Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution's compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax,not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats.For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clausedoes not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a changein conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enactedor took effect. Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, thatcase, in O'Malley's words, "cannot survive." 307 U. S., at283.532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN572 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the CourtThe Government points out that the Medicare tax is justsuch a nondiscriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, northe federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, inso-far as the Court of Appeals found that application of theMedicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, wereverse its decision.IVThe Social Security tax is a different matter. Respond-ents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon thensitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it dis-criminates against judges in a manner forbidden by theClause, even as interpreted in O'Malley, not Evans. Cf.O'Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judgesare immune "from the incidences of taxation to which every-one else within the defined classes . . . is subjected" (emphasis added)). After examining the statute's details, we agreewith the judges that it does discriminate in a manner thatthe Clause forbids. Four features of the law, taken together,lead us to this conclusion.First, federal employees had remained outside the SocialSecurity system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage ofthe 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the So-cial Security Commission's recommendation to bring thoseemployees within the law. See supra, at 562. And the lawitself deals primarily with that subject. Thus, history, context, statutory purpose, and statutory language, taken to-gether, indicate that the category of "federal employees" isthe appropriate class against which we must measure theasserted discrimination.Second, the law, as applied in practice, in effect imposed anew financial obligation upon sitting judges, but it did notimpose a new financial burden upon any other group of (then)current federal employees. We have previously explainedwhy that is so. See supra, at 562-564. The law requiredall newly hired federal employees to join Social Security andpay related taxes. It gave 96% of all current employees532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN573Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Court(employed as of January 1, 1984, or earlier) total freedom toenter, or not to enter, the system as they chose. It gave theremaining 4% of all current employees the freedom to main-tain their pre-1984 payroll deductions, provided that theywere currently enrolled in a "covered" system. And it de-fined "covered" system in a way that included virtually allof that 4%, except for federal judges. See supra, at 563-564. The practical upshot is that the law permitted nearlyevery current federal employee, but not federal judges, toavoid the newly imposed financial obligation.Third, the law, by including sitting judges in the system,adversely affected most of them. Inclusion meant a requirement to pay a tax of about $2,000 per year, deducted from amonthly salary check. App. 49. At the same time, 95% ofthe then-active judges had already qualified for Social Security (due to private sector employment) before becomingjudges. See id., at 115. And participation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority. See id., at 116-119 (reviewing examples of individual judges and demonstrating that participation in Social Security primarily wouldbenefit the minority of judges who had not worked the 40quarters necessary to be fully insured). The new law imposed a substantial cost on federal judges with little or noexpectation of substantial benefit for most of them.Fourth, when measured against Compensation Clause objectives, the Government's justification for the statutory distinction (between judges, who do, and other federal employees, who do not, incur additional financial obligations) isunsound. The sole justification, according to the Government, is one of "equaliz[ing]" the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposed upon judges with theretirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposedupon other current high-level federal employees. Brief forUnited States 40. Thus the Government says that the newfinancial burden imposed upon judges was meant to make upfor the fact that the judicial retirement system is basically532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN574 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the Courta noncontributory system, while the system to which otherfederal employees belonged was a contributory system. Id.,at 39-40; Reply Brief for United States 16.This rationale, however, is the Government's and not necessarily that of Congress, which was silent on the matter.Cf. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. StateFarm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983)(expressing concern at crediting post hoc explanation ofagency action).More importantly, the judicial retirement system is noncontributory because it reflects the fact that the Constitutionitself guarantees federal judges life tenure--thereby constitutionally permitting federal judges to draw a salary for lifesimply by continuing to serve. Cf. Booth v. United States,291 U. S. 339, 352 (1934) (holding that Compensation Clauseprotects salary of judge who has retired). That fact meansthat a contributory system, in all likelihood, would not work.And, of course, as of 1982, the noncontributory pension salary benefits were themselves part of the judge's compensation. The 1983 statute consequently singles out judges foradverse treatment solely because of a feature required bythe Constitution to preserve judicial independence. At thesame time, the "equaliz[ation]" in question takes place notby offering all current federal employees (including judges)the same opportunities but by employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets a constitutionally guaranteed advantage. Hence, to accept the "justification" offered here is topermit, through similar reasoning, taxes which have the effect of weakening or eliminating those constitutional guarantees necessary to secure judicial independence, at least insofar as similar guarantees are not enjoyed by others. Thispoint would be obvious were Congress, say, to deny some ofthe benefits of a tax reduction to those with constitutionallyguaranteed life tenure to make up for the fact that otheremployees lack such tenure. Although the relationships532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN575Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courthere--among advantages and disadvantages--are less dis-tant and more complex, the principle is similar.Nor does the statute "equaliz[e]" with any precision. Onthe one hand, the then-current retirement system open to allfederal employees except judges required a typical employeeto contribute 7% to 8% of his or her annual salary. See generally 5 U. S. C. $ 8334(a)(1). In return it provided a Member of Congress, for instance, with a pension that vestedafter five years and increased in value (by 2.5% of the Member's average salary) with each year of service to a maximumof 80% of salary, and covered both employee and survivors.See 5 U. S. C. $$ 8339, 8341. On the other hand, the judges'retirement system (based on life tenure) required no contribution for a judge who retired at age 65 (and who met certainservice requirements) to receive full salary. But the rightto receive that salary did not vest until retirement. Thesystem provided nothing for a judge who left office beforeage 65. Nor did the law provide any coverage for a judge'ssurvivors. Indeed, in 1984, a judge had to contribute 4.5%of annual salary to obtain a survivor's annuity, which increased in value by 1.25% of the judge's salary per year to amaximum of 40% of salary. 28 U. S. C. $$ 376(b), (l) (1982ed.).These two systems were not equal either before or afterCongress enacted the 1983 law. Before 1983, a typical married federal employee other than a judge had to contribute7% to 8% of annual salary to receive benefits that were better in some respects (vesting period, spousal benefit) andworse in some respects (80% salary maximum) than his married judicial counterpart would receive in return for a 4.5%contribution. The 1983 law imposed an added 5.7% burdenupon the judge, in return for which the typical judge received little, or no, financial benefit. Viewed purely in financial equalization terms, and as applied to typical judges,the new requirement seems to overequalize, putting thetypical married judge at a financial disadvantage--though532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN576 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the Courtperhaps it would produce greater equality when applied toother, less typical examples.Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a lawthat is special--in its manner of singling out judges for disadvantageous treatment, in its justification as necessary to off-set advantages related to constitutionally protected featuresof the judicial office, and in the degree of permissible legislative discretion that would have to underlie any determina-tion that the legislation has "equalized" rather than gone toofar. For these reasons the law before us is very differentfrom the "non-discriminatory" tax thatO'Malley upheld.307 U. S., at 282. Were the Compensation Clause to permitCongress to enact a discriminatory law with these features,it would authorize the Legislature to diminish, or to equalizeaway, those very characteristics of the Judicial Branch thatArticle III guarantees--characteristics which, as we havesaid, see supra, at 568-569, the public needs to secure thatjudicial independence upon which its rights depend. Weconsequently conclude that the 1983 Social Security tax lawdiscriminates against the Judicial Branch, in violation of theCompensation Clause.The Government makes additional arguments in supportof reversal. But we find them unconvincing. It suggeststhat Article III protects judges only against a reduction instated salary, not against indirect measures that only reducetake-home pay. Brief for United States 28. In O'Malley,however, this Court, when upholding a "non-discriminatory"tax, strongly implied that the Compensation Clause wouldbar a discriminatory tax. 307 U. S., at 282. The commentators whose work O'Malley cited said so explicitly. See Fellman, The Diminution of Judicial Salaries, 24 Iowa L. Rev. 89,99 (1938); see also Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925);Corwin, Constitutional Law in 1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sci.Rev. 635, 642 (1920). And in Will, the Court yet morestrongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to reduce judges' salaries through taxes when532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN577Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthose taxes discriminate. 449 U. S., at 226. Indeed, theGovernment itself "assume[s] that discriminatory taxation ofjudges would contravene fundamental principles underlyingArticle III, if not the [Compensation] Clause itself." Brieffor United States 37, n. 27.The Government also argues that there is no evidence herethat Congress singled out judges for special treatment inorder to intimidate, influence, or punish them. But thisCourt has never insisted upon such evidence. To require itis to invite legislative efforts that embody, but lack evidenceof, some such intent, engendering suspicion among thebranches and consequently undermining that mutual respectthat the Constitution demands. Cf. Wilson, Lectures onLaw, in 1 Works of James Wilson, at 364 (stating that judges"should be removed from the most distant apprehension ofbeing affected, in their judicial character and capacity, byanything, except their own behavior and its consequences").Nothing in the record discloses anything other than benigncongressional motives. If the Compensation Clause is tooffer meaningful protection, however, we cannot limit thatprotection to instances in which the Legislature manifests,say, direct hostility to the Judiciary.Finally, the Government correctly points out that the lawdisfavored not only judges but also the President of theUnited States and certain Legislative Branch employees.As far as we can determine, however, all LegislativeBranch employees were free to join a covered system, andthe record provides us with no example of any current Legislative Branch employee who had failed to do so. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 16-17, 37-38. The President's pension is noncontributory. See note following 3 U. S. C. $ 102. And thePresident himself, like the judges, is protected against diminution in his "[c]ompensation." See U. S. Const., Art. II,$ 1. These facts may help establish congressional good faith.But, as we have said, we do not doubt that good faith. Andwe do not see why, otherwise, the separate and special exam532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN578 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the Courtple of that single individual, the President, should make acritical difference here.We conclude that, insofar as the 1983 statute requiredthen-sitting judges to join the Social Security system andpay Social Security taxes, that statute violates the Compen-sation Clause.VThe second question presented is whether the"constitutional violation ended when Congress increasedthe statutory salaries of federal judges by an amountgreater than the amount [of the Social Security] taxesdeducted from respondents' judicial salaries." Pet. forCert. I.The Government argues for an affirmative answer. Itpoints to a statutory salary increase that all judges receivedin 1984. It says that this increase, subsequent to the imposi-tion of Social Security taxes on judges' salaries, cured anyearlier unconstitutional diminution of salaries in a lesseramount. Otherw ise, if "Congress improperly reducedjudges' salaries from $140,000" per year "to $130,000" peryear, the judges would be able to collect the amount of theimproper reduction, here $10,000, forever--even if Congresscured the improper reduction by raising salaries $20,000, to$150,000, a year later. Reply Brief for United States 18.To avoid this consequence, the Government argues, weshould simply look to the fact of a later salary increase"whether or not one of Congress's purposes in increasingthe salaries" was "to terminate the constitutional viola-tion." Ibid.But how could we always decide whether a later salaryincrease terminates a constitutional violation without examining the purpose of that increase? Imagine a violation thataffected only a few. To accept the Government's positionwould leave those few at a permanent salary disadvantage.If, for example, Congress reduced the salaries of one group532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN579Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of the Courtof judges by 20%, a later increase of 30% applicable to alljudges would leave the first group permanently 20% behind.And a pay cut that left those judges at a permanent disad-vantage would perpetuate the very harm that the Compensation Clause seeks to prevent.The Court of Appeals consequently examined the contextin which the later pay increases took place in order to determine their relation to the earlier Compensation Clause viola-tion. It found "nothing to suggest" that the later salaryincrease at issue here sought "to make whole the losses sus-tained by the pre-1983 judges." 185 F. 3d, at 1362-1363.The Government presents no evidence to the contrary.The relevant economic circumstances surrounding the1984, and subsequent, salary increases include inflation sufficiently serious to erode the real value of judicial salariesand salary increases insufficient to maintain real salaries orreal compensation parity with many other private-sectoremployees. See Report of 1989 Commission on Executive,Legislative, and Judicial Salaries, Hearings before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 101st Cong., 1stSess., 12-13 (1989) (testimony of Lloyd Cutler regarding effect of inflation on judges' salaries since 1969). For instance,while consumer prices rose 363% between 1969 and 1999, salaries in the private sector rose 421%, and salaries for districtjudges rose 253%. See American Bar Association, FederalJudicial Pay Erosion 11 (Feb. 2001). These figures stronglysuggest that the judicial salary increases simply reflected acongressional effort to restore both to judges and to Members of Congress themselves some, but not all, of the realcompensation that inflation had eroded. Those salary increases amounted to a congressional effort to adjust judicialsalaries to reflect "fluctuations in the value of money," TheFederalist No. 79, at 473 (A. Hamilton)--the kind of adjustment that the Founders believed "may be requisite," McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11,1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution, at 539; see532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN580 UNITED STATES v. HATTEROpinion of the Courtalso Rosenn, The Constitutional Guaranty Against Diminu-tion of Judicial Compensation, 24 UCLA L. Rev. 308, 314-315 (1976).We have found nothing to the contrary. And we thereforeagree with the Court of Appeals' similar conclusion. 185F. 3d, at 1363 ("[E]verything in the record" suggests that theincrease was meant to halt "the slide in purchasing powerresulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation").The Government says that a circumstance-specific approach may prove difficult to administer. Brief for UnitedStates 43. And we concede that examining the circumstances in order to determine whether there is or is not arelation between an earlier violation and a later increase ismore complex than the Government's proposed automatic approach. But we see no reason why such relief as damages oran exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable.Finally, the Government looks to our decision in Will forsupport. In that case, federal judges challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative "freezes" that Congresshad imposed upon earlier enacted Government-wide cost-ofliving salary adjustments. The Court found a Compensation Clause violation in respect to the freeze for what wasdesignated Year One (where Congress had rescinded an earlier voted 4.8% salary increase). Will, 449 U. S., at 225-226. The Government points out that the Will Court "notedthat Congress, later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutoryincrease in judges' salaries that exceeded the salaries thatjudges would have received" without the rescission. Brieffor United States 41. And the Government adds that "itwas unquestioned in Will" that the judges could not receivedamages for the time subsequent to this later enactment.Id., at 41-42.The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, inthe circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the latersalary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was "un532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN581Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)Opinion of Scalia, J.questioned" in Will shows that it was not argued. See 449U. S., at 206, n. 3 (noting that the judges' complaint soughtrelief for Year One's diminution only up to the moment ofthe subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did notdecide the matter now before us.We conclude that later statutory salary increases did notcure the preceding unconstitutional harm.VIInsofar as the Court of Appeals found the application ofMedicare taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before1983 unconstitutional, its judgment is reversed. Insofar asthat court found the application of Social Security taxes tothe salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its judgment is affirmed. We also affirm the Courtof Appeals' determination that the 1984 salary increase received by federal judges did not cure the CompensationClause violation. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
