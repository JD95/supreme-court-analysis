The United States Criminal Code makes it"unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted inany court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for aterm exceeding one year . . . to . . . possess . . . anyfirearm." 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1) (emphasis added).The question before us focuses upon the words "convicted inany court." Does this phrase apply only to convictions entered in any domestic court or to foreign convictions as well?We hold that the phrase encompasses only domestic, not foreign, convictions. IIn 1994 petitioner, Gary Small, was convicted in a Japa-nese court of having tried to smuggle several pistols, a rifle,and ammunition into Japan. Small was sentenced to fiveyears' imprisonment. 183 F. Supp. 2d 755, 757, n. 3 (WD Pa.2002). After his release, Small returned to the UnitedStates, where he bought a gun from a Pennsylvania gundealer. Federal authorities subsequently charged Smallunder the "unlawful gun possession" statute here at issue.333 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA3 2003). Small pleaded guilty whilereserving the right to challenge his conviction on the groundthat his earlier conviction, being a foreign conviction, felloutside the scope of the illegal gun possession statute. TheFederal District Court rejected Small's argument, as did theCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 183 F. Supp. 2d, at759; 333 F. 3d, at 427, n. 2. Because the Circuits disagreeabout the matter, we granted certiorari. CompareUnitedStates v. Atkins, 872 F. 2d 94, 96 (CA4 1989) ("convicted inany court" includes foreign convictions); United States v.Winson, 793 F. 2d 754, 757-759 (CA6 1986) (same), withUnited States v. Gayle, 342 F. 3d 89, 95 (CA2 2003) ("con-victed in any court" does not include foreign convictions);United States v. Concha, 233 F. 3d 1249, 1256 (CA10 2000)(same).544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 SMALL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIIAThe question before us is whether the statutory reference"convicted in any court" includes a conviction entered in aforeign court. The word "any" considered alone cannot answer this question. In ordinary life, a speaker who says,"I'll see any film," may or may not mean to include filmsshown in another city. In law, a legislature that uses thestatutory phrase " `any person' " may or may not mean toinclude " `persons' " outside "the jurisdiction of the state."See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818)(Marshall, C. J.) ("[G]eneral words," such as the word" `any,' " must "be limited" in their application "to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them");Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132(2004) (" `any' " means "different things depending upon thesetting"); United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350,357 (1994) ("[R]espondent errs in placing dispositive weighton the broad statutory reference to `any' law enforcementofficer or agency without considering the rest of the statute"); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. NationalSea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1981) (it is doubtfulthat the phrase " `any statute' " includes the very statute inwhich the words appear); Flora v. United States, 362 U. S.145, 149 (1960) (" `[A]ny sum,' " while a "catchall" phrase,does not "define what it catches"). Thus, even though theword "any" demands a broad interpretation, see, e. g., UnitedStates v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997), we must look beyondthat word itself.In determining the scope of the statutory phrase we findhelp in the "commonsense notion that Congress generallylegislates with domestic concerns in mind. " Smi th v.United States, 507 U. S. 197, 204, n. 5 (1993). This notion hasled the Court to adopt the legal presumption that Congressordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extrater544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 544 U. S. 385 (2005)Opinion of the Courtritorial, application. See Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336U. S. 281, 285 (1949); see alsoPalmer, supra, at 631 ("Thewords `any person or persons,' are broad enough to compre-hend every human being" but are "limited to cases withinthe jurisdiction of the state"); EEOC v. Arabian AmericanOil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 249-251 (1991). That presumptionwould apply, for example, were we to consider whether thisstatute prohibits unlawful gun possession abroad as well asdomestically. And, although the presumption against extraterritorial application does not apply directly to this case, webelieve a similar assumption is appropriate when we considerthe scope of the phrase "convicted in any court" here.For one thing, the phrase describes one necessary portionof the "gun possession" activity that is prohibited as a matterof domestic law. For another, considered as a group, foreignconvictions differ from domestic convictions in importantways. Past foreign convictions for crimes punishable bymore than one year's imprisonment may include a convictionfor conduct that domestic laws would permit, for example,for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage. See, e. g., Art. 153 of the Criminal Code of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, in Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure 171 (H. Berman & J. Spindlertransls. 2d ed. 1972) (criminalizing "Private EntrepreneurialActivity"); Art. 153, id., at 172 (criminalizing "Speculation,"which is defined as "the buying up and reselling of goods orany other articles for the purpose of making a profit"); cf.,e. g., Gaceta Oficial de la Republica de Cuba, ch. II, Art. 103,p. 68 (Dec. 30, 1987) (forbidding propaganda that incitesagainst the social order, international solidarity, or the Communist state). They would include a conviction from a legalsystem that is inconsistent with an American understandingof fairness. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of State, Country Reportson Human Rights Practices for 2003, Submitted to the HouseCommittee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 702-705,544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 SMALL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court1853, 2023 (Joint Comm. Print 2004) (describing failures of"due process" and citing examples in which "the testimonyof one man equals that of two women"). And they wouldinclude a conviction for conduct that domestic law punishesfar less severely. See, e. g., Singapore Vandalism Act,ch. 108, $$ 2, 3, III Statutes of Republic of Singapore,pp. 257-258 (imprisonment for up to three years for an actof vandalism). Thus, the key statutory phrase "convicted inany court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a termexceeding one year" somewhat less reliably identifies dan-gerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are atissue.In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as askingjudges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctionswhere foreign convictions are at issue. To somehow weedout inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutorydefinition is not consistent with the statute's language; it isnot easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish;and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreigncourt (say, of economic crimes) uncertain about their legalobligations. Cf. 1 United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 4A1.2(h) (Nov. 2004) ("[S]entences resulting from foreign convictions are not counted" as a "priorsentence" for criminal history purposes).These considerations, suggesting significant differencesbetween foreign and domestic convictions, do not dictate ourultimate conclusion. Nor do they create a "clear statement"rule, imposing upon Congress a special burden of specificity.See post, at 399 (Thomas, J., dissenting). They simply convince us that we should apply an ordinary assumption aboutthe reach of domestically oriented statutes here--an assumption that helps us determine Congress' intent where Congress likely did not consider the matter and where other indicia of intent are in approximate balance. Cf. ibid. Weconsequently assume a congressional intent that the phrase544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 544 U. S. 385 (2005)Opinion of the Court"convicted in any court" applies domestically, not extraterri-torially. But, at the same time, we stand ready to revisethis assumption should statutory language, context, history,or purpose show the contrary.BWe have found no convincing indication to the contraryhere. The statute's language does not suggest any intent toreach beyond domestic convictions. Neither does it mentionforeign convictions nor is its subject matter special, say, immigration or terrorism, where one could argue that foreignconvictions would seem especially relevant. To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statute's lan-guage creates anomalies.For example, the statute creates an exception that allowsgun possession despite a prior conviction for an antitrust orbusiness regulatory crime. 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20)(A). Indoing so, the exception speaks of "Federal or State" antitrustor regulatory offenses. Ibid. If the phrase "convicted inany court" generally refers only to domestic convictions, thislanguage causes no problem. But if "convicted in any court"includes foreign convictions, the words "Federal or State"prevent the exception from applying where a foreign anti-trust or regulatory conviction is at issue. An individual convicted of, say, a Canadian antitrust offense could not lawfullypossess a gun, Combines Investigation Act, 2 R. S. C. 1985,ch. C-34, $$ 61(6), (9), but a similar individual convicted of,say, a New York antitrust offense, could lawfully possessa gun.For example, the statute specifies that predicate crimesinclude "a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence." 18U. S. C. $ 922(g)(9). Again, the language specifies that thesepredicate crimes include only crimes that are "misdemean-or[s] under Federal or State law." $ 921(a)(33)(A). If "convicted in any court" refers only to domestic convictions, thislanguage creates no problem. If the phrase also refers to544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 SMALL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtforeign convictions, the language creates an apparentlysenseless distinction between (covered) domestic relationsmisdemeanors committed within the United States and(uncovered) domestic relations misdemeanors committedabroad.For example, the statute provides an enhanced penaltywhere unlawful gun possession rests upon three predicateconvictions for a "serious drug offense." $ 924(e)(1) (2000ed., Supp. II). Again the statute defines the relevant drugcrimes through reference to specific federal crimes and withthe words "offense under State law." $$ 924(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii)(2000 ed.). If "convicted in any court" refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem. Butif the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the languagecreates an apparently senseless distinction between drugoffenses committed within the United States (potentiallyproducing enhanced punishments) and similar offenses committed abroad (not producing enhanced punishments).For example, the statute provides that offenses that arepunishable by a term of imprisonment of up to two years,and characterized under state law as misdemeanors, are notpredicate crimes. $ 921(20). This exception is presumablybased on the determination that such state crimes are notsufficiently serious or dangerous so as to preclude an individual from possessing a firearm. If "convicted in any court"refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates noproblem. But if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates another apparently senseless distinction between less serious crimes (misdemeanors punishable by more than one year's imprisonment) committedwithin the United States (not predicate crimes) and similaroffenses committed abroad (predicate crimes). These illustrative examples taken together suggest that Congress didnot consider whether the generic phrase "convicted in anycourt" applies to domestic as well as foreign convictions.544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 544 U. S. 385 (2005)Opinion of the CourtThe statute's lengthy legislative history confirms the factthat Congress did not consider whether foreign convictionsshould or should not serve as a predicate to liability underthe provision here at issue. Congress did consider a Senatebill containing language that would have restricted predicateoffenses to domestic offenses. See S. Rep. No. 1501, 90thCong., 2d Sess., 31 (1968) (defining predicate crimes in termsof "Federal" crimes "punishable by a term of imprisonmentexceeding one year" and crimes "determined by the laws ofthe State to be a felony"). And the Conference Committeeultimately rejected this version in favor of language thatspeaks of those "convicted in any court of, a crime punishableby a term of imprisonment exceeding one year," $ 928(g)(1).See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 28-29(1968). But the history does not suggest that this languagechange reflected a congressional view on the matter beforeus. Rather, the enacted version is simpler and it avoidspotential difficulties arising out of the fact that States maydefine the term "felony" differently. And as far as the legislative history is concerned, these latter virtues of the newlanguage fully explain the change. Thus, those who uselegislative history to help discern congressional intent willsee the history here as silent, hence a neutral factor, thatsimply confirms the obvious, namely, that Congress did notconsider the issue. Others will not be tempted to use orto discuss the history at all. But cf. post, at 406 (Thomas,J., dissenting).The statute's purpose does offer some support for a reading of the phrase that includes foreign convictions. As theGovernment points out, Congress sought to " `keep guns outof the hands of those who have demonstrated that they maynot be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming athreat to society.' " Brief for United States 16 (quotingDickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103, 112(1983)); see also Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55, 60-62,66 (1980); Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 824544US2 Unit: $U42 [11-04-07 13:18:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 SMALL v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissenting(1974). And, as the dissent properly notes, post, at 402-403,one convicted of a serious crime abroad may well be as dangerous as one convicted of a similar crime in the UnitedStates.The force of this argument is weakened significantly, how-ever, by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have probably been no more than "10to a dozen" instances in which such a foreign conviction hasserved as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. This empirical fact reinforces the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter.CIn sum, we have no reason to believe that Congress consid-ered the added enforcement advantages flowing from inclusion of foreign crimes, weighing them against, say, the po-tential unfairness of preventing those with inapt foreignconvictions from possessing guns. See supra, at 389. Thestatute itself and its history offer only congressional silence.Given the reasons for disfavoring an inference of extraterri-torial coverage from a statute's total silence and our initialassumption against such coverage, see supra, at 390-391, weconclude that the phrase "convicted in any court" refers onlyto domestic courts, not to foreign courts. Congress, ofcourse, remains free to change this conclusion through statutory amendment.For these reasons, the judgment of the Third Circuit isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
