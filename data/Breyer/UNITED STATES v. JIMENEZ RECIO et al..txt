We here consider the validity of a Ninth Circuit rule thata conspiracy ends automatically when the object of the conspiracy becomes impossible to achieve--when, for example,the Government frustrates a drug conspiracy's objective byseizing the drugs that its members have agreed to distribute.In our view, conspiracy law does not contain any such "automatic termination" rule. IIn United States v. Cruz, 127 F. 3d 791, 795 (CA9 1997),the Ninth Circuit, following the language of an earlier case,United States v. Castro, 972 F. 2d 1107, 1112 (CA9 1992),wrote that a conspiracy terminates when " `there is affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal or de-feat of the object of the conspiracy.' " (Emphasis added.)It considered the conviction of an individual who, the Gov-ernment had charged, joined a conspiracy (to distributedrugs) after the Government had seized the drugs in ques-tion. The Circuit found that the Government's seizure ofthe drugs guaranteed the "defeat" of the conspiracy's objec-tive, namely, drug distribution. The Circuit held that theconspiracy had terminated with that "defeat," i. e., when theGovernment seized the drugs. Hence the individual, whohad joined the conspiracy after that point, could not be con-victed as a conspiracy member.In this case the lower courts applied the Cruz rule to simi-lar facts: On November 18, 1997, police stopped a truck inNevada. They found, and seized, a large stash of illegaldrugs. With the help of the truck's two drivers, they setup a sting. The Government took the truck to the drivers'destination, a mall in Idaho. The drivers paged a contactand described the truck's location. The contact said that hewould call someone to get the truck. And three hours later,the two defendants, Francisco Jimenez Recio and AdrianLopez-Meza, appeared in a car. Jimenez Recio drove awayin the truck; Lopez-Meza drove the car away in a simi537US2 Unit: $U16 [04-14-04 20:12:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN273Cite as: 537 U. S. 270 (2003)Opinion of the Courtlar direction. Police stopped both vehicles and arrestedboth men.A federal grand jury indicted Jimenez Recio, Lopez-Meza,and the two original truck drivers, charging them with having conspired, together and with others, to possess and todistribute unlawful drugs. A jury convicted all four. Butthe trial judge then decided that the jury instructions hadbeen erroneous in respect to Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza.The judge noted that the Ninth Circuit, inCruz, had heldthat the Government could not prosecute drug conspiracydefendants unless they had joined the conspiracy before theGovernment seized the drugs. See Cruz, supra, at 795-796.That holding, as applied here, meant that the jury could notconvict Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza unless the jury believed they had joined the conspiracy before the Nevada police stopped the truck and seized the drugs. The judge ordered a new trial where the jury would be instructed to thateffect. The new jury convicted the two men once again.Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza appealed. They pointedout that, given Cruz, the jury had to find that they had joinedthe conspiracy before the Nevada stop, and they claimed thatthe evidence was insufficient at both trials to warrant anysuch jury finding. The Ninth Circuit panel, by a vote of 2to 1, agreed. All three panel members accepted Cruz asbinding law. Two members concluded that the evidencepresented at the second trial was not sufficient to show thatthe defendants had joined the conspiracy before the Nevadadrug seizure. One of the two wrote that the evidence at thefirst trial was not sufficient either, a circumstance she believed independently warranted reversal. The third member, dissenting, believed that the evidence at both trials adequately demonstrated preseizure membership. He addedthat he, like the other panel members, was bound by Cruz,but he wrote that in his view Cruz was "totally inconsistentwith long established and appropriate principles of the lawof conspiracy," and he urged the Circuit to overrule it en537US2 Unit: $U16 [04-14-04 20:12:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 UNITED STATES v. JIMENEZ RECIOOpinion of the Courtbanc "at the earliest opportunity." 258 F. 3d 1069, 1079, n. 2(2001) (opinion of Gould, J.).The Government sought certiorari. It noted that theNinth Circuit's holding in this case was premised upon thelegal rule enunciated in Cruz. And it asked us to decide therule's validity, i. e., to decide whether "a conspiracy ends as amatter of law when the government frustrates its objective."Pet. for Cert. (I). We agreed to consider that question.IIIn Cruz, the Ninth Circuit held that a conspiracy continues" `until there is affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal or defeat of the object of the conspiracy.' "127 F. 3d, at 795 (quotingCastro, supra, at 1112). The criti-cal portion of this statement is the last segment, that a conspiracy ends once there has been " `defeat of [its] object.' "The Circuit's holdings make clear that the phrase means thatthe conspiracy ends through "defeat" when the Governmentintervenes, making the conspiracy's goals impossible toachieve, even if the conspirators do not know that the Gov-ernment has intervened and are totally unaware that theconspiracy is bound to fail. In our view, this statement ofthe law is incorrect. A conspiracy does not automaticallyterminate simply because the Government, unbeknownst tosome of the conspirators, has "defeat[ed]" the conspiracy's"object."Two basic considerations convince us that this is theproper view of the law. First, the Ninth Circuit's rule isinconsistent with our own understanding of basic conspiracylaw. The Court has repeatedly said that the essence of aconspiracy is "an agreement to commit an unlawful act."Iannelli v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, 777 (1975); seeUnited States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 16 (1994); Bravermanv. United States, 317 U. S. 49, 53 (1942). That agreement is"a distinct evil," which "may exist and be punished whetheror not the substantive crime ensues."Salinas v. United537US2 Unit: $U16 [04-14-04 20:12:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 537 U. S. 270 (2003)Opinion of the CourtStates, 522 U. S. 52, 65 (1997). The conspiracy poses a"threat to the public" over and above the threat of the commission of the relevant substantive crime--both because the"[c]ombination in crime makes more likely the commission of[other] crimes" and because it "decreases the probability thatthe individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality." Callanan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 593-594(1961); see also United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78, 88(1915) (conspiracy "sometimes quite outweigh[s], in injury tothe public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime").Where police have frustrated a conspiracy's specific objective but conspirators (unaware of that fact) have neitherabandoned the conspiracy nor withdrawn, these specialconspiracy-related dangers remain. Cf. 2 W. LaFave &A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 6.5, p. 85 (1986) ("[i]mpossibility" does not terminate conspiracy because "criminalcombinations are dangerous apart from the danger of attaining the particular objective"). So too remains the essence ofthe conspiracy--the agreement to commit the crime. Thatbeing so, the Government's defeat of the conspiracy's objective will not necessarily and automatically terminate theconspiracy.Second, the view we endorse today is the view of almostall courts and commentators but for the Ninth Circuit. Noother Federal Court of Appeals has adopted the Ninth Circuit's rule. Three have explicitly rejected it. In UnitedStates v. Wallace, 85 F. 3d 1063, 1068 (CA2 1996), for example, the court said that the fact that a "conspiracy cannotactually be realized because of facts unknown to the conspirators is irrelevant." See also United States v. BelardoQuin~ ones, 71 F. 3d 941, 944 (CA1 1995) (conspiracy existseven if, unbeknownst to conspirators, crime is impossible tocommit); United States v. LaBudda, 882 F. 2d 244, 248 (CA71989) (defendants can be found guilty of conspiracy even ifconspiracy's object "is unattainable from the very beginning"). One treatise, after surveying lower court conspir537US2 Unit: $U16 [04-14-04 20:12:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 UNITED STATES v. JIMENEZ RECIOOpinion of the Courtacy decisions, has concluded that "[i]mpossibility of successis not a defense." 2 LaFave & Scott, Substantive CriminalLaw $ 6.5, at 85; see also id., $ 6.5(b), at 90-93. And theAmerican Law Institute's Model Penal Code $ 5.03, p. 384(1985), would find that a conspiracy "terminates when thecrime or crimes that are its object are committed" or whenthe relevant "agreement . . . is abandoned." It would notfind "impossibility" a basis for termination.TheCruz majority argued that the more traditional termination rule threatened "endless" potential liability. To illus-trate the point, the majority posited a sting in which policeinstructed an arrested conspirator to go through the "telephone directory . . . [and] call all of his acquaintances" tocome and help him, with the Government obtaining convictions of those who did so. 127 F. 3d, at 795, n. 3. The problem with this example, however, is that, even though it isnot necessarily an example of entrapment itself, it draws itspersuasive force from the fact that it bears certain resemblances to entrapment. The law independently forbids convictions that rest upon entrapment. See Jacobson v. UnitedStates, 503 U. S. 540, 548-549 (1992); Sorrells v. UnitedStates, 287 U. S. 435, 442-445 (1932). And the example failsto explain why a different branch of the law, conspiracylaw, should be modified to forbid entrapment-like behaviorthat falls outside the bounds of current entrapment law.Cf. United States v. Russell, 411 U. S. 423, 435 (1973) ("defense of entrapment . . . not intended to give the federaljudiciary . . . veto" over disapproved "law enforcement practices"). At the same time, the Cruz rule would reach wellbeyond arguable police misbehavior, potentially threateningthe use of properly run law enforcement sting operations.See Lewis v. United States, 385 U. S. 206, 208-209 (1966)(Government may "use decoys" and conceal agents' identity);see also M. Lyman, Criminal Investigation 484-485 (2d ed.1999) (explaining the importance of undercover operations inenforcing drug laws).537US2 Unit: $U16 [04-14-04 20:12:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 537 U. S. 270 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIn tracing the origins of the statement of conspiracy lawupon which the Cruz panel relied, we have found a 1982Ninth Circuit case, United States v. Bloch, 696 F. 2d 1213, inwhich the court, referring to an earlier case, United Statesv. Krasn, 614 F. 2d 1229 (CA9 1980), changed the languageof the traditional conspiracy termination rule. Krasn saidthat a conspiracy is " `presumed to continue unless there isaffirmative evidence thatthe defendant abandoned, with-drew from, or disavowed the conspiracy or defeated its purpose.' " Id., at 1236 (emphasis added). The Bloch panelchanged the grammatical structure. It said that "a conspiracy is presumed to continue until there is . . . defeat ofthe purposes of the conspiracy." 696 F. 2d, at 1215 (emphasis added). Later Ninth Circuit cases apparently readthe change to mean that a conspiracy terminates, not onlywhen the defendant defeats its objective, but also whensomeone else defeats that objective, perhaps the police. InCastro, the panel followed Bloch. 972 F. 2d, at 1112. InCruz, the panel quoted Castro. 127 F. 3d, at 795. This his-tory may help to explain the origin of the Cruz rule. But,since the Circuit's earlier cases nowhere give any reason forthe critical change of language, they cannot help to justify it.IIIWe conclude that the Ninth Circuit's conspiracy-termination law holding set forth in Cruz is erroneous in themanner discussed. We reverse the present judgment inso-far as it relies upon that holding. Because Jimenez Recioand Lopez-Meza have raised other arguments not here con-sidered, we remand the case, specifying that the Court ofAppeals may consider those arguments, if they were prop-erly raised.The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
