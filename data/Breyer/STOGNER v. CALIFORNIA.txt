California has brought a criminal prosecution after expira-tion of the time periods set forth in previously applicablestatutes of limitations. California has done so under the au-thority of a new law that (1) permits resurrection of otherwise time-barred criminal prosecutions, and (2) was itselfenactedafter pre-existing limitations periods had expired.We conclude that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause,Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1, bars application of this new law to thepresent case.IIn 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limi-tations governing sex-related child abuse crimes. The newstatute permits prosecution for those crimes where "[t]helimitation period specified in [prior statutes of limitations]has expired"--provided that (1) a victim has reported an al-legation of abuse to the police, (2) "there is independent evidence that clearly and convincingly corroborates the victim'sallegation," and (3) the prosecution is begun within one yearof the victim's report. 1993 Cal. Stats. ch. 390, $ 1 (codifiedas amended at Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 803(g) (West Supp.2003)). A related provision, added to the statute in 1996,makes clear that a prosecution satisfying these three conditions "shall revive any cause of action barred by [prior stat-utes of limitations]." 1996 Cal. Stats. ch. 130, $ 1 (codified atCal. Penal Code Ann. $ 803(g)(3)(A) (West Supp. 2003)). Thestatute thus authorizes prosecution for criminal acts committed many years beforehand--and where the original limi-tations period has expired--as long as prosecution beginswithin a year of a victim's first complaint to the police.In 1998, a California grand jury indicted Marion Stogner,the petitioner, charging him with sex-related child abusecommitted decades earlier--between 1955 and 1973.

CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtout the new statute allowing revival of the State's cause ofaction, California could not have prosecuted Stogner. Thestatute of limitations governing prosecutions at the time thecrimes were allegedly committed had set forth a 3-year limitations period. And that period had run 22 years or morebefore the present prosecution was brought.Stogner moved for the complaint's dismissal. He arguedthat the Federal Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I,$ 10, cl. 1, forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution. The trial court agreed that such a revival is unconstitutional. But the California Court of Appeal reversed,citing a recent, contrary decision by the California SupremeCourt, People v. Frazer, 21 Cal. 4th 737, 982 P. 2d 180 (1999),cert. denied, 529 U. S. 1108 (2000). Stogner then moved todismiss his indictment, arguing that his prosecution is unconstitutional under both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the DueProcess Clause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. The trial court denied Stogner's motion, and the Court of Appeal upheld that denial.Stogner v. Superior Court, 93 Cal. App. 4th 1229, 114 Cal.Rptr. 2d 37 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider Stogner's constitutional claims. 537 U. S. 1043 (2002).IIThe Constitution's two Ex Post Facto Clauses prohibit theFederal Government and the States from enacting laws withcertain retroactive effects. See Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3 (FederalGovernment); Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1 (States). The law at issuehere created a new criminal limitations period that extendsthe time in which prosecution is allowed. It authorizedcriminal prosecutions that the passage of time had previously barred. Moreover, it was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Dothese features of the law, taken together, produce the kindof retroactivity that the Constitution forbids? We concludethat they do.539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN611Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the CourtFirst, the new statute threatens the kinds of harm that, inthis Court's view, theEx Post Facto Clause seeks to avoid.Long ago Justice Chase pointed out that the Clause protectsliberty by preventing governments from enacting statuteswith "manifestly unjust and oppressive" retroactive effects.Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391 (1798). Judge Learned Handlater wrote that extending a limitations period after theState has assured "a man that he has become safe from itspursuit . . . seems to most of us unfair and dishonest."Falter v. United States, 23 F. 2d 420, 426 (CA2), cert. denied,277 U. S. 590 (1928). In such a case, the government hasrefused "to play by its own rules," Carmell v. Texas, 529U. S. 513, 533 (2000). It has deprived the defendant of the"fair warning," Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28 (1981),that might have led him to preserve exculpatory evidence.F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, p. 210 (8thed. 1880) ("The statute [of limitations] is . . . an amnesty,declaring that after a certain time . . . the offender shall beat liberty to return to his country . . . and . . . may cease topreserve the proofs of his innocence"). And a Constitutionthat permits such an extension, by allowing legislatures topick and choose when to act retroactively, risks both "arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation," and erosion ofthe separation of powers, Weaver, supra, at 29, and n. 10.See Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 137-138 (1810) (viewingthe Ex Post Facto Clause as a protection against "violentacts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment").Second, the kind of statute at issue falls literally withinthe categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws set forth byJustice Chase more than 200 years ago in Calder v. Bull,supra--a categorization that this Court has recognized asproviding an authoritative account of the scope of theEx Post Facto Clause. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,46 (1990); Carmell, supra, at 539. Drawing substantially onRichard Wooddeson's 18th-century commentary on the nature of ex post facto laws and past parliamentary abuses,539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN612 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtChase divided ex post facto laws into categories that he de-scribed in two alternative ways. See 529 U. S., at 522-524,and n. 9. He wrote:"I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws,within the words and the intent of the prohibition. 1st.Every law that makes an action done before the passingof the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal;and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, whencommitted. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the lawannexed to the crime, when committed.4th. Everylaw that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receivesless, or different, testimony, than the law required atthe time of the commission of the offence, in order toconvict the offender. All these, and similar laws, aremanifestly unjust and oppressive." Calder, supra, at390-391 (emphasis altered from original).In his alternative description, Chase traced these four cat-egories back to Parliament's earlier abusive acts, as follows:Category 1: "Sometimes they respected the crime, bydeclaring acts to be treason, which were not treason,when committed."Category 2: "[A]t other times they inflicted punish-ments, where the party was not, by law, liable to anypunishment."Category 3: "[I]n other cases, they inflicted greater pun-ishment, than the law annexed to the offence."Category 4: "[A]t other times, they violated the rulesof evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof) byadmitting one witness, when the existing law requiredtwo; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath ofthe wife against the husband; or other testimony, whichthe courts of justice would not admit." 3 Dall., at 389(emphasis altered from original).539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN613Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the CourtThe second category--including any "law that aggravatesa crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed,"id., at 390--describes California's statute as long as thosewords are understood as Justice Chase understood them--i. e., as referring to a statute that "inflict[s] punishments,where the party was not, bylaw, liable to any punishment,"id., at 389. See also 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical Viewof the Laws of England 638 (1792) (hereinafter Wooddeson,Systematical View) (discussing theex post facto status of alaw that affects punishment by "making therein some inno-vation,or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law" (emphasis added)).After (but not before) the original statute of limitations hadexpired, a party such as Stogner was not "liable to any punishment." California's new statute therefore "aggravated"Stogner's alleged crime, or made it "greater than it was,when committed," in the sense that, and to the extent that,it "inflicted punishment" for past criminal conduct that(when the new law was enacted) did not trigger any suchliability. See also H. Black, American Constitutional Law$ 266, p. 700 (4th ed. 1927) (hereinafter Black, American Constitutional Law) ("[A]n act condoned by the expiration of thestatute of limitations is no longer a punishable offense"). Itis consequently not surprising that New Jersey's highestcourt long ago recognized that Chase's alternative description of second category laws "exactly describes the operation" of the kind of statute at issue here. Moore v. State, 43N. J. L. 203, 217 (1881) (emphasis added). See also H. Black,Constitutional Prohibitions Against Legislation Impairingthe Obligation of Contracts, and Against Retroactive andEx Post Facto Laws $ 235, p. 298 (1887) (hereinafter Black,Constitutional Prohibitions) ("Such a statute" "certainlymakes that a punishable offense which was previously a condoned and obliterated offense").So to understand the second category (as applying wherea new law inflicts a punishment upon a person not then sub539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN614 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtject to that punishment, to any degree) explains why andhow that category differs from both the first category (making criminal noncriminal behavior) and the third category(aggravating the punishment). And this understanding isconsistent, in relevant part, with Chase's second category ex-amples--examples specifically provided to illustrate Chase'salternative description of laws " `inflict[ing] punishments,where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment,' "Calder, 3 Dall., at 389.Following Wooddeson, Chase cited as examples of suchlaws Acts of Parliament that banished certain individualsaccused of treason. Id., at 389, and n. ##; see also Carmell,529 U. S., at 522-524, and n. 11. Both Chase and Wooddesonexplicitly referred to these laws as involving "banishment."Calder, supra, at 389, and n. ##; 2 Wooddeson, SystematicalView 638-639. This fact was significant because Parliament had enacted those laws not only after the crime's commission, but under circumstances where banishment "wassimply not a form of penalty that could be imposed bythe courts." Carmell, supra, at 523, n. 11; see also 11 W.Holdsworth, A History of English Law 569 (1938). Thus,these laws, like the California law at issue here, enabled punishment where it was not otherwise available "in the ordinary course of law," 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638.As this Court previously recognized in Carmell, supra, at523, and n. 11, it was this vice that was relevant to Chase'spurpose.It is true, however, that Parliament's Acts of banishment,unlike the law in this case, involved a punishment (1) that thelegislature imposed directly, and (2) that courts had neverpreviously had the power to impose. But these differencesare not determinative. The first describes not a retroactivity problem but an attainder problem that Justice Chase'slanguage does not emphasize and with which the Constitution separately deals, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3; Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. Thesecond difference seems beside the point. The example of539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN615Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the CourtParliament's banishment laws points to concern that a legis-lature, knowing the accused and seeking to have the accusedpunished for a pre-existing crime, might enable punishmentof the accused in ways that existing law forbids. That fundamental concern, related to basic concerns about retroac-tive penal laws and erosion of the separation of powers, applies with equal force to punishment like that enabled byCalifornia's law as applied to Stogner--punishment thatcourts lacked the power to impose at the time the legislatureacted. See Black, Constitutional Prohibitions $ 235, at 298("It would be superfluous to point out that such an act [reviving otherwise time-barred criminal liability] would fallwithin the evils intended to be guarded against by the prohibition in question"). Cf. 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law $ 444a,pp. 347-348, n. b (rev. 7th ed. 1874) (hereinafter CriminalLaw).In finding that California's law falls within the literalterms of Justice Chase's second category, we do not denythat it may fall within another category as well. JusticeChase's fourth category, for example, includes any "law thatalters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender."Calder, supra, at 390. This Court has described that category as including laws that diminish "the quantum of evidence required to convict." Carmell, supra, at 532.Significantly, a statute of limitations reflects a legislativejudgment that, after a certain time, no quantum of evidenceis sufficient to convict. See United States v. Marion, 404U. S. 307, 322 (1971). And that judgment typically rests, inlarge part, upon evidentiary concerns--for example, concernthat the passage of time has eroded memories or made witnesses or other evidence unavailable. United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117 (1979); 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N.King, Criminal Procedure $ 18.5(a), p. 718 (1999); Wharton,Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, at 210. Indeed, this539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN616 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtCourt once described statutes of limitations as creating"a presumption which renders proof unnecessary."Wood v.Carpenter, 101 U. S. 135, 139 (1879).Consequently, to resurrect a prosecution after the relevantstatute of limitations has expired is to eliminate a currentlyexisting conclusive presumption forbidding prosecution, andthereby to permit conviction on a quantum of evidence wherethat quantum, at the time the new law is enacted, wouldhave been legally insufficient. And, in that sense, the newlaw would "violate" previous evidence-related legal rules byauthorizing the courts to " `receiv[e] evidence . . . which thecourts of justice would not [previously have] admit[ted]' " assufficient proof of a crime, supra, at 612. Cf. Collins, 497U. S., at 46 ("Subtle ex post facto violations are no more permissible than overt ones"); Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall.277, 329 (1867) (The Ex Post Facto Clause "cannot be evadedby the form in which the power of the State is exerted").Nonetheless, given Justice Chase's description of the secondcategory, we need not explore the fourth category, or othercategories, further.Third, likely for the reasons just stated, numerous legislators, courts, and commentators have long believed it wellsettled that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids resurrection ofa time-barred prosecution. Such sentiments appear alreadyto have been widespread when the Reconstruction Congressof 1867--the Congress that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment--rejected a bill that would have revived time-barredprosecutions for treason that various Congressmen wantedbrought against Jefferson Davis and "his coconspirators,"Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 279 (1866-1867) (commentsof Rep. Lawrence). Radical Republicans such as RoscoeConkling and Thaddeus Stevens, no friends of the South, opposed the bill because, in their minds, it proposed an "ex postfacto law," id., at 68 (comments of Rep. Conkling), andthreatened an injustice tantamount to "judicial murder," id.,at 69 (comments of Rep. Stevens). In this instance, Con539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN617Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courtgress ultimately passed a law extending unexpired limita-tions periods, ch. 236, 15 Stat. 183--a tailored approach toextending limitations periods that has also been taken inmodern statutes,e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 3293 (notes on effectivedate of 1990 amendment and effect of 1989 amendment); Cal.Penal Code Ann. $ 805.5 (West Supp. 2003).Further, Congressmen such as Conkling were not the onlyones who believed that laws reviving time-barred prosecu-tions areex post facto. That view was echoed in roughlycontemporaneous opinions by State Supreme Courts. E. g.,State v. Sneed, 25 Tex. Supp. 66, 67 (1860); Moore, 43 N. J. L.,at 216-217. Cf. State v. Keith, 63 N. C. 140, 145 (1869) (AState's repeal of an amnesty was "substantially an ex postfacto law"). Courts, with apparent unanimity until California's decision in Frazer, have continued to state such views,and, when necessary, so to hold. E. g., People ex rel. Reibman v.

Further, they have often done so by saying that extension of existing limitations periods is not ex post facto"provided," "so long as," "because," or "if " the prior limitations periods have not expired--a manner of speaking thatsuggests a presumption that revival of time-barred criminalcases is not allowed.

S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courtis subject to enlargement or repeal without being obnoxiousto the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws").Given the apparent unanimity of pre-Frazer case law, legalscholars have long had reason to believe this matter settled.As early as 1887, Henry Black reported that, although "notat all numerous," the "cases upon this point . . . unmistakablypoint to the conclusion that such an act would be ex postfacto in the strict sense, and void." Constitutional Prohibitions $ 235, at 297. Even earlier, in 1874, Francis Whartonsupported this conclusion by emphasizing the historic role ofstatutes of limitations as "acts of grace or oblivion, and notof process," "extinguish[ing] all future prosecution" and making an offense unable to "be again called into existence atthe caprice of the prince." 1 Criminal Law $ 444a, at 347-348, n. b. More modern commentators--reporting on thesame and subsequent cases--have come to the same conclusion. E. g., 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law $ 294, pp. 349-350(1998 and Supp. 2002); 16A C. J. S., Constitutional Law $ 420,p. 372 (1984 and Supp. 2002); 4 LaFave, Israel, & King, Criminal Procedure $ 18.5(a), at 718, n. 6; 2 C. Antieau & W.

Wood, Limitation of Actions $ 13, p. 43 (3d ed. 1901) (The State "may be said" to be"estopped from prosecuting"). Likewise, with respect tothe closely related case of a law repealing an amnesty--acase not distinguished by the dissent--William Wade concluded early on that "[s]uch an act would be as clearly incontravention of the inhibition of ex post facto laws as thoughit undertook to annex criminality to an act innocent whendone." Operation and Construction of Retroactive Laws539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN620 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Court$ 286, p. 339 (1880). But cf. post, at 638-639 (Kennedy, J.,dissenting).This Court itself has not previously spoken decisively onthis matter. On the one hand, it has clearly stated that theFifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination doesnot apply after the relevant limitations period has expired.Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598 (1896). And thatrule may suggest that the expiration of a statute of limita-tions is irrevocable, for otherwise the passage of time wouldnot have eliminated fear of prosecution.On the other hand, inStewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 503-504 (1871), this Court upheld a statute, enacted during theCivil War, that retroactively tolled all civil and criminal limitations for periods during which the war had made serviceof process impossible or courts inaccessible. Stewart, however, involved a civil, not a criminal, limitations statute. Id.,at 500-501. Significantly, in reviewing this civil case, theCourt upheld the statute as an exercise of Congress' warpowers, id., at 507, without explicit consideration of any potential collision with the Ex Post Facto Clause. Moreover,the Court already had held, independent of Congress' Act,that statutes of limitations were tolled for "the time duringwhich the courts in the States lately in rebellion were closedto the citizens of the loyal States . . . ." Id., at 503; see alsoHanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 539-542 (1868). Hence, theCourt could have seen the relevant statute as ratifying apre-existing expectation of tolling due to wartime exigencies,rather than as extending limitations periods that had trulyexpired. See id., at 541; see also Stewart, supra, at 507. Inour view, Stewart therefore no more dictates the outcomehere than does seemingly contrary precedent regarding theFifth Amendment privilege.Instead, we believe that the outcome of this case is determined by the nature of the harms that California's law creates, by the fact that the law falls within Justice Chase'ssecond category as Chase understood that category, and by539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courta long line of authority holding that a law of this type vio-lates the Ex Post Facto Clause.IIIIn a prodigious display of legal and historical textual re-search, the dissent finely parses cases that offer us support,see post, at 633-637; shows appreciation for 19th-century dis-sident commentary, see post, at 638-639; discusses in depthits understanding of late 17th-century and early 18th-centuryparliamentary history, post, at 642-649; and does its best todrive a linguistic wedge between Justice Chase's alternativedescriptions of categories ofex post facto laws, post, at 640-641. All to what end? The dissent undertakes this Herculean effort to prove that it is not unfair, in any constitution-ally relevant sense, to prosecute a man for crimes committed25 to 42 years earlier when nearly a generation has passedsince the law granted him an effective amnesty. Cf. post,at 649-653.We disagree strongly with the dissent's ultimate conclusion about the fairness of resurrecting a long-dead prosecu-tion. See infra, at 630-632. Rather, like Judge LearnedHand, we believe that this retroactive application of a later-enacted law is unfair. And, like most other judges who haveaddressed this issue, see supra, at 617-618, we find thewords"ex post facto" applicable to describe this kind of un-fairness. Indeed, given the close fit between laws that workthis kind of unfairness and the Constitution's concern withex post facto laws, we might well conclude that California'slaw falls within the scope of the Constitution's interdictioneven were the dissent's historical and precedent-related criticisms better founded than they are.We need not examine that possibility here, however, because the dissent's reading of the relevant history and prece-dent raises far too many problems to serve as a foundationfor the reading of "ex post facto" that it proposes. In ourview, that reading is too narrow; it is unsupported by prec539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN622 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtedent; and it would deny liberty where the Constitutiongives protection.AIn the dissent's view, Chase's historical examples showthat"Calder's second category concerns only laws" that both(1) "subjec[t] the offender to increased punishment" and(2) do so by "chang[ing] the nature of an offense to make itgreater than it was at the time of commission." Post, at642 (emphasis added). The dissent does not explain what itmeans by "chang[ing] the nature of an offense," but we mustassume (from the fact that this language comes in a dissent)that it means something beyond attaching otherwise unavailable punishment and requires, in addition, some form of re-characterization of the crime. After all, the dissent seeksto show through its discussion of the relevant historical ex-amples that a new law subjecting to punishment a person notthen legally subject to punishment does not fall within thesecond categoryunless the new law somehow changes thekind of crime that was previously at issue.The dissent's discussion of the historical examples suffersfrom several problems. First, it raises problems of historical accuracy. In order to show the occurrence of a changein the kind or nature of the crime, the dissent argues thatParliament's effort to banish the Earl of Clarendon amountedto an effort "to elevate criminal behavior of lower magnitudeto the level of treason." Post, at 643. The dissent supportsthis argument with a claim that "the allegations [againstClarendon] could not support a charge of treason." Ibid.Historians, however, appear to have taken a different view.But cf. post, at 646. In their view, at least one chargeagainst Clarendondid amount to treason.Clarendon was charged with "betraying his majesty's secret counsels to his enemies during the war." Edward Earlof Clarendon's Trial, 6 How. St. Tr. 292, 350 (1667) (hereinafter Clarendon's Trial). In the words of one historian,this charge "undoubtedly contained treasonous matter.

And it was on the basis ofthis specific charge--a charge of conduct that amounted totreason--that the House of Commons (which had previouslyrefused to impeach Clarendon on other charges that did notamount to treason) "voted to impeach Clarendon for hightreason." Roberts, Impeachment 13; accord, Clarendon'sTrial 350-351.The House of Lords initially thought that the Commonshad failed to provide sufficient evidence because it failed toprovide "special articles" laying out "particulars to prove it."Roberts, Impeachment 14. The Lords and Commons deadlocked over whether a "general charge" was sufficient. Ibid.See also Clarendon's Trial 351-374. But Clarendon fled,thereby providing proof of guilt. 10 Dictionary of NationalBiography, supra, at 383; see also Clarendon's Trial 389-390; 2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: Fromthe Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II, p. 373(8th ed. 1855). See also Berger, supra, at 44-45, and n. 189.The Lords and Commons then agreed to banish Clarendon.The Act of banishment--the only item in this complicatedhistory explicitly cited by Chase--explained that Clarendonwas being banished because he had "been impeached bythe Commons . . . of Treason and other misdemeanours" andhad "fled whereby Justice cannot be done upon him accordingto his demerit." 19 & 20 Car. II, c. 2 (1667-1668) (reprint1963).539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN624 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtIn sum, Clarendon's case involved Parliament's punishment of an individual who was charged before Parliamentwith treason and satisfactorily proved to have committedtreason, but whom Parliament punished by imposing "banishment" in circumstances where the party was not, in "theordinary course of law," liable to any "banishment." Seesupra, at 614. Indeed, because Clarendon had fled the country, it had become impossible to hold a proper trial to subjectClarendon to punishment through "ordinary" proceedings.See 19 & 20 Car. II, c. 2; Clarendon's Trial 385-386. Torepeat, the example of Clarendon's banishment is an exampleof an individual's being punished through legislation thatsubjected him to punishment otherwise unavailable, to anydegree, through "the ordinary course of law"--just as Chaseand his predecessor Wooddeson said. Calder, 3 Dall., at 389,and n. ##; 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638. See alsoCarmell, 529 U. S., at 523, n. 11.A second problem that the dissent's account raises is oneof historical completeness. That account does not explainhow the second relevant example--the banishment of theBishop of Atterbury--can count as an example of a recharacterization of a pre-existing crime. The dissent concedesthat Atterbury was charged with conduct constituting a"conspiracy to depose George I." Post, at 647. It oughtthen to note (but it does not note) that, like the charge of" `betraying his majesty's secret counsels,' " supra, at 622,this charge was recognized as a charge of treason, see 2J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 266-267 (1883). As the dissent claims, the evidence upon whichParliament based its decision to banish may have been "meager," and the punishment may even have been greater thansome expected. Post, at 647. But the relevant point isthat Parliament did not recharacterize the Bishop's crime.Rather, through extraordinary proceedings that concludedwith a punishment that only the legislature could impose,539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN625Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the CourtParliament aggravated a predefined crime by imposing apunishment that courts could not have imposed in "the ordinary course."Third, the dissent's account raises a problem ofvagueness.The dissent describes Justice Chase's alternative descriptionof the second category as "shed[ding] light on the meaning"of the category, post, at 641, and describes the historical references that accompany Chase's alternative description as"illustrative examples,"post, at 649. But the question iswould the dissent apply the term ex post facto to laws thatfall within the alternative description--or would it not? Ifnot, how does it reconcile its view with Carmell? See 529U. S., at 522, n. 9; see also id., at 523 (Wooddeson's categories"correlate precisely to Calder's four categories"). If so, howdoes it explain the fact that the alternative description nowhere says anything about recharacterizing, or "changingthe nature," of a crime?In our view, the key to the Atterbury and Clarendon examples lies not in any kind of recharacterization, or the like,but in the fact that Atterbury and Clarendon suffered the"same sentence"--"banishment." 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638; see also Calder, supra, at 389, n. ## (using theword "banishment" to describe both examples). As we haveargued, supra, at 614, Parliament aggravated the crimes atissue by imposing an otherwise unavailable punishment--namely, banishment--which was, according to Wooddeson, a"forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary courseof law," 2 Systematical View 638.Fourth, the dissent's initial account suffers from a technicalproblem of redundancy. Were the second category alwaysto involve the recharacterization of an offense in a way thatsubjects it to greater punishment, see post, at 642, the secondcategory would be redundant. Any law falling within itwould also necessarily fall within the third category, whichalready encompasses " `[e]very law that . . . inflicts a greaterpunishment,' " supra, at 612 (emphasis added).539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtFifth, the dissent's historical account raises problems ofpertinence. For one thing, to the extent that we are construing the scope of the Calder categories, we are trying notto investigate precisely what happened during the trials ofClarendon and Atterbury, but to determine how, severaldecades later, an 18th-century legal commentator and an18th-century American judge who relied on that commentator--and, by extension, the Framers themselves--likelyunderstood the scope of the words "ex post facto." Hence,the dissent's account seems of little relevance once we recognize that:(1) When Justice Chase set forth his alternative language for the second category (the language that thehistorical examples are meant to illuminate), he saidnothing about recharacterizing crimes, Calder, 3 Dall.,at 389;(2) When Chase speaks of laws "declaring acts to betreason, which were not treason, when committed,"ibid., he uses this language for his alternative description of first category laws, and not second category laws,supra, at 612; and(3) Wooddeson says nothing about recharacterizingcrimes and instead uses the Clarendon and Atterburyexamples to illustrate laws that "principally affect thepunishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law," 2 Systematical View 638 (some emphasis added).Of course, we do not know whether Chase and Wooddeson,in using such language, had statutes of limitations specifically in mind. We know only that their descriptions of expost facto laws and the relevant historical examples indicatean ex post facto category broad enough to include retroactivechanges in, and applications of, those statutes. And we539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courtknow that those descriptions fit this case--the dissent's his-torical exegesis notwithstanding.More importantly, even were we to accept the dissent'sview that Chase's second category examples involved somekind of recharacterization of criminal behavior (which theydid not), why would recharacterization be the ex post factotouchstone? Why, in a case where (a) application of a pre-viously inapplicable punishment and (b) recharacterization(or "changing the nature") of criminal behavior do not comehand in hand, should the absence of the latter make a criticaldifference? After all, the presence of a recharacterizationwithout new punishment works no harm. But the presenceof the new punishment without recharacterization works allthe harm. Indeed, it works retroactive harm--a circumstance relevant to the applicability of a constitutional provi-sion aimed at preventing unfair retroactive laws. Perhapsthat is why Justice Chase's alternative description--which,like Wooddeson's, speaks of laws "affect[ing]the punishment," ibid.--does not mention recharacterization or thelike.BThe dissent believes that our discussion of the case law is"less persuasive than it may appear at a first glance." Post,at 633. The dissent says that this case law is "deficient,"and that we rely on an "inapposite" case and other cases that"flatly contradict" the "principles" on which we rely. Post,at 634, 635.Having reviewed the relevant cases and commentary, wecontinue to believe that our characterizations are accurate.We say that courts, "with apparent unanimity until Califor-nia's decision inFrazer, have continued to state" that "lawsreviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto" and,"when necessary, so to hold." Supra, at 617. That state-ment is accurate. The dissent refers to no case, outside ofCalifornia, that has held, or even suggested, anything tothe contrary.539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN628 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtOf course, one might claim that the judges who wrote thecited opinions did not consider the matter as thoroughly ashas the dissent or used precisely the same kind of reasoning.The dissent makes this kind of argument in its discussion ofthe old New Jersey case, Moore v. State, 43 N. J. L. 203(1881)--a case that we believe supports our view. The dissent says that the Moore court "expressly stated that a statute reviving an expired limitations period `is not covered byany of [Justice Chase's] classes.' "Post, at 635. And thedissent draws from this language the conclusion that Moore"flatly contradict[s]" our views.Post, at 635.The dissent, however, has taken the language that itquotes out of context. In context, the court's statement reflects a conclusion that the language of Justice Chase's firstdescription of the categories (which Moore used the word"classes" to describe) does not fit cases in which a State revives time-barred prosecutions. The Moore court immediately adds, however, that Chase's alternative description ofsecond category laws does fit this case. Indeed, it "easilyembraces" a statute that, like the statute here, retroactivelyextends an expired statute of limitations and "exactly describes [its] operation." 43 N. J. L., at 216-217 (emphasisadded). Had the New Jersey court had the benefit of Carmell, 529 U. S., at 522-524, and n. 9, or perhaps even of thedissent itself, post, at 641, would it not have recognizedChase's alternative description as an authoritative accountof elements of Chase's "classes"? Would it then not havewithdrawn its earlier statement, which the dissent quotes?Would it not have simply held that the statute did fall withinthe second category? Our reading of the case leads us toanswer these questions affirmatively, but we leave the interested reader to examine the case and draw his or her ownconclusions.The dissent draws special attention to another case, Statev. Sneed, 25 Tex. Supp. 66 (1860), arguing that it is "inapposite" because it "avoided the issue" whether a law was539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN629Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courtex post facto "by holding that the statute was not meantto apply retroactively." Post, at 634. Here is the court'sanalysis, virtually in full:"In this case the bar of the statute of limitations ofone year was completed before the Code went into operation . . . . The state having neglected to prosecutewithin the time prescribed for its own action, lost theright to prosecute the suit. To give an Act of the Legis-lature, passed after such loss, the effect of reviving theright of action in the State, would give it an operationex post facto, which we cannot suppose the Legislatureintended." 25 Tex. Supp., at 67.The reader can make up his own mind.Neither can we accept the dissent's view that JudgeLearned Hand's like-minded comments in Falter were "un-supported,"post, at 637. In fact, Judge Hand's commentshad support in pre-existing case law, commentary, and published legislative debates, supra, at 616-620, and Hand'sopinion specifically cited Moore and two other early cases,Commonwealth v. Duffy, 96 Pa. 506 (1880), and People v.Buckner, 281 Ill. 340, 117 N. E. 1023 (1917). Falter, 23F. 2d, at 425.We add that, whatever the exact counts of categories ofcases that we cite, cf. post, at 633, it is not surprising thatmost of these cases involve dicta, while only a handful involve clear holdings. Where the law has long been acceptedas clearly settled, few cases are likely to arise, and cases thatdo arise most likely involve bordering areas of law, such asnew limitations statutes enactedprior to expiration of pre-existing limitations periods. Consistent with this expectation, one commentator noted in 1993 that the questionwhether to give retroactive effect to the extension of unexpired limitations periods had "become timely due to statelegislature amendments during the early 1980s that lengthenthe limitation period for the crimes of rape and sexual inter-course with a child." Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 1.6,539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtat 36. The law at issue today represents a kind of extremevariant that, given the legal consensus of unconstitutionality,has not likely been often enacted in our Nation's history.Cf. 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law $ 219a, p. 127 (rev. 4th ed. 1868)(declining to answer whether a law reviving time-barredprosecutions was ex post facto in part because "it is not likelyto come before the courts").Neither should it be surprising if the reasoning in a stringof cases stretching back over nearly 150 years is not per-fectly consistent with modern conceptions of how legal analysis should proceed. After all, Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167(1925), an opinion relied on by the dissent,post, at 640, isitself vulnerable to criticism that its "method of analysis isforeclosed by this Court's precedents," post, at 637. SeeCollins, 497 U. S., at 45-46. In assessing the case law, wefind the essential fact to be the unanimity of judicial viewsthat the kind of statute before us is ex post facto. Seesupra, at 617-619.The situation is similar with respect to commentators.Here, the essential fact is that, over a span of well over acentury, commentators have come to the same conclusion,and have done so with virtual unanimity. See supra, at 619-620. We say "virtual," for the dissent identifies one commentator who did not, namely, Joel Bishop--the same com-mentator relied on 122 years ago by the dissent inMoore,supra, at 240. The Moore majority rejected Bishop's conclusion. So did other contemporary courts and commenta-tors. Supra, at 617-620. We do the same.CThe dissent says it is a "fallacy" to apply the label " `unfairand dishonest' " to this statute, a law that revives long-deadprosecutions. Post, at 650. The dissent supports this con-clusion with three arguments. First, it suggests that "retroactive extension of unexpired statutes of limitations" is noless unfair.Ibid. Second, the dissent refers to the small539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Opinion of the Courtlikelihood that "criminals keep calendars" to mark the expi-ration of limitations periods, and it mocks the possibility thatrevival "destroys a reliance interest." Ibid. Third, the dis-sent emphasizes the harm that child molestation causes, aharm that "will plague the victim for a lifetime," andstresses the need to convict those who abuse children.Post,at 651.In making the first argument, the dissent reverses field,abandoning its historical literalism to appeal to practical consequences. But history, case law, and constitutional pur-posesall are relevant. At a minimum, the first two of theseadequately explain the difference between expired and unexpired statutes of limitations, and Chase's alternative description of second category laws itself supports such a distinction. See supra, at 613-614, 618-619.In making its second argument, which denies the existenceof significant reliance interests, the dissent ignores thepotentially lengthy period of time (in this case, 22 years)during which the accused lacked notice that he might beprosecuted and during which he was unaware, for example,of any need to preserve evidence of innocence. See supra,at 609-610. Memories fade, and witnesses can die or disappear. See supra, at 615-616. Such problems can plaguechild abuse cases, where recollection after so many yearsmay be uncertain, and "recovered" memories faulty, but maynonetheless lead to prosecutions that destroy families. See,e. g., Holdsworth, Is It Repressed Memory with DelayedRecall or Is It False Memory Syndrome? The Controversyand Its Potential Legal Implications, 22 Law & Psychol. Rev.103, 103-104 (1998). Regardless, a constitutional principlemust apply not only in child abuse cases, but in every criminal case. And, insofar as we can tell, the dissent's principlewould permit the State to revive a prosecution for any kindof crime without any temporal limitation. Thus, in thecriminal context, the dissent goes beyond our prior statements of what is constitutionally permissible even in the539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtanalogous civil context. Chase Securities Corp. v. Donald-son, 325 U. S. 304, 312, n. 8, 315-316 (1945) (acknowledgingthat extension of even an expired civil limitations period canunconstitutionally infringe upon a "vested right"); WilliamDanzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. Co., 268 U. S. 633,637 (1925) (holding the same). But see post, at 638, 653. Itis difficult to believe that the Constitution grants greaterprotection from unfair retroactivity to property than tohuman liberty.As to the dissent's third argument, we agree that theState's interest in prosecuting child abuse cases is an impor-tant one. But there is also a predominating constitutionalinterest in forbidding the State to revive a long-forbiddenprosecution. And to hold that such a law isex post factodoes not prevent the State from extending time limits forthe prosecution of future offenses, or for prosecutions not yettime barred.In sum, California's law subjects an individual such asStogner to prosecution long after the State has, in effect,granted an amnesty, telling him that he is "at liberty to re-turn to his country . . . and that from henceforth he maycease to preserve the proofs of his innocence," Wharton,Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, at 210. See alsoMoore, 43 N. J. L., at 223-224. It retroactively withdrawsa complete defense to prosecution after it has alreadyattached, and it does so in a manner that allows the State towithdraw this defense at will and with respect to individualsalready identified. See supra, at 611. "Unfair" seems to usa fair characterization.IVThe statute before us is unfairly retroactive as applied toStogner. A long line of judicial authority supports characterization of this law as ex post facto. For the reasonsstated, we believe the law falls within Justice Chase's secondcategory of ex post facto laws. We conclude that a lawenacted after expiration of a previously applicable limita539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)Kennedy, J., dissentingtions period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it isapplied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution. TheCalifornia court's judgment to the contrary is
