This case raises a narrow question of sentencing law.What standard of review applies when a court of appealsreviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination asto whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated,hence "related," for purposes of sentencing? In particular,should the appeals court review the trial court's decision deferentially or de novo? We conclude, as did the Court of Ap-peals, that deferential review is appropriate, and we affirm.IAThe trial court decision at issue focused on one aspect ofthe United States Sentencing Guidelines' treatment of "career offenders," a category of offender subject to particularlysevere punishment. The Guidelines define a "career offender" as an offender with "at least two prior felony con-victions" for violent or drug-related crimes. United StatesSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1 (Nov.2000) (USSG). At the same time, they provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior felony conviction532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 532 U. S. 59 (2001)Opinion of the Courtall those that are "related" to one another. USSG $ 4B1.2(c),and comment., n. 3; $ 4A1.2(a)(2). And they advise (in anapplication note) that prior convictions are "related" to oneanother when, inter alia, they "were consolidated for . . .sentencing." $ 4A1.2, comment., n. 3.The Seventh Circuit has refined this "prior conviction"doctrine yet further. It has held that two prior convictionsmight have been "consolidated for sentencing," and hence"related," even if the sentencing court did not enter any formal order of consolidation. See United States v. Joseph, 50F. 3d 401, 404, cert. denied, 516 U. S. 847 (1995). In such aninstance, the Circuit has said, a court should decide whetherthe convictions were nonetheless "functionally consolidated," which means that the convictions were "factually orlogically related, and sentencing was joint." 201 F. 3d 937,940 (2000) (emphasis added).BThis case concerns "functional consolidation." Paula Bu-ford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, a crime of violence, in federal court. The federal sentencing judge hadto decide whether Buford's five 1992 Wisconsin state-courtconvictions were "related" to one another, and consequentlycounted as one single prior conviction, or whether theyshould count as more than one.The Government conceded that four of the five prior convictions were "related" to one another. These four involveda series of gas station robberies. All four had been the subject of a single criminal indictment, and Buford had pleadedguilty to all four at the same time in the same court. SeeUSSG $ 4A1.2, comment., n. 3 (prior offenses are "related" if"consolidated for trial or sentencing").The Government did not concede, however, that the fifthconviction, for a drug crime, was "related" to the other four.The drug crime (possession of, with intent to deliver, co-caine) had taken place about the same time as the fourth532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN62 BUFORD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrobbery, and Buford claimed that the robberies had been motivated by her drug addiction. But the only evidentiary linkamong the crimes was that the police had discovered thecocaine when searching Buford's house after her arrest forthe robberies. Moreover, no formal order of consolidationhad been entered. The State had charged the drug offensein a separate indictment and had assigned a different prosecutor to handle the drug case. A different judge had heardBuford plead guilty to the drug charge in a different hearingheld on a different date; two different state prosecutors hadappeared before the sentencing court, one discussing drugs,the other discussing the robberies; and the sentencing courthad entered two separate judgments.Buford, without denying these facts, nonetheless pointedto other circumstances that, in her view, showed that thedrug crime conviction had been "consolidated" with the robbery convictions for sentencing, rendering her drug conviction and robbery convictions "related." She pointed outthat the State had sent the four robbery cases for sentencingto the very same judge who had heard and accepted her pleaof guilty to the drug charge; that the judge had heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases at the same time ina single proceeding; that the judge had issued sentences forall five crimes at the same time; and that the judge, havingimposed three sentences for the five crimes (6 years for thedrug crime, 12 years for two robberies, and 15 years for theother two), had ordered all three to run concurrently.The District Court, placing greater weight on the formercircumstances than on the latter, decided that the drug caseand the robbery cases had not been consolidated for sentencing, either formally or functionally. Buford appealed. TheCourt of Appeals found the "functional consolidation" question a close one, and wrote that "the standard of appellatereview may be dispositive." 201 F. 3d, at 940. It decidedto review the District Court's decision "deferentially" rather532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 532 U. S. 59 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthan "de novo." Id., at 942. And it affirmed that decision.Ibid.Buford sought certiorari. In light of the different Circuits' different approaches to the problem, we granted thewrit. Compare United States v. Irons, 196 F. 3d 634, 638(CA6 1999) (relatedness decision reviewed for clear error);United States v. Wiseman, 172 F. 3d 1196, 1219 (CA10)(same), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 889 (1999); United States v.Mapp, 170 F. 3d 328, 338 (CA2) (same), cert. denied, 528 U. S.901 (1999); United States v. Maza, 93 F. 3d 1390, 1400 (CA81996) (same), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 1138 (1997); UnitedStates v. Mullens, 65 F. 3d 1560, 1565 (CA11 1995), cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1112 (1996) (same), with United States v. Garcia, 962 F. 2d 479, 481 (CA5) (relatedness determination reviewed de novo), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 902 (1992); UnitedStates v. Davis, 922 F. 2d 1385, 1388 (CA9 1991) (same).IIIn arguing for de novo review, Buford points out that shehas not contested any relevant underlying issue of fact. Shedisagrees only with the District Court's legal conclusion thata legal label--"functional consolidation"--failed to fit the undisputed facts. She concedes, as she must, that this circumstance does not dispose of the standard of review question.That is because the relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to "accept" a districtcourt's "findings of fact" (unless "clearly erroneous"), but alsoto "give due deference to the district court's application ofthe guidelines to the facts." 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(e) (emphasisadded). And that is the kind of determination--applicationof the Guidelines to the facts--that is at issue here. Hencethe question we must answer is what kind of "deference" is"due." And, as we noted in Koon v. United States, 518 U. S.81, 98 (1996), the "deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented."532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 BUFORD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBuford argues that the nature of the question presentedhere--applying a Sentencing Guidelines term to undisputedfacts--demands no deference at all. That is to say, the def-erence "due" is no deference; hence the Court of Appealsshould have reviewed the trial court's decision de novo. Bu-ford points out that, because the underlying facts are not indispute, witness credibility is not important. She adds thatde novo appellate review will help clarify and make meaning-ful the consolidation-related legal principles at issue. Andshe says that de novo review will help avoid inconsistent trialcourt determinations about consolidation, thereby furtheringthe Guidelines' effort to bring consistency to sentencing law.Despite these arguments, we believe that the appellatecourt was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than de novo. In Koon, we based our selectionof an abuse-of-discretion standard of review on the relativeinstitutional advantages enjoyed by the district court inmaking the type of determination at issue. See id., at98-99; cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) (deference may depend on whether "one judicial actor is betterpositioned than another to decide the issue in question").We concluded there that the special competence of the district court helped to make deferential review appropriate.And that is true here as well. That is to say, the districtcourt is in a better position than the appellate court to decidewhether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates "functional consolidation."That is so because a district judge sees many more "consolidations" than does an appellate judge. As a trial judge, adistrict judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general, including consolidation procedures. And as a sentencing judge who must regularly review and classify defendants' criminal histories, a districtjudge is more likely to be aware of which procedures therelevant state or federal courts typically follow. Experiencewith trials, sentencing, and consolidations will help that532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 532 U. S. 59 (2001)Opinion of the Courtjudge draw the proper inferences from the procedural de-scriptions provided.In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal de-cision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. SeeKoon v. United States, supra, at 98-99 (District Court's detailed understanding of the case before it and experiencewith other sentencing cases favored deferential review);Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 403-404(1990) (fact-intensive nature of decision whether to imposesanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 madedeferential review appropriate); Pierce v. Underwood, 487U. S. 552, 560 (1988) (District Court's familiarity with facts ofcase warranted deferential review of determination whetherGovernment's legal position was "substantially justified").In a case like this one, for example, under Seventh Circuitdoctrine, the District Judge usefully might have consideredthe factual details of the crimes at issue in order to determine whether factual connections among those crimes,rather than, say, administrative convenience, led Wisconsinto sentence Buford simultaneously and concurrently for therobbery and drug offenses. See United States v. Joseph, 50F. 3d, at 404; United States v. Russell, 2 F. 3d 200, 204(CA7 1993).Nor can we place determinative weight upon the heightened uniformity benefits that Buford contends will resultfrom de novo review. The legal question at issue is a minor,detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law, buried in ajudicial interpretation of an application note to a Sentencing Guideline. That question is not a generally recurring,purely legal matter, such as interpreting a set of legal words,say, those of an individual guideline, in order to determinetheir basic intent. Nor is that question readily resolved byreference to general legal principles and standards alone.Rather, the question at issue grows out of, and is boundedby, case-specific detailed factual circumstances. And the532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 BUFORD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfact-bound nature of the decision limits the value of appellatecourt precedent, which may provide only minimal help whenother courts consider other procedural circumstances, otherstate systems, and other crimes. In any event, the Sentencing Commission itself gathers information on the sentencesimposed by different courts, it views the sentencing processas a whole, it has developed a broad perspective on sentenc-ing practices throughout the Nation, and it can, by adjustingthe Guidelines or the application notes, produce more con-sistent sentencing results among similarly situated offenderssentenced by different courts. Insofar as greater uniform-ity is necessary, the Commission can provide it. Cf.Braxtonv. United States, 500 U. S. 344, 347-348 (1991) (Congress intended Sentencing Commission to play primary role in re-solving conflicts over interpretation of Guidelines).IIIIn light of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision, thecomparatively greater expertise of the District Court, andthe limited value of uniform court of appeals precedent, weconclude that the Court of Appeals properly reviewed theDistrict Court's "functional consolidation" decision deferen-tially. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
