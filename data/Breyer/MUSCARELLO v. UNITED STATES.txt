A provision in the firearms chapter of the federal criminalcode imposes a 5-year mandatory prison term upon a personwho "uses or carries a firearm" "during and in relation to" a"drug trafficking crime." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). The question before us is whether the phrase "carries a firearm" islimited to the carrying of firearms on the person. We holdthat it is not so limited. Rather, it also applies to a person#Daniel Kanstroom, David Porter, and Kyle O'Dowd filed a brief forthe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as amicicuriae urging reversal.524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the Courtwho knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle,including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car,which the person accompanies.IThe question arises in two cases, which we have consoli-dated for argument. Petitioner in the first case, Frank J.Muscarello, unlawfully sold marijuana, which he carried inhis truck to the place of sale. Police officers found a handgun locked in the truck's glove compartment. During pleaproceedings, Muscarello admitted that he had "carried" thegun "for protection in relation" to the drug offense, App.in No. 96-1654, p. 12, though he later claimed to the contrary, and added that, in any event, his "carr[ying]" of thegun in the glove compartment did not fall within the scopeof the statutory word "carries." App. to Pet. for Cert. inNo. 96-1654, p. 10a.Petitioners in the second case, Donald Cleveland and En-rique Gray-Santana, placed several guns in a bag, put thebag in the trunk of a car, and then traveled by car to a pro-posed drug-sale point, where they intended to steal drugsfrom the sellers. Federal agents at the scene stopped them,searched the cars, found the guns and drugs, and arrestedthem.In both cases the Courts of Appeals found that petitionershad "carrie[d]" the guns during and in relation to a drugtrafficking offense. 106 F. 3d 636, 639 (CA5 1997); 106 F. 3d1056, 1068 (CA1 1997). We granted certiorari to determinewhether the fact that the guns were found in the lockedglove compartment, or the trunk, of a car precludes applica-tion of $ 924(c)(1). We conclude that it does not.IIAWe begin with the statute's language. The parties vigor-ously contest the ordinary English meaning of the phrase524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"carries a firearm." Because they essentially agree thatCongress intended the phrase to convey its ordinary, and notsome special legal, meaning, and because they argue the linguistic point at length, we too have looked into the matterin more than usual depth. Although the word "carry" hasmany different meanings, only two are relevant here. Whenone uses the word in the first, or primary, meaning, one can,as a matter of ordinary English, "carry firearms" in a wagon,car, truck, or other vehicle that one accompanies. When oneuses the word in a different, rather special, way, to mean, forexample, "bearing" or (in slang) "packing" (as in "packing agun"), the matter is less clear. But, for reasons we shall setout below, we believe Congress intended to use the word inits primary sense and not in this latter, special way.Consider first the word's primary meaning. The OxfordEnglish Dictionary gives as its first definition "convey, originally by cart or wagon, hence in any vehicle, by ship, onhorseback, etc." 2 Oxford English Dictionary 919 (2d ed.1989); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 343 (1986) (first definition: "move while supporting (as ina vehicle or in one's hands or arms)"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 319 (2d ed.1987) (first definition: "to take or support from one place toanother; convey; transport").The origin of the word "carries" explains why the first, orbasic, meaning of the word "carry" includes conveyance in avehicle. See Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 146 (1988)(tracing the word from Latin "carum," which means "car" or"cart"); 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919 (tracingthe word from Old French "carier" and the late Latin "carricare," which meant to "convey in a car"); Oxford Dictionaryof English Etymology 148 (C. Onions ed. 1966) (same); Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, supra, at 143 (explaining thatthe term "car" has been used to refer to the automobilesince 1896).524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe greatest of writers have used the word with thismeaning. See, e. g., The King James Bible, 2 Kings 9:28("[H]is servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem"); id.,Isaiah 30:6 ("[T]hey will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses"). Robinson Crusoe says, "[w]ith myboat, I carry'd away every Thing." D. Defoe, RobinsonCrusoe 174 (J. Crowley ed. 1972). And the owners of Queequeg's ship, Melville writes, "had lent him a [wheelbarrow],in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-house."H. Melville, Moby Dick 43 (U. Chicago 1952). This Court,too, has spoken of the "carrying" of drugs in a car or inits "trunk." California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 572-573(1991); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U. S. 248, 249 (1991).These examples do not speak directly about carrying guns.But there is nothing linguistically special about the fact thatweapons, rather than drugs, are being carried. RobinsonCrusoe might have carried a gun in his boat; Queequeg mighthave borrowed a wheelbarrow in which to carry not a chestbut a harpoon. And, to make certain that there is no specialordinary English restriction (unmentioned in dictionaries)upon the use of "carry" in respect to guns, we have surveyedmodern press usage, albeit crudely, by searching computerized newspaper data bases--both the New York Times database in Lexis/Nexis, and the "US News" data base in Westlaw. We looked for sentences in which the words "carry,""vehicle," and "weapon" (or variations thereof) all appear.We found thousands of such sentences, and random samplingsuggests that many, perhaps more than one-third, are sentences used to convey the meaning at issue here, i. e., thecarrying of guns in a car.The New York Times, for example, writes about "anex-con" who "arrives home driving a stolen car and carryinga load of handguns," Mar. 21, 1992, section 1, p. 18, col. 1, andan "official peace officer who carries a shotgun in his boat,"June 19, 1988, section 12WC, p. 2, col. 1; cf. The New York524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtTimes Manual of Style and Usage, a Desk Book of Guidelinesfor Writers and Editors, foreword (L. Jordan rev. ed. 1976)(restricting Times journalists and editors to the use ofproper English). The Boston Globe refers to the arrest of aprofessional baseball player "for carrying a semiloaded automatic weapon in his car." Dec. 10, 1994, p. 75, col. 5. TheColorado Springs Gazette Telegraph speaks of one "Russell"who "carries a gun hidden in his car." May 2, 1993, p. B1,col. 2. The Arkansas Gazette refers to a "house" that was"searched" in an effort to find "items that could be carriedin a car, such as . . . guns." Mar. 10, 1991, p. A1, col. 2. TheSan Diego Union-Tribune asks, "What, do they carry gunsaboard these boats now?" Feb. 18, 1992, p. D2, col. 5.Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of theword "carry"--a meaning upon which the linguistic argu-ments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The OxfordEnglish Dictionary's twenty-sixth definition of "carry" is"bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one." 2 Oxford English Dictionary,at 921. Webster's defines "carry" as "to move while supporting," not just in a vehicle, but also "in one's handsor arms." Webster's Third New International Dictionary,supra, at 343. And Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase "carry arms or weapons" as"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in theclothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or forthe purpose of being armed and ready for offensive ordefensive action in case of a conflict with another per-son." Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).These special definitions, however, do not purport to limitthe "carrying of arms" to the circumstances they describe.No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person "carries a weapon." But to say that is not to deny that one mayalso "carry a weapon" tied to the saddle of a horse or placedin a bag in a car.524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the CourtNor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congressintended to limit the word "carries" in the statute to any ofthese special definitions. To the contrary, all these specialdefinitions embody a form of an important, but secondary,meaning of "carry," a meaning that suggests support ratherthan movement or transportation, as when, for example, acolumn "carries" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford EnglishDictionary, at 919, 921. In this sense a gangster might"carry" a gun (in colloquial language, he might "pack a gun")even though he does not move from his chair. It is difficultto believe, however, that Congress intended to limit the statutory word to this definition--imposing special punishmentupon the comatose gangster while ignoring drug lords whodrive to a sale carrying an arsenal of weapons in their van.We recognize, as the dissent emphasizes, that the word"carry" has other meanings as well. But those other meanings (e. g., "carry all he knew," "carries no colours"), see post,at 143-144, are not relevant here. And the fact that speakers often do not add to the phrase "carry a gun" the words"in a car" is of no greater relevance here than the fact thatmillions of Americans did not see Muscarello carry a gun inhis truck. The relevant linguistic facts are that the word"carry" in its ordinary sense includes carrying in a car andthat the word, used in its ordinary sense, keeps the samemeaning whether one carries a gun, a suitcase, or a banana.Given the ordinary meaning of the word "carry," it is notsurprising to find that the Federal Courts of Appeals haveunanimously concluded that "carry" is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the person but can include theircarriage in a car. United States v. Toms, 136 F. 3d 176, 181(CADC 1998); United States v. Foster, 133 F. 3d 704, 708(CA9 1998); United States v.

Farris, 77 F. 3d 391, 395-396 (CA111996).BWe now explore more deeply the purely legal question ofwhether Congress intended to use the word "carry" in itsordinary sense, or whether it intended to limit the scope ofthe phrase to instances in which a gun is carried "on theperson." We conclude that neither the statute's basic pur-pose nor its legislative history support circumscribing thescope of the word "carry" by applying an "on the person"limitation.This Court has described the statute's basic purposebroadly, as an effort to combat the "dangerous combination"of "drugs and guns." Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,240 (1993). And the provision's chief legislative sponsor hassaid that the provision seeks "to persuade the man who istempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun athome." 114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff); see Busicv.United States, 446 U. S. 398, 405 (1980) (describing Poff 'scomments as "crucial material" in interpreting the purposeof $ 924(c)); Simpson v. United States, 435 U. S. 6, 13-14(1978) (concluding that Poff 's comments are "clearly probative" and "certainly entitled to weight"); see also 114 Cong.Rec. 22243-22244 (statutes would apply to "the man whogoes out taking a gun to commit a crime") (Rep. Hunt); id.,at 22244 ("Of course, what we are trying to do by these penalties is to persuade the criminal to leave his gun at home")(Rep. Randall);id., at 22236 ("We are concerned . . . withhaving the criminal leave his gun at home") (Rep. Meskill).From the perspective of any such purpose (persuading acriminal "to leave his gun at home"), what sense would it524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmake for this statute to penalize one who walks with a gunin a bag to the site of a drug sale, but to ignore a similarindividual who, like defendant Gray-Santana, travels to asimilar site with a similar gun in a similar bag, but insteadof walking, drives there with the gun in his car? How persuasive is a punishment that is without effect until a drugdealer who has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for use) actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks theglove compartment) of his car? It is difficult to say that,considered as a class, those who prepare, say, to sell drugsby placing guns in their cars are less dangerous, or less deserving of punishment, than those who carry handguns ontheir person.We have found no significant indication elsewhere in thelegislative history of any more narrowly focused relevantpurpose. We have found an instance in which a legislatorreferred to the statute as applicable when an individual "hasa firearm on his person," ibid. (Rep. Meskill); an instance inwhich a legislator speaks of "a criminal who takes a gun inhis hand," id., at 22239 (Rep. Pucinski); and a reference inthe Senate Report to a "gun carried in a pocket," S. Rep.No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1983); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 21788,21789 (1968) (references to gun "carrying" without more).But in these instances no one purports to define the scope ofthe term "carries"; and the examples of guns carried on theperson are not used to illustrate the reach of the term "carries" but to illustrate, or to criticize, a different aspect ofthe statute.Regardless, in other instances, legislators suggest that theword "carries" has a broader scope. One legislator indicatesthat the statute responds in part to the concerns of law enforcement personnel, who had urged that "carrying shortfirearms in motor vehicles be classified as carrying suchweapons concealed." Id., at 22242 (Rep. May). Anothercriticizes a version of the proposed statute by suggesting itmight apply to drunken driving, and gives as an example a524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN134 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdrunken driver who has a "gun in his car." Id., at 21792(Rep. Yates). Others describe the statute as criminalizinggun "possession"--a term that could stretch beyond both the"use" of a gun and the carrying of a gun on the person. Seeid., at 21793 (Rep. Casey); id., at 22236 (Rep. Meskill); id., at30584 (Rep. Collier);id., at 30585 (Rep. Skubitz).CWe are not convinced by petitioners' remaining argumentsto the contrary. First, they say that our definition of "carry"makes it the equivalent of "transport." Yet, Congress else-where in related statutes used the word "transport" deliberately to signify a different, and broader, statutory coverage.The immediately preceding statutory subsection, for example, imposes a different set of penalties on one who, withan intent to commit a crime, "ships, transports, or receivesa firearm" in interstate commerce. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(b).Moreover, $ 926A specifically "entitle[s]" a person "not otherwise prohibited . . . from transporting, shipping, or receivinga firearm" to "transport a firearm . . . from any place wherehe may lawfully possess and carry" it to "any other place"where he may do so. Why, petitioners ask, would Congresshave used the word "transport," or used both "carry" and"transport" in the same provision, if it had intended to obliterate the distinction between the two?The short answer is that our definition does not equate"carry" and "transport." "Carry" implies personal agencyand some degree of possession, whereas "transport" does nothave such a limited connotation and, in addition, implies themovement of goods in bulk over great distances. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 343 (notingthat "carry" means "moving to a location some distance awaywhile supporting or maintaining off the ground" and "is anatural word to use in ref. to cargoes and loads on trucks,wagons, planes, ships, or even beasts of burden," while"transport refers to carriage in bulk or number over an ap524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the Courtpreciable distance and, typically, by a customary or usual car-rier agency"); see also Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms 141(1942). If Smith, for example, calls a parcel delivery service,which sends a truck to Smith's house to pick up Smith's package and take it to Los Angeles, one might say that Smithhas shipped the package and the parcel delivery service hastransported the package. But only the truck driver has"carried" the package in the sense of "carry" that we believeCongress intended. Therefore, "transport" is a broadercategory that includes "carry" but also encompasses otheractivity.The dissent refers to $ 926A and to another statute whereCongress used the word "transport" rather than "carry" todescribe the movement of firearms. 18 U. S. C. $ 925(a)(2)(B); post, at 146-147. According to the dissent, had Congress intended "carry" to have the meaning we give it, Congress would not have needed to use a different word in theseprovisions. But as we have discussed above, we believe theword "transport" is broader than the word "carry."And, if Congress intended "carry" to have the limiteddefinition the dissent contends, it would have been quite unnecessary to add the proviso in $ 926A requiring a person, tobe exempt from penalties, to store her firearm in a lockedcontainer not immediately accessible. See $ 926A (quoted infull, post, at 146) (exempting from criminal penalties one whotransports a firearm from a place where "he may lawfullypossess and carry such firearm" but not exempting the"transportation" of a firearm if it is "readily accessible or isdirectly accessible from the passenger compartment of suchtransporting vehicle"). The statute simply could have saidthat such a person may not "carry" a firearm. But, ofcourse, Congress did not say this because that is not what"carry" means.As we interpret the statutory scheme, it makes sense.Congress has imposed a variable penalty with no mandatoryminimum sentence upon a person who "transports" (or524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"ships" or "receives") a firearm knowing it will be used tocommit any "offense punishable by imprisonment for [morethan] one year," $ 924(b), and it has imposed a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence upon one who "carries" a firearm"during and in relation to" a "drug trafficking crime,"$ 924(c). The first subsection imposes a less strict sentencing regime upon one who, say, ships firearms by mail foruse in a crime elsewhere; the latter subsection imposes amandatory sentence upon one who, say, brings a weapon withhim (on his person or in his car) to the site of a drug sale.Second, petitioners point out that, in Bailey v. UnitedStates, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), we considered the related phrase"uses . . . a firearm" found in the same statutory provisionnow before us. See 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) ("uses or carries afirearm"). We construed the term "use" narrowly, limitingits application to the "active employment" of a firearm. Bailey, 516 U. S., at 144. Petitioners argue that it would beanomalous to construe broadly the word "carries," its statutory next-door neighbor.In Bailey, however, we limited "use" of a firearm to "activeemployment" in part because we assumed "that Congress. . . intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluousmeaning." Id., at 146. A broader interpretation of "use,"we said, would have swallowed up the term "carry." Ibid.But "carry" as we interpret that word does not swallow upthe term "use." "Use" retains the same independent meaning we found for it in Bailey, where we provided examplesinvolving the displaying or the bartering of a gun. Ibid."Carry" also retains an independent meaning, for, under Bailey, carrying a gun in a car does not necessarily involve thegun's "active employment." More importantly, having construed "use" narrowly in Bailey, we cannot also construe"carry" narrowly without undercutting the statute's basic objective. For the narrow interpretation would remove theact of carrying a gun in a car entirely from the statute's524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN137Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Opinion of the Courtreach, leaving a gap in coverage that we do not believe Con-gress intended.Third, petitioners say that our reading of the statutewould extend its coverage to passengers on buses, trains, orships, who have placed a firearm, say, in checked luggage.To extend this statute so far, they argue, is unfair, going wellbeyond what Congress likely would have thought possible.They add that some lower courts, thinking approximatelythe same, have limited the scope of "carries" to instanceswhere a gun in a car is immediately accessible, thereby mostlikely excluding from coverage a gun carried in a car's trunkor locked glove compartment. See, e. g., Foster, 133 F. 3d,at 708 (concluding that person "carries" a firearm in a caronly if the firearm is immediately accessible); Giraldo, 80F. 3d, at 676 (same).In our view, this argument does not take adequate accountof other limiting words in the statute--words that make thestatute applicable only where a defendant "carries" a gunboth "during and in relation to" a drug crime. $ 924(c)(1)(emphasis added). Congress added these words in part toprevent prosecution where guns "played" no part in thecrime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 314, n. 10; cf. UnitedStates v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d 538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.)(observing that " `in relation to' " was "added to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted . . . forcommitting an entirely unrelated crime while in possessionof a firearm"), overruled in part on other grounds, UnitedStates v. Hernandez, 80 F. 3d 1253, 1257 (CA9 1996).Once one takes account of the words "during" and "in relation to," it no longer seems beyond Congress' likely intent,or otherwise unfair, to interpret the statute as we have done.If one carries a gun in a car "during" and "in relation to" adrug sale, for example, the fact that the gun is carried inthe car's trunk or locked glove compartment seems not onlylogically difficult to distinguish from the immediately accessible gun, but also beside the point.524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN138 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAt the same time, the narrow interpretation creates itsown anomalies. The statute, for example, defines "firearm"to include a "bomb," "grenade," "rocket having a propellantcharge of more than four ounces," or "missile having anexplosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarterounce," where such device is "explosive," "incendiary," or de-livers "poison gas." 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(4)(A). On petitioners' reading, the "carry" provision would not apply to in-stances where drug lords, engaged in a major transaction,took with them "firearms" such as these, which most likelycould not be carried on the person.Fourth, petitioners argue that we should construe theword "carry" to mean "immediately accessible." And, as wehave said, they point out that several Courts of Appeals havelimited the statute's scope in this way. See, e. g., Foster,supra, at 708; Giraldo, supra, at 676. That interpretation,however, is difficult to square with the statute's language,for one "carries" a gun in the glove compartment whether ornot that glove compartment is locked. Nothing in the stat-ute's history suggests that Congress intended that limitation. And, for reasons pointed out above, see supra, at 137,we believe that the words "during" and "in relation to" willlimit the statute's application to the harms that Congressforesaw.Finally, petitioners and the dissent invoke the "rule of lenity." The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity,however, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule,for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree. Cf. Smith,508 U. S., at 239 ("The mere possibility of articulating a narrower construction . . . does not by itself make the rule oflenity applicable"). " `The rule of lenity applies only if,"after seizing everything from which aid can be derived," . . .we can make "no more than a guess as to what Congressintended." ' " United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 499(1997) (quoting Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995), in turnquoting Smith, supra, at 239, and Ladner v. United States,358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). To invoke the rule, we must con524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)Ginsburg, J., dissentingclude that there is a " ` "grievous ambiguity or uncertainty" 'in the statute." Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619,n. 17 (1994) (quoting Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S.453, 463 (1991)). Certainly, our decision today is based onmuch more than a "guess as to what Congress intended,"and there is no "grievous ambiguity" here. The problem ofstatutory interpretation in these cases is indeed no differentfrom that in many of the criminal cases that confront us.Yet, this Court has never held that the rule of lenity auto-matically permits a defendant to win.In sum, the "generally accepted contemporary meaning"of the word "carry" includes the carrying of a firearm in avehicle. The purpose of this statute warrants its applicationin such circumstances. The limiting phrase "during and inrelation to" should prevent misuse of the statute to penalizethose whose conduct does not create the risks of harm atwhich the statute aims.For these reasons, we conclude that petitioners' conductfalls within the scope of the phrase "carries a firearm." Thejudgments of the Courts of Appeals are affirmed.
