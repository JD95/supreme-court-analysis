The petitioner in this case, Richard Trest, seeks a writ ofhabeas corpus, which would vacate a long sentence that heis serving in a Louisiana prison for armed robbery. TheDistrict Court refused to issue the writ. Trest appealed tothe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which ruledagainst him on the ground of "procedural default."Trest v.Whitley, 94 F. 3d 1005, 1007 (1996). The Fifth Circuit believed that Trest had failed to raise his federal claims on timein state court, that a state court would now refuse to consider his claims for that reason, and that this state proce-dural reason amounted to an adequate and independent stateground for denying Trest relief. Hence, in the absence ofspecial circumstances, a federal habeas court could not reachthe merits of Trest's federal claims. Id., at 1007-1009; see*Edward M. Chikofsky and Barbara E.

S. 87 (1997)Opinion of the Courtgenerally Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991); Rosev.Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982).In his petition for certiorari to this Court, Trest pointedout that the Court of Appeals had raised and decided thequestion of "procedural default" sua sponte. The partiesthemselves had neither raised nor argued the matter. Andlanguage in the Court of Appeals' opinion suggested that thecourt had thought that, once it had noticed the possibilityof a procedural default, it was required to raise the matteron its own. Trest consequently asked us to decide whethera court of appeals, reviewing a district court's habeas corpus decision, "is required to raise . . . sua sponte" a petitioner's potential procedural default. Pet. for Cert. i (emphasisadded). We agreed to do so.Precedent makes clear that the answer to the questionpresented is "no." A court of appeals is not "required" toraise the issue of procedural default sua sponte. It is notas if the presence of a procedural default deprived the federal court of jurisdiction, for this Court has made clear thatin the habeas context, a procedural default, that is, a criticalfailure to comply with state procedural law, is not a jurisdictional matter. See Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518,522-523 (1997); Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730-731. Rather,"[i]n the habeas context, the application of the independentand adequate state ground doctrine," of which a proceduraldefault is typically an instance, "is grounded in concerns ofcomity and federalism." Id., at 730 (contrasting habeas proceeding with this Court's direct review of a state court judgment). Thus, procedural default is normally a "defense"that the State is "obligated to raise" and "preserv[e]" if it isnot to "lose the right to assert the defense thereafter."Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 166 (1996); see Jenkins v.Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 234, n. 1 (1980). We are not awareof any precedent stating that a habeas court must raise sucha matter where the State itself does not do so. And Louisiana concedes as much, for it says in its brief that "the Fifth522US1 Unit: $$U8 [01-27-00 19:25:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN90 TREST v. CAINOpinion of the CourtCircuit clearly was not `required' to sua sponte invoke procedural default." Brief for Respondent 16-17.Louisiana, however, would like us to go beyond the question presented and hold that the law permitted (though it didnot require) the Fifth Circuit to raise the procedural defaultsua sponte. Cf. Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 133-134(1987) (appellate court may raise sua sponte petitioner's failure to exhaust state remedies). We recognize some uncertainty in the lower courts as to whether, or just when, ahabeas court may consider a procedural default that theState at some point has waived, or failed to raise. CompareEsslinger v. Davis, 44 F. 3d 1515, 1525-1528 (CA11 1995)(sua sponte invocation of procedural default serves no important federal interest), with Hardiman v. Reynolds, 971 F. 2d500, 502-505 (CA10 1992) (comity and scarce judicial resources may justify court raising state procedural defaultsua sponte); see also J. Liebman & R. Hertz, 2 FederalHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure $ 26.2, pp. 814-817(1994) (citing cases). Nonetheless, we do not believe this isan appropriate case in which to examine that question forseveral reasons. First, the Fifth Circuit's opinion containslanguage suggesting the court believed that, despite Louisiana's failure to raise the matter, Circuit precedent requiredthe court (and did not simply permit the court) to consider apotential procedural default. See, e. g., 94 F. 3d, at 1007("[T]his court's decision in Sones v. Hargett . . . precludes usfrom reviewing the merits of Trest's habeas challenge").Second, the language of the question presented in Trest'spetition for certiorari, as well as the arguments made in hispetition, made clear that Trest intended to limit the questionin the way we have described. Yet Louisiana in its responsedid not object or suggest alternate wording. Nor did Louisiana ask us to consider the question in any broader context.Third, we cannot now easily answer the broader questionin the context of this case, for we are uncertain about mat522US1 Unit: $$U8 [01-27-00 19:25:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN91Cite as: 522 U. S. 87 (1997)Opinion of the Courtters which arguably are relevant to the question whether thelaw permitted the Fifth Circuit to raise a procedural defaultsua sponte. The parties disagree, for example, aboutwhether or not Trest has fully, or partially, exhausted hiscurrent federal claims by raising them in state court. Cf.Rose v. Lundy, supra, at 518-520. They disagree aboutwhether Louisiana has waived any "nonexhaustion" defense.Cf. Granberry v. Greer, supra. They consequently disagreeabout whether this is, or is not, the kind of case in which afederal court might rely upon the existence of a state "procedural bar" despite the failure of any state court to assertone. See Coleman v. Thompson, supra, at 735, n.The parties also seem to disagree about which State's procedural rules are relevant. Trest's federal claims focus uponthe 35-year sentence of imprisonment that the Louisianacourt imposed (under a Louisiana "habitual offender" law)in light of his earlier convictions in Mississippi for burglary.Trest argued that those earlier convictions were constitutionally invalid because they rested upon a guilty plea whichhe says the Mississippi court accepted without having firsttold him about his rights to appeal, to trial by jury, to confront witnesses, and not to incriminate himself. Cf. Boykinv. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242-244 (1969); State v. Robicheaux, 412 So. 2d 1313, 1316-1317 (La. 1982). The FifthCircuit did not reach the merits of Trest's claims because itbelieved that the Mississippi courts would have barred anychallenge to his Mississippi convictions as a challenge that,under state law, came too late in the day. See Miss. CodeAnn. $ 99-39-5(2) (1994). Trest, and amici supporting him,state that the relevant procedural law (for the purposes ofthe "procedural default" doctrine) is that of Louisiana, ratherthan that of Mississippi, for it is Louisiana, not Mississippi,which holds Trest in custody. And it is not clear whetherMississippi's procedural law would create a "default" thatwould bar federal courts from considering whether Louisi522US1 Unit: $$U8 [01-27-00 19:25:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 TREST v. CAINOpinion of the Courtana, not Mississippi, could (or could not) use Mississippi con-victions to enhance a sentence for a subsequent Louisianacrime.We note that the parties might have considered thesequestions, and the Court of Appeals might have determinedtheir relevance or their answers, had that court not decidedthe procedural default question without giving the partiesan opportunity for argument. We do not say that a courtmust always ask for further briefing when it disposes of acase on a basis not previously argued. But often, as here,that somewhat longer (and often fairer) way `round is theshortest way home. Regardless, we have answered thequestion presented, we vacate the judgment of the Court ofAppeals, and we remand the case for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN93OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusHUDSON et al. v. UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuitNo. 96-976. Argued October 8, 1997--Decided December 10, 1997The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) imposed monetarypenalties and occupational debarment on petitioners for violating 12U. S. C. $$ 84(a)(1) and 375b by causing two banks in which they wereofficials to make certain loans in a manner that unlawfully allowed petitioner Hudson to receive the loans' benefit. When the Governmentlater criminally indicted petitioners for essentially the same conduct,they moved to dismiss under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment. The District Court ultimately dismissed the indictments,but the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on United States v. Halper,490 U. S. 435, 448-449.Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause is not a bar to petitioners' later criminal prosecution because the OCC administrative proceedings were civil,not criminal. Pp. 98-105.(a) The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. See, e. g., Helvering v. Mitchell,303 U. S. 391, 399. Halper deviated from this Court's longstanding double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects. First, it bypassed the traditional threshold question whether the legislature intended the particularsuccessive punishment to be "civil" or "criminal" in nature, see, e. g.,United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248, focusing instead on whetherthe sanction was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as toconstitute "punishment." The Court thereby elevated to dispositivestatus one of the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372U. S. 144, 168-169, for determining whether a statute intended to becivil was so punitive as to transform it into a criminal penalty, eventhough Kennedy itself emphasized that no one factor should be considered controlling, id., at 169. Second, Halper "assess[ed] the characterof the actual sanctions imposed," 490 U. S., at 447, rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the "statute on its face" to determinewhether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S.,at 169. Such deviations were ill considered. Halper's test has provedunworkable, creating confusion by attempting to distinguish between"punitive" and "nonpunitive" penalties. Moreover, some of the ills atwhich it was directed are addressed by other constitutional provisions.522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 HUDSON v. UNITED STATESSyllabusThus, this Court largely disavows Halper's method of analysis and reaffirms the previous rule exemplified in Ward. Pp. 98-103.(b) Applying traditional principles to the facts, it is clear that petitioners' criminal prosecution would not violate double jeopardy. Themoney penalties statutes' express designation of their sanctions as"civil," see $$ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), and the fact that the authority to issuedebarment orders is conferred upon the "appropriate Federal bankingagenc[ies]," see $$ 1818(e)(1)-(3), establish that Congress intended thesesanctions to be civil in nature. Moreover, there is little evidence--much less the "clearest proof" this Court requires, see Ward, supra, at249--to suggest that the sanctions were so punitive in form and effectas to render them criminal despite Congress' contrary intent, see UnitedStates v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 290. Neither sanction has historicallybeen viewed as punishment, Helvering, supra, at 399, and n. 2, 400, andneither involves an affirmative disability or restraint, see Flemming v.Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617. Neither comes into play "only" on a findingof scienter, Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 168, since penalties may be assessedunder $$ 93(b) and 504, and debarment imposed under $ 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii),without regard to the violator's willfulness. That the conduct for whichOCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal, see ibid., is insufficientto render the sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, supra, at 292, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509U. S. 688, 704. Finally, although the imposition of both sanctions willdeter others from emulating petitioners' conduct, see Kennedy, supra,at 168, the mere presence of this traditional goal of criminal punishmentis insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "may servecivil as well as criminal goals," e. g., Ursery, supra, at 292.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDouble Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a barto the later criminal prosecution because the administrativeproceedings were civil, not criminal. Our reasons for soholding in large part disavow the method of analysis used inUnited States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), and reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in UnitedStates v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980).During the early and mid-1980's, petitioner John Hudsonwas the chairman and controlling shareholder of the FirstNational Bank of Tipton (Tipton) and the First NationalBank of Hammon (Hammon).1 During the same period,petitioner Jack Rackley was president of Tipton and a mem-ber of the board of directors of Hammon, and petitionerLarry Baresel was a member of the board of directors ofboth Tipton and Hammon.An examination of Tipton and Hammon led the Office ofthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to conclude that petitioners had used their bank positions to arrange a seriesof loans to third parties in violation of various federal banking statutes and regulations. According to the OCC, thoseloans, while nominally made to third parties, were in realitymade to Hudson in order to enable him to redeem bank stockthat he had pledged as collateral on defaulted loans.On February 13, 1989, OCC issued a "Notice of Assessmentof Civil Money Penalty." The notice alleged that petitionershad violated 12 U. S. C. $$ 84(a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12CFR $$ 31.2(b) and 215.4(b) (1986) by causing the banks withwhich they were associated to make loans to nominee borrowers in a manner that unlawfully allowed Hudson to receive the benefit of the loans. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a.The notice also alleged that the illegal loans resulted inlosses to Tipton and Hammon of almost $900,000 and contributed to the failure of those banks. Id., at 97a.

"After taking intoaccount the size of the financial resources and the good faithof [petitioners], the gravity of the violations, the history ofprevious violations and other matters as justice may require,as required by 12 U. S. C. $$ 93(b)(2) and 504(b)," OCC assessed penalties of $100,000 against Hudson and $50,000 eachagainst Rackley and Baresel. Id., at 89a. On August 31,1989, OCC also issued a "Notice of Intention to Prohibit Further Participation" against each petitioner. Id., at 99a.These notices, which were premised on the identical allegations that formed the basis for the previous notices, informedpetitioners that OCC intended to bar them from further participation in the conduct of "any insured depository institution." Id., at 100a.In October 1989, petitioners resolved the OCC proceedingsagainst them by each entering into a "Stipulation and Consent Order." These consent orders provided that Hudson,Baresel, and Rackley would pay assessments of $16,500,$15,000, and $12,500 respectively. Id., at 130a, 140a, 135a.In addition, each petitioner agreed not to "participate in anymanner" in the affairs of any banking institution without thewritten authorization of the OCC and all other relevant regulatory agencies.2 Id., at 131a, 141a, 136a.In August 1992, petitioners were indicted in the WesternDistrict of Oklahoma in a 22-count indictment on charges ofconspiracy, 18 U.

The Court of Appealsaffirmed the District Court's holding on the nonparticipationsanction issue, but vacated and remanded to the DistrictCourt on the money sanction issue. 14 F. 3d 536 (CA101994).

S. 537, 549 (1943) (quoting Moore v. Illinois,14 How. 13, 19 (1852)). The Clause protects only against theimposition of multiple criminal punishments for the sameoffense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938); seealsoHess, supra, at 548-549 ("Only" "criminal punishment""subject[s] the defendant to `jeopardy' within the constitu-tional meaning");Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 528 (1975)("In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk thatis traditionally associated with a criminal prosecution"), andthen only when such occurs in successive proceedings, seeMissouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359, 366 (1983).Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, atleast initially, a matter of statutory construction. Helvering, supra, at 399. A court must first ask whether the legislature, "in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicatedeither expressly or impliedly a preference for one label orthe other." Ward, 448 U. S., at 248. Even in those caseswhere the legislature "has indicated an intention to establisha civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect," id.,at 248-249, as to "transfor[m] what was clearly intended asa civil remedy into a criminal penalty," Rex Trailer Co. v.United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).In making this latter determination, the factors listed inKennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963),provide useful guideposts, including: (1) "[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint"; (2)"whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment";(3) "whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter";(4) "whether its operation will promote the traditional aimsof punishment--retribution and deterrence"; (5) "whetherthe behavior to which it applies is already a crime"; (6)"whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationallybe connected is assignable for it"; and (7) "whether it appears522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN100 HUDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtexcessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned."It is important to note, however, that "these factors must beconsidered in relation to the statute on its face," id., at 169,and "only the clearest proof " will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civilremedy into a criminal penalty, Ward, supra, at 249 (internalquotation marks omitted).Our opinion in United States v. Halper marked the firsttime we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanctionwithout first determining that it was criminal in nature. Inthat case, Irwin Halper was convicted of,inter alia, violatingthe criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 287, based onhis submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of whichovercharged the Government by $9. He was sentenced totwo years' imprisonment and fined $5,000. The Governmentthen brought an action against Halper under the civil FalseClaims Act, 31 U. S. C. $$ 3729-3731 (1982 ed., Supp. II).The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act providedthat a violation of the Act rendered one "liable to the UnitedStates Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amountequal to 2 times the amount of damages the Governmentsustains because of the act of that person, and costs of thecivil action." Id., $ 3729. Given Halper's 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of$130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600. However, the District Court concluded that a penalty of this magnitude would violate theDouble Jeopardy Clause in light of Halper's previous criminal conviction. While explicitly recognizing that the statutory damages provision of the Act "was not itself a criminalpunishment," the District Court nonetheless concluded thatapplication of the full penalty to Halper would constitute asecond "punishment" in violation of the Double JeopardyClause. 490 U. S., at 438-439.On direct appeal, this Court affirmed. As the HalperCourt saw it, the imposition of "punishment" of any kind was522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN101Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsubject to double jeopardy constraints, and whether asanction constituted "punishment" depended primarily onwhether it served the traditional "goals of punishment,"namely, "retribution and deterrence." Id., at 448. Anysanction that was so "overwhelmingly disproportionate" tothe injury caused that it could not "fairly be saidsolely toserve [the] remedial purpose" of compensating the Government for its loss, was thought to be explainable only as "serv-ing either retributive or deterrent purposes." See id., at448-449 (emphasis added).The analysis applied by theHalper Court deviated fromour traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects.First, the Halper Court bypassed the threshold question:whether the successive punishment at issue is a "criminal"punishment. Instead, it focused on whether the sanction,regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grosslydisproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute "punish-ment." In so doing, the Court elevated a singleKennedyfactor--whether the sanction appeared excessive in relationto its nonpunitive purposes--to dispositive status. But aswe emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should beconsidered controlling as they "may often point in differingdirections." 372 U. S., at 169. The second significant departure in Halper was the Court's decision to "asses[s] thecharacter of the actual sanctions imposed," 490 U. S., at 447,rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the "statuteon its face" to determine whether it provided for whatamounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169.We believe thatHalper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.5 As subsequent5 In his concurrence, Justice Stevens criticizes us for reexamining ourHalper opinion rather than deciding the case on what he believes is thenarrower Blockburger grounds. But the question upon which we grantedcertiorari in this case is "whether imposition upon petitioners of monetaryfines as in personam civil penalties by the Department of the Treasury,together with other sanctions, is `punishment' for purposes of the Double522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN102 HUDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcases have demonstrated, Halper's test for determiningwhether a particular sanction is "punitive," and thus subjectto the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has provedunworkable. We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994);United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).6If a sanction must be "solely" remedial (i. e., entirely nondeterrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause,then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.Under Halper's method of analysis, a court must also look atthe "sanction actually imposed" to determine whether theDouble Jeopardy Clause is implicated. Thus, it will not bepossible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clauseis violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial tojudgment. But in those cases where the civil proceedingfollows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in theface of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbidsthe government from even "attempting a second time topunish criminally." Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasisadded).Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at whichHalper was directed are addressed by other constitutionalJeopardy Clause." Pet. for Cert. i. It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did noteven pass upon the Blockburger question, finding it unnecessary to do so.92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3.6 In Kurth Ranch, we held that the presence of a deterrent purpose oreffect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question. 511 U. S., at 781.Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test, see 511 U. S., at 780-783, beforeconcluding that Montana's dangerous drug tax was "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution," id., at 784. Similarly, inUrsery, we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate theDouble Jeopardy Clause. 518 U. S., at 270-271. We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeituresare civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy. Id., at 292.522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN103Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)Opinion of the Courtprovisions. The Due Process and Equal Protection Clausesalready protect individuals from sanctions which are downright irrational. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,348 U. S. 483 (1955). The Eighth Amendment protectsagainst excessive civil fines, including forfeitures. Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544 (1993); Austin v. UnitedStates, 509 U. S. 602 (1993). The additional protection afforded by extending double jeopardy protections to proceedings heretofore thought to be civil is more than offset bythe confusion created by attempting to distinguish between"punitive" and "nonpunitive" penalties.Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to thefacts of this case, it is clear that the criminal prosecution ofthese petitioners would not violate the Double JeopardyClause. It is evident that Congress intended the OCCmoney penalties and debarment sanctions imposed for violations of 12 U. S. C. $$ 84 and 375b to be civil in nature. Asfor the money penalties, both $$ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), whichauthorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violationsof $$ 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that suchpenalties are "civil." While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating thesanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority toissue debarment orders is conferred upon the "appropriateFederal banking agenc[ies]." $$ 1818(e)(1)-(3). That suchauthority was conferred upon administrative agencies isprima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide fora civil sanction. See Helvering, supra, at 402; United Statesv. Spector, 343 U. S. 169, 178 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting)("Administrative determinations of liability to deportationhave been sustained as constitutional only by consideringthem to be exclusively civil in nature, with no criminal consequences or connotations"); Wong Wing v. United States, 163U. S. 228, 235 (1896) (holding that quintessential criminalpunishments may be imposed only "by a judicial trial").522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN104 HUDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtTurning to the second stage of the Ward test, we find thatthere is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that werequire, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are "so punitive in form and effect as torender them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary." Ursery, supra, at 290. First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment. We have long recognized that "revocation ofa privilege voluntarily granted," such as a debarment, "ischaracteristically free of the punitive criminal element."Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399, and n. 2. Similarly, "the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction whichha[s] been recognized as enforcible by civil proceedings sincethe original revenue law of 1789." Id., at 400.Second, the sanctions imposed do not involve an "affirmative disability or restraint," as that term is normally understood. While petitioners have been prohibited from furtherparticipating in the banking industry, this is "certainly nothing approaching the `infamous punishment' of imprisonment." Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).Third, neither sanction comes into play "only" on a finding ofscienter. The provisions under which the money penaltieswere imposed, 12 U. S. C. $$ 93(b) and 504, allow for the assessment of a penalty against any person "who violates" anyof the underlying banking statutes, without regard to theviolator's state of mind. "Good faith" is considered by OCCin determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed,$ 93(b)(2), but a penalty can be imposed even in the absenceof bad faith. The fact that petitioners' "good faith" was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only to "the statute on its face" to determine whether a penalty is criminalin nature. Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169. Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a "willful" disregard "for thesafety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,"522US1 Unit: $$U9 [02-03-00 12:47:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN105Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)Opinion of the Courtwillfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficientthat the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was "continuing." $ 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposedmay also be criminal (and in this case formed the basis forpetitioners' indictments). This fact is insufficient to renderthe money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292, particularly in the doublejeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688,704 (1993) (rejecting "same-conduct" test for double jeopardy purposes).Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both moneypenalties and debarment sanctions will deter others fromemulating petitioners' conduct, a traditional goal of criminalpunishment. But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "mayserve civil as well as criminal goals." Ursery, supra, at292; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996)("[F]orfeiture . . . serves a deterrent purpose distinct fromany punitive purpose"). For example, the sanctions at issuehere, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serveto promote the stability of the banking industry. To holdthat the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders suchsanctions "criminal" for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government's ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions such as banks.In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothingof the "clearest proof " required by Ward, that OCC moneypenalties and debarment sanctions are criminal. The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to their trial onthe pending indictments, and it may proceed.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the TenthCircuit is accordingly
