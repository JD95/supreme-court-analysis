The issue before us concerns limits upon the damages thata tort plaintiff in admiralty can recover for physical damageto property caused by a defective product. In East River*Steven B. Fisher and Michael H. Williamson filed a brief for All Alaskan Seafoods, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal.Jan S. Amundson, Quentin Riegel, and Gregory S. Gilchrist filed abrief for the National Association of Manufacturers et al. as amici curiaeurging affirmance.520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN877Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)Opinion of the CourtS. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858(1986), the Court held that an admiralty tort plaintiff cannotrecover for the physical damage the defective product causesto the "product itself "; but the plaintiff can recover for physical damage the product causes to "other property." In thiscase all agree that the "product itself " consistsat least of aship as built and outfitted by its original manufacturer andsold to an initial user. This case asks how this corner of tortlaw treats the physical destruction of extra equipment (askiff, a fishing net, spare parts) added by the initial userafter the first sale and then resold as part of the ship whenthe ship itself is later resold to a subsequent user. Is thatadded equipment part of the "product itself," in which casethe plaintiff cannot recover in tort for its physical loss? Oris it "other property," in which case the plaintiff can recover?We conclude that it is "other property." Hence (assumingother tort law requirements are satisfied) admiralty's tortrules permit recovery. IThis case arises out of an engine room fire and flood thatled to the sinking of the fishing vessel M/V Saratoga in January 1986. We must assume that a hydraulic system defec-tively designed by respondent Marco Seattle Inc. was onesignificant cause of the accident. About 15 years before theaccident, respondent J. M. Martinac & Co. had built the ship,installed the hydraulic system, and sold the ship new to Jo-seph Madruga. Madruga then added extra equipment--askiff, a seine net, and various spare parts--and used the shipfor tuna fishing. In 1974, Madruga resold the ship to petitioner, Saratoga Fishing Co., which continued to use the shipfor fishing. In 1987, after the ship caught fire and sank,Saratoga Fishing brought this tort suit in admiralty againstMarco Seattle and J. M. Martinac.The District Court found that the hydraulic system hadbeen defectively designed, and it awarded Saratoga Fishingdamages (adjusted to reflect Saratoga Fishing's own partial520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN878 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.Opinion of the Courtfault). Those damages included damages for the loss of theequipment that Madruga had added after the initial purchaseof the ship.The Ninth Circuit held that the District Court should nothave awarded damages for the added equipment. SaratogaFishing Co. v. Marco Seattle Inc., 69 F. 3d 1432, 1445 (1995).A majority noted that the equipment, though added by Madruga, was part of the ship when Madruga resold the ship toSaratoga Fishing, and, for that reason, the majority held, theadded equipment was part of the defective product that itselfcaused the harm. Applying East River's distinction between the product that itself caused the harm and "otherproperty," the majority concluded that Saratoga Fishingcould not recover in tort for the loss. A dissenting judgebelieved that the "product itself " was the ship whenlaunched into the stream of commerce by Martinac, its origi-nal builder. Consequently, the added equipment was "otherproperty." We granted certiorari to resolve this uncer-tainty about the proper application ofEast River. We nowagree with the dissenting judge.IIThe facts before us show: (1) a Component Supplier who(2) provided a defective component (the hydraulic system)to a Manufacturer, who incorporated it into a manufacturedproduct (the ship), which (3) the Manufacturer sold to anInitial User, who (4) after adding equipment and using theship, resold it to a Subsequent User (Saratoga Fishing).The applicable law is general maritime law, "an amalgam oftraditional common-law rules, modifications of those rules,and newly created rules," drawn from both state and federalsources. East River, supra, at 865; see also Fitzgerald v.United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 20 (1963); Kermarecv. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 630(1959). The context is purely commercial. The particularquestion before us requires us to interpret the Court's deci520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN879Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsion in East River: Does the term "other property," as usedin that case, include the equipment added by the Initial Userbefore he sold the ship to the Subsequent User? We con-clude that it does: When a manufacturer places an item inthe stream of commerce by selling it to an Initial User, thatitem is the "product itself " under East River. Items addedto the product by the Initial User are therefore "other property," and the Initial User's sale of the product to a Subse-quent User does not change these characterizations.East River arose at the intersection of two principles thatgovern recovery in many commercial cases involving defective products. The first principle is that tort law in this areaordinarily (but with exceptions) permits recovery from amanufacturer and others in the initial chain of distributionfor foreseeable physical harm to property caused by productdefects. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 402A (1965);W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser andKeeton on Law of Torts $ 101 (5th ed. 1984); East River, 476U. S., at 867. The second principle is that tort law in thisarea ordinarily (but with exceptions) does not permit recovery for purely economic losses, say, lost profits. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability $ 6, Commentd (Proposed Final Draft, Preliminary Version, Oct. 18, 1996);e. g., Rardin v. T & D Machine Handling, Inc., 890 F. 2d24, 27-30 (CA7 1989). The Court in East River favored thesecond principle, for it held that an injury to the defectiveproduct itself, even though physical, was a kind of "economicloss," for which tort law did not provide compensation. 476U. S., at 871.The Court reasoned that the loss of the value of a productthat suffers physical harm--say, a product that destroys itself by exploding--is very much like the loss of the value ofa product that does not work properly or does not work atall. See id., at 870. In all such cases, the Court held,"[c]ontract law, and the law of warranty in particular, is wellsuited" to setting the responsibilities of a seller of a product520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN880 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.Opinion of the Courtthat fails to perform the function for which it was intended.Id., at 872-873. The commercial buyer and commercialseller can negotiate a contract--a warranty--that will setthe terms of compensation for product failure. If the buyerobtains a warranty, he will receive compensation for theproduct's loss, whether the product explodes or just refusesto start. If the buyer does not obtain a warranty, he willlikely receive a lower price in return. Given the availabilityof warranties, the courts should not ask tort law to performa job that contract law might perform better. Ibid.; Seelyv.White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 18-19, 403 P. 2d 145, 151(1965) (en banc).The Ninth Circuit reasoned that East River required it todefine the defective "product itself " by looking to that whichthe plaintiff had purchased, for that is the product that, inprinciple, the plaintiff could have asked the seller to warrant.Since Saratoga Fishing, the Subsequent User, might haveasked Madruga, the Initial User, to warrant the M/V Saratoga, skiff, nets, and all, that product, skiff, nets, and all,is the "product itself " that stands outside the reach of tortrecovery. In our view, however, this holding pushes EastRiver's principle beyond the boundary set by the principle'srationale.For one thing, the Ninth Circuit's holding creates a tortdamage immunity beyond that set by any relevant tort precedent that we have found. State law often distinguishes between items added to or used in conjunction with a defectiveitem purchased from a Manufacturer (or its distributors) and(following East River) permits recovery for the former whenphysically harmed by a dangerously defective product.Thus the owner of a chicken farm, for example, recovered forchickens killed when the chicken house ventilation systemfailed, suffocating the 140,000 chickens inside. A. J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 333 Md. 245, 634 A.2d 1330 (1994). A warehouse owner recovered for damageto a building caused by a defective roof. United Air Lines,520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN881Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)Opinion of the CourtInc. v. CEI Industries of Ill., Inc., 148 Ill. App. 3d 332, 499N. E. 2d 558 (1986). And a prior case in admiralty (not unlike the one before us) held that a ship charterer, who addsexpensive seismic equipment to the ship, may recover for itsloss in a fire caused by a defective engine. Nicor SupplyShips Assocs. v. General Motors Corp., 876 F. 2d 501 (CA51989). Indeed, respondents here conceded that, had the shipremained in the hands of the Initial User, the loss of theadded equipment could have been recovered in tort. SeeTr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. We have found no suggestion instate (or in federal) law that these results would change witha subsequent sale--that is, we have found no case, other thanthe Ninth Circuit case before us, that suggests that thecourts would deny recovery to a subsequent chicken farmer,who had later purchased the farm, chickens, coop, ventilationsystem, and all.Indeed, the denial of recovery for added equipment simplybecause of a subsequent sale makes the scope of a manufacturer's liability turn on what seems, in one important respect, a fortuity, namely, whether a defective product causesforeseeable physical harm to the added equipment before orafter an Initial User (who added the equipment) resells theproduct to a Subsequent User. One important purpose ofdefective-product tort law is to encourage the manufactureof safer products. The various tort rules that determinewhich foreseeable losses are recoverable aim, in part, to provide appropriate safe-product incentives. And a liabilityrule that diminishes liability simply because of some suchresale is a rule that, other things being equal, diminishesthat basic incentive. That circumstance requires a justification. That is to say, why should a series of resales, afterreplacement and additions of ever more physical items, progressively immunize a manufacturer to an ever greater extent from the liability for foreseeable physical damage thatwould otherwise fall upon it?520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN882 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.Opinion of the CourtThe East River answer to this question--because the par-ties can contract for appropriate sharing of the risks ofharm--is not as satisfactory in the context of resale after aninitial use. That is because, as other courts have suggested,the Subsequent User does not contract directly with themanufacturer (or distributor). Cf. Peterson v. Idaho FirstNat. Bank, 117 Idaho 724, 727, 791 P. 2d 1303, 1306 (1990);Tillman v. Vance Equipment Co., 286 Ore. 747, 755-756, 596P. 2d 1299, 1304 (1979). Moreover, it is likely more difficultfor a consumer--a commercial user and reseller--to offer anappropriate warranty on the used product he sells akin to amanufacturer's (or distributor's) warranty of the initial product. The user/reseller did not make (or initially distribute)the product and, to that extent, he normally would knowless about the risks that such a warranty would involve. Cf.Tillman, supra, at 755, 596 P. 2d, at 1303-1304; Peterson,supra, at 726-727, 791 P. 2d, at 1305-1306. That is to say, itwould seem more difficult for a reseller to warrant, say, aship's engine; as time passes, the ship ages, the ship undergoes modification, and it passes through the hands of usersand resellers.Of course, nothing prevents a user/reseller from offering awarranty. But neither does anything prevent a Manufacturer and an Initial User from apportioning through theircontract potential loss of any other items--say, added equipment or totally separate physical property--that a defectivemanufactured product, say, an exploding engine, might cause.No court has thought that the mere possibility of such a contract term precluded tort recovery for damage to an InitialUser's other property. Similarly, in the absence of a showing that it is ordinary business practice for user/resellers tooffer a warranty comparable to those typically provided bysellers of new products, the argument for extending EastRiver, replacing tort law with contract law, is correspondingly weak. That is to say, respondents have not explainedwhy the ordinary rules governing the manufacturer's tort520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN883Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)Opinion of the Courtliability should be supplanted merely because the user/reseller may in theory incur an overlapping liability incontract.Respondents make two other important arguments.First, they say that our reasoning proves too much. Theyargue that, if a Subsequent User can recover for damage adefective manufactured product causes to property added bythe Initial User, then a user might recover for damage adefective component causes the manufactured product, otherthan the component itself. Saratoga Fishing, for example,could recover the damage the defective hydraulic systemcaused to any other part of the ship. But the lower courts,followingEast River, have held that it is not a componentpart, but the vessel--as placed in the stream of commerceby the manufacturer and its distributors--that is the "prod-uct" that itself caused the harm. SeeShipco 2295, Inc. v.Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 825 F. 2d 925, 928 (CA5 1987); seealso,e. g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v.Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., 107 Nev. 535, 539-542, 815P. 2d 601, 604-605 (1991). As the Court said inEast River:" `Since all but the very simplest of machines have com-ponent parts, [a contrary] holding would require a finding of "property damage" in virtually every case wherea product damages itself. Such a holding would eliminate the distinction between warranty and strict prod-ucts liability.' " 476 U. S., at 867 (quotingNorthernPower & Engineering Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co.,623 P. 2d 324, 330 (Alaska 1981)).Our holding here, however, does not affect this rule, forthe relevant relations among initial users, manufacturers,and component suppliers are typically different from thoseat issue here. Initial users, when they buy, typically depend upon, and likely seek warranties that depend upon, amanufacturer's primary business skill, namely, the assemblyof workable product components into a marketable whole.520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN884 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.Opinion of the CourtKing v. Hilton-Davis, 855 F. 2d 1047, 1052 (CA3 1988);Shipco 2295, supra, at 929; National Union Fire Ins., supra,at 541, 815 P. 2d, at 605. Moreover, manufacturers and com-ponent suppliers can allocate through contract potential liability for a manufactured product that does not work,thereby ensuring that component suppliers have appropriateincentives to prevent component defects that might destroythe product. King, supra, at 1054; cf. Shipco 2295, supra, at930. There is no reason to think that initial users systematically control the manufactured product's quality or, as wehave said, systematically allocate responsibility for useradded equipment, in similar ways. Regardless, the case lawdoes suggest a distinction between the components added toa product by a manufacturer before the product's sale to auser, e. g., Airlift Int'l, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 685F. 2d 267 (CA9 1982); King, supra; Shipco 2295, supra; andthose items added by a user to the manufactured product,e. g., Nicor Supply Ships Assocs. v. General Motors Corp.,876 F. 2d 501 (CA5 1989); and we would maintain thatdistinction.Second, respondents argue that our holding would imposetoo great a potential tort liability upon a manufacturer or adistributor. But we do not see how that is so. For onething, a host of other tort principles, such as foreseeability,proximate cause, and the "economic loss" doctrine, alreadydo, and would continue to, limit liability in important ways.For another thing, where such principles are satisfied, liability would exist anyway had the manufactured product simplyremained in the hands of the Initial User. Our holdingmerely maintains liability, for equipment added after the initial sale, despite the presence of a resale by the Initial User.We conclude that equipment added to a product after theManufacturer (or distributor selling in the initial distributionchain) has sold the product to an Initial User is not partof the product that itself caused physical harm. Rather,in East River's language, it is "other property." (We are520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN885Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)Scalia, J., dissentingspeaking, of course, of added equipment that itself played nocausal role in the accident that caused the physical harm.)Thus the extra skiff, nets, spare parts, and miscellaneousequipment at issue here, added to the ship by a user afteran initial sale to that Initial User, are not part of the product(the original ship with the defective hydraulic system) thatitself caused the harm.The decision of the Ninth Circuit is
