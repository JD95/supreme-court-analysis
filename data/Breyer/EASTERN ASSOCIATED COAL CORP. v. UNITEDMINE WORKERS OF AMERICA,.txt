A labor arbitrator ordered an employer to reinstate an employee truck driver who had twice tested positive for marijuana. The question before us is whether considerationsof public policy require courts to refuse to enforce that arbitration award. We conclude that they do not. The courtsmay enforce the award. And the employer must reinstate,rather than discharge, the employee.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Air TransportAssociation of America et al. by John J. Gallagher and Neal D. Mollen;for the Equal Employment Advisory Council by Robert E. Williams andAnn Elizabeth Reesman; for Exxon Mobile Corp. by Walter E. Dellingerand John F.

MINE WORKERSOpinion of the CourtIPetitioner, Eastern Associated Coal Corp., and respond-ent, United Mine Workers of America, are parties to acollective-bargaining agreement with arbitration provisions.The agreement specifies that, in arbitration, in order to discharge an employee, Eastern must prove it has "just cause."Otherwise the arbitrator will order the employee reinstated.The arbitrator's decision is final. App. 28-31.James Smith worked for Eastern as a member of a roadcrew, a job that required him to drive heavy trucklike vehi-cles on public highways. As a truck driver, Smith was subject to Department of Transportation (DOT) regulationsrequiring random drug testing of workers engaged in"safety-sensitive" tasks. 49 CFR $$ 382.301, 382.305 (1999).In March 1996, Smith tested positive for marijuana.Eastern sought to discharge Smith. The union went to arbi-tration, and the arbitrator concluded that Smith's positivedrug test did not amount to "just cause" for discharge. In-stead the arbitrator ordered Smith's reinstatement, providedthat Smith (1) accept a suspension of 30 days without pay,(2) participate in a substance-abuse program, and (3) undergodrug tests at the discretion of Eastern (or an approvedsubstance-abuse professional) for the next five years.Between April 1996 and January 1997, Smith passedfour random drug tests. But in July 1997 he again testedpositive for marijuana. Eastern again sought to dischargeSmith. The union again went to arbitration, and the arbitrator again concluded that Smith's use of marijuana did notamount to "just cause" for discharge, in light of two mitigating circumstances. First, Smith had been a good employeefor 17 years. App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-27a. And, second,Smith had made a credible and "very personal appeal underoath . . . concerning a personal/family problem which causedthis one time lapse in drug usage." Id., at 28a.The arbitrator ordered Smith's reinstatement providedthat Smith (1) accept a new suspension without pay, this time531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 531 U. S. 57 (2000)Opinion of the Courtfor slightly more than three months; (2) reimburse Easternand the union for the costs of both arbitration proceedings;(3) continue to participate in a substance-abuse program; (4)continue to undergo random drug testing; and (5) provideEastern with a signed, undated letter of resignation, to takeeffect if Smith again tested positive within the next fiveyears. Id., at 29a.Eastern brought suit in federal court seeking to have thearbitrator's award vacated, arguing that the award contra-vened a public policy against the operation of dangerous machinery by workers who test positive for drugs. 66 F. Supp.2d 796 (SDWV 1998). The District Court, while recognizinga strong regulation-based public policy against drug use byworkers who perform safety-sensitive functions, held thatSmith's conditional reinstatement did not violate that policy.Id., at 804-805. And it ordered the award's enforcement.Id., at 805.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed onthe reasoning of the District Court. 188 F. 3d 501, 1999 WL635632 (1999) (unpublished). We granted certiorari in lightof disagreement among the Circuits. Compareid., at **1(holding that public policy does not prohibit "reinstatementof employees who have used illegal drugs in the past"), with,e. g., Exxon Corp. v. Esso Workers' Union, Inc., 118 F. 3d841, 852 (CA1 1997) (holding that public policy prohibits en-forcement of a similar arbitration award). We now affirmthe Fourth Circuit's determination.IIEastern claims that considerations of public policy makethe arbitration award unenforceable. In considering thisclaim, we must assume that the collective-bargaining agree-ment itself calls for Smith's reinstatement. That is becauseboth employer and union have granted to the arbitrator theauthority to interpret the meaning of their contract's language, including such words as "just cause." See Steelwork531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN62 EASTERN ASSOCIATED COAL CORP. v. MINE WORKERSOpinion of the Courters v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 599(1960). They have "bargained for" the "arbitrator's construction" of their agreement. Ibid. And courts will setaside the arbitrator's interpretation of what their agreementmeans only in rare instances. Id., at 596. Of course, an ar-bitrator's award "must draw its essence from the contractand cannot simply reflect the arbitrator's own notions of industrial justice." Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29,38 (1987). "But as long as [an honest] arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting withinthe scope of his authority," the fact that "a court is convincedhe committed serious error does not suffice to overturn hisdecision." Ibid.; see also Enterprise Wheel, supra, at 596(the "proper" judicial approach to a labor arbitration awardis to "refus[e] . . . to review the merits"). Eastern does notclaim here that the arbitrator acted outside the scope of hiscontractually delegated authority. Hence we must treat thearbitrator's award as if it represented an agreement betweenEastern and the union as to the proper meaning of the contract's words "just cause." See St. Antoine, Judicial Reviewof Labor Arbitration Awards: A Second Look at EnterpriseWheel and Its Progeny, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1137, 1155 (1977).For present purposes, the award is not distinguishable fromthe contractual agreement.We must then decide whether a contractual reinstatementrequirement would fall within the legal exception that makesunenforceable "a collective-bargaining agreement that is contrary to public policy." W. R. Grace & Co. v. Rubber Workers, 461 U. S. 757, 766 (1983). The Court has made clear thatany such public policy must be "explicit," "well defined," and"dominant." Ibid. It must be "ascertained `by referenceto the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.' " Ibid. (quotingMuschany v. United States, 324 U. S. 49, 66 (1945)); accord,Misco, supra, at 43. And, of course, the question to be answered is not whether Smith's drug use itself violates public531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 531 U. S. 57 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpolicy, but whether the agreement to reinstate him does so.To put the question more specifically, does a contractualagreement to reinstate Smith with specified conditions, seeApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29a, run contrary to an explicit, welldefined, and dominant public policy, as ascertained by refer-ence to positive law and not from general considerations ofsupposed public interests? See Misco, supra, at 43.IIIEastern initially argues that the District Court erred byasking, not whether the award is "contrary to" public policy"as ascertained by reference" to positive law, but whetherthe award "violates" positive law, a standard Eastern says istoo narrow. We believe, however, that the District Courtcorrectly articulated the standard set out in W. R. Grace andMisco, see 66 F. Supp. 2d, at 803 (quoting Misco, supra, at43), and applied that standard to reach the right result.We agree, in principle, that courts' authority to invoke thepublic policy exception is not limited solely to instanceswhere the arbitration award itself violates positive law.Nevertheless, the public policy exception is narrow and mustsatisfy the principles set forth in W. R. Grace and Misco.Moreover, in a case like the one before us, where two political branches have created a detailed regulatory regime in aspecific field, courts should approach with particular cautionpleas to divine further public policy in that area.Eastern asserts that a public policy against reinstatementof workers who use drugs can be discerned from an examina-tion of that regulatory regime, which consists of the OmnibusTransportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and DOT's im-plementing regulations. The Testing Act embodies a congressional finding that "the greatest efforts must be ex-pended to eliminate the . . . use of illegal drugs, whether onor off duty, by those individuals who are involved in [certainsafety-sensitive positions, including] the operation of . . .trucks." Pub. L. 102-143, $ 2(3), 105 Stat. 953. The Act531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 EASTERN ASSOCIATED COAL CORP. v. MINE WORKERSOpinion of the Courtadds that "increased testing" is the "most effective deter-rent" to "use of illegal drugs." $ 2(5). It requires theSecretary of Transportation to promulgate regulationsrequiring "testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of a controlled substance." 49 U. S. C.$ 31306(b)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. III). It mandates suspension of those operators who have driven a commercial motorvehicle while under the influence of drugs. 49 U. S. C.$ 31310(b)(1)(A) (requiring suspension of at least one year fora first offense); $ 31310(c)(2) (requiring suspension of at least10 years for a second offense). And DOT's implementingregulations set forth sanctions applicable to those who testpositive for illegal drugs. 49 CFR $ 382.605 (1999).In Eastern's view, these provisions embody a strong publicpolicy against drug use by transportation workers in safetysensitive positions and in favor of random drug testing inorder to detect that use. Eastern argues that reinstatementof a driver who has twice failed random drug tests wouldundermine that policy--to the point where a judge must setaside an employer-union agreement requiring reinstatement.Eastern's argument, however, loses much of its force whenone considers further provisions of the Act that make clearthat the Act's remedial aims are complex. The Act says that"rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program," $ 2(7), 105 Stat. 953, that rehabilitation "should bemade available to individuals, as appropriate," ibid., andthat DOT must promulgate regulations for "rehabilitationprograms," 49 U. S. C. $ 31306(e). The DOT regulationsspecifically state that a driver who has tested positive fordrugs cannot return to a safety-sensitive position until (1)the driver has been evaluated by a "substance abuse professional" to determine if treatment is needed, 49 CFR$ 382.605(b) (1999); (2) the substance-abuse professional hascertified that the driver has followed any rehabilitationprogram prescribed, $ 382.605(c)(2)(i); and (3) the driver haspassed a return-to-duty drug test, $ 382.605(c)(1). In addi531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 531 U. S. 57 (2000)Opinion of the Courttion, (4) the driver must be subject to at least six randomdrug tests during the first year after returning to the job.$ 382.605(c)(2)(ii). Neither the Act nor the regulations for-bid an employer to reinstate in a safety-sensitive position anemployee who fails a random drug test once or twice. Thecongressional and regulatory directives require only that theabove-stated prerequisites to reinstatement be met.Moreover, when promulgating these regulations, DOT de-cided not to require employers either to provide rehabilitation or to "hold a job open for a driver" who has tested posi-tive, on the basis that such decisions "should be left tomanagement/driver negotiation." 59 Fed. Reg. 7502 (1994).That determination reflects basic background labor lawprinciples, which caution against interference with labormanagement agreements about appropriate employee discipline. See, e. g., California Brewers Assn. v. Bryant, 444U. S. 598, 608 (1980) (noting that it is "this Nation's longstanding labor policy" to give "employers and employees thefreedom through collective bargaining to establish conditionsof employment").We believe that these expressions of positive law embodyseveral relevant policies. As Eastern points out, these policies include Testing Act policies against drug use by employees in safety-sensitive transportation positions and in favorof drug testing. They also include a Testing Act policy favoring rehabilitation of employees who use drugs. And therelevant statutory and regulatory provisions must be readin light of background labor law policy that favors determination of disciplinary questions through arbitration whenchosen as a result of labor-management negotiation.The award before us is not contrary to these several policies, taken together. The award does not condone Smith'sconduct or ignore the risk to public safety that drug use bytruck drivers may pose. Rather, the award punishes Smithby suspending him for three months, thereby depriving himof nearly $9,000 in lost wages, Record Doc. 29, App. A, p. 2;531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 EASTERN ASSOCIATED COAL CORP. v. MINE WORKERSOpinion of the Courtit requires him to pay the arbitration costs of both sides; itinsists upon further substance-abuse treatment and testing;and it makes clear (by requiring Smith to provide a signedletter of resignation) that one more failed test meansdischarge.The award violates no specific provision of any law or regulation. It is consistent with DOT rules requiring completion of substance-abuse treatment before returning to work,see 49 CFR $ 382.605(c)(2)(i) (1999), for it does not precludeEastern from assigning Smith to a non-safety-sensitive position until Smith completes the prescribed treatment program. It is consistent with the Testing Act's 1-year and10-year driving license suspension requirements, for thoserequirements apply only to drivers who, unlike Smith, actually operated vehicles under the influence of drugs. See 49U. S. C. $$ 31310(b), (c). The award is also consistent withthe Act's rehabilitative concerns, for it requires substanceabuse treatment and testing before Smith can return towork.The fact that Smith is a recidivist--that he has failed drugtests twice--is not sufficient to tip the balance in Eastern'sfavor. The award punishes Smith more severely for his second lapse. And that more severe punishment, which included a 90-day suspension, would have satisfied even a "recidivist" rule that DOT once proposed but did not adopt--arule that would have punished two failed drug tests, not withdischarge, but with a driving suspension of 60 days. 57 Fed.Reg. 59585 (1992). Eastern argues that DOT's withdrawalof its proposed rule leaves open the possibility that dischargeis the appropriate penalty for repeat offenders. That argument fails, however, because DOT based its withdrawal, notupon a determination that a more severe penalty wasneeded, but upon a determination to leave in place, as the"only driving prohibition period for a controlled substancesviolation," the "completion of rehabilitation requirements531US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-13-02 14:40:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 531 U. S. 57 (2000)concurring in judgmentand a return-to-duty test with a negative result." 59 Fed.Reg. 7493 (1994).Regarding drug use by persons in safety-sensitive posi-tions, then, Congress has enacted a detailed statute. AndCongress has delegated to the Secretary of Transporta-tion authority to issue further detailed regulations on thatsubject. Upon careful consideration, including public noticeand comment, the Secretary has done so. Neither Congressnor the Secretary has seen fit to mandate the discharge ofa worker who twice tests positive for drugs. We hesitateto infer a public policy in this area that goes beyond thecareful and detailed scheme Congress and the Secretaryhave created.We recognize that reasonable people can differ as towhether reinstatement or discharge is the more appropriate remedy here. But both employer and union haveagreed to entrust this remedial decision to an arbitrator.We cannot find in the Act, the regulations, or any other lawor legal precedent an "explicit," "well defined," "dominant"public policy to which the arbitrator's decision "runs contrary." Misco, 484 U. S., at 43; W. R. Grace, 461 U. S., at766. We conclude that the lower courts correctly rejectedEastern's public policy claim. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals is
