This case concerns a congressional statute "recogniz[ing]and affirm[ing]" the "inherent" authority of a tribe to bringa criminal misdemeanor prosecution against an Indian whois not a member of that tribe--authority that this Court previously held a tribe did not possess. Compare 25 U. S. C.$ 1301(2) withDuro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676 (1990). We mustdecide whether Congress has the constitutional power torelax restrictions that the political branches have, over time,placed on the exercise of a tribe's inherent legal authority.We conclude that Congress does possess this power.IRespondent Billy Jo Lara is an enrolled member of theTurtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in north-centralNorth Dakota. He married a member of a different tribe,the Spirit Lake Tribe, and lived with his wife and childrenon the Spirit Lake Reservation, also located in North Da-kota. See Brief for Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae 4-5. After several incidents ofserious misconduct, the Spirit Lake Tribe issued an orderexcluding him from the reservation. Lara ignored theorder; federal officers stopped him; and he struck one of thearresting officers. 324 F. 3d 635, 636 (CA8 2003) (en banc).The Spirit Lake Tribe subsequently prosecuted Lara inthe Spirit Lake Tribal Court for "violence to a policeman."Ibid. Lara pleaded guilty and, in respect to that crime,served 90 days in jail. See ibid.; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.gress of American Indians by Carter G. Phillips, Virginia A. Seitz, andRiyaz A.

S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the CourtAfter Lara's tribal conviction, the Federal Governmentcharged Lara in the Federal District Court for the Districtof North Dakota with the federal crime of assaulting a fed-eral officer. 324 F. 3d, at 636; 18 U. S. C. $ 111(a)(1). Keyelements of this federal crime mirror elements of the tribalcrime of "violence to a policeman." See Brief for UnitedStates 7. And this similarity between the two crimes wouldordinarily have brought Lara within the protective reachof the Double Jeopardy Clause. U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (theGovernment may not "subject" any person "for the same of-fence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb"); 324 F. 3d,at 636. But the Government, responding to Lara's claimof double jeopardy, pointed out that the Double JeopardyClause does not bar successive prosecutions brought by separate sovereigns, and it argued that this "dual sovereignty"doctrine determined the outcome here. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88 (1985) (the Double Jeopardy Clausereflects the "common-law conception of crime as an offenseagainst the sovereignty of the government"; when "a defendant in a single act violates the `peace and dignity' of twosovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committedtwo distinct `offences' ").The Government noted that this Court has held that anIndian tribe acts as a separate sovereign when it prosecutesits own members. United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,318, 322-323 (1978) (a tribe's "sovereign power to punishtribal offenders," while subject to congressional "defeasance," remains among those " `inherent powers of a limitedsovereignty which has never been extinguished' " (emphasis added and deleted)). The Government recognized, ofcourse, that Lara is not one of the Spirit Lake Tribe's ownmembers; it also recognized that, in Duro v. Reina, supra,this Court had held that a tribe no longer possessed inherentor sovereign authority to prosecute a "nonmember Indian."Id., at 682. But it pointed out that, soon after this Courtdecided Duro, Congress enacted new legislation specifically541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN198 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the Courtauthorizing a tribe to prosecute Indian members of a differ-ent tribe. See Act of Nov. 5, 1990, $$ 8077(b)-(d), 104 Stat.1892-1893 (temporary legislation until September 30, 1991);Act of Oct. 28, 1991, 105 Stat. 646 (permanent legislation).That new statute, in permitting a tribe to bring certaintribal prosecutions against nonmember Indians, does notpurport to delegate the Federal Government's own federalpower. Rather, it enlarges the tribes' own " `powers of self-government' " to include "the inherent power of Indiantribes, hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise criminaljurisdiction overall Indians," including nonmembers. 25U. S. C. $ 1301(2) (emphasis added).In the Government's view, given this statute, the Tribe,in prosecuting Lara, had exercised its own inherent tribalauthority, not delegated federal authority; hence the "dualsovereignty" doctrine applies, Heath, supra, at 88; and sincethe two prosecutions were brought by two different sovereigns, the second, federal, prosecution does not violate theDouble Jeopardy Clause.The Federal Magistrate Judge accepted the Government'sargument and rejected Lara's double jeopardy claim. 324F. 3d, at 636-637. An Eighth Circuit panel agreed with theMagistrate Judge. 294 F. 3d 1004 (2002). But the en bancCourt of Appeals, by a vote of 7 to 4, reached a differentconclusion. 324 F. 3d 635 (2003). It held the Tribal Court,in prosecuting Lara, was exercising a federal prosecutorialpower; hence the "dual sovereignty" doctrine does not apply;and the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the second prosecution.Id., at 640. The four dissenting judges, agreeing with theFederal Government, concluded that the Tribal Court hadexercised inherent tribal power in prosecuting Lara; hencethe "dual sovereignty" doctrine applies and allows the second, federal, prosecution. Id., at 641 (opinion of M. Arnold,J.).Because the Eighth Circuit and Ninth Circuit havereached different conclusions about the new statute, we541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN199Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the Courtgranted certiorari. Cf. United States v. Enas, 255 F. 3d 662(CA9 2001) (en banc), cert. denied, 534 U. S. 1115 (2002). Wenow reverse the Eighth Circuit.IIWe assume, as do the parties, that Lara's double jeopardyclaim turns on the answer to the "dual sovereignty" question. What is "the source of [the] power to punish" nonmember Indian offenders, "inherent tribal sovereignty" ordelegated federal authority? Wheeler, supra, at 322 (emphasis added).We also believe that Congress intended the former answer.The statute says that it "recognize[s] and affirm[s]" in eachtribe the "inherent" tribal power (not delegated federalpower) to prosecute nonmember Indians for misdemeanors.See supra, at 198; Appendix, infra (emphasis added). Andthe statute's legislative history confirms that such was Congress' intent. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-261,pp. 3-4 (1991) ("The Committee of the Conference notes that. . . this legislation is not a delegation of this jurisdiction buta clarification of the status of tribes as domestic dependentnations"); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 102-61, p. 7 (1991); see alsoS. Rep. No. 102-168, p. 4 (1991) ("recogniz[ing] and reaffirm[ing] the inherent authority of tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians"); 137 Cong. Rec.9446 (1991) (remarks of Sen. Inouye) (the "premise [of thelegislation] is that the Congress affirms the inherent jurisdiction of tribal governments over nonmember Indians" (emphasis added)); id., at 10712-10714 (remarks of Rep. Miller,House manager of the bill) (the statute "is not a delegationof authority but an affirmation that tribes retain all rightsnot expressly taken away" and the bill "recognizes an inherent tribal right which always existed"); id., at 10713 (remarks of Rep. Richardson, a sponsor of the amendment) (thelegislation "reaffirms" tribes' power).541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN200 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the CourtThus the statute seeks to adjust the tribes' status. It relaxes the restrictions, recognized in Duro, that the politicalbranches had imposed on the tribes' exercise of inherentprosecutorial power. The question before us is whether theConstitution authorizes Congress to do so. Several considerations lead us to the conclusion that Congress does possessthe constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes'criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians as the statuteseeks to do.First, the Constitution grants Congress broad generalpowers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers thatwe have consistently described as "plenary and exclusive."E. g., Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 470-471 (1979); Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U. S. 99, 103 (1993); see Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 323;see also W. Canby, American Indian Law 2 (3d ed. 1998)(hereinafter Canby) ("[T]he independence of the tribes issubject to exceptionally great powers of Congress to regulate and modify the status of the tribes").This Court has traditionally identified the Indian Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, and the TreatyClause, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2, as sources of that power. E. g.,Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 552 (1974); McClanahanv. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, 172, n. 7 (1973); seealso Canby 11-12; F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal IndianLaw 209-210 (1982 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen) (also mentioning,inter alia, the Property Clause). The "central function ofthe Indian Commerce Clause," we have said, "is to provideCongress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs." Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490U. S. 163, 192 (1989); see also, e. g., Ramah Navajo SchoolBd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 458 U. S. 832, 837(1982) ("broad power" under the Indian Commerce Clause);White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142(1980) (same, and citing Wheeler, supra, at 322-323).541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThe treaty power does not literally authorize Congress toact legislatively, for it is an Article II power authorizing thePresident, not Congress, "to make Treaties." U. S. Const.,Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2. But, as Justice Holmes pointed out, treaties made pursuant to that power can authorize Congress todeal with "matters" with which otherwise "Congress couldnot deal." Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 433 (1920);see also L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the U. S. Constitu-tion 72 (2d ed. 1996). And for much of the Nation's history,treaties, and legislation made pursuant to those treaties, gov-erned relations between the Federal Government and theIndian tribes. See, e. g., Cohen 109-111; F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years 44-49 (1962).We recognize that in 1871 Congress ended the practice ofentering into treaties with the Indian tribes. 25 U. S. C. $ 71(stating that tribes are not entities "with whom the UnitedStates may contract by treaty"). But the statute saved existing treaties from being "invalidated or impaired," ibid.,and this Court has explicitly stated that the statute "in noway affected Congress' plenary powers to legislate on problems of Indians," Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194, 203(1975) (emphasis deleted).Moreover, "at least during the first century of America'snational existence . . . Indian affairs were more an aspectof military and foreign policy than a subject of domestic ormunicipal law." Cohen 208 (footnotes omitted). Insofar asthat is so, Congress' legislative authority would rest in part,not upon "affirmative grants of the Constitution," but uponthe Constitution's adoption of preconstitutional powers necessarily inherent in any Federal Government, namely, powers that this Court has described as "necessary concomitantsof nationality." United States v. Curtiss-Wright ExportCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 315-322 (1936); Henkin, supra, at 14-22,63-72; cf. 2 J. Continental Cong. 174-175 (1775) (W. Ford ed.1905) (creating departments of Indian affairs, appointing Indian commissioners, and noting the great importance of "se541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN202 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the Courtcuring and preserving the friendship of the Indian Nations");Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 557 (1832) ("The treatiesand laws of the United States contemplate . . . that all inter-course with [Indians] shall be carried on exclusively by thegovernment of the union").Second, Congress, with this Court's approval, has interpreted the Constitution's "plenary" grants of power as authorizing it to enact legislation that both restricts and, inturn, relaxes those restrictions on tribal sovereign authority.From the Nation's beginning Congress' need for such legisla-tive power would have seemed obvious. After all, the Government's Indian policies, applicable to numerous tribes withdiverse cultures, affecting billions of acres of land, of necessity would fluctuate dramatically as the needs of the Nationand those of the tribes changed over time. See, e. g., Cohen48. And Congress has in fact authorized at different timesvery different Indian policies (some with beneficial resultsbut many with tragic consequences). Congressional policy,for example, initially favored "Indian removal," then "assimilation" and the breakup of tribal lands, then protection of thetribal land base (interrupted by a movement toward greaterstate involvement and "termination" of recognized tribes);and it now seeks greater tribal autonomy within the framework of a "government-to-government relationship" withfederal agencies. 59 Fed. Reg. 22951 (1994); see also 19Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 98 (1983) (President Reagan reaffirming the rejection of termination as a policy and announcing the goal of decreasing tribal dependence on theFederal Government); see 25 U. S. C. $ 450a(b) (congressionalcommitment to "the development of strong and stable tribalgovernments"). See generally Cohen 78-202 (describingthis history); Canby 13-32 (same).Such major policy changes inevitably involve majorchanges in the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty. The1871 statute, for example, changed the status of an Indiantribe from a "powe[r] . . . capable of making treaties" to a541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the Court"power with whom the United States may [not] contractby treaty." CompareWorcester, supra, at 559, with 25U. S. C. $ 71.One can readily find examples in congressional decisions torecognize, or to terminate, the existence of individual tribes.SeeUnited States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419 (1866) ("If by[the political branches] those Indians are recognized as atribe, this court must do the same"); Menominee Tribe v.United States, 391 U. S. 404 (1968) (examining the rights ofMenominee Indians following the termination of their Tribe).Indeed, Congress has restored previously extinguishedtribal status--by re-recognizing a Tribe whose tribal existence it previously had terminated. 25 U. S. C. $$ 903-903f(restoring the Menominee Tribe); cf. United States v. Long,324 F. 3d 475 (CA7) (upholding against double jeopardy challenge successive prosecutions by the restored MenomineeTribe and the Federal Government), cert. denied, 540 U. S.822 (2003). Congress has advanced policies of integrationby conferring United States citizenship upon all Indians. 8U. S. C. $ 1401(b). Congress has also granted tribes greaterautonomy in their inherent law enforcement authority (in respect to tribal members) by increasing the maximum criminal penalties tribal courts may impose. $ 4217, 100 Stat.3207-146, codified at 25 U. S. C. $ 1302(7) (raising the maximum from "a term of six months and a fine of $500" to"a term of one year and a fine of $5,000").Third, Congress' statutory goal--to modify the degree ofautonomy enjoyed by a dependent sovereign that is not aState--is not an unusual legislative objective. The politicalbranches, drawing upon analogous constitutional authority,have made adjustments to the autonomous status of othersuch dependent entities--sometimes making far more radicaladjustments than those at issue here. See, e. g., Hawaii--Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197, 209-211 (1903) (describingannexation of Hawaii by joint resolution of Congress and themaintenance of a "Republic of Hawaii" until formal incorpo541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN204 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the Courtration by Congress); Northern Mariana Islands--note fol-lowing 48 U. S. C. $ 1801 ("in accordance with the [UnitedNations] trusteeship agreement . . . [establishing] a self-governing commonwealth . . . in political union with andunder the sovereignty of the United States"); the Philip-pines--22 U. S. C. $ 1394 (congressional authorization for thePresident to "withdraw and surrender all right of . . . sovereignty" and to "recognize the independence of the PhilippineIslands as a separate and self-governing nation"); Presidential Proclamation No. 2695, 60 Stat. 1352 (so proclaiming);Puerto Rico--Act of July 3, 1950, 64 Stat. 319 ("[T]his Act isnow adopted in the nature of a compact so that people ofPuerto Rico may organize a government pursuant to a constitution of their own adoption"); P. R. Const., Art. I, $ 1("Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico"); see also Cordova & Simonpietri Ins. Agency Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank N. A., 649 F. 2d 36, 39-41 (CA1 1981) (describingvarious adjustments to Puerto Rican autonomy through congressional legislation since 1898).Fourth, Lara points to no explicit language in the Constitution suggesting a limitation on Congress' institutional authority to relax restrictions on tribal sovereignty previouslyimposed by the political branches. But cf. Part III, infra.Fifth, the change at issue here is a limited one. It concerns a power similar in some respects to the power to prosecute a tribe's own members--a power that this Court hascalled "inherent." Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 322-323. In largepart it concerns a tribe's authority to control events thatoccur upon the tribe's own land. See United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975) ("Indian tribes are uniqueaggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over boththeir members and their territory" (emphasis added)); seealso, e. g., S. Rep. No. 102-168, at 21 (remarks of P. Hugen).And the tribes' possession of this additional criminal jurisdiction is consistent with our traditional understanding ofthe tribes' status as "domestic dependent nations." Chero541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN205Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the Courtkee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831); see also id., at 16(describing tribe as "a distinct political society, separatedfrom others, capable of managing its own affairs and govern-ing itself "). Consequently, we are not now faced with aquestion dealing with potential constitutional limits on con-gressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes intribal status. In particular, this case involves no interference with the power or authority of any State. Nor do wenow consider the question whether the Constitution's DueProcess or Equal Protection Clauses prohibit tribes fromprosecuting a nonmember citizen of the United States. SeePart III, infra.Sixth, our conclusion that Congress has the power to relaxthe restrictions imposed by the political branches on thetribes' inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent withour earlier cases. True, the Court held in those cases thatthe power to prosecute nonmembers was an aspect of thetribes' external relations and hence part of the tribal sovereignty that was divested by treaties and by Congress.Wheeler, supra, at 326; Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435U. S. 191, 209-210 (1978); Duro, 495 U. S., at 686. But theseholdings reflect the Court's view of the tribes' retained sovereign status as of the time the Court made them. Theydid not set forth constitutional limits that prohibit Congressfrom changing the relevant legal circumstances, i. e., fromtaking actions that modify or adjust the tribes' status.To the contrary, Oliphant and Duro make clear that theConstitution does not dictate the metes and bounds of tribalautonomy, nor do they suggest that the Court shouldsecond-guess the political branches' own determinations. InOliphant, the Court rested its conclusion about inherenttribal authority to prosecute tribe members in large partupon "the commonly shared presumption of Congress, theExecutive Branch, and lower federal courts," a presumption which, "[w]hile not conclusive[,] carries considerableweight." 435 U. S., at 206. The Court pointed out that541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN206 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the Court" `Indian law' draws principally upon the treaties drawn andexecuted by the Executive Branch andlegislation passedby Congress." Ibid. (emphasis added). It added that those"instruments . . . form the backdrop for the intricate web ofjudicially made Indian law." Ibid. (emphasis added).Similarly, inDuro, the Court drew upon a host of differentsources in order to reach its conclusion that a tribe does notpossess the inherent power to prosecute a nonmember. TheCourt referred to historic practices, the views of experts, theexperience of forerunners of modern tribal courts, and thepublished opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of theInterior. 495 U. S., at 689-692. See also, e. g., Nevada v.Hicks, 533 U. S. 353, 361, n. 4 (2001) ("Our holding in Worcester must be considered in light of . . . the 1828 treaty" (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); South Dakotav. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679, 695 (1993) ("Having concludedthat Congress clearly abrogated the Tribe's pre-existing regulatory control over non-Indian hunting and fishing, we findno evidence in the relevant treaties or statutes that Congressintended to allow the Tribes to assert regulatory jurisdictionover these lands pursuant to inherent sovereignty" (emphasis added)); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. CrowTribe, 471 U. S. 845, 855-856 (1985) ("[T]he existence andextent of a tribal court's jurisdiction will require [inter alia]a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions"); United States v. Kagama, 118U. S. 375, 382-383 (1886) (characterizing Ex parte Crow Dog,109 U. S. 556, 570 (1883), as resting on extant treaties andstatutes and recognizing congressional overruling of CrowDog).Thus, the Court in these cases based its descriptions ofinherent tribal authority upon the sources as they existedat the time the Court issued its decisions. Congressionallegislation constituted one such important source. And thatsource was subject to change. Indeed Duro itself antici541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN207Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the Courtpated change by inviting interested parties to "address theproblem [to] Congress." 495 U. S., at 698.We concede that Duro, like several other cases, referredonly to the need to obtain a congressional statute that "delegated" power to the tribes. See id., at 686 (emphasis added);Bourland, supra, at 695, n. 15; Montana v. United States,450 U. S. 544, 564 (1981); Mazurie, 419 U. S., at 556-557.But in so stating,Duro (like the other cases) simply did notconsider whether a statute, like the present one, could constitutionally achieve the same end by removing restrictions onthe tribes' inherent authority. Consequently we do not readany of these cases as holding that the Constitution forbidsCongress to change "judicially made" federal Indian lawthrough this kind of legislation. Oliphant, supra, at 206;cf. County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226, 233-237 (1985) (recognizing the "federal commonlaw" component of Indian rights, which "common law" federal courts develop as "a `necessary expedient' when Con-gress has not `spoken to aparticular issue' " (quoting Mil-waukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 313-315 (1981))); id., at 313("[F]ederal common law is `subject to the paramount author-ity of Congress' " (quoting New Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S.336, 348 (1931))).Wheeler, Oliphant, and Duro, then, are not determinativebecause Congress has enacted a new statute, relaxing re-strictions on the bounds of the inherent tribal authority thatthe United States recognizes. And that fact makes all thedifference.IIILara makes several additional arguments. First, hepoints out that the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat.77, lacks certain constitutional protections for criminal de-fendants, in particular the right of an indigent defendant tocounsel. See 25 U. S. C. $ 1302. And he argues that theDue Process Clause forbids Congress to permit a tribe toprosecute a nonmember Indian citizen of the United States541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN208 UNITED STATES v. LARAOpinion of the Courtin a forum that lacks this protection. See Argersinger v.Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972) (Constitution guarantees indigents counsel where imprisonment possible).Lara's due process argument, however, suffers from a critical structural defect. To explain the defect, we contrast thisargument with Lara's "lack of constitutional power" argument discussed in Part II, supra. Insofar as that "constitutional power" argument might help Lara win his doublejeopardy claim, it must proceed in four steps:Step One: Congress does not possess the constitutionalpower to enact a statute that modifies tribal power by "recogniz[ing] and affirm[ing]" the tribes' "inherent" authorityto prosecute nonmember Indians. 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2).Step Two: Consequently, the word "inherent" in the statute's phrase "inherent power" is void.Step Three: The word "inherent" is severable from the restof the statute (as are related words). The remainder of thestatute is valid without those words, but it then delegatesfederal power to the tribe to conduct the prosecution.Step Four: Consequently, the Tribe's prosecution of Larawas federal. The current, second, prosecution is also federal. Hence Lara wins his Double Jeopardy Clause claim,the subject of the present proceeding.Although the Eighth Circuit accepted this argument, 324F. 3d, at 640, we reject Step One of the argument, PartII, supra. That rejection, without more, invalidates theargument.Lara's due process argument, however, is significantly different. That argument (if valid) would show that anyprosecution of a nonmember Indian under the statute is invalid; so Lara's tribal prosecution would be invalid, too.Showing Lara's tribal prosecution was invalid, however, doesnot show that the source of that tribal prosecution was federal power (showing that a state prosecution violated theDue Process Clause does not make that prosecution federal).541US1 Unit: $U37 [05-08-06 20:51:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 541 U. S. 193 (2004)Opinion of the CourtBut without that "federal power" showing, Lara cannot winhis double jeopardy claim here. Hence, we need not, and weshall not, consider the merits of Lara's due process claim.Other defendants in tribal proceedings remain free to raisethat claim should they wish to do so. See 25 U. S. C. $ 1303(vesting district courts with jurisdiction over habeas writsfrom tribal courts).Second, Lara argues that Congress' use of the words "allIndians," in the statutory phrase "inherent power . . . to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians," violates theEqual Protection Clause. He says that insofar as the wordsinclude nonmember Indians within the statute's scope (whileexcluding all non-Indians) the statute is race based and without justification. Like the due process argument, however,this equal protection argument is simply beside the point,therefore we do not address it. At best for Lara, the argument (if valid) would show, not that Lara's first convictionwas federal, but that it was constitutionally defective. Andthat showing cannot help Lara win his double jeopardyclaim.Third, Lara points out that the Duro Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, for example, theguarantee of an indigent's right to counsel, as an importantreason for concluding that tribes lacked the "inherentpower" to try a "group of citizens" (namely, nonmember Indians) who were not "include[d]" in those "political bodies."495 U. S., at 693-694. In fact, Duro says the following: "Wehesitate to adopt a view of tribal sovereignty that wouldsingle out another group of citizens, nonmember Indians, fortrial by political bodies that do not include them."
