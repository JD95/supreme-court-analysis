This case asks us to decide whether a federal court maydismiss a first federal habeas petition for general "equitable"reasons beyond those embodied in the relevant statutes,Federal Habeas Corpus Rules, and prior precedents. Wedecide that the Court of Appeals erred in doing so in thiscase. The primary "equitable" consideration favoring dismissal of the "eleventh hour" petition before us is seriousdelay. A Federal Habeas Corpus Rule deals specificallywith delay. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(a) (permittingcourts to dismiss a habeas petition when "it appears that thestate . . . has been prejudiced in its ability to respond . . . bydelay in its filing"). And, in our view, this Rule, not somegeneral "equitable" power to create exceptions to the Rule,should have determined whether or not the petition's dismissal was appropriate. IPetitioner Larry Lonchar was sentenced to death for mur-der nine years ago. He filed this "eleventh hour" petition517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT317Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Courtfor habeas corpus--his first federal habeas corpus petition--on June 28, 1995, the day of his scheduled execution. Tounderstand the procedural significance of this petition, thenature of the delay here at issue, and other relevant specialfeatures of this case, we must consider the petition in thecontext of earlier proceedings, which, for ease of exposition,we divide into five stages:Stage One: Trial, Appeal, Execution Date: 1987-1990. In1987, Lonchar was convicted in state court for murderingthree people and sentenced to death by electrocution. Amandatory state-court appeal led to affirmance of the conviction and sentence in 1988. The trial judge then issued adeath warrant for the week of March 23, 1990. Throughoutthese proceedings Lonchar said he wanted to die and refusedto cooperate with his lawyer or to attend his trial. He alsoattempted (unsuccessfully) to waive his mandatory appeal,declined to authorize any collateral attacks on his convictionor sentence, and wrote the trial judge asking for an execution date.Stage Two: Sister's "Next Friend" Habeas: March 1990-February 1993. Two days before the scheduled execution,Lonchar's sister, Chris Kellog, filed a "next friend" habeaspetition in state court, claiming Lonchar was incompetent.Lonchar opposed the action and eventually the state and federal courts, at trial and appellate levels, held that Loncharwas competent and dismissed the petition. The state courtsagain issued a death warrant, this time for the week of February 24, 1993.Stage Three: Lonchar's own State Habeas: February 1993-May 1995. After Lonchar's lawyer told him that hisbrother, Milan, was threatening to kill himself because ofLonchar's execution, Lonchar authorized a habeas petition instate court and obtained a stay of execution. He subsequently changed his mind and told the judge he did not wantto proceed. Although his lawyers objected that Loncharwas incompetent to make this decision, the judge dismissed517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT318 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtthe petition without prejudice. A death warrant was issuedfor the week of June 23, 1995.Stage Four: Brother's "Next Friend" Habeas: June 20-June 23, 1995. Three days before the scheduled execution,Lonchar's brother, Milan, filed another "next friend" habeaspetition in state court. Lonchar again opposed it. Withinthree days, Milan's petition met the same fate as his sister'searlier petition. That is to say, federal and state courts, attrial and appellate levels, all found Lonchar competent anddenied the petition.Stage Five: Lonchar's Current Habeas: June 23, 1995-Present. Immediately thereafter, after discussions with hislawyers, Lonchar filed another state habeas petition containing 22 claims, including one that challenged the method ofexecution. He told the state-court judge that he wished topursue each of the 22 claims, but was litigating them only todelay his execution, with the hope that the State wouldchange the execution method to lethal injection so he coulddonate his organs. The state courts stayed the executionbriefly, and then, two days later, denied the petition.Lonchar immediately filed his first federal habeas petition,which set forth the same 22 claims.The State asked that Lonchar's federal petition be dismissed, stressing what it called Lonchar's "inequitable conduct" in waiting almost six years, and until the last minute,to file a federal habeas petition. The District Court heldthat this could not constitute an independent basis for rejecting the petition. In its view, Habeas Corpus Rule 9, notsome generalized equitable authority to dismiss, governedthe case. And, it held, Rule 9's authority to dismiss for"abuse of the writ" applied to "second or successive" habeaspetitions, not to a first petition, such as Lonchar's. See Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b) ("A second or successive petition maybe dismissed if . . . the judge finds that the failure of thepetitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ") (emphasis added). The District517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT319Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the CourtCourt therefore granted a stay to permit time for consider-ation of the State's other grounds in its motion to dismiss.The next day the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir-cuit vacated the stay. 58 F. 3d 590 (1995). It pointed outthat the District Court had "based its holding exclusivelyon Rule 9."Id., at 592. It held that "equitable doctrinesindependent of Rule 9" applied, relying chiefly on thisCourt's per curiam order in Gomez v. United States Dist.Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992). 58F. 3d, at 593. And, setting aside the Rules and traditionalhabeas doctrines, the court concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, "Lonchar does not merit equitable re-lief."Ibid.As mentioned above, we granted certiorari in order to consider whether a federal court may, in such circumstances,dismiss a valid first habeas petition for "equitable reasons"other than reasons listed in federal statutes and Rules, orwell established in this Court's precedents.IIWe first discuss a preliminary matter. We have before usa Court of Appeals order that vacates a stay, not an order todismiss the habeas petition. We believe, however, that thisfact makes no difference. That is, the Court of Appealsorder vacating the stay is lawful only if dismissal of the peti-tion would have been lawful. By bringing about Lonchar'sexecution, vacating the stay would prevent the courts fromconsidering the petition's merits, just as would its dismissal.This Court has previously considered, in a slightly differ-ent context, whether a court may allow a first federal habeaspetition to be mooted by an execution, even though the courtlacked the authority to dispose of the petition on the merits.In Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983), the Court consid-ered the proper standard for granting or denying a staypending consideration of an appeal from a dismissal of a firstfederal habeas petition. The Court stated:517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT320 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the Court"When a certificate of probable cause is issued by thedistrict court, as it was in this case, or later by the courtof appeals, petitioner must then be afforded an opportu-nity to address the merits, and the court of appeals isobligated to decide the merits of the appeal. Accord-ingly, a court of appeals, where necessary to prevent thecase from becoming moot by the petitioner's execution,should grant a stay of execution pending disposition ofan appeal when a condemned prisoner obtains a certifi-cate of probable cause on his initial habeas appeal."Id.,at 893-894.We believe that the same principle applies when a districtcourt is faced with a request for a stay in a first federalhabeas case: If the district court cannot dismiss the petitionon the merits before the scheduled execution, it is obligatedto address the merits and must issue a stay to prevent thecase from becoming moot. That is, if the district court lacksauthority to directly dispose of the petition on the merits, itwould abuse its discretion by attempting to achieve the sameresult indirectly by denying a stay. Of course, a districtcourt is authorized to dismiss a petition summarily when "itplainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibitsannexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief inthe district court," Habeas Corpus Rule 4, just as a court ofappeals is not required to address an appeal that fails to meetthe certificate of probable cause standard of a "substantialshowing of the denial of a federal right," see Barefoot, 463U. S., at 893-894. And, as is also true of consideration ofappeals, a district court may, within the constraints ofdue process, expedite proceedings on the merits. Id., at894-895.In this case, Lonchar's claims certainly seem substantialenough to prevent dismissal under Rule 4, and the State doesnot argue to the contrary. That being so, we believe thatthe District Court and Court of Appeals were correct to as517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsume that Lonchar could not be denied a stay unless his petition was properly subject to dismissal. See App. 62, 63-64;58 F. 3d, at 593.The concurrence argues that the Court's decision in Gomezv. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal.,supra, displaced the rationale of Barefoot, relying particularly on the statement that a "court may consider the lastminute nature of an application to stay execution in decidingwhether to grant equitable relief." 503 U. S., at 654. Theconcurrence understands this statement to authorize denialof a stay, for generalized equitable reasons, in first federalhabeas cases, even when the district court lacks authority todismiss the petition on the merits. We do not believe thissentence, or the rest of the Court's order in Gomez, supportsthis conclusion.First, Gomez did not involve denial of a stay in a case inwhich the lower court had no authority to dismiss the petition. Instead, as the concurrence concedes, post, at 338, thecase could have been dismissed as an "abuse of the writ."See 503 U. S., at 653-654. Second, Gomez involved a fifthattempt to secure collateral review, not a first habeas petition. Barefoot indicated that stays in "[s]econd and successive federal habeas corpus petitions present a differentissue," since in such cases it is more likely that " `a condemned inmate might attempt to use repeated petitions andappeals as a mere delaying tactic,' " and because this dangeris specially recognized and addressed in the Habeas CorpusRules. Barefoot, supra, at 895. Finally, the concurrence'sreading of Gomez seriously conflicts with Barefoot's wellsettled treatment of first habeas petitions. We decline toadopt such a far-reaching interpretation of this per curiamorder, especially since Gomez did not concern a first habeaspetition, and since the Gomez order did not discuss (or evencite) Barefoot, much less explicitly repudiate its rationale.517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT322 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the CourtIIIWe turn, then, to the main question: Could the Court ofAppeals properly dismiss this first habeas petition for specialad hoc "equitable" reasons not encompassed within theframework of Rule 9? We conclude that it could not.First, the history of the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus re-veals, not individual judges dismissing writs for ad hoc reasons, but, rather, the gradual evolution of more formal judi-cial, statutory, or rules-based doctrines of law. See,e. g.,McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 479-489 (1991); Barefoot,supra, at 892; Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 451 (1986)(plurality opinion); Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 15(1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313 (1963). In earlier times, the courts followed comparatively simple rules,even occasionally disregarding complex procedural doctrines, such as res judicata, see McCleskey, supra, at 479, asthey exercised the writ in light of its most basic purpose,avoiding serious abuses of power by a government, say aking's imprisonment of an individual without referring thematter to a court. See, e. g., L. Yackle, Postconviction Rem-edies $ 4, pp. 9-11 (1981); W. Duker, A Constitutional Historyof Habeas Corpus 4-6 (1980); W. Church, A Treatise on theWrit of Habeas Corpus $$ 1-46, pp. 2-40 (2d ed. 1893). Asthe writ has evolved into an instrument that now demandsnot only conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, seeIn re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 756-758 (1888), but also applicationof basic constitutional doctrines of fairness, see Jones v.Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236, 243 (1963), Congress, the Rulewriters, and the courts have developed more complex procedural principles that regularize and thereby narrow the dis-cretion that individual judges can freely exercise. Thoseprinciples seek to maintain the courts' freedom to issue thewrit, aptly described as the "highest safeguard of liberty,"Smith v. Bennett, 365 U. S. 708, 712 (1961), while at the sametime avoiding serious, improper delay, expense, complexity,and interference with a State's interest in the "finality" of517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT323Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Courtits own legal processes. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,698 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissentingin part); McCleskey, supra, at 490-492; Reed v. Ross, 468U. S. 1, 10 (1984). These legal principles are embodied instatutes, rules, precedents, and practices that control thewrit's exercise. Within constitutional constraints they re-flect a balancing of objectives (sometimes controversial),which is normally for Congress to make, but which courtswill make when Congress has not resolved the question.See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 632-633 (1993).Second, the fact that the writ has been called an "equitable" remedy, see, e. g., Gomez, supra, at 653-654, does notauthorize a court to ignore this body of statutes, rules, andprecedents. "There is no such thing in the Law, as Writs ofGrace and Favour issuing from the Judges." Opinion onthe Writ of Habeas Corpus, Wilm. 77, 87, 97 Eng. Rep. 29,36 (1758) (Wilmot, J.). Rather, "courts of equity must begoverned by rules and precedents no less than the courts oflaw." Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (Thomas,J., concurring). See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422U. S. 405, 417 (1975); The Federalist No. 78, p. 528 (J. Cookeed. 1961). As Selden pointed out so many years ago, thealternative is to use each equity chancellor's conscience as ameasure of equity, which alternative would be as arbitraryand uncertain as measuring distance by the length of eachchancellor's foot. See 1 J. Story, Commentaries on EquityJurisprudence 16 (13th ed. 1886).That is why this Court, in McCleskey, said that concernabout habeas petition abuses has led to "a complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled byhistorical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions." 499 U. S., at 489 (emphasis added). And it is whythis Court, in McCleskey, also reaffirmed the importance," `in order to preclude individualized enforcement of the Constitution in different parts of the Nation,' " of " `lay[ing] downas specifically as the nature of the problem permits the517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT324 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtstandards or directions that should govern the DistrictJudges in the disposition of applications for habeas corpusby prisoners under sentence of State Courts.' " Id., at 496(quotingBrown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 501-502 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)).After all, equitable rules that guide lower courts reduceuncertainty, avoid unfair surprise, minimize disparate treatment of similar cases, and thereby help all litigants, includingthe State, whose interests in "finality" such rules often further. See Barefoot, 463 U. S., at 892; Kuhlmann, supra, at451;Townsend, supra, at 313. See also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991) (barring consideration of claimsprocedurally defaulted in state court absent cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice); Teague v. Lane,489 U. S. 288, 299-316 (1989) (plurality opinion) (barringfrom habeas proceedings federal claims based on certain"new rules" of constitutional law); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S.509, 522 (1982) ("[A] district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims").And the arguments against ad hoc departure from settledrules would seem particularly strong when dismissal of afirst habeas petition is at issue. Dismissal of a first federalhabeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writentirely, risking injury to an important interest in humanliberty. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 95 (1869) (the writ"has been for centuries esteemed the best and only sufficientdefence of personal freedom"); Withrow, supra, at 700(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (decisions involving limitation of habeas relief "warrant restraint"). Even in the context of "second and successive"petitions--which pose a greater threat to the State's interests in "finality" and are less likely to lead to the discoveryof unconstitutional punishments--this Court has createdcareful rules for dismissal of petitions for abuse of the writ.See McCleskey, supra.517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT325Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThis is not to say that a district court has no discretionin dealing with first federal habeas petitions. The HabeasCorpus Rules themselves provide district courts with amplediscretionary authority to tailor the proceedings to disposequickly, efficiently, and fairly of first habeas petitions thatlack substantial merit, while preserving more extensive proceedings for those petitions raising serious questions. Forinstance, as noted above, the Rules permit a district court todismiss summarily a first petition without waiting for theState's response if "it plainly appears from the face of thepetition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner isnot entitled to relief." Habeas Corpus Rule 4. Moreover,even if the petition cannot be dismissed under that standard,the district court is still authorized to "take such other actionas the judge deems appropriate." Ibid. The AdvisoryCommittee's Note makes clear that this provision was"designed to afford the judge flexibility in a case whereeither dismissal or an order to answer may be inappropriate. For example, the judge may want to authorizethe respondent to make a motion to dismiss based uponinformation furnished by respondent, which may showthat petitioner's claims have already been decided on themerits in a federal court; that petitioner has failed toexhaust state remedies; that the petitioner is not in custody within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254; or that adecision in the matter is pending in state court. Inthese situations, a dismissal may be called for on proce-dural grounds, which may avoid burdening the respondent with the necessity of filing an answer on the substan-tive merits of the petition. In other situations, thejudge may want to consider a motion from respondentto make the petition more certain. Or the judge maywant to dismiss some allegations in the petition, requir-ing the respondent to answer only those claims whichappear to have some arguable merit." 28 U. S. C.,p. 478.517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT326 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the CourtThe Rules also afford the district court substantial discretionin the conduct of a case once an answer has been ordered.It may decide to order expansion of the record to facilitate adisposition on the merits without the need for an evidentiaryhearing. Habeas Corpus Rule 7. Discovery is availableonly if "the judge in the exercise of his discretion and forgood cause shown grants leave." Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a).And the district court is afforded a degree of discretion indetermining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing. SeeHabeas Corpus Rule 8(a); Townsend, 372 U. S., at 318;Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992). Thus,the district court is afforded substantial discretion to expe-dite proceedings, cf.Barefoot, supra, at 894-895, in orderquickly to dispose of meritless first petitions while at thesame time preserving the important right of those raisingserious habeas questions to have their claims thoroughlyconsidered by the district court.Third, a specific federal Habeas Corpus Rule, Rule 9(a),directly addresses the primary factor--delay--that led theCourt of Appeals to dismiss the petition for "equitable reasons." That Rule says:"Delayed petitions. A petition may be dismissed if itappears that the state of which the respondent is an of-ficerhas been prejudiced in its ability to respond to thepetition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner showsthat it is based on grounds of which he could not havehad knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligencebefore the circumstances prejudicial to the state oc-curred." (Emphasis added.)The Rule applies because Lonchar's petition is a "delayedpetition." And the language of the Rule requires, as a condition of dismissal, a finding of "prejudice," which the District Court was not asked to, and did not, make. (Becausethe State specifically disavows reliance upon Rule 9(a), wedo not consider what would constitute sufficient "prejudice"517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT327Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Courtto justify application of the Rule in the context of a last-minute habeas petition.) Instead, it asked the Court ofAppeals to develop an equitable rule under which a "peti-tion may be dismissed" for "delay in its filing"without theprejudice precondition.But the history of the Rule makes plain that the prejudicerequirement represents a critical element in the balancing ofinterests undertaken by Congress and the framers of theRule which courts may not undermine through the exerciseof background equitable powers. See Bank of Nova Scotiav.United States, 487 U. S. 250, 255 (1988) ("The balancestruck by the Rule between societal costs and the rights ofthe accused may not casually be overlooked `because a courthas elected to analyze the question under the supervisorypower ' " (quoting United States v. Payner, 447 U. S. 727, 736(1980)). The Advisory Committee's Note indicates that thevery maxim upon which the Court of Appeals relied as authority for acting outside the Rules--the equitable maximthat "the petitioner's conduct may . . . disentitle him to relief," 58 F. 3d, at 592--was taken into account when theRule's framers drafted Rule 9(a) and included its prejudicerequirement. See Advisory Committee's Note on HabeasCorpus Rule 9, 28 U. S. C., p. 484. Moreover, Congress,when considering a draft of the Rule, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2074,directly focused upon the prejudice requirement and rejected, by removing from the draft Rule, a provision thatwould have eased the burden of the prejudice requirementby presuming prejudice after a delay of five years. Compare Rules of Procedure: Communication from the ChiefJustice of the United States Transmitting Rules and FormsGoverning Proceedings Under Sections 2254 and 2255 ofTitle 28, H. R. Doc.

THOMASOpinion of the Court(Even in an area, such as exhaustion, where judges have con-siderable discretionary authority, "appropriate deference toCongress' power to prescribe the basic procedural schemeunder which a claim may be heard in a federal court requiresfashioning of exhaustion principles in a manner consistentwith congressional intent and any applicable statutoryscheme").We recognize there is considerable debate about whetherthe present Rule properly balances the relevant competinginterests. See, e. g., U. S. Judicial Conference, Ad Hoc Com-mittee on Federal Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Committee Report and Proposal 6, 18-21 (1989) (hereinafter PowellReport) (suggesting a statute of limitations for habeas petitions); American Bar Association, Toward a More Just andEffective System of Review in State Death Penalty Cases29-30 (1990) (hereinafter ABA Report) (same). But, to debate the present Rule's effectiveness is to affirm, not to deny,its applicability. Moreover, that debate's focus upon Congress also reveals the institutional inappropriateness ofamending the Rule, in effect, through an ad hoc judicialexception, rather than through congressional legislation orthrough the formal rulemaking process. See Vasquez v.Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986) ("[D]espite many attemptsin recent years, Congress has yet to create a statute of limitations for federal habeas corpus actions. We should notlightly create a new judicial rule . . . to achieve the sameend") (citation omitted); Appendix to this opinion (listingmore than 80 bills that have proposed a statute of limitationsfor federal habeas cases since Vasquez, none of which hasbeen adopted).Fourth, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, we donot believe that this Court, in Gomez v. United StatesDist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992),authorized ad hoc equitable departures from the HabeasCorpus Rules. The Court of Appeals relied heavily on thestatement:517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT329Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Court"Even if we were to assume, however, that Harriscould avoid the application of McCleskey to bar hisclaim, we would not consider it on the merits. Whetherhis claim is framed as a habeas petition or as a [42U. S. C.] $ 1983 action, Harris seeks an equitable rem-edy."Id., at 653-654.But, this statement, understood in context, does not meanthat this Court authorized setting aside the Habeas CorpusRules and refusing to consider a first habeas petition forgeneralized "equitable" reasons. As we explained above,Gomez was not a first habeas petition. Harris, after bring-ing four habeas petitions, argued that he still could raise a"method of execution" claim in a last-minute $ 1983 action, towhich habeas rules, likeMcCleskey's abuse of the writ doc-trine, would not apply. The quoted sentence simply saysthat these rules would apply, even if $ 1983 were also aproper vehicle for his "method of execution" claim, sinceHarris was still seeking equitable relief and the equitablerationale underlyingMcCleskey's abuse of the writ doc-trine--avoiding, among other things, "last-minute attemptsto manipulate the judicial process," 503 U. S., at 654; Mc-Cleskey, 499 U. S., at 484-485, 491-493--would apply to asuit challenging the method of execution, regardless of thetechnical form of action.Gomez did not, and did not purportto, work a significant change in the law applicable to thedismissal of first habeas petitions.Fifth, the fact that Lonchar filed his petition at the "eleventh hour" does not lead to a different conclusion. Werecognize that the Court in Gomez said that "[a] court mayconsider the last-minute nature of an application to stayexecution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief."503 U. S., at 654. And this Court has made similar state-ments in other cases. See,e. g., Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S.333, 341, n. 7 (1992) ( judge may resolve doubts against petitioners who "delay their filings until the last minute with aview to obtaining a stay because the district court will lack517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT330 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the Courttime to give them the necessary consideration before thescheduled execution");Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 425-426 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring).These statements do not help the State, however, for theyall involve "second or successive" habeas petitions. TheRules specifically authorize dismissal of those petitions for"abuse of the writ." Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b). See also 28U. S. C. $ 2244(b) (authorizing dismissal when "the applicanthas . . . deliberately withheld the newly asserted groundorotherwise abused the writ") (emphasis added). McCleskeygives content to the notion of "abuse of the writ," as do thecases just mentioned. These statements, therefore, reflectan effort to follow and to apply the Habeas Corpus Rules,not an effort to develop law outside the Rules.Indeed, to try to devise some sensible way of supplementing first federal habeas petition rules with ad hoc equitabledevices would prove difficult. As we discussed, supra, at324, the interest in permitting federal habeas review of afirst petition is quite strong. And, given the importanceof a first federal habeas petition, it is particularly important that any rule that would deprive inmates of all accessto the writ should be both clear and fair. As two prominentbodies charged with developing proposals for habeas lawreform have pointed out, developing fair and effective rulesto minimize the harms created by last-minute petitions incapital cases is quite complicated, requiring considerationof issues such as the State's control over setting execution dates, the time needed to exhaust state remedies, thecommon practice of substituting specialized capital counselfor habeas, and the time needed by habeas counsel to investigate claims, some of which (such as ineffective assistanceof counsel) often cannot be raised on direct appeal.

S. 314 (1996)Opinion of the Courtvirtually every level, the execution is imminent"); PowellReport 1 ("[P]risoners often cannot obtain qualified counseluntil execution is imminent"). These bodies, consequently,have proposed a comprehensive set of interrelated changes,see ABA Report 5-39; Powell Report 5-7, as have recentlegislative proposals. See, e. g., H. R. 3, 104th Cong., 1stSess. (1995); H. R. 729, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); H. R.2703, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); S. 3, 104th Cong., 1st Sess.(1995); S. 623, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); S. 735, 104thCong., 1st Sess. (1995). This complexity offers a practicalcaution against a judicial attempt, outside the framework ofthe Habeas Corpus Rules, to fashion similar reforms concerning first federal habeas petitions.Sixth, the special circumstances in this case--other thandelay--do not warrant a different result. The earlier habeas petitions brought by Lonchar's sister and brother arebeside the point. Lonchar did not assert his claims in thoseproceedings, nor did he conspire with his siblings to delayhis execution. To the contrary, he opposed their petitionsand prevailed in his opposition. See App. 22, 35, 48. These"next friend" petitions neither aggravate nor mitigateLonchar's delay in filing his own petition during those sixyears.Lonchar's filing and later withdrawal of his own statehabeas petition would seem similarly beside the point. Atmost, the assertion and withdrawal of that petition wouldcreate a potential ground for a state-law procedural bar to asecond state petition, which, in certain circumstances, mightalso prevent litigation of similar claims in federal court. SeeColeman, 501 U. S., at 729-732. The State (despite itsapparent agreement to Lonchar's withdrawal of the statepetition "without prejudice," see App. 34, 161-163) hasasserted just such a bar. It is free to litigate the matteron remand.Nor do we believe that Lonchar's motive for filing this federal habeas petition can make a critical difference. Lonchar517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT332 LONCHAR v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtdid say that he filed this petition to delay his execution withthe hope that the State would change its execution method.But Lonchar's petition also requested the traditional habeasrelief of a new trial or resentencing, App. 362, and he toldthe District Court specifically that he had considered eachand every claim and wanted the court to hear them. Normally courts will not look behind an action that states a validlegal claim on its face in order to try to determine the comparative weight a litigant places on various subjective reasons for bringing the claim. A valid antitrust complaint orenvironmental action, for example, does not suddenly becomeinvalid simply because the litigant is subjectively indifferentabout receiving the requested equitable relief, but insteadprimarily wants to please his or her family or obtain revenge.More importantly, litigation about a petitioner's subjectivemotivations risks adding to the complexity of habeas litigation, asking a subjective question (about the petitioner's truemotives) that is often unanswerable and the very asking ofwhich may encourage and reward the disingenuous. SeeMurray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 487 (1986) (rejecting a subjective test for determining "cause" for procedural default, inpart because under such a rule "federal habeas courts wouldroutinely be required to hold evidentiary hearings to determine what prompted counsel's failure to raise the claim inquestion").In sum, we believe that this case should have been examined within the framework of the Habeas Corpus Rules andsettled precedents, not according to generalized equitableconsiderations outside that framework. We, of course, express no view about the proper outcome of the application ofthe Rules.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
