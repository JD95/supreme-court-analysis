A State may tax a proportionate share of the income of anondomiciliary corporation that carries out a particular business both inside and outside that State. Allied-Signal, Inc.v.Director, Div. of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768, 772 (1992). TheState, however, may not tax income received by a corporation from an " ` "unrelated business activity" ' which consti-tutes a ` "discrete business enterprise." ' " Id., at 773 (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S.207, 224 (1980), in turn quoting Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 442, 439 (1980)). Cali-fornia's rules for taxing its share of a multistate corporation'sincome authorize a deduction for interest expense. Butthey permit (with one adjustment) use of that deductiononlyto the extent that the amount exceeds certain out-of-stateincome arising from the unrelated business activity of a dis-crete business enterprise, i. e., income that the State couldnot otherwise tax. We must decide whether those rules vio-late the Constitution's Due Process and Commerce Clauses.We conclude that they do. IThe legal issue is less complicated than may first appear,as examples will help to show. California, like many otherStates, uses what is called a "unitary business" income-calculation system for determining its taxable share of amultistate corporation's business income. In effect, thatsystem first determines the corporation's total income fromits nationwide business. During the years at issue, it thenaveraged three ratios--those of the firm's California prop-erty, payroll, and sales to total property, payroll, and sales--to make a combined ratio. Cal.

S. 458 (2000)Opinion of the Court$$ 25128, 25129, 25132, 25134 (West 1979). Finally, it mul-tiplies total income by the combined ratio. The result is"California's share," to which California then applies itscorporate income tax. If, for example, an Illinois tin canmanufacturer, doing business in California and elsewhere,earns $10 million from its total nationwide tin can sales, andif California's formula determines that the manufacturerdoes 10% of its business in California, then California willimpose its income tax upon 10% of the corporation's tin canincome, $1 million.The income of which California taxes a percentage isconstitutionally limited to a corporation's "unitary" income.Unitary income normally includes all income from a corporation's business activities, but excludes income that "derive[s]from unrelated business activity which constitutes a discretebusiness enterprise," Allied-Signal, 504 U. S., at 773 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we have said, this latter"nonunitary" income normally is not taxable by any Stateexcept the corporation's State of domicile (and the Statesin which the "discrete enterprise" carries out its business).Ibid.Any income tax system must have rules for determiningthe amount of net income to be taxed. California's system,like others, basically does so by asking the corporation toadd up its gross income and then deduct costs. One of thecosts that California permits the corporation to deduct isinterest expense. The statutory language that authorizesthat deduction--the language here at issue--contains an important limitation. It says that the amount of "interest deductible" shall be the amount by which "interest expenseexceeds interest and dividend income . . . not subject to allocation by formula," i. e., the amount by which the interestexpense exceeds the interest and dividends that the nondomiciliary corporation has received from nonunitary businessor investment. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code Ann. $ 24344 (West1979) (emphasis added); Appendix, infra. Suppose the Illi528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN462 HUNT-WESSON, INC. v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtnois tin can manufacturer has interest expense of $150,000;and suppose it receives $100,000 in dividend income from anonunitary New Zealand sheep-farming subsidiary. Califor-nia's rule authorizes an interest deduction, not of $150,000,but of $50,000, for the deduction is allowed only insofar asthe interest expense "exceeds" this other unrelated income.Other language in the statute makes the matter a littlemore complex. One part makes clear that, irrespective ofnonunitary income, the corporation may use the deductionagainst unitary interest income that it earns. $ 24344.This means that if the Illinois tin can manufacturer hasearned $100,000 from tin can related interest, say, interestpaid on its tin can receipt bank accounts, the manufacturercan use $100,000 of its interest expense deduction to offsetthat interest income (though it would still lose the remaining$50,000 of deduction because of income from the NewZealand sheep farm). Another part provides an exceptionto the extent that the subsidiary paying the dividend haspaid taxes to California. $$ 24344, 24402. If the sheep farmwere in California, not New Zealand (or at least to the extentit were taxable in California), the tin can manufacturerwould not lose the deduction. We need not consider eitherof these complications here.One final complication involves a dispute between the parties over the amount of interest expense that the Californiastatute at issue covers. Hunt-Wesson, Inc., claims that California (at least during the years at issue here) required interstate corporations first to determine what part of their interest expense was for interest related to the unitary businessand what part was for interest related to other, nonunitarymatters. It says that the statute then required it to put thelatter to the side, so that only interest related to the unitarybusiness was at issue. California agrees that the form itprovided to corporations during the years at issue did workthis way, but states that the form did not interpret the statute correctly. In its view, the statute takes all interest ex528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 528 U. S. 458 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpense into account. Apparently California now believesthat, if the tin can manufacturer had $100,000 interest expense related to its tin can business, and another $50,000interest expense related to the New Zealand sheep farm (say,money borrowed to buy shares in the farm), then California'sstatute would count a total interest expense of $150,000, allof which California would permit it to deduct from its uni-tary tin can business income if, for example, it had no nonunitary New Zealand sheep farm income in that particularyear. This matter, arguably irrelevant to the tax years herein question (Hunt-Wesson reported no nonunitary interestexpense), is also irrelevant to our legal result. Therefore,we need not consider this particular dispute further.The question before us then is reasonably straightforward:Does the Constitution permit California to carve out an ex-ception to its interest expense deduction, which it measuresby the amount of nonunitary dividend and interest incomethat the nondomiciliary corporation has received? Petitioner, Hunt-Wesson, Inc., is successor in interest to a non-domiciliary corporation. That corporation incurred interestexpense during the years at issue. California disallowed thededuction for that expense insofar as the corporation hadreceived relevant nonunitary dividend and interest income.Hunt-Wesson challenged the constitutional validity of thedisallowance. The California Court of Appeal found it con-stitutional, No. A079969 (Dec. 11, 1998), App. 54; see alsoPacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 7 Cal. 3d 544,498 P. 2d 1030 (1972) (upholding statute), and the CaliforniaSupreme Court denied review, App. 67. We granted certio-rari to consider the question.IIRelevant precedent makes clear that California's rule vio-lates the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the FederalConstitution. In Container Corp. of America v. FranchiseTax Bd., 463 U. S. 159 (1983), this Court wrote that the "Due528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 HUNT-WESSON, INC. v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the CourtProcess and Commerce Clauses . . . do not allow a Stateto tax income arising out of interstate activities--even on aproportional basis--unless there is a ` "minimal connection"or "nexus" between the interstate activities and the taxingState, and "a rational relationship between the income at-tributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise." ' " Id., at 165-166 (quoting Exxon Corp., 447 U. S.,at 219-220, in turn quoting Mobil Oil Corp., 445 U. S., at436, 437). Cf.International Harvester Co. v. Departmentof Treasury, 322 U. S. 340, 353 (1944) (Rutledge, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part) ("If there is a want ofdue process to sustain" a tax, "by that fact alone any burdenthe tax imposes on the commerce among the states becomes`undue' "). The parties concede that the relevant incomehere--that which falls within the scope of the statutoryphrase "not allocable by formula"--is income that, like theNew Zealand sheep farm in our example, by itself bears no"rational relationship" or "nexus" to California. Under ourprecedent, this "nonunitary" income may not constitutionallybe taxed by a State other than the corporation's domicile,unless there is some other connection between the taxingState and the income. Allied-Signal, 504 U. S., at 772-773.California's statute does not directly impose a tax on nonunitary income. Rather, it simply denies the taxpayer useof a portion of a deduction from unitary income (income likethat from tin can manufacture in our example), income whichdoes bear a "rational relationship" or "nexus" to California.But, as this Court once put the matter, a " `tax on sleepingmeasured by the number of pairs of shoes you have in yourcloset is a tax on shoes.' " Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept.of Treasury, 498 U. S. 358, 374 (1991) (quoting Jenkins, StateTaxation of Interstate Commerce, 27 Tenn. L. Rev. 239, 242(1960)). California's rule measures the amount of additionalunitary income that becomes subject to its taxation (throughreducing the deduction) by precisely the amount of nonunitary income that the taxpayer has received. And for that528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN465Cite as: 528 U. S. 458 (2000)Opinion of the Courtreason, that which California calls a deduction limitationwould seem, in fact, to amount to an impermissible tax.National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 508 (1928)(finding that a federal statute that reduced an insurance company's tax deduction for reserves by the amount of tax-exempt interest the company received from a holding of"tax-free" municipal bonds constituted unlawful taxation oftax-exempt income).However, this principle does not end the matter. California offers a justification for its rule that seeks to relate thededuction limit to collection of California's tax on unitaryincome. If California could show that its deduction limit actually reflected the portion of the expense properly relatedto nonunitary income, the limit would not, in fact, be a taxon nonunitary income. Rather, it would merely be a properallocation of the deduction. See Denman v. Slayton, 282U. S. 514 (1931) (upholding Federal Tax Code's denial of interest expense deduction where borrowing is incurred to"purchase or carry" tax-exempt obligations).California points out that money is fungible, and that consequently it is often difficult to say whether a particular borrowing is "really" for the purpose of generating unitary income or for the purpose of generating nonunitary income.California's rule prevents a firm from claiming that it paidinterest on borrowing for the first purpose (say, to build atin can plant) when the borrowing is "really" for the second(say, to buy shares in the New Zealand sheep farm). Without some such rule, firms might borrow up to the hilt tosupport their (more highly taxed) unitary business needs,and use the freed unitary business resources to purchase(less highly taxed) nonunitary business assets. This "taxarbitrage" problem, California argues, is why this Courtupheld the precursor of 26 U. S. C. $ 265(a)(2), which deniesthe taxpayer an interest deduction insofar as the interestexpense was "incurred or continued to purchase or carry"tax-exempt obligations or securities. Denman v. Slayton,528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 HUNT-WESSON, INC. v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 519. This Court has consistently upheld deductiondenials that represent reasonable efforts properly to allocatea deduction between taxable and tax-exempt income, eventhough such denials mean that the taxpayer owes more thanhe would without the denial. E. g., First Nat. Bank of Atlanta v. Bartow County Bd. of Tax Assessors, 470 U. S. 583(1985).The California statute, however, pushes this concept pastreasonable bounds. In effect, it assumes that a corporationthat borrows any money at all has really borrowed thatmoney to "purchase or carry," cf. 26 U. S. C. $ 265(a)(2), itsnonunitary investments (as long as the corporation has suchinvestments), even if the corporation has put no money at allinto nonunitary business that year. Presumably Californiabelieves that, in such a case, the unitary borrowing supportsthe nonunitary business to the extent that the corporationhas any nonunitary investment because the corporationmight have, for example, sold the sheep farm and used theproceeds to help its tin can operation instead of borrowing.At the very least, this last assumption is unrealistic. Andthat lack of practical realism helps explain why California'srule goes too far. A state tax code that unrealistically assumes that every tin can borrowing first helps the sheepfarm (or the contrary view that every sheep farm borrowingfirst helps the tin can business) simply because of the theoretical possibility of a hypothetical sale of either business isa code that fails to "actually reflect a reasonable sense of howincome is generated," Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 169, andin doing so assesses a tax upon constitutionally protectednonunitary income. That is so even if, as California claims,its rule attributes all interest expense both to unitary andto nonunitary income. And it is even more obviously so if,as Hunt-Wesson claims, California attributes all sheep-farmrelated borrowing to the sheep farm while attributing alltin-can-related borrowing first to the sheep farm as well.528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 528 U. S. 458 (2000)Opinion of the CourtNo other taxing jurisdiction, whether federal or state, hastaken so absolute an approach to the tax arbitrage problemthat California presents. Federal law in comparable circumstances (allocating interest expense between domestic andforeign source income) uses a ratio of assets and gross income to allocate a corporation's total interest expense. See26 CFR $$ 1.861-9T(f), (g) (1999). In a similar, but muchmore limited, set of circumstances, the federal rules use akind of modified tracing approach--requiring that a certainamount of interest expense be allocated to foreign income insituations where a United States business group's loans toforeign subsidiaries and the group's total borrowing haveincreased relative to recent years (subject to a number ofadjustments), and both loans and borrowing exceed certainamounts relative to total assets. See $ 1.861-10. SomeStates other than California follow a tracing approach. See,e. g., D. C. Mun. Regs., Tit. 9, $ 123.4 (1998); Ga. Rules andRegs. $ 560-7-7.03(3) (1999). Some use a set of ratio-basedformulas to allocate borrowing between the generationof unitary and nonunitary income. See, e. g., Ala. Code$ 40-18-35(a)(2) (1998); La. Reg. $ 1130(B)(1) (1988). Andsome use a combination of the two approaches. See, e. g.,N. M. Admin. Code, Tit. 3, $ 5.5.8 (1999); Utah Code Ann.$ 59-7-101 (19) (1999). No other jurisdiction uses a rule likeCalifornia's.Ratio-based rules like the one used by the Federal Government and those used by many States recognize that borrowing, even if supposedly undertaken for the unitary business,may also (as California argues) support the generation ofnonunitary income. However, unlike the California rule,ratio-based rules do not assume that all borrowing first supports nonunitary investment. Rather, they allocate eachborrowing between the two types of income. Although theymay not reflect every firm's specific actions in any givenyear, it is reasonable to expect that, over some period of528US2 Unit: $U27 [06-15-01 20:21:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN468 HUNT-WESSON, INC. v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Appendix to opinion of the Courttime, the ratios used will reflect approximately the amountof borrowing that firms have actually devoted to generatingeach type of income. Conversely, it is simply not reasonableto expect that a rule that attributes all borrowing first tononunitary investment will accurately reflect the amount ofborrowing that has actually been devoted to generating eachtype of income.Because California's offset provision is not a reasonableallocation of expense deductions to the income that the expense generates, it constitutes impermissible taxation of income outside its jurisdictional reach. The provision therefore violates the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of theConstitution.The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
