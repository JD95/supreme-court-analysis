A federal criminal statute forbids any "person" from "en-gag[ing] in a continuing criminal enterprise." 84 Stat. 1264,21 U. S. C. $ 848(a). It defines "continuing criminal enter-prise" (CCE) as involving a "violat[ion]" of the drug statuteswhere "such violation is a part of a continuing series of vio-lations." $ 848(c). We must decide whether a jury has toagree unanimously about which specific violations make upthe "continuing series of violations." We hold that the jurymust do so. That is to say, a jury in a federal criminal casebrought under $ 848 must unanimously agree not only thatthe defendant committed some "continuing series of vio-lations" but also that the defendant committed each of theindividual "violations" necessary to make up that "continu-ing series."IThe CCE statute imposes a mandatory minimum prisonterm of at least 20 years upon a person who engages in a"continuing criminal enterprise." $ 848(a). It says:"[A] person is engaged in a continuing criminal enter-prise if--"(1) he violates any provision of [the federal drug laws,i. e.,] this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapterthe punishment for which is a felony, and"(2) such violation is a part of a continuing series of vio-lations of [the federal drug laws, i. e.,] this subchapteror subchapter II of this chapter--"(A) which are undertaken by such person in concertwith five or more other persons with respect to whom*Wendy Sibbison, David M.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsuch person occupies a position of organizer [or supervisor or manager] and"(B) from which such person obtains substantial income or resources." $ 848(c).In 1994 the Federal Government charged the petitioner,Eddie Richardson, with violating this statute. The Government presented evidence designed to show that in 1970Richardson had organized a Chicago street gang called theUndertaker Vice Lords; that the gang had distributedheroin, crack cocaine, and powder cocaine over a period ofyears stretching from 1984 to 1991; and that Richardson,known as "King of all the Undertakers," had run the gang,managed the sales, and obtained substantial income fromthose unlawful activities. The jury convicted Richardson.The question before us arises out of the trial court's instruction about the statute's "series of violations" requirement. The judge rejected Richardson's proposal to instructthe jury that it must "unanimously agree on which three actsconstituted [the] series of violations." App. 21. Instead,the judge instructed the jurors that they "must unanimouslyagree that the defendant committed at least three federalnarcotics offenses," while adding, "[y]ou do not . . . haveto agree as to the particular three or more federal narcotics offenses committed by the defendant." Id., at 37.On appeal, the Seventh Circuit upheld the trial judge's instruction. 130 F. 3d 765, 779 (1997). Recognizing a split inthe Circuits on the matter, we granted certiorari. CompareUnited States v. Edmonds, 80 F. 3d 810, 822 (CA3 1996)(en banc) ( jury must unanimously agree on which "violations" constitute the series), with United States v. Hall, 93F. 3d 126, 129 (CA4 1996) (unanimity with respect to particular "violations" is not required), and United States v. Anderson, 39 F. 3d 331, 350-351 (CADC 1994) (same). We nowconclude that unanimity in respect to each individual violation is necessary.526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN817Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)Opinion of the CourtIIFederal crimes are made up of factual elements, whichare ordinarily listed in the statute that defines the crime.A (hypothetical) robbery statute, for example, that makes ita crime (1) to take (2) from a person (3) through force or thethreat of force (4) property (5) belonging to a bank wouldhave defined the crime of robbery in terms of the five elements just mentioned. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(a). Calling aparticular kind of fact an "element" carries certain legalconsequences. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523U. S. 224, 239 (1998). The consequence that matters for thiscase is that a jury in a federal criminal case cannot convictunless it unanimously finds that the Government has provedeach element. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356, 369-371(1972) (Powell, J., concurring); Andres v. United States, 333U. S. 740, 748 (1948); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 31(a).The question before us arises because a federal jury neednot always decide unanimously which of several possible setsof underlying brute facts make up a particular element, say,which of several possible means the defendant used to com-mit an element of the crime.Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S.624, 631-632 (1991) (plurality opinion); Andersen v. UnitedStates, 170 U. S. 481, 499-501 (1898). Where, for example,an element of robbery is force or the threat of force, somejurors might conclude that the defendant used a knife tocreate the threat; others might conclude he used a gun. Butthat disagreement--a disagreement about means--wouldnot matter as long as all 12 jurors unanimously concludedthat the Government had proved the necessary related ele-ment, namely, that the defendant had threatened force. SeeMcKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 449 (1990) (Black-mun, J., concurring).In this case, we must decide whether the statute's phrase"series of violations" refers to one element, namely a "series," in respect to which the "violations" constitute theunderlying brute facts or means, or whether those words526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN818 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcreate several elements, namely the several "violations," inrespect to each of which the jury must agree unanimouslyand separately. Our decision will make a difference where,as here, the Government introduces evidence that the defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes thanlegally necessary to make up a "series." (We assume, butdo not decide, that the necessary number is three, the num-ber used in this case.) If the statute creates a single element, a "series," in respect to which individual violationsare but the means, then the jury need only agree that thedefendant committed at least three of all the underlyingcrimes the Government has tried to prove. The jury neednot agree about which three. On the other hand, if thestatute makes each "violation" a separate element, thenthe jury must agree unanimously about which three crimesthe defendant committed.AWhen interpreting a statute, we look first to the language.United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 490 (1997). In thiscase, that language may seem to permit either interpretation, that of the Government or of the petitioner, for thestatute does not explicitly tell us whether the individual violation is an element or a means. But the language is nottotally neutral. The words "violates" and "violations" arewords that have a legal ring. A "violation" is not simply anact or conduct; it is an act or conduct that is contrary to law.Black's Law Dictionary 1570 (6th ed. 1990). That circum-stance is significant because the criminal law ordinarily entrusts a jury with determining whether alleged conduct "vio-lates" the law, seeinfra, at 822, and, as noted above, afederal criminal jury must act unanimously when doing so.Indeed, even though the words "violates" and "violations"appear more than 1,000 times in the United States Code, theGovernment has not pointed us to, nor have we found, anylegal source reading any instance of either word as the Government would have us read them in this case. To hold that526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN819Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)Opinion of the Courteach "violation" here amounts to a separate element is consistent with a tradition of requiring juror unanimity wherethe issue is whether a defendant has engaged in conduct thatviolates the law. To hold the contrary is not.The CCE statute's breadth also argues against treatingeach individual violation as a means, for that breadth aggravates the dangers of unfairness that doing so would risk.Cf. Schad v. Arizona, supra, at 645 (plurality opinion). Thestatute's word "violations" covers many different kinds ofbehavior of varying degrees of seriousness. The two chapters of the Federal Criminal Code setting forth drug crimescontain approximately 90 numbered sections, many of whichproscribe various acts that may be alleged as "violations" forpurposes of the series requirement in the statute. Compare,e. g., 21 U. S. C. $$ 842(a)(4) and (c) (1994 ed. and Supp. III)(providing civil penalties for removing drug labels) and 21U. S. C. $ 844(a) (Supp. III) (simple possession of a controlledsubstance) with 21 U. S. C. $ 858 (endangering human lifewhile manufacturing a controlled substance in violationof the drug laws) and $ 841(b)(1)(A) (possession with intentto distribute large quantities of drugs). At the same time,the Government in a CCE case may well seek to prove thata defendant, charged as a drug kingpin, has been involvedin numerous underlying violations. The first of these considerations increases the likelihood that treating violationssimply as alternative means, by permitting a jury to avoiddiscussion of the specific factual details of each violation,will cover up wide disagreement among the jurors aboutjust what the defendant did, or did not, do. The secondconsideration significantly aggravates the risk (present atleast to a small degree whenever multiple means are atissue) that jurors, unless required to focus upon specificfactual detail, will fail to do so, simply concluding from testimony, say, of bad reputation, that where there is smokethere must be fire.526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN820 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtFinally, this Court has indicated that the Constitutionitself limits a State's power to define crimes in ways thatwould permit juries to convict while disagreeing aboutmeans, at least where that definition risks serious unfairness and lacks support in history or tradition. Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S., at 632-633 (plurality opinion); id., at 651(Scalia, J., concurring) ("We would not permit . . . an indictment charging that the defendant assaulted either X onTuesday or Y on Wednesday . . ."). We have no reason tobelieve that Congress intended to come close to, or to test,those constitutional limits when it wrote this statute. SeeGarrett v. United States, 471 U. S. 773, 783-784 (1985) (citingH. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, pp. 83-84 (1970)) (in makingCCE a separate crime, rather than a sentencing provision,Congress sought increased procedural protections for defendants); cf. Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, 864(1989) ("It is our settled policy to avoid an interpretationof a federal statute that engenders constitutional issues if areasonable alternative interpretation poses no constitutionalquestion"); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936)(Brandeis, J., concurring).BThe Government's arguments for an interpretation of"violations" as means are not sufficiently powerful to overcome the considerations just mentioned, those of language,tradition, and potential unfairness. The Government, emphasizing the words "continuing series," says that the statute, in seeking to punish drug kingpins, focuses upon thedrug business, not upon the particular violations that constitute the business. Brief for United States 18-19. The argument, however, begs the question. Linguistically speaking, the statute punishes those kingpins who are involved ina "continuing series of violations" of the drug laws. AndCongress might well have intended a jury to focus upon individual violations in order to assure guilt of the serious526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN821Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)Opinion of the Courtcrime the statute creates. Emphasizing the first two wordsin the passage does not eliminate the last.Nor can the Government successfully appeal to a historyor tradition of treating individual criminal "violations" assimply means toward the commission of a greater crime.The Government virtually concedes the absence of any suchtradition when it says that the statute "departed significantly from common-law models and prior drug laws, creat-ing a new crime keyed to the concept of a `continuing criminal enterprise.' " Id., at 18. The closest analogies it citesconsist of state statutes making criminal such crimes assexual abuse of a minor. State courts interpreting suchstatutes have sometimes permitted jury disagreement abouta "specific" underlying criminal "incident" insisting onlyupon proof of a "continuous course of conduct" in violationof the law. E. g., People v. Gear, 19 Cal. App. 4th 86, 89-94,23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 261, 263-267 (1993) (continuous sexual abuseof a child); People v. Reynolds, 294 Ill. App. 3d 58, 69-71, 689N. E. 2d 335, 343-344 (1997) (criminal sexual assault of aminor and aggravated sexual abuse of a minor); State v.Spigarolo, 210 Conn. 359, 391-392, 556 A. 2d 112, 129 (1989)(committing an act likely to impair the health or morals of achild); Soper v. State, 731 P. 2d 587, 591 (Alaska App. 1987)(sexual assault in the first degree). With one exception,see Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 288.5(a) (West Supp. 1998), thestatutes do not define the statutory crime in terms thatrequire the commission of other predicate crimes by thedefendant. The state practice may well respond to specialdifficulties of proving individual underlying criminal acts,People v. Gear, supra, at 90-92, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 264-265,which difficulties are absent here. See infra, at 823-824.The cases are not federal but state, where this Court has notheld that the Constitution imposes a jury-unanimity requirement. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S., at 366 (Powell, J.,concurring). And their special subject matter indicates thatthey represent an exception; they do not represent a general526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN822 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttradition or a rule. People v. Gear, supra, at 89-92, 23 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 263-265.In fact, federal criminal law's treatment of recidivism of-fers a competing analogy no more distant than the analogy the Government offers. See Garrett v. United States,supra, at 782 (the statute originated in a "recidivist pro-vision . . . that provided for enhanced sentences"). If onelooks to recidivism, one finds that commission of a priorcrime will lead to an enhanced punishment only when a relevant factfinder, judge, or jury has found that the defendantcommitted that specific individual prior crime. Where sentencing is at issue, the judge, enhancing a sentence in lightof recidivism, must find a prior individual conviction, UnitedStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $$ 4A1.1,4B1.1 (Nov. 1998), which means that an earlier factfinder(e. g., a unanimous federal jury in the case of a federal crime)found that the defendant committed the specific earliercrime, $$ 4A1.2(a)(1), 4B1.2(c). Where a substantive statuteis at issue, for example, a statute forbidding a felon's possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g) (1994 ed. and Supp. III),the relevant precondition, namely that the gun possessor bea felon, means at a minimum that an earlier factfinder (e. g.,a unanimous federal jury in the case of a federal crime) foundthat the defendant in fact committed that earlier individual crime. The Government's interpretation is inconsistentwith this practice, for it, in effect, imposes punishment ona defendant for the underlying crimes without any factfinderhaving found that the defendant committed those crimes. Ifthere are federal statutes reflecting a different practice ortradition, the Government has not called them to our attention, which suggests that any such statute would representa lesser known exception to ordinary practice. Cf. Schadv. Arizona, 501 U. S., at 633 (plurality opinion) ("[I]t is anassumption of our system of criminal justice . . . that no person may be punished criminally save upon proof of some specific illegal conduct").526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN823Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)Opinion of the CourtNeither are we convinced by the Government's two re-maining significant arguments. First, the Government saysthat a jury-unanimity requirement will make the statute'scrime too difficult to prove--to the point where it is unreasonable to assume Congress intended such a requirement.But we do not understand why a unanimity requirementwould produce that level of difficulty. After all, the Government routinely obtains the testimony of underlings--street-level dealers who could point to specific incidents--aswell as the testimony of agents who make controlled buysor otherwise observe drug transactions. Such witnessesshould not have inordinate difficulty pointing to specifictransactions. Or, if they do have difficulty, would that difficulty in proving individual specific transactions not tend tocast doubt upon the existence of the requisite "series"?The dissent, but not the Government, argues that theprosecution will now have to prove that the defendant derived substantial income or resources from, and that five persons were involved with, the specific underlying crimes thejury unanimously agrees were committed. See post, at 830.To the extent the dissent suggests that those other statutoryrequirements must be satisfied with respect to each underlying crime, it is clearly wrong. Those requirements mustbe met with respect to the series, which, at a minimum, permits the jury to look at all of the agreed-upon violations incombination. Even if the jury were limited to the agreedupon violations, we still fail to see why prosecutions wouldprove unduly difficult. The dissent writes as if it followsfrom its reading that conviction under the CCE statute depends on specific proof of specific sales to specific street-levelusers. See post, at 832. That is not true. A specific transaction is not an element of possession with intent to distribute under 21 U. S. C. $ 841. It would be enough to presenttestimony, like that of Michael Sargent partially recountedby the dissent, showing that the defendant supplied a runnerin his organization with large quantities of drugs on or about526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN824 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtparticular dates as alleged in an indictment. And one needonly examine Sargent's testimony to dispel any fears aboutfading memories. He testified that he received from Rich-ardson large quantities of heroin three times a week; he wasable to specify the location where Richardson gave him thedrugs; he was able to recall precisely how the heroin waspackaged when Richardson gave it to him. Tr. 1399-1401.Though he was not pressed to be specific, he even testifiedthat he started receiving drugs from Richardson sometimein the beginning of 1989. Id., at 1382. Given the record inthis case, we find it hard to believe the Government will haveas hard a time producing evidence sufficient to support aCCE conviction as the dissent suggests.Second, the Government points to a different portion ofthe statute, which requires a defendant to have supervised"five or more other persons." 21 U. S. C. $ 848(c)(2)(A).The Government says that no one claims that the jury mustunanimously agree about the identity of those five otherpersons. It adds that the jury may also disagree about thebrute facts that make up other statutory elements such asthe "substantial income" that the defendant must derivefrom the enterprise, $ 848(c)(2)(B), or the defendant's rolein the criminal organization, $ 848(c)(2)(A). Assuming, without deciding, that there is no unanimity requirement in respect to these other provisions, we nonetheless find themsignificantly different from the provision before us. Theydiffer in respect to language, breadth, tradition, and theother factors we have discussed.These considerations, taken together, lead us to concludethat the statute requires jury unanimity in respect to eachindividual "violation." We leave to the Court of Appealsthe question whether to engage in harmless-error analysis,and if so, whether the error was harmless in this case.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
