In this case we primarily consider whether the Fifth andSixth Amendments require federal prosecutors, before entering into a binding plea agreement with a criminal defendant, to disclose "impeachment information relating toany informants or other witnesses." App. to Pet. for Cert.46a. We hold that the Constitution does not require thatdisclosure.IAfter immigration agents found 30 kilograms of marijuanain Angela Ruiz's luggage, federal prosecutors offered herwhat is known in the Southern District of California as a"fast track" plea bargain. That bargain--standard in thatdistrict--asks a defendant to waive indictment, trial, and anappeal. In return, the Government agrees to recommend tothe sentencing judge a two-level departure downward fromthe otherwise applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines sentence. In Ruiz's case, a two-level departure downward would have shortened the ordinary Guidelines-specified18-to-24-month sentencing range by 6 months, to 12-to-18months. 241 F. 3d 1157, 1161 (2001).The prosecutors' proposed plea agreement contains a set ofdetailed terms. Among other things, it specifies that "any[known] information establishing the factual innocence of thedefendant" "has been turned over to the defendant," and itacknowledges the Government's "continuing duty to providesuch information." App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a-46a. At thesame time it requires that the defendant "waiv[e] the right"to receive "impeachment information relating to any informants or other witnesses" as well as the right to receive information supporting any affirmative defense the defendantraises if the case goes to trial. Id., at 46a. Because Ruizwould not agree to this last-mentioned waiver, the prosecutors withdrew their bargaining offer. The Government thenindicted Ruiz for unlawful drug possession. And despite536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 UNITED STATES v. RUIZOpinion of the Courtthe absence of any agreement, Ruiz ultimately pleadedguilty.At sentencing, Ruiz asked the judge to grant her the sametwo-level downward departure that the Government wouldhave recommended had she accepted the "fast track" agree-ment. The Government opposed her request, and the District Court denied it, imposing a standard Guideline sentenceinstead. 241 F. 3d, at 1161.Relying on 18 U. S. C. $ 3742, see infra, at 627, 628-629,Ruiz appealed her sentence to the United States Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit vacatedthe District Court's sentencing determination. The NinthCircuit pointed out that the Constitution requires prosecu-tors to make certain impeachment information available to adefendant before trial. 241 F. 3d, at 1166. It decided thatthis obligation entitles defendants to receive that same information before they enter into a plea agreement. Id., at1164. The Ninth Circuit also decided that the Constitutionprohibits defendants from waiving their right to that infor-mation. Id., at 1165-1166. And it held that the prosecutors' standard "fast track" plea agreement was unlawful be-cause it insisted upon that waiver. Id., at 1167. The NinthCircuit remanded the case so that the District Court coulddecide any related factual disputes and determine an appropriate remedy. Id., at 1169.The Government sought certiorari. It stressed what itconsidered serious adverse practical implications of theNinth Circuit's constitutional holding. And it added thatthe holding is unique among courts of appeals. Pet. forCert. 8. We granted the Government's petition. 534 U. S.1074 (2002). IIAt the outset, we note that a question of statutory juris-diction potentially blocks our consideration of the NinthCircuit's constitutional holding. The relevant statute saysthat a536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)Opinion of the Court"defendant may file a notice of appeal . . . for review . . .if the sentence"(1) was imposed in violation of law;"(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or"(3) is greater than [the Guideline] specified [sentence] . . . ; or"(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is nosentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable." 18U. S. C. $ 3742(a).Every Circuit has held that this statute does not authorize adefendant to appeal a sentence where the ground for appealconsists of a claim that the district court abused its discretionin refusing to depart. See,e. g., United States v. Conway,81 F. 3d 15, 16 (CA1 1996); United States v. Lawal, 17 F. 3d560, 562 (CA2 1994); United States v. Powell, 269 F. 3d 175,179 (CA3 2001); United States v. Ivester, 75 F. 3d 182, 183(CA4 1996); United States v. Cooper, 274 F. 3d 230, 248 (CA52001); United States v. Scott, 74 F. 3d 107, 112 (CA6 1996);United States v. Byrd, 263 F. 3d 705, 707 (CA7 2001); UnitedStates v. Mora-Higuera, 269 F. 3d 905, 913 (CA8 2001);United States v. Garcia-Garcia, 927 F. 2d 489, 490 (CA91991); United States v. Coddington, 118 F. 3d 1439, 1441(CA10 1997); United States v. Calderon, 127 F. 3d 1314, 1342(CA11 1997);In re Sealed Case No. 98-3116, 199 F. 3d 488,491-492 (CADC 1999).The statute does, however, authorize an appeal from a sen-tence that "was imposed in violation of law." Two quite different theories might support appellate jurisdiction pursuantto that provision. First, as the Court of Appeals recognized,if the District Court's sentencing decision rested on a mis-taken belief that it lacked the legal power to grant a departure, the quoted provision would apply. 241 F. 3d, at 1162,n. 2. Our reading of the record, however, convinces us thatthe District Judge correctly understood that he had such dis-cretion but decided not to exercise it. We therefore reject536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN628 UNITED STATES v. RUIZOpinion of the Courtthat basis for finding appellate jurisdiction. Second, if re-spondent's constitutional claim, discussed in Part III, infra,were sound, her sentence would have been "imposed in viola-tion of law." Thus, if she had prevailed on the merits, hervictory would also have confirmed the jurisdiction of theCourt of Appeals.Although we ultimately conclude that respondent's sen-tence was not "imposed in violation of law" and thereforethat $ 3742(a)(1) does not authorize an appeal in a case ofthis kind, it is familiar law that a federal court always hasjurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. See UnitedStates v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 291 (1947). In orderto make that determination, it was necessary for the NinthCircuit to address the merits. We therefore hold that appel-late jurisdiction was proper.IIIThe constitutional question concerns a federal criminal de-fendant's waiver of the right to receive from prosecutors exculpatory impeachment material--a right that the Constitu-tion provides as part of its basic "fair trial" guarantee. SeeU. S. Const., Amdts. 5, 6. See also Brady v. Maryland, 373U. S. 83, 87 (1963) (Due process requires prosecutors to"avoi[d] . . . an unfair trial" by making available "upon re-quest" evidence "favorable to an accused . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment"); UnitedStates v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112-113 (1976) (defense requestunnecessary); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (exculpatory evidence is evidence the suppression of whichwould "undermine confidence in the verdict"); Giglio v.United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154 (1972) (exculpatory evidenceincludes "evidence affecting" witness "credibility," wherethe witness' "reliability" is likely "determinative of guilt orinnocence").When a defendant pleads guilty he or she, of course, for-goes not only a fair trial, but also other accompanying consti536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN629Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)Opinion of the Courttutional guarantees. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243(1969) (pleading guilty implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Sixth Amendment rightto confront one's accusers, and the Sixth Amendment rightto trial by jury). Given the seriousness of the matter, theConstitution insists, among other things, that the defendantenter a guilty plea that is "voluntary" and that the defendantmust make related waivers "knowing[ly], intelligent[ly],[and] with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstancesand likely consequences." Brady v. United States, 397 U. S.742, 748 (1970); see alsoBoykin, supra, at 242.In this case, the Ninth Circuit in effect held that a guiltyplea is not "voluntary" (and that the defendant could not, bypleading guilty, waive her right to a fair trial) unless theprosecutors first made the same disclosure of material impeachment information that the prosecutors would have hadto make had the defendant insisted upon a trial. We mustdecide whether the Constitution requires that preguilty pleadisclosure of impeachment information. We conclude thatit does not.First, impeachment information is special in relation to thefairness of a trial, not in respect to whether a plea is voluntary ("knowing," "intelligent," and "sufficient[ly] aware").Of course, the more information the defendant has, the moreaware he is of the likely consequences of a plea, waiver, ordecision, and the wiser that decision will likely be. But theConstitution does not require the prosecutor to share all useful information with the defendant. Weatherford v. Bursey,429 U. S. 545, 559 (1977) ("There is no general constitutionalright to discovery in a criminal case"). And the law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the natureof the right and how it would likely apply in general in thecircumstances--even though the defendant may not knowthe specific detailed consequences of invoking it. A defendant, for example, may waive his right to remain silent, his536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 UNITED STATES v. RUIZOpinion of the Courtright to a jury trial, or his right to counsel even if the defend-ant does not know the specific questions the authorities intend to ask, who will likely serve on the jury, or the particu-lar lawyer the State might otherwise provide. Cf.Coloradov. Spring, 479 U. S. 564, 573-575 (1987) (Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination waived when defendantreceived standard Miranda warnings regarding the natureof the right but not told the specific interrogation questionsto be asked).It is particularly difficult to characterize impeachment in-formation as critical information of which the defendantmust always be aware prior to pleading guilty given the random way in which such information may, or may not, help aparticular defendant. The degree of help that impeachmentinformation can provide will depend upon the defendant'sown independent knowledge of the prosecution's potentialcase--a matter that the Constitution does not require prosecutors to disclose.Second, we have found no legal authority embodied eitherin this Court's past cases or in cases from other circuits thatprovides significant support for the Ninth Circuit's decision.To the contrary, this Court has found that the Constitution,in respect to a defendant's awareness of relevant circumstances, does not require complete knowledge of the relevantcircumstances, but permits a court to accept a guilty plea,with its accompanying waiver of various constitutionalrights, despite various forms of misapprehension underwhich a defendant might labor. See Brady v. United States,397 U. S., at 757 (defendant "misapprehended the quality ofthe State's case"); ibid. (defendant misapprehended "thelikely penalties"); ibid. (defendant failed to "anticipate" achange in the law regarding relevant "punishments"); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 770 (1970) (counsel "misjudged the admissibility" of a "confession"); United States v.Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 573 (1989) (counsel failed to point out apotential defense); Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 267536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)Opinion of the Court(1973) (counsel failed to find a potential constitutional infir-mity in grand jury proceedings). It is difficult to distinguish, in terms of importance, (1) a defendant's ignorance ofgrounds for impeachment of potential witnesses at a possiblefuture trial from (2) the varying forms of ignorance at issuein these cases.Third, due process considerations, the very considerationsthat led this Court to find trial-related rights to exculpatoryand impeachment information inBrady and Giglio, argueagainst the existence of the "right" that the Ninth Circuitfound here. This Court has said that due process considerations include not only (1) the nature of the private interestat stake, but also (2) the value of the additional safeguard,and (3) the adverse impact of the requirement upon theGovernment's interests. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 77(1985). Here, as we have just pointed out, the added valueof the Ninth Circuit's "right" to a defendant is often limited,for it depends upon the defendant's independent awarenessof the details of the Government's case. And in any case,as the proposed plea agreement at issue here specifies, theGovernment will provide "any information establishing thefactual innocence of the defendant" regardless. That fact,along with other guilty-plea safeguards, see Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 11, diminishes the force of Ruiz's concern that, in theabsence of impeachment information, innocent individuals,accused of crimes, will plead guilty. Cf. McCarthy v. UnitedStates, 394 U. S. 459, 465-467 (1969) (discussing Rule 11's rolein protecting a defendant's constitutional rights).At the same time, a constitutional obligation to provideimpeachment information during plea bargaining, prior toentry of a guilty plea, could seriously interfere with the Government's interest in securing those guilty pleas that are factually justified, desired by defendants, and help to secure theefficient administration of justice. The Ninth Circuit's rulerisks premature disclosure of Government witness information, which, the Government tells us, could "disrupt ongoing536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 UNITED STATES v. RUIZOpinion of the Courtinvestigations" and expose prospective witnesses to seriousharm. Brief for United States 25. Cf. Amendments toFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure: Hearings before theSubcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committeeon the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 92 (1975) (statementof John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Div., Dept. of Justice) (opposing mandated witness disclosure three days before trial because of documented instances of witness intimidation). And the careful tailoringthat characterizes most legal Government witness disclosurerequirements suggests recognition by both Congress and theFederal Rules Committees that such concerns are valid.See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 3432 (witness list disclosure required incapital cases three days before trial with exceptions); $ 3500(Government witness statements ordinarily subject to discovery only after testimony given); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.16(a)(2) (embodies limitations of 18 U. S. C. $ 3500). Compare 156 F. R. D. 460, 461-462 (1994) (congressional proposalto significantly broaden $ 3500) with 167 F. R. D. 221, 223,n. ( judicial conference opposing congressional proposal).Consequently, the Ninth Circuit's requirement could forcethe Government to abandon its "general practice" of not "disclos[ing] to a defendant pleading guilty information thatwould reveal the identities of cooperating informants, undercover investigators, or other prospective witnesses." Brieffor United States 25. It could require the Government todevote substantially more resources to trial preparationprior to plea bargaining, thereby depriving the pleabargaining process of its main resource-saving advantages.Or it could lead the Government instead to abandon its heavyreliance upon plea bargaining in a vast number--90% ormore--of federal criminal cases. We cannot say that theConstitution's due process requirement demands so radical achange in the criminal justice process in order to achieve socomparatively small a constitutional benefit.536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)Thomas, J., concurring in judgmentThese considerations, taken together, lead us to concludethat the Constitution does not require the Government todisclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering aplea agreement with a criminal defendant.In addition, we note that the "fast track" plea agreementrequires a defendant to waive her right to receive information the Government has regarding any "affirmative defense"she raises at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. We do notbelieve the Constitution here requires provision of this information to the defendant prior to plea bargaining--for most(though not all) of the reasons previously stated. That isto say, in the context of this agreement, the need for thisinformation is more closely related to the fairness of a trialthan to the voluntariness of the plea; the value in terms ofthe defendant's added awareness of relevant circumstancesis ordinarily limited; yet the added burden imposed upon theGovernment by requiring its provision well in advance oftrial (often before trial preparation begins) can be serious,thereby significantly interfering with the administration ofthe plea-bargaining process.For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit is
