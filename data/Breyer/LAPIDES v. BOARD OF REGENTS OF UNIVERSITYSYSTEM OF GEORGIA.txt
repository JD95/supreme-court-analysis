The Eleventh Amendment grants a State immunity fromsuit in federal court by citizens of other States, U. S. Const.,Amdt. 11, and by its own citizens as well, Hans v. Louisiana,134 U. S. 1 (1890). The question before us is whether theState's act of removing a lawsuit from state court to federalcourt waives this immunity. We hold that it does.IPaul Lapides, a professor employed by the Georgia stateuniversity system, brought this lawsuit in a Georgia statecourt. He sued respondents, the Board of Regents of theUniversity System of Georgia (hereinafter Georgia or State)and university officials acting in both their personal capac-ities and as agents of the State. Lapides' lawsuit allegedthat university officials placed allegations of sexual harass-ment in his personnel files. And Lapides claimed that theirdoing so violated both Georgia law, see Georgia Tort ClaimsAct, Ga. Code Ann. $ 50-21-23 (1994), and federal law, seeCivil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983(1994 ed., Supp. V).All defendants joined in removing the case to Federal Dis-trict Court, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441, where they sought dismissal.Those individuals whom Lapides had sued in their personalcapacities argued that the doctrine of "qualified immunity"barred Lapides' federal-law claims against them. And theDistrict Court agreed. The State, while conceding that astate statute had waived sovereign immunity from state-lawsuits in state court, argued that, by virtue of the EleventhAmendment, it remained immune from suit in federal court.*John Townsend Rich filed a brief for Ceres Marine Terminals, Inc., asamicus curiae urging reversal.535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN617Cite as: 535 U. S. 613 (2002)Opinion of the CourtSee U. S. Const., Amdt. 11 (limiting scope of "Judicial powerof theUnited States" (emphasis added)). But the DistrictCourt did not agree. Rather, in its view, by removing thecase from state to federal court, the State had waivedits Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Atascadero StateHospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238 (1985) (State maywaive Eleventh Amendment immunity).The State appealed the District Court's Eleventh Amend-ment ruling. SeePuerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 144-145 (1993)(allowing interlocutory appeal). And the Court of Appealsfor the Eleventh Circuit reversed. 251 F. 3d 1372 (2001).In its view, state law was, at the least, unclear as to whetherthe State's attorney general possessed the legal authorityto waive the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. And,that being so, the State retained the legal right to assertits immunity, even after removal. See Ford Motor Co. v.Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945).Lapides sought certiorari. We agreed to decide whether"a state waive[s] its Eleventh Amendment immunity by itsaffirmative litigation conduct when it removes a case to federal court . . . ." Pet. for Cert. (i).It has become clear that we must limit our answer to thecontext of state-law claims, in respect to which the State hasexplicitly waived immunity from state-court proceedings.That is because Lapides' only federal claim against the Statearises under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, that claim seeks only monetary damages, and we have held that a State is not a "person" against whom a $ 1983 claim for money damages mightbe asserted. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491U. S. 58, 66 (1989). Compare Tr. of Oral Arg. 57-58 (asserting that complaint also sought declaratory judgment onthe federal claim), with complaint, App. 9-19 (failing, implicitly or explicitly, to seek any such relief). Hence thiscase does not present a valid federal claim against the State.Nor need we address the scope of waiver by removal in a535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN618 LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV. SYSTEMOF GA.Opinion of the Courtsituation where the State's underlying sovereign immunityfrom suit has not been waived or abrogated in state court.It has also become clear that, in the absence of any viablefederal claim, the Federal District Court might well remandLapides' state-law tort claims against the State to statecourt. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3). Nonetheless, Lapides' statelaw tort claims against the State remain pending inFederal District Court, $ 1367(a), and the law commits theremand question, ordinarily a matter of discretion, to theFederal District Court for decision in the first instance.Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 712 (1973).Hence, the question presented is not moot. We possess thelegal power here to answer that question as limited to thestate-law context just described. And, in light of differences of view among the lower courts, we shall do so. Com-pareMcLaughlin v. Board of Trustees of State Collegesof Colo., 215 F. 3d 1168, 1171 (CA10 2000) (removal waivesimmunity regardless of attorney general's state-law waiverauthority); andNewfield House, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dept.of Public Welfare, 651 F. 2d 32, 36, n. 3 (CA1 1981) (similar);with Estate of Porter ex rel. Nelson v. Illinois, 36 F. 3d684, 690-691 (CA7 1994) (removal does not waive immunity);Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F. 2d 1211, 1214 (CA11 1986) (simi-lar); and Gwinn Area Community Schools v. Michigan, 741F. 2d 840, 846-847 (CA6 1984) (similar).IIThe Eleventh Amendment provides that the "Judicialpower of the United States shall not be construed to extendto any suit . . . commenced or prosecuted against one ofthe . . . States" by citizens of another State, U. S. Const.,Amdt. 11, and (as interpreted) by its own citizens. Hans v.Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890). A State remains free towaive its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in a federal court. See, e. g., Atascadero, supra, at 238. And thequestion before us now is whether a State waives that im535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN619Cite as: 535 U. S. 613 (2002)Opinion of the Courtmunity when it removes a case from state court to federalcourt.It would seem anomalous or inconsistent for a State both(1) to invoke federal jurisdiction, thereby contending thatthe "Judicial power of the United States" extends to thecase at hand, and (2) to claim Eleventh Amendment immunity, thereby denying that the "Judicial power of theUnited States" extends to the case at hand. And a Constitu-tion that permitted States to follow their litigation interestsby freely asserting both claims in the same case could gener-ate seriously unfair results. Thus, it is not surprising thatmore than a century ago this Court indicated that a State'svoluntary appearance in federal court amounted to a waiverof its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Clark v. Barnard,108 U. S. 436, 447 (1883) (State's "voluntary appearance" infederal court as an intervenor avoids Eleventh Amendmentinquiry). The Court subsequently held, in the context of abankruptcy claim, that a State "waives any immunity . . .respecting the adjudication of " a "claim" that it voluntarilyfiles in federal court. Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565,574 (1947). And the Court has made clear in general that"where a State voluntarily becomes a party to a cause andsubmits its rights for judicial determination, it will be boundthereby and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary actby invoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment."Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284(1906) (emphasis added). The Court has long accepted thisstatement of the law as valid, often citing with approval thecases embodying that principle. See, e. g., College SavingsBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,527 U. S. 666, 681, n. 3 (1999) (citing Gardner); Employeesof Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Departmentof Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 294, andn. 10 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (citing Clark);Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,276 (1959) (citing Clark).535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN620 LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV. SYSTEMOF GA.Opinion of the CourtIn this case, the State was brought involuntarily into thecase as a defendant in the original state-court proceedings.But the State then voluntarily agreed to remove the case tofederal court. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(a);Chicago, R. I. & P.R. Co. v. Martin, 178 U. S. 245, 248 (1900) (removal requiresthe consent of all defendants). In doing so, it voluntarilyinvoked the federal court's jurisdiction. And unless we areto abandon the general principle just stated, or unless thereis something special about removal or about this case, thegeneral legal principle requiring waiver ought to apply.We see no reason to abandon the general principle. Georgia points out that the cases that stand for the principle, Gunter, Gardner, and Clark, did not involve suits formoney damages against the State--the heart of the EleventhAmendment's concern. But the principle enunciated inthose cases did not turn upon the nature of the relief sought.And that principle remains sound as applied to suits formoney damages.Georgia adds that this Court decided Gunter, Gardner,and Clark before it decided more recent cases, which haverequired a "clear" indication of the State's intent to waiveits immunity. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 675-681.But College Savings Bank distinguished the kind of constructive waivers repudiated there from waivers effected bylitigation conduct. Id., at 681, n. 3. And this makes sensebecause an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment thatfinds waiver in the litigation context rests upon the Amendment's presumed recognition of the judicial need to avoidinconsistency, anomaly, and unfairness, and not upon aState's actual preference or desire, which might, after all,favor selective use of "immunity" to achieve litigation advantages. See Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schacht,524 U. S. 381, 393 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). The relevant "clarity" here must focus on the litigation act the Statetakes that creates the waiver. And that act--removal--isclear.535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 535 U. S. 613 (2002)Opinion of the CourtNor has Georgia pointed to any special feature, either ofremoval or of this case, that would justify taking the caseout from under the general rule. Georgia argues that itsmotive for removal was benign. It agreed to remove, notin order to obtain litigating advantages for itself, but to pro-vide its codefendants, the officials sued in their personalcapacities, with the generous interlocutory appeal provisionsavailable in federal, but not in state, court. Compare Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985) (authorizinginterlocutory appeal of adverse qualified immunity determi-nation), withTurner v. Giles, 264 Ga. 812, 813, 450 S. E. 2d421, 424 (1994) (limiting interlocutory appeals to those certified by trial court). And it intended, from the beginning, toreturn to state court, when and if its codefendants hadachieved their own legal victory.A benign motive, however, cannot make the critical difference for which Georgia hopes. Motives are difficult toevaluate, while jurisdictional rules should be clear. SeeHanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 426 (1916)(Holmes, J., concurring). To adopt the State's EleventhAmendment position would permit States to achieve unfairtactical advantages, if not in this case, in others. SeeSchacht, supra, at 393-394, 398 (Kennedy, J., concurring);cf. ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between Stateand Federal Courts 366-367 (1968) (discussing the unfairnessof allowing one who has invoked federal jurisdiction subsequently to challenge that jurisdiction). And that being so,the rationale for applying the general "voluntary invocation"principle is as strong here, in the context of removal, aselsewhere.More importantly, Georgia argues that state law, while authorizing its attorney general "[t]o represent the state in allcivil actions tried in any court," Ga. Code Ann. $ 45-15-3(6)(1990); see Ga. Const., Art. 5, $ 3, || 4, does not authorize theattorney general to waive the State's Eleventh Amendmentimmunity, id., Art. 1, $ 2, |||| 9(e), (f), reprinted in 2 Ga. Code535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN622 LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV. SYSTEMOF GA.Opinion of the CourtAnn. (Supp. 1996). Georgia adds that in Ford, this Courtunanimously interpreted roughly similar state laws similarly,that the Court held that "no properly authorized executiveor administrative officer of the state has waived the state'simmunity," 328 U. S., at 469, and that it sustained an Elev-enth Amendment defense raised for the first time after aState had litigated a claim brought against it in federal court.That is to say, in Ford a State regained immunity by showingthe attorney general's lack of statutory authority to waive--even after the State litigated a case brought against it infederal court. Why, then, asks Georgia, can it not regainimmunity in the same way, even after it removed its case tofederal court?The short answer to this question is that this case involvesa State that voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court, while Ford involved a State that a private plaintiff had involuntarily made a defendant in federal court.This Court consistently has found a waiver when a State'sattorney general, authorized (as here) to bring a case infederal court, has voluntarily invoked that court's jurisdiction. See Gardner, 329 U. S., at 574-575; Gunter, 200 U. S.,at 285-289, 292; cf. Clark, 108 U. S., at 447-448 (not inquiring into attorney general's authority). And the Eleventh Amendment waiver rules are different when a State'sfederal-court participation is involuntary. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 11 (discussing suits "commenced or prosecuted against" a State).But there is a more important answer. In large part therule governing voluntary invocations of federal jurisdictionhas rested upon the problems of inconsistency and unfairnessthat a contrary rule of law would create. Gunter, supra, at284. And that determination reflects a belief that neitherthose who wrote the Eleventh Amendment nor the Statesthemselves (insofar as they authorize litigation in federalcourts) would intend to create that unfairness. As in analogous contexts, in which such matters are questions of federal535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN623Cite as: 535 U. S. 613 (2002)Opinion of the Courtlaw, cf., e. g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425,429, n. 5 (1997), whether a particular set of state laws, rules,or activities amounts to a waiver of the State's EleventhAmendment immunity is a question of federal law. A ruleof federal law that finds waiver through a state attorneygeneral's invocation of federal-court jurisdiction avoids inconsistency and unfairness. A rule of federal law that, asin Ford, denies waiver despite the state attorney general'sstate-authorized litigating decision, does the opposite. Forthese reasons one Member of this Court has called for Ford'sreexamination.Schacht, 524 U. S., at 394, 397 (Kennedy,J., concurring). And for these same reasons, we concludethat Clark, Gunter, and Gardner represent the sounder lineof authority. Finding Ford inconsistent with the basic rationale of that line of cases, we consequently overrule Fordinsofar as it would otherwise apply.The State makes several other arguments, none of whichwe find convincing. It points to cases in which this Courthas permitted the United States to enter into a case voluntarily without giving up immunity or to assert immunitydespite a previous effort to waive. See United States v.United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506 (1940);United States v. Shaw, 309 U. S. 495 (1940); see also Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribeof Okla., 498 U. S. 505 (1991). Those cases, however, do notinvolve the Eleventh Amendment--a specific text with ahistory that focuses upon the State's sovereignty vis-a` -visthe Federal Government. And each case involves specialcircumstances not at issue here, for example, an effort by asovereign (i. e., the United States) to seek the protection ofits own courts (i. e., the federal courts), or an effort to protectan Indian tribe.Finally, Georgia says that our conclusion will prove confusing, for States will have to guess what conduct mightbe deemed a waiver in order to avoid accidental waivers.But we believe the rule is a clear one, easily applied by both535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN624 LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV. SYSTEMOF GA.Opinion of the Courtfederal courts and the States themselves. It says that re-moval is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court'sjurisdiction sufficient to waive the State's otherwise validobjection to litigation of a matter (here of state law) in afederal forum. As Justice Kennedy has pointed out, once"the States know or have reason to expect that removal willconstitute a waiver, then it is easy enough to presume thatan attorney authorized to represent the State can bind it tothe jurisdiction of the federal court (for Eleventh Amend-ment purposes) by the consent to removal." SeeSchacht,supra, at 397 (concurring opinion).We conclude that the State's action joining the removingof this case to federal court waived its Eleventh Amendmentimmunity--though, as we have said, the District Court maywell find that this case, now raising only state-law issues,should nonetheless be remanded to the state courts for de-termination. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3).For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis reversed.
